<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's interior world is richly textured through her preservation work and relationship to her mother's memory, but her choices remain largely observational until the final decision not to repair the chime. The choice to document rather than restore demonstrates internal values, though the stakes of this decision feel muted—no competing pressure tests her commitment. Embodied emotion appears in "foxglove regret bloomed in her chest," but much of the piece operates in contemplative mode without visceral contradiction or crisis-level stakes that force harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cracked chime's discovery seeds the final preservation choice, and the ending reweights Miren's role from passive caretaker to active documenter of "how breaking created new beauty." Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). Closure operates as Charged Poise—Miren's act of naming and documenting "Thessaly" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (choosing transformation over repair, claiming personal meaning in an institutional archive). The cost is legible in the final whispered name and the candle metaphor, though the decisive moment lacks sharp on-page consequences that alter her situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and clouds create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Miren's work (dawn watering, prismatic light timing) and charges the final image (opal walls as prism of memories). The cracked bamboo chime functions as a tactile object that Miren handles across multiple beats, its physical properties (cool, light, fractured tone) shaping her choice. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Miren's professional attention. The setting's specificity (above the clouds, climate-controlled vaults below) grounds the conceptual museum without excessive exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to repair or preserve the chime's broken voice—emerges clearly in the middle and drives the ending choice. The tightening is modest: Miren pauses, listens, hesitates, then decides. No external pressure tests her decision; the conflict is entirely internal contemplation of preservation versus transformation. Under the Accumulative lens this works, but the lack of a competing force or visible price (institutional consequences, personal sacrifice beyond sentiment) keeps the escalation in the mid-band. The foxglove regret moment deepens emotional texture but doesn't narrow options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the museum premise and the chime's transformation: extinct feelings, the cruelty of nameless loss, breaking as creation. The final act—whispering "Thessaly" and lighting "a small candle of sound in the vast darkness of forgetting"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The foxglove regret and glass-orchid imagery recur purposefully. Minor slip: "deserted marvels" and "extinct feelings" are stated directly in exposition rather than discovered through scene pressure, and the museum concept borders on allegory with transparent stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Miren; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, contemplative texture with purposeful elevated diction ("foxglove regret," "prismatic shadows," "frozen music") that suits the setting and Miren's archival sensibility. Perceptual signature is consistent: Miren notices light refraction, botanical detail, acoustic nuance. The prose occasionally drifts toward museum-catalog register ("climate-controlled vaults," "efficiency protocols") that feels expository rather than character-lived. Psychic distance is controlled, though the reflection-heavy mode mutes immediate scene texture in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("clouds drifted past like slow thoughts," "frozen music"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase: the museum's purpose is explained twice (extinction theme in paragraphs 3 and 5), and Miren's "true work" is stated then restated with synonym variations. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: three sentences open with "The" constructions in close succession. Stock metaphor: "lighting a small candle of sound in the vast darkness" borders on cliché. Elevated diction in peak beats ("crystalline suspension," "split-tone aria") slightly obscures immediacy. No causality break, but momentum drags in the middle reflection block.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The museum of extinct feelings premise is conceptually rich but risks allegory; the execution grounds it through Miren's specific work (glass orchids, watering precision, the chime). The choice to preserve brokenness rather than repair offers a fresh inflection on preservation narratives. The mother's memory (Thessaly, rooftop gardens, humming) adds personal texture. However, the opal-library-above-clouds setting and the catalogued emotions (Nostalgia, Serendipity, Melancholy, Wonder) read as high-concept scaffolding; the transformation test is uncertain—swap names and the arc largely persists. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, earning credit for conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Miren is present throughout; her choice not to repair the chime and to document it under her mother's name drives the ending. She is introduced early, involved in multiple beats (watering, listening, lifting the chime, documenting), and her decision shapes closure. However, much of her presence is observational or reflective rather than pressure-driven action. The caretaker role constrains her movements (dawn watering ritual, precise technique) and her preservation ethos informs the final choice, creating meaningful linkage. The element is essential but operates more through contemplation than through high-cost decisive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo chime appears early (paragraph 2), is handled physically (Miren lifts it, paragraph 5; hangs it, paragraph 8), and its fractured tone triggers the memory that seeds the ending choice. It returns in the final image as the honored broken voice teaching the glass orchids to sing. The chime's transformation from flaw to beauty is the story's conceptual hinge. The element drives two distinct beats (discovery/listening, decision/documentation) and charges closure. It is nearly indispensable; removing it would collapse the causal and thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" is named in the title and appears explicitly in paragraphs 3 and 9 ("caretaker of deserted marvels"). The concept shapes the museum's purpose and Miren's role, anchoring the stakes (preservation of what humanity abandoned). However, it functions more as thematic framing than as a tactic-altering force; the chime's broken voice and Miren's personal memory do the causal work. The phrase charges the final image by naming Miren's true role, but it is stated rather than dramatized as a pressure. Present across the arc, it contributes to closure resonance but is not irreplaceable—"forgotten wonders" or similar could substitute with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears in the opening paragraph, describing Miren's watering precision (forty-five-degree tilt, three drops per stem). It characterizes her method and signals care, but does not constrain a later choice with visible cost. The trait is consistent with her final decision (systematic documentation), but it is not tested under pressure—no moment where her systematic nature conflicts with urgency or impulse. The attribute is functional setup that colors her characterization without driving a key turn. Lyric reprise at closure is absent; the trait is invoked early then absorbed into general portrayal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Light is woven throughout: prismatic shadows in the opening, opal refraction, the library as prism in the penultimate paragraph, and the final "small candle of sound" metaphor. It enables the dawn watering ritual (protecting delicate petals) and charges multiple images. However, it does not drive a major turn; the chime's cracked sound, not light, triggers Miren's memory and decision. Light enriches atmosphere and thematic resonance (memory as illumination) but is not the causal engine. Removing light imagery would reduce texture without breaking plot logic. Present in setup, development, and payoff, it reaches mid-band through accumulation rather than indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By the echo of a long-forgotten song" describes the method by which the cracked chime's sound evokes Miren's mother's humming (paragraph 4). The song has no name, underscoring the extinction theme, and this nameless melody becomes the content Miren documents under "Thessaly." The method is signaled early, shapes the middle recognition beat, and directly informs the ending action (recording the melody, labeling it). The mechanics matter: the fractured tone creates the echo that bridges past and present. The element is causal and specific, present in all three gates, and difficult to replace without altering the story's emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is introduced immediately and anchors every scene. Its properties—prismatic light refraction, artificial breeze, opal walls—constrain Miren's work (dawn timing, ventilation-driven chime movement) and supply the sensory palette. The setting shapes tactics (the watering ritual, the decision to hang the chime "in a place of honor") and charges the final image (light through opal walls, clouds as questions). It is integral to tone and concept, providing the isolated, elevated space where extinct feelings are preserved. The setting is irreplaceable; relocating the story to a ground-level archive would collapse the metaphorical and atmospheric architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the museum of extinct feelings" is more spatial than temporal; the story unfolds in a single morning (dawn watering, immediate discovery and decision). The museum as container is present throughout, framing Miren's role and the stakes, but "across" does not function as a time pressure. The action is continuous with no deadline or clock that tightens choices. The museum setting contributes to atmosphere and theme but does not operate as a temporal constraint. The element is ornamental regarding time; as a setting descriptor it is functional but replaceable (e.g., "within the museum").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to preserve forgotten names is stated explicitly (paragraph 5: "Her true work was to preserve the sound of forgotten names") and dramatized in the ending when she labels the chime's melody with "Thessaly," her mother's name that "meant nothing to anyone living now except Miren." The motivation drives the final choice (documentation over repair) and carries personal cost (claiming private meaning in a public archive). It is seeded early, tested in the middle hesitation, and paid off at closure. The desire is coherent and shapes the arc, though the lack of external friction (no institutional pushback) softens the conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" appears once (paragraph 6) as "that particular shade of sorrow that came from choosing between preservation and transformation." The phrase anchors the emotional register—melancholy, bittersweet—and ties to Miren's mother (foxglove was her favorite). The tone is consistent throughout: elegiac, contemplative, gently mournful. However, the tone does not modulate sharply under pressure; it remains uniform from opening to close. The final image (whispering "Thessaly," lighting a candle of sound) sustains the regretful tone but does not deepen or twist it. Coherent and purposeful, but static rather than dynamically charged by escalation.</comment>
