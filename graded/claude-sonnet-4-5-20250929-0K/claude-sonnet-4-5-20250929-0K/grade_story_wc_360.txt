<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The operator's borrowed personalities are described but rarely constrain on-page choices in dramatized beats. Interior states rely heavily on abstraction ("anxious precision of a clockmaker," "languid confidence of a river guide") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile is "someone else's," but no visible cost attends this dissolution beyond thematic assertion. Motivation remains conceptual—mapping emotional mathematics—without friction between competing wants that would force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens but delivers only thematic density, not a decisive tightening or cost at closure. The operator arranges type, presses fragments, examines patterns—repeated moves without narrowing options or altering knowledge. The ending restates the opening premise ("seeking the equation") without a visible change in stance or foreclosed path. No on-page reversal or Charged Poise moment crystallizes options; the final image ("steady as a heartbeat, patient as the mathematics of the dying sky") offers metaphor but no felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop with bioluminescent walls and the letterpress are vivid and POV-filtered ("patterns she could never quite replicate"). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (halo fragment beside lead types, press descending, paper lifted). However, the workshop does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The vanishing stars above recur but remain decorative, not a clock that pressures decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding emotional mathematics to predict the next collapse—is clear but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the operator moves through arranging, pressing, examining in a static loop. The halo fragment reveals emotional data ("grief, loneliness, joy"), but no on-page decision risks or sacrifices anything. The ending restates the opening activity without visible cost or narrowed choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—emotion as universal force, the mathematics of feeling—emerges from the operator's work but remains asserted rather than tested. The equations ("Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance") are declared insights, not earned through struggle or dramatized friction. The final image offers conceptual resonance but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it simply extends the opening metaphor. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured with purposeful compression ("sugar in rain," "honey, then sudden and sharp as shattering ice"). POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic across beats; the operator's borrowed personalities do not alter syntax or rhythm in distinguishable ways. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lucid turbulence," "residual divinity") without POV-specific anchoring, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is often striking ("emotions weren't separate variables but different expressions of the same underlying force"). However, paraphrase loops recur: the operator's lack of original self is restated across three beats ("dissolved like sugar," "no longer tell where she ended," "become a vessel"). Template cadence in the work sequence ("setting type, pressing, examining" repeated with minor variations) creates drag. Mixed metaphor: "love that tasted of copper and rain" blurs sensory coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of letterpress operator, halo fragments, borrowed personalities, and vanishing stars is conceptually fresh. However, the central activity—mapping emotional mathematics—remains abstract throughout; no specific, non-obvious turn emerges from the premise. The story could swap the operator's tool (letterpress for another craft) and the dying-universe frame without structural loss. The equations feel ornamental rather than inevitably tied to the character's method or the world's constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The operator arranges type, presses fragments, examines patterns—but no choice alters tactics or options. She is present throughout but never decides between competing goods or renounces a path. Observation and craft dominate; agency is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early, is pressed into paper mid-story, and grows warmer near the end. It provides emotional data that the operator examines. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as input for contemplation, not as an object whose properties force a trade-off or reweighted stance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named in the messenger's line ("Payment for the empathy work") and mentioned in one beat ("transpose their empathy from one person to another") but never dramatized on the page. No character's empathy is visibly moved or altered; the concept remains thematic backdrop, not a mechanism shaping stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Borrowed personalities are described (clockmaker, river guide, mathematician) and the operator's self-dissolution is asserted multiple times. However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The borrowed mathematician's "patient wonder" informs her approach but does not foreclose another path or force a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears once as the operator's gift to "disorient readers so completely that their defenses collapsed." The action is mentioned but not enacted on the page; no character is disoriented, and no turn traces to this action. It could be swapped for another craft verb without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is signaled when the operator composes "words that meant three different things depending on how light struck them." This method shapes one beat (the pressing of the message) but does not recur or constrain later attempts. Its mechanics are described, not used to alter tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The topaz workshop with amber, bioluminescent walls is present throughout and responds to the operator's moods. It provides vivid atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting is ornamental rather than essential to tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Vanishing stars recur as framing device ("another star winked out" appears twice) and "between these vanishing stars, time moved strangely" is asserted. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the operator works steadily without a live clock forcing urgency or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to understand the mathematics of emotion and "perhaps save the remaining stars"—is stated and guides the operator's activity. However, it is never conflicted; no friction between cost and desire forces a choice. The operator simply continues the work without dramatized obstacles or sacrifice tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" appears once in the text as a description of the impression ("glowed with lucid turbulence—clear yet chaotic, ordered yet wild"). Tone is consistent and purposeful across the piece—contemplative with poetic compression—but does not modulate with rising pressure or charge the final image distinctly. The mood is static rather than escalating.</comment>
