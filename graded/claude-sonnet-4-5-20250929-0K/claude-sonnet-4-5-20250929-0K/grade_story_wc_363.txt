<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mariko's motivation is embodied through the weaving work and the amber bead warming against her chest. Her decision to cross the threshold carries visible cost—she takes Kenji's place in the liminal space with full knowledge of the consequences. The interiority remains consistent and specific to her craft, though the grandmother's exposition in the middle third summarizes key backstory rather than letting Mariko's present choices reveal it fully. The final act earns the sacrifice through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with visible cost: Mariko crosses the jigsaw frame, trading her place for Kenji's. The accumulative lens holds—each weaving detail, the amber bead's warmth, the jigsaw frame, and the grandmother's teaching cohere into the final threshold crossing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pattern locks into place and Mariko steps forward, narrowing options to a single committed act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard, bamboo stalks, and jigsaw frame on the ground create a coherent micro-setting. The loom and puzzle pieces constrain Mariko's approach and charge the final crossing. Sensory details—morning mist, cold numbing her fingers, the amber bead warming—are filtered through her focused attention. Spatial choreography remains clear: loom, frame on the ground, threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve Kenji from the raveling silence. Escalation tightens when the final thread passes through and the pattern locks, forcing the choice. The cost is unmistakable—Mariko will take his place, possibly returning "translucent, forever caught between states of being." Her agency drives the resolution; coincidence does not solve. The sacrifice forecloses her former life with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: weaving as connection, the spaces between worlds, the latent sacrifice required to hold the door. The amber bead and jigsaw frame recur with shifted weight at closure. The final image—crossing with "her message of remembered songs and unbroken bonds"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. No overt thematic statements intrude, though "raveling silence welcomed her home" risks poeticism. The core question of cost and connection is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mariko. Perceptual signature is consistent—craft-focused, stoic, attentive to texture and intention. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gossamer," "liminal," "translucent") that fits the mythic atmosphere but strains against the grounded craft details. No head-hopping. The grandmother's exposition in reported speech feels slightly formal but remains within bounds. Psychic distance is controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. "Stoically sparkling" appears twice, once as phrase and once embedded, reading as a purposeful echo rather than churn. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "Her grandmother had…" "He had…" "She had…" across adjacent paragraphs. The phrase "raveling silence" recurs five times, functioning as a taught motif rather than loop. Figurative language ("gossamer," "honey-colored depths") is dense but controlled. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—weaving a path between worlds using hair, bamboo, and spider silk, framed by jigsaw edges—offers specificity and a fresh synthesis of craft and liminal mythology. The emotional core (sibling rescue via sacrifice) is familiar but grounded in particular objects and methods. The jigsaw-as-doorway-frame and the amber bead as anchor are non-obvious. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to its mythic register without hedging, though the emotional arc follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mariko is present throughout, her weaving work drives the middle beats, and her decision to cross the threshold is the closure act. She appears in the opening, her craft constrains the middle (weaving with intention, hearing Kenji's fragments), and her final choice is causal. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Specific cost tied to her: she takes Keji's place with visible consequence. Not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber bead is introduced early (third paragraph), mentioned when it grows warm as the pattern nears completion, and addressed directly in the final line ("whispered to the amber bead"). Three distinct beats: introduction with backstory, warming pulse during escalation, direct address at closure. It carries the grandmother's words and the preserved bamboo leaf, linking past to present. The bead reweights meaning at the end, though it does not constrain a middle choice on its own. Strong lyric reprise with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Raveling silence" is introduced in the second paragraph as the space where Kenji is trapped. It shapes stakes (he is "lost in the raveling silence"), tactics (Mariko must weave to reach him "through the raveling silence"), and closure (she crosses and "the raveling silence welcomed her home"). The concept defines the problem, the method, and the ending. Not merely thematic; it alters options and is causally active. Present in setup, development, and payoff with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears twice: once describing her dedication ("stoically sparkling dedication") and once describing the completed weaving ("stoically sparkling with an inner light"). Both are descriptive labels without constraining a choice or enabling a tactic under pressure. The trait does not force a trade-off or alter her approach. Functional within tone but swappable with similar modifiers. Present in setup and closure beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears once in reported speech: grandmother promises Mariko "could recommence her life afterward." It frames a potential future but does not create a key turn or shape the closure. The protagonist's actual action is crossing the threshold, not recommencing. The word is present but peripheral to the dominant causal chain. Introduced late (past midpoint) and not revisited at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle edges are introduced in the second paragraph, their mechanics explained (they "formed borders... not of pictures, but of pathways" and "frame an absence, a doorway"), and they appear in multiple beats: Mariko spent months fitting them, they form the frame on the ground before her loom, and she steps across them at closure. The method shapes her approach (months of arrangement) and defines the threshold she crosses. Setup, development, and payoff gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard with bamboo is anchored in the opening and recurs (bamboo whispering, gnarled apple trees, orchard shadows for spider silk). It supplies resources (bamboo fiber, spider silk) and frames the isolated workspace. The setting appears in the final line ("the forgotten orchard that had witnessed everything"), recharging prior material. Setup and payoff present; middle development is lighter but the setting enables the craft. Lyric reprise strengthens integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" is a phrase describing how Mariko learned to hear Kenji. Time is also tracked loosely (three seasons since discovery, seven years since Kenji vanished, months fitting puzzle pieces, deepest part of night). The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. It sets context but does not narrow tactics beat-to-beat. Present across the arc but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to carry a message across impossible distance is dramatized: Mariko weaves "her intention, her memory of Kenji's laugh, his steady hands, his habit of humming old songs." The motivation drives the weaving work across multiple beats and culminates in the crossing ("carrying her message of remembered songs and unbroken bonds"). The friction between her want (retrieve Kenji) and the cost (take his place) charges the final choice. Setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone of latent sacrifice is signaled early ("latent sacrifice her grandmother had warned her about"), sustained through the middle (consequences detailed: "some who entered... never quite returned whole"), and charges the final image (she crosses "freely" knowing the cost). Tone modulates with the escalation—stoic determination gives way to quiet resolve—and the closure line ("the raveling silence welcomed her home") carries the sacrificial weight. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
