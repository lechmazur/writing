<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mrs. Chen's interiority is established through her teaching history and the zither inheritance, but her emotional states remain largely told rather than embodied ("expectantly resigned" functions as a label). The gathered students are named with their prejudices but lack distinct behavioral markers or speech patterns; they exist primarily as types. The ending choice—placing the rosette back in the box—feels more symbolic than motivated by internal conflict, and no visible cost attaches to the teaching act itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the library gathering and humming exercise build pressure toward the final reweighting of the zither rosette. Orientation anchors are clear by the second paragraph. The closure image (rosette returned to box, lesson resonating) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract—"difficult work of autumn and beyond" tells future consequence rather than showing present forfeiture. No on-page choice forecloses a live option with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly rendered with sound-dampening walls, amber light, and autumn leaves; these details support the thematic work of creating sanctuary. The rosette itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the teaching moment and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching harmony to undo inherited prejudice—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the humming exercise unfolds without resistance or visible setback; the participants adjust "slowly" but no one refuses or falters on the page. The escalation is told ("The timeframe across unlearning hatred...small moments") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of harmony through listening emerges organically from the zither rosette and the choir teaching. The intertwined phoenixes provide a concrete image that shifts meaning from preservation to practice. The final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("this is how traditions survive") but the underlying question—whether teaching can heal communal fracture—receives non-literal answer through the charged image of the boxed rosette and resonating lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mrs. Chen with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a slightly elevated literary register ("traveled stillness," "braid diverse voices") that occasionally drifts from the focalizer's immediate perception into thematic commentary. The gathered students speak no dialogue, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Filter verbs ("she had seen it happen before") appear but do not dull the key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several passages rely on abstract summary rather than scene work: "The timeframe across unlearning hatred wasn't measured..." and "the casual cruelties that denote difference as deficiency" tell thematic stakes rather than showing them. The phrase "harmonious choir teacher" appears twice verbatim. Figurative language is purposeful ("leaves pressed against the glass like illuminated manuscripts") but occasional elevated diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") clashes with concrete action. No major loops or mechanical templates, but density could increase by dramatizing the humming exercise's friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The combination of zither craft, choir teaching, and library sanctuary offers a specific synthesis. The premise—gathering prejudiced individuals to hum together—risks didacticism but is grounded in Mrs. Chen's vocational history. The humming-as-harmony metaphor is familiar; the story does not transform it through an unexpected complication or cost, and the resolution feels preordained rather than earned through on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mrs. Chen frames the story, opens the box, guides the humming exercise, and places the rosette back—three distinct beats. However, her choices lack friction; no one resists, and she does not adjust tactics or pay a visible cost. The teaching moment is her decision, but it unfolds as planned without dramatized opposition.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rosette appears in the opening paragraph, is placed on the table to anchor the teaching beat, and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning (preservation versus practice). Three beats with early signal and closure linkage. However, the rosette is not handled or examined by others; it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a tool that alters tactics or imposes cost tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is named explicitly in the first third ("the vanishing arts—both the ancient craft...and the harder work of teaching") and resurfaces at closure ("the last piece of a vanishing art"). It shapes Mrs. Chen's motivation and colors the stakes, but does not constrain a choice or change tactics on the page. The concept functions as thematic framing rather than dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears once as a character label in the third paragraph. It tells Mrs. Chen's stance but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The trait is not dramatized through a choice that demonstrates both expectation and resignation with visible cost; it remains a static descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Denote" appears in the phrase "the casual cruelties that denote difference as deficiency" in the second paragraph. It describes the background forces Mrs. Chen fights but does not trigger a plot turn or shape a key choice on the page. The action is told as past context rather than dramatized in the present beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled in paragraph six ("her method by subtracting noise—not the noise of voices, but the noise of assumptions") and shapes the library sanctuary design. The method informs the humming exercise (finding intervals, adjusting rather than dominating) across two beats. However, the mechanics are told in abstract terms rather than shown through a moment where noise is actively removed with visible effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The velvet library with sound-dampening walls appears in the opening and recurs throughout. It provides the sanctuary that enables the teaching moment and its "atmosphere of enforced reflection" directly supports Mrs. Chen's method of subtracting noise. The setting constrains the action (choir can gather quietly) and charges the closure image ("velvet library...carrying forward"). Three gates met with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Timeframe across unlearning hatred" is named explicitly in paragraph seven but remains abstract. The story unfolds in a single continuous scene with autumn as backdrop; no ticking clock or deadline pressures tactics. The phrase functions as thematic commentary rather than a constraint that alters choices or escalation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony" is signaled in the second paragraph as Mrs. Chen's decades-long goal and drives her gathering of students and the humming exercise. The motivation is present across multiple beats and directly shapes the closure lesson. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible tradeoffs; Mrs. Chen's teaching unfolds without internal friction or cost to her personally.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears in the opening paragraph and recurs in the closing line ("traveled stillness of that velvet library"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, balancing contemplation with quiet urgency. However, it remains relatively static; the prose does not modulate with pressure during the humming exercise, and the final image reprises the opening mood without tonal shift or charge that reflects the intervening action.</comment>
