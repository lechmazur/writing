<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's obsession with the timer is embodied through sustained tactile engagement ("fingers, trained to understand the secret anatomy of locks"), and his internal conflict between practical survival and wonder-preservation creates tension. However, the peak choice—calling the survivors to witness—lacks dramatized resistance or visible cost; he simply decides to share. The other survivors remain undifferentiated beyond "old Chen" and "the Martov twins," functioning as abstract backdrop rather than applying interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (locksmith, marble cavern, wounded season) within the opening. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Marcus's mapping, reconstruction, and activation build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the timer conjures echoes and the survivors witness resilience. Closure lands with conceptual cost—wonder stored against future despair—legible in "when we forget how to hope, we can return here." One small causality slip: the leap from "reflections shifted" to "temporal echoes" is asserted rather than earned through intermediate discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vivid and functional: moonlight through fissures creates the repeating patterns Marcus maps, polished stone acts as a temporal mirror, and the geometric center where six passages converge becomes the mechanism's final placement. The timer itself—brass gears, corroded springs—constrains Marcus's reconstruction work across multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and tied to Marcus's locksmith attention ("calcite deposits," "hairspring").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder for communal resilience—is signaled early and tightens through Marcus's isolation from practical survival concerns. The reconstruction work provides sustained pressure, and the final activation narrows options by committing Marcus to a public unveiling. However, the climax lacks interpersonal resistance or a dramatized trade-off; the survivors simply arrive and are "transfixed" without skepticism or cost to Marcus's social standing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the marble's capacity to hold temporal echoes parallels the human need to store hope against despair. The timer mechanism becomes a concrete answer to "how do we endure" without moralizing. The final image—reflections blooming like flowers, ghosts of resilience—reweights the wounded season as one cycle in a longer pattern. Marcus's line "wonder itself was a resource that needed storing" risks thematic echo but is rescued by immediate return to tactile action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV is clean with stable third-limited focalization. Marcus's perceptual signature—locksmith precision, attention to "secret anatomy" and "relationship between components"—remains consistent. The prose shifts register slightly under pressure: "temporal echoes" and "astronomical precision" feel elevated for someone working by torchlight with charcoal on leather. Brief dialogue ("To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later") carries subtext of isolation and purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the reconstruction sequence. Two minor loops: "The broken timer mechanism became his obsession" followed immediately by "He would sit for hours studying its corroded innards" restates focus without advancing it. "Reflections bloomed across the stone like flowers opening—not just light, but captured moments" layers metaphor but the dash-clause feels like a hedge against the initial image's clarity. Otherwise propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—marble as temporal storage medium, timer as harvester of echoes—is fresh and commits fully to its logic. The wounded season frame and locksmith's skillset transform a familiar "lone inventor" arc through specificity. Risk-taking in the extended metaphysical leap (marble preserving "impressions") pays off at closure. One derivative beat: the community dismissing the obsessed outsider who later proves visionary echoes workshop templates, though the ending's focus on collective witnessing rather than vindication mitigates this.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his choices (mapping angles, reconstructing the timer, placing it at the cavern's center, calling the survivors) drive all major beats. His reflective nature is embodied in sustained observation and reverse-engineering rather than stated. The final choice to share the discovery participates in closure but lacks visible cost or dramatized resistance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The timer appears early ("half-buried in calcite deposits"), is handled across multiple beats (studying corroded innards, fabricating new gears, winding and placing it), and its activation at the geometric center directly produces the closure effect. Its specific properties—brass gears, burst springs, counting mechanism—constrain Marcus's reconstruction work and enable the harvest of temporal echoes. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes from the first third: Marcus discovers the timer was "designed to harvest these echoes," and his goal becomes operationalizing that harvest. The mechanics—temporal impressions preserved in marble, accessed through reflection angles—constrain his approach and deliver the climactic moment when "the marble walls responded" and "reflections bloomed." The phrase "harvest of echoes" appears verbatim only once but the action occurs on-page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is demonstrated through Marcus's draw to "places where torchlight barely reached" and his remaining "peripherally focused on the settlement's daily dramas" while working. This enables his discovery of reflection patterns others miss but also isolates him from practical concerns. The trait shapes two beats (discovery, social isolation) but lacks a dramatized cost or choice where peripheral vision fails him.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering drives Marcus's central work: "trying to reverse-engineer its purpose from the relationship between its components." This action yields the insight about temporal echoes and structures the reconstruction sequence. It appears in the first third and shapes the middle beats, though the final activation is placement rather than additional reverse-engineering. The mechanics are somewhat glossed ("fabricating new gears, teaching himself the language of springs and escapements").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is signaled early and executed across beats: Marcus maps how moonlight "filtering through fissures played across the polished stone," documents "each beam's trajectory, measuring angles," and discovers patterns. This method yields the core insight about temporal echoes. However, the final activation relies on placement at "the cavern's geometric center" rather than a specific reflection-angle manipulation, weakening the method's closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern pressures all choices: its reflective surfaces enable Marcus's discovery, underground streams support survival, the geometric center where six passages converge becomes the timer's necessary placement, and moonlight through fissures provides the illumination Marcus maps. The eastern passage, calcite deposits, and polished stone all supply resources or constraints. Removing this exact setting would require fundamental redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wounded season frames the entire narrative, arriving early to drive survivors into the caves and creating the survival-versus-wonder tension. Marcus works "across the lull" and completes the timer "on the season's coldest night," and the ending references "the long wait for spring." Time tightens the stakes (rationing, sickness, birth) and the survivors' skepticism about impractical work. However, the passage of time within the reconstruction is summarized ("three winters") rather than pressuring individual choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is dramatized through Marcus's choice to work on the timer despite the settlement's practical focus and is stated verbatim in dialogue. It drives his isolation from daily dramas and shapes the final beat: "When we forget how to hope, we can return here." The friction between wonder-as-resource and immediate survival needs creates tension, though the cost of this choice is conceptual rather than social or material.</comment>
