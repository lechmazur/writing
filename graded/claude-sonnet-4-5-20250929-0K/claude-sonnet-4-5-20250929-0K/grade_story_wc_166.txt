<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaleth's motivation ("pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin") is declared in paragraph three but never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a trade-off. Her internal state remains a single unbroken note—reverent determination—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The grandmother memory and exile backstory anchor her stance but do not create friction in the present. The caretaker's discovery at dawn names the result without showing how Kaleth's choice forecloses a path or accepts a cost she resists on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates gestures and images toward a final tableau (Kaleth frozen in pose, "eyes held galaxies"), which reads as Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where options are reconfigured and the cost of elective exile becomes undeniable. However, the closure relies heavily on assertion ("Her silence spoke volumes," "written herself into the cosmos forever") rather than a concrete image or action that makes the transformation legible without commentary. No causality break, but the resonance depends on tell rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden's crystalline petals, gravity generators, and pale stones provide vivid anchors and recurring micro-setting detail. The flowers turning toward Kaleth in paragraph eight and the final sunrise frame constrain perception and charge the closure image with a shift from starlit motion to still dawn. Spatial choreography (rows, path, final pose) remains coherent. The garden functions as both stage and responsive element, elevating it above postcard description, though the tool (moonstone) does more causal work than the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to embody forbidden memory through dance and "pen a cosmic verse." The moonstone discovery (paragraph five) provides a tightening—Kaleth recognizes it as "the key"—but the escalation is instant empowerment rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No on-page reversal; the dance succeeds without friction or visible cost paid during the act. The caretaker's arrival names the outcome but does not dramatize consequence or foreclose a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the middle lacks a complication that tests commitment or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory as embodied rebellion, exile as chosen belonging) emerges from recurring images: tide-dancing without oceans, gaps as speech, the body as living document. The final pose offers a non-literal answer to the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece's thematic claims lean on direct assertion—"exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging," "some memories ran deeper than thought"—rather than letting the image do the work. The moonstone-as-catalyst and the dance itself are particular, but the closure paragraph edges toward thematic echo by articulating the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("obsidian grace," "kinaesthetic poetry," "hieroglyph spelling out a single, complex truth"), which matches the ceremonial tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that sounds more like authorial commentary than Kaleth's embodied perception. Perceptual signature (dance vocabulary, attention to gaps and currents) is coherent. No head-hopping. The register remains stable, though phrases like "elective exile" and "cosmic verse" read as prompt-adjacent rather than character-lived idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood suddenly" (telling the realization rather than showing it through action or image), and the final two paragraphs recycle conceptual ground ("living document," "memories ran deeper than thought," "written herself into the cosmos") without advancing the image. The phrase "moonstone cabochon dust speck" mixes scale cues awkwardly (cabochon vs. dust speck). No template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "obsidian grace" and "mercury" lack vehicle specificity that would ground the comparison in Kaleth's world.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (tide-dancing as embodied memory under a nostalgia ban) combines familiar SF tropes (orbital habitat, authoritarian memory-policing) with a lyric focus on dance-as-text. The moonstone artifact and "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" motif are specific, but the arc—isolated artist achieves transcendent self-expression without obstacle—follows a well-worn template. The piece commits fully to its ceremonial tone and does not retreat, yet no turn surprises or reweights prior material in hindsight. Removing Kaleth's name and swapping "tide dancer" for another art form would leave the emotional shape unchanged, signaling derivative structure beneath vivid surface detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaleth is on the page throughout and her dance shapes the narrative arc, but her skill as a tide dancer does not create a meaningful choice under pressure. She moves, discovers the moonstone, dances again—all without friction or a decision that narrows options. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure tableau, but her dancer identity remains a label more than a constraint or enabler that alters tactics with cost. The caretaker's line "still standing" names the result but does not trace to a tide-dancer-specific turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonstone appears in paragraph five (mid-story), is consumed immediately (one beat of handling), and its essence enables the permanence of Kaleth's dance-writing in paragraphs seven and eight (second beat). It returns implicitly in the closure when Kaleth's body becomes "a living document," though the stone itself is not named or reweighted there. The element drives the transformation but is not revisited with charged meaning at the end. Setup missing (arrives mid-story, −0.4); development and payoff present; causal pressure evident; closure linkage indirect. Swappability moderate—another catalyst artifact could serve a similar role with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elective exile is named in paragraph two and returns in the penultimate paragraph's closure claim: "exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging." The concept frames Kaleth's situation (orbital garden refuge from persecution) and charges the final tableau with thematic weight. However, it does not constrain an on-page action or force a mid-scene trade-off; it functions as thematic backdrop rather than a tactical element that alters her choices under pressure. Setup clear, closure participation strong via theme, but middle development absent—no moment where exile imposes a visible cost or narrows options during the dance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears once in paragraph two (gravity generators) and once in the penultimate paragraph ("spontaneously anchored not by gravity generators but by the weight of what she'd become"). The trait is asserted in both instances without constraining or enabling a specific on-page action with cost. It functions as metaphor in the closure line but does not shape tactics or narrow options during the dance. Setup and closure participation present; development absent. Highly swappable—remove both mentions and the story's causal chain remains intact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fledge" appears in paragraph three ("danced to fledge a new understanding") and paragraph nine ("fledge from the chrysalis of enforced amnesia"). The action is thematic rather than literal—Kaleth does not undergo a physical metamorphosis beat-by-beat—and the verb could be replaced with "emerge" or "transform" without structural loss. Present in setup and closure, but the concept does not drive a middle turn or constrain her choices. The dance itself is the major action; "fledge" is descriptive label for the result.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is taught in paragraph four (grandmother's method: "spaces between constellations, pauses between petals, stillness at the center") and returns implicitly in paragraph nine ("in the spaces between heartbeats, in the gaps where truth resided"). The method shapes Kaleth's perceptual signature and is invoked at closure to charge the final claim. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter her tactics on the page—she does not solve a problem by applying gap-observation in a beat where another approach would fail. Setup, thematic development, and closure participation present; causal pressure moderate. Lyric reprise reweights the stake without mid-scene use, eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden is anchored early (paragraph one) with recurring detail (crystalline petals, pale stones, flowers turning toward Kaleth in paragraph eight, sunrise in paragraph ten). It provides stage and atmospheric pressure but does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters Kaleth's tactics—she could dance anywhere with the moonstone. The garden's flowers resonate with her dance (paragraph eight), charging the scene, but this is responsive rather than constraining. Setup, development (responsive environment), and closure framing all present; causal pressure moderate. The setting enriches tone more than it shapes choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is named in paragraphs one and two, framing the stakes (persecution for remembering Earth's oceans), and returns in paragraph nine as "enforced amnesia." It motivates Kaleth's exile and her choice to dance forbidden patterns, but the ban does not tighten decisions during the dance itself—no enforcer approaches, no internal clock or risk of discovery alters her tactics. Setup strong, closure thematic participation present, middle development absent. The timeframe is historical backdrop rather than a live pressure that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is introduced in paragraph three as Kaleth's crystallized intention and returns in paragraphs seven ("pen verses that existed in four dimensions"), nine ("living document"), and ten ("penned her cosmic verse on the only mortal skin that mattered"). The desire is declared and pursued without internal friction or competing want. Setup clear, development (moonstone enables the verse-writing in paragraph seven), and closure (body as document) all present. However, the motivation is told and executed without on-page conflict between cost and desire—she achieves her goal without visible sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears in paragraph one only, establishing Kaleth's movement quality. Tone throughout is elevated, ceremonial, and lyric—consistent with the phrase—but the descriptor itself does not modulate with pressure or return to charge the final image. The prose maintains a single register (reverent, abstract) from opening to closure without cadence shift that would reflect escalation or cost. Present in setup, coherent across the piece, but static; does not shape turns or final resonance beyond initial mood-setting.</comment>
