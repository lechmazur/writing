<comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific—her choice to refuse the invitation arises from a clear history of loss and preservation instinct. The embodied work of archiving memories in flowers is particular, and her final renunciation feels earned by the sister's erasure and Mira's years-long practice. However, the sister remains abstract (a voice, a laugh, no contradictory impulses on the page), and Mira's internal conflict between recognition and control is articulated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice lands cleanly with visible cost (foreclosing legitimacy, cementing isolation), but the path there is more reflective summary than scene-by-scene pressure.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure unit is Earned Stasis: Mira writes her refusal, foreclosing the path to recognition and cementing her independence-through-isolation with visible cost (remaining misunderstood, garden never shared). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered reflection and the recurring shell/flower images, culminating in a cadence shift at dawn that reweights the dominant stake (preservation vs. legitimacy). One meaningful deepening: the envelope's arrival yesterday frames the present choice, and the final placement of the shell at the garden's center charges the ending image. Minor friction: the "because/therefore" linkage between sister's erasure and Mira's archiving method is largely told rather than shown through on-page discovery.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The velvet garden is anchored early with sensory specificity (moonflowers, tragically radiant blooms, twilight-to-dawn progression) and the space constrains Mira's final choice: she places the shell at the center, marking the buried half, which charges the closure image. The recurring shell and flowers function as micro-setting, reweighted at the end. Spatial choreography is coherent (rows, beds, garden center) and the dawn shift tracks cleanly. Details filter through Mira's bias (flowers as vessels, beauty inseparable from loss), and the garden's response to her actions (flowers turning toward her) integrates world logic into her perception without overt exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preservation vs. legitimacy—is signaled early (the envelope's arrival, Mira's refusal to call the garden an archive) and deepens through her internal debate. One meaningful pressure point: the dawn deadline forces the final choice, and writing the refusal forecloses legitimacy with visible cost (isolation, no understanding). However, the escalation is largely reflective; Mira's stance is already crystallized when the story opens, and the envelope's arrival is framed as yesterday's event rather than an on-page complication. Agency is clear (renunciation), and the cost is legible (cementing her outsider status, ensuring the garden remains hers alone), but the tightening is more a cadence shift than a causal reversal under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira's actions and the garden's images: love as dangerous synchronicity, preservation as resistance, isolation vs. independence. The recurring shell and moonflowers shift meaning at the end (two pieces forever separated, forever connected), charging the closure without a stated moral. The final image—garden whispering, Mira writing her refusal at dawn—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether preservation can be shared or must remain solitary. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the shell at the center) and implication (the sister's erasure as the government's cure). Minor friction: "translate isolation into independence" risks thematic echo, but the line is Mira's internal framing rather than authorial summary, and the ending complicates rather than confirms her claim.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during shell-listening, slightly wider during garden survey). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices resonance structures, emotional residue, fragmentation—vocabulary fits a researcher who has turned her knowledge into private ritual. Diction stays within her register (quarantined memory, cognitive contagion, resonance poisoning) without unmotivated elevation. Minor slip: "the sky shifted from purple to deep blue" and "tragically radiant" recur as stock descriptors rather than evolving percepts under pressure. Reflection is substantial (~35% of text) but anchored to present stimuli (shell, flowers, dawn) and drives the final choice, meeting the BRR exception; no cap applied.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show diversity. Information density is high in the opening third, then the middle carries paraphrase loops: "I'm not crazy / I'm careful" distinction is restated multiple times without added pressure; "tragically radiant" appears twice identically. Template cadence emerges in the reflective beats ("She had separated them deliberately... Back when they'd walked... before the resonance structures..."). Stock metaphor "ghostly resolve" and "velvet garden" recur without reweighting. These artifacts concentrate in non-closure beats; the final paragraph tightens and lands cleanly. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in middle third, not touching closure), score lands at 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—archiving dangerous memories in flowers to resist government erasure—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative grief and botanical metaphor. The sister's resonance poisoning and Mira's fragmentation method feel specific, not template-driven. However, the emotional arc (refusal of institutional recognition to preserve personal truth) follows a familiar outsider-artist pattern without a non-obvious inflection. The ending's inevitability is signaled early; Mira's stance does not shift, only crystallizes. Risk-taking is present (accumulative/lyric design, substantial reflection), and the garden's "whispering" through resonance structures is a concrete, verifiable detail that grounds the speculative. Transformation test: the plot could survive with different memory mechanics, but the specificity of "split seashell as template for survival" and "moonflowers holding a laugh" elevate the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mira as "charmed skeptic" is named early and her decision to refuse the invitation drives the closure. Her skepticism ("I don't believe in your cure") and charm (the garden's beauty, her meticulous care) shape the refusal with visible cost. However, "charmed skeptic" as a label is more asserted than enacted through contradictory on-page choices; her stance is consistent rather than torn. Two beats: initial archiving work, final refusal. Moderate causal pressure (skepticism forecloses legitimacy). Closure linkage strong. Swappability moderate (could be "obsessive archivist" with minor edits). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5, ornamental label use −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, rounded to 5.8 within band for strong closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The whispering seashell half is handled in three beats: pressed to Mira's ear in paragraph 3, murmuring against her palm in paragraph 8, and placed at the garden's center in the final beat. It frames the sister's absence, enables Mira to hear emotional residue, and at the end reweights the separation (two halves forever connected). Early signal (paragraph 2) +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (listening shapes reflection, placement charges closure) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (jagged edge, buried other half) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, minor summary use of "fragments of thought" −0.2, final 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Quarantined memory shapes the premise and stakes: Mira splits memories into fragments stored in plants to resist erasure. It drives her refusal (sharing protocols would enable control/replication). Present in all three acts: opening archive work, reflective debate over the envelope, final placement and refusal. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (quarantine method forecloses sharing) +1.2, closure linkage +1.3 (the refusal ensures memories remain quarantined, never standardized). Specificity moderate (could be "fragmented memory" with similar effect) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, rounded to 6.9 for slight abstraction in middle beats where it is theme-claimed more than tactically enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Tragically radiant appears twice as descriptor for moonflowers (paragraphs 4 and 16) but does not constrain or enable on-page action. It labels the flowers' quality (beauty inseparable from loss) without altering Mira's tactics or the closure. Early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.8, ornamental/label-only use −1.0, no causal pressure or cost connection −0.8. Base 3.0 + (−0.5) = 2.5; lyric-resonance allowance (seed-to-final reprise reweights stake) +2.3, final 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Archive (verb/action) drives the premise: Mira archives memories in flowers throughout, and the closure is her decision to keep archiving privately rather than submit her research. Present in all three acts: opening flower-tending, reflective history of archiving post-sister's erasure, final refusal to share the archive. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (archiving method enables refusal, forecloses legitimacy) +1.3, closure linkage +1.4 (the refusal preserves the archive's secrecy). Irreplaceability moderate (could be "preserve" or "store" with similar effect) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, rounded to 7.6 for strong closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Through resonance structures is named twice (paragraph 2: sister's minds mirrored; paragraph 9: Mira learned to archive) but its mechanics are told rather than shown. It enables the archiving method and the shell's whispering, but the "how" remains abstract. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enabling (resonance allows memory storage in plants) +0.7, summary-only use −0.8, swappability moderate (could be "psychic imprinting" with minor edits) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, rounded to 5.2 for causal role despite abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The velvet garden at twilight is anchored in the opening line and remains the sole setting throughout. It supplies the archive (flowers as vessels), pressures the final choice (Mira places the shell at its center), and the twilight-to-dawn progression tightens the deadline. Early signal +0.8, three beats (opening archive work, reflective walk, final placement) +1.4, causal pressure (garden's structure enables the quarantine method, dawn forces decision) +1.4, closure linkage +1.5 (garden whispers in final image, spatial center charges the act). Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, minor static description (velvet/tragically radiant recur unchanged) −0.3, final 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>When the last star fades into morning light is invoked once in paragraph 10 ("all debts come due") and the dawn arrival in paragraph 16 closes the window. The deadline is present but not leveraged for mid-scene tightening; Mira's stance is already decided, and the time passage is atmospheric rather than tactical. Early signal (paragraph 10, ~50% mark) +0.3, two beats (invocation, dawn arrival) +0.9, closure presence +0.9, causal pressure weak (time arrival coincides with decision but does not force a trade-off) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>To translate isolation into independence is stated in paragraph 8 and enacted in the closure: Mira's refusal translates her isolation (no one understands the garden) into independence (she owns the archive, refuses control). Present in two beats: initial reflection, final refusal. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (the desire drives the refusal with visible cost: no legitimacy, no shared understanding) +1.1, closure linkage +1.2. Told-only in middle section (desire articulated but not shown through friction) −0.6, swappability moderate (could be "preserve autonomy" with similar effect) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, rounded to 6.7 for strong closure connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Ghostly resolve is named twice (paragraphs 1 and 17) and enacted in Mira's steady archiving work and final refusal. Tone is coherent—determined yet melancholic—and modulates slightly (opening guardedness, closing peace). Present in opening and closure. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0 (resolve "hardens into something like peace" in final paragraph, charging the ending). Static mood through middle section (no tonal shift under pressure) −0.4, label-only mentions −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, rounded to 6.4 for coherent modulation at closure that reweights the trait.</comment>
