<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular in the opening ("silk cravat," "elegant precision," "utterly lifeless"), and the reversal from wielding narrative as weapon to holding space for complexity is earned through the argument catalyst. However, the final transformation feels partially summarized rather than fully embodied—"he understood what he needed to do" tells the epiphany more than showing it through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The puppet work in the dome provides some embodied exploration, but the climactic insight ("holding space for complexity, trusting audiences with ambiguity") reads slightly abstract and lacks the visceral cost or micro-choice that would make the change feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Marcus, dome, post-argument). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through Marcus's recursive exploration of his puppets, layering context and dimensionality until the final paragraph reweights his entire approach. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization)—"Not a demolition, but an exploration"—with conceptual cost legible in his renunciation of weaponized narrative. The cost could be sharper; we feel his recognition but the price paid (losing the applause, the comfortable certainty) is somewhat implied rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dome is well-chosen and purposeful: "designed once to track objects hurtling through space, to provide warning and protection. Now it tracked nothing, protected no one" mirrors Marcus's emptied method and charges the reversal. The "meteor hush" and "uncommonly serene silence" anchor tone throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (portable stage in center, radar operators' seats, high windows). The setting does not constrain a choice with visible friction, which limits the score, but it effectively mirrors internal state and supports the final image of walking toward the exit with new intent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marcus's need to reverse his exploitative storytelling—is signaled early and tightens through the night's puppet work. The argument with his collaborator provides inciting pressure ("She'd accused him of using ethics as entertainment"), and his puppet exploration serves as a meaningful deepening that narrows his options from weaponized provocation to dimensional humanity. Agency is clear (he chooses to work differently), and the renunciation of his former method forecloses a path. The cost is conceptual and relational (losing the applause, accepting ambiguity) but could be more viscerally felt on the page to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling as holding space for complexity rather than forcing revelation—emerges organically from Marcus's puppet exploration and is earned through his night of questioning every character's dimensionality. The final image ("Not a demolition, but an exploration. Not an answer, but an honest question") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. "Half-lit epiphanies" recurs purposefully, shifting from what audiences seek to what Marcus now offers. The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces ambiguity. Minor deduction: "uncomfortable humanity" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of full sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during the puppet work, slightly elevated in reflection). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Marcus notices "silk cravat," "elegant precision," the dome's radar function—details filtered through his urbane, analytical lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. The prose occasionally slips into mild exposition ("For years, he'd wielded narrative like a weapon") that tells his history cleanly but without the compression or textural surprise that would elevate to the 8+ band. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high in most beats. The opening ("uncommonly serene silence, the kind that follows a storm") and recurring "meteor hush" anchor tone effectively. However, mild scaffold appears in the reflective passages: "But discomfort wasn't enlightenment. Provocation wasn't ethical" is a two-sentence toggle pattern that edges toward template cadence, and "Not just the puppet positions... he needed to reverse his entire approach" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same idea. These patterns do not obscure closure but dull momentum slightly in the middle third, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q7 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise—an artist reversing his exploitative method through solitary puppet work in a disused military structure—offers a fresh angle on the "artist questioning his ethics" template. The dome, story stick, and puppet reimagining are particular and organic. However, the emotional arc (self-critique → epiphany → renewed purpose) follows a familiar introspective trajectory without significant risk or surprise in structure. The reversal concept is executed competently but feels slightly predictable in hindsight; the final image reweights prior material but does not fundamentally transform expectations established in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus (urbane calligrapher) is present throughout and his choices drive the arc: he sets up the stage, reworks each puppet with new dimensionality, and decides to bring "something different" to the seedy bars. His decision to explore rather than demolish is the story's key turn. The "urbane" trait is visible in "silk cravat" and his analytical reflection but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup is immediate; development occurs through the puppet work; payoff is clear in the final decision. Causal pressure is moderate (his choices narrow his options), and the ending hinges on his stance shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in three beats: picked up from the trunk with backstory, used to mark transitions during the puppet work, and gathered with the puppets at dawn. It shifts from a prop signaling "whose truth was being told" to a tool Marcus uses himself, marking his ownership of the exploration. However, its function in the middle beat is described rather than dramatized—"used it to mark transitions between perspectives"—and it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Setup is early; development is functional but told; payoff is present but passive (gathered, not wielded). The meaning shift is gentle but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is named twice: first as what audiences sought in seedy bars, then as what Marcus now offers instead of "blinding certainties." The concept shapes the thematic question and his final stance, but it does not constrain an on-page action or alter a tactical choice during the dome scene. It functions primarily as thematic claim rather than dramatized pressure. Setup is early (paragraph 5); payoff is clear in the final reweighting; middle development is absent. The reprise reweights meaning but does not drive a beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears only in the opening line as scene-setting description: "The decommissioned radar dome held an uncommonly serene silence." It establishes tone but does not constrain or enable any action. Marcus does not wrestle with or leverage the serenity; it remains a static atmospheric label. No setup as character trait, no development, no payoff. The silence is revisited abstractly at the end ("less empty now, more expectant"), but "uncommonly serene" itself does not recur or shape a choice. Ornamental use; late-arrival cap does not apply, but lack of causal work does.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reverse" is the story's central action, named explicitly ("He had to reverse everything") and executed through Marcus's puppet work: he reverses his approach from tearing down to building dimensionality, from provocation to understanding. The reversal shapes the dominant stake and every middle beat (reworking the politician, bureaucrat, worker). The final line ("The reversal was complete") closes the loop. Setup is explicit (paragraph 7); development is sustained across the dome scene; payoff is on-page and causal. The action is irreplaceable—swapping "reverse" for "rethink" would weaken the structural spine. Cost is conceptual (renouncing his weapon) but legible. Minor cap: the final "reversal was complete" is a touch declarative, slightly reducing closure sharpness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is established in backstory (paragraph 3) and frames both Marcus's prior method and his future intent. He performs mentally in the dome, and the final paragraph returns to "The seedy bars would still host him, but he'd be bringing something different now." The method shapes the premise and the ending commitment, but the dome scene does not involve actual performance in a bar; the shows are referenced, not enacted. Setup is early; development is conceptual (he rehearses alone); payoff is clear in the closing promise. The specificity (seedy bars, subversive) is irreplaceable and charges the contrast, but the lack of on-stage dramatization limits score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "decommissioned radar dome" is present throughout: Marcus surveys it, notes its history ("designed once to track objects hurtling through space"), sets up his stage in its center, and walks toward its exit at dawn. The dome mirrors his emptied method and provides spatial grounding. However, it does not constrain a choice—Marcus could perform this reversal in any private space. The dome enriches atmosphere and metaphor but does not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Setup is immediate; development is atmospheric; payoff is present (the exit walk). The setting is purposeful and irreplaceable thematically, elevating it above functional-only, but lacks the friction needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the inciting event: the collaborator's accusation strips Marcus's defenses and drives him to the dome. The argument is referenced in the opening and revisited midway ("The argument with his collaborator had stripped away his defenses"). However, the timeframe itself—the immediate aftermath—does not tighten decisions. Marcus works "hours" with no clock pressure; dawn arrives as a natural endpoint, not a deadline. Setup is immediate (opening paragraph); development is passive (hours pass); payoff is gentle (dawn light). The hush enables reflection but does not force a choice with urgency. Lyric reprise (silence → expectant) reweights tone but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is the story's explicit motivation, dramatized through Marcus's reworking of his puppets and his final decision to bring "uncomfortable humanity" rather than weaponized revelation. The desire is tested against his former success ("The audiences had loved it. The money had followed") and the collaborator's accusation, creating friction between comfort and cost. Setup is clear (paragraph 3 onward); development spans the dome work; payoff is on-page in the stance shift. The motivation shapes every beat and forecloses his prior path. Minor deduction: the phrasing "ethical storytelling" is slightly abstract and prompt-adjacent, reducing the feeling of lived, embodied desire, but the puppet work grounds it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears twice: in paragraph 7 ("The meteor hush of the empty structure felt appropriate") and implicitly in the opening's "uncommonly serene silence" and closing's "less empty now, more expectant." The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (serene → raw → expectant) as Marcus's stance shifts. The hush charges the final image by contrasting the dome's prior tracking function with its current stillness. However, "meteor hush" itself is ornamental—removing it would not break the story's tonal arc. Setup is early; development is consistent; payoff is present in the tonal shift. The phrase is evocative and irreplaceable as idiom, but it does not constrain a choice or impose cost, capping it below 7.0.</comment>
