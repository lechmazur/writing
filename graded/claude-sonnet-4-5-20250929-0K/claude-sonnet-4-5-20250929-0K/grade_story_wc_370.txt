<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iris's empathetic withdrawal is consistently motivated and embodied through concrete choices—crumpling the invitation, avoiding her sister's wedding. The sister wound carries visible cost and drives the library visit. However, the elderly woman's wisdom arrives too quickly without resistance, and Iris's shift from years of avoidance to "learning to stay by choosing when to go" lacks sufficient on-page friction. The final choice to return feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the laundromat at 11:47, and the impossible library architecture provides a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Iris opens the book to "read herself back into the world." The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crumpled invitation, coffee shop recognition, and library descent build density toward the woman's paradox reframing. Cost is legible in Iris's five-year pattern foreclosed by her choice to return. One structural seam: the wedding backstory arrives mid-story rather than anchored early, briefly disrupting forward momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The impossible library—shelves curving into themselves, light from nowhere—provides vivid spatial constraint and charges the closure when Iris takes the blank-covered book. The laundromat fluorescence and coffee-shop reflection ground the opening sensorily. The "Storage" door and descending staircase supply purposeful micro-setting that alters Iris's access to the society. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to be present without drowning in others' feelings—is signaled early and tightens through the crumpled invitation, the coffee-shop threshold, and the woman's reframe. The wedding absence provides one meaningful on-page cost that narrows options. However, the library discovery arrives without sufficient resistance; Iris enters too easily, and the woman's wisdom resolves tension quickly rather than forcing Iris to choose between competing goods with visible friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "compassionate recluse" paradox without sermon. The woman's line "Staying while leaving wasn't your mistake. Your mistake was thinking they were the same thing" reframes prior material through scene particulars. The library as physical nestled-paradox architecture embodies rather than declares theme. The blank book and "You're learning to stay by choosing when to go" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor penalty: "hiding so we're visible" edges toward overt thematic echo in the woman's dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Iris. Perceptual signature—"compassionate distance," noticing customers who "seemed to be waiting without waiting"—is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext in the woman's "not asking" observation and Iris's whispered admission. Two slips: the phrase "enlarged tranquility" reads as authorial rather than Iris's lexicon, and "nestled paradoxes made architectural" shifts into elevated register briefly. Filter verbs ("watching her reflection") remain voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening crumple anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the library description. Two artifact penalties: "People called her kind but unreachable" tells rather than shows in backstory; "devoted while distant" and "staying while leaving" become synonym loops across the wedding paragraph, restating the same concept. The phrase "decades of similar confessions" stacks modifiers without concrete image. No loops touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "secret society for empathetic recluses" premise and impossible-library-in-a-coffee-shop setting offer fresh spatial ingenuity. The transformation of "staying while leaving" into a paradox needing unpacking rather than simple avoidance is a non-obvious angle. However, the wise-elder-dispenses-insight frame and "library as sanctuary" motif lean on familiar templates without sufficient character-specific cost to fully transform them. The closing image—reading herself back—feels earned but not entirely surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iris as compassionate recluse is present from the opening and drives all key beats: crumpling the invitation, recalling the wedding absence, crossing the threshold, and choosing to return. Her empathetic withdrawal shapes the entire narrative arc and the woman's reframe. Removing this trait would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The invitation is crumpled three times in the opening, smoothed on her thigh, touched in her pocket mid-library, and directly referenced in the woman's question. It appears in three distinct beats but functions primarily as a physical anchor rather than constraining a choice with visible cost. Swapping it for another object (letter, card) would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nestled paradoxes shape the library's architecture ("shelves that curved into themselves"), the society's logic ("hiding so we're visible"), and the woman's central reframe distinguishing "staying while leaving." The concept structures the narrative from setup through the final paradox articulation. Removing it would fundamentally break the thematic and physical world-building.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Keen empathy constrains Iris's five-year withdrawal, forces her to hide from "overwhelming static of human proximity," and enables her to send "thoughtful gifts" and know "what others needed before they asked." The trait creates the wedding-absence cost and drives her library question. Visible tradeoffs appear on the page: connection through removal, love through distance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Hiding structures Iris's backstory (avoiding gatherings, ghosting the wedding), the woman's diagnosis ("Everyone here is hiding"), and the society's purpose. It appears across beats and is articulated at closure. However, the action itself is recounted more than dramatized in peak moments, and swapping "hide" for "withdraw" or "retreat" would not fundamentally alter the narrative mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Staying while leaving is established in the opening gifts-and-distance pattern, named explicitly in Iris's wedding reflection, and becomes the story's central paradox when the woman reframes it: "Your mistake was thinking they were the same thing." The method shapes Iris's past tactics and the closure lesson. The woman's final line—"learning to stay by choosing when to go"—turns the method into resolution with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The secret-society library hidden in plain sight provides the entire second-half setting, supplies the impossible architecture that embodies theme, and delivers the woman and blank book that enable closure. The "Storage" door and staircase alter Iris's access to wisdom. Customers "lingering near the back stairwell" in the opening pay off when Iris enters. Removing this setting would collapse the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Midnight is named in the invitation, tracked at 11:47 and 11:53, and arrives on-page at the end. The timeframe creates urgency in the opening and frames the threshold crossing. However, once Iris enters the library, the clock disappears and does not constrain her conversation or choices. The deadline shapes setup but does not tighten tactics in the resolution beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unearthing wisdom in a mistake is dramatized through the wedding absence, voiced explicitly when Iris whispers "To unearth wisdom in a mistake," and resolved when the woman reframes her error. The desire drives the threshold crossing, the library question, and the book-opening closure. Friction appears in Iris's five-year pattern conflicting with her need to reconnect, and cost is visible in the foreclosed avoidance path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Enlarged tranquility appears in the staircase descent description, is embodied in the library's "collective silence that felt like communion," and contrasts purposefully with the fluorescent laundromat hum. The tone modulates from Iris's anxious threshold moment to the calm woman's entrance, supporting the paradox theme. However, the phrase "enlarged tranquility" itself reads as imposed diction rather than emerging from scene pressure, and static calm in the final third reduces tonal range under peak choice.</comment>
