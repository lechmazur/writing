<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction—stubborn commitment to beauty in fog versus recent creative hollowness—drives her choices credibly. The fragment triggers a daydream that shifts her approach from "forced cheer" to organic luminescence, and the final choice to paint the district itself reflects earned insight. Embodied emotion is present ("laughed, surprising herself") but the epiphany moment ("joy wasn't the subject; it was the method") reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis awareness. The renunciation of performative joy and acceptance of mist-bound beauty forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and accumulates pressure through reflection on the fragment, daydream immersion, and the studio mural creation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight crystallization) with felt cost: Mara abandons her prior method and commits to painting fog itself as joy. The final image—ancient dancer seeming to leap again—reweights the fragment's meaning and charges the ending. One meaningful deepening (fragment observation → method shift → new mural plan) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, perpetual fog, and phosphorescent pigments anchor setting vividly and filter through Mara's professional priorities. The fragment propped against the wall becomes a spatial anchor that constrains her perception and shapes the studio mural choice. Sensory hierarchy is strong: "thick fog," "columns" of light, "ghost-shapes of apple blossoms." The studio wall as micro-setting charges the closure when it "blazed" and seemed to move, directly enabling the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rediscovering authentic joy to create a meaningful central-square mural. Pressure tightens when Mara notices the ancient artist "hadn't painted the dancer's joy directly" but captured light and negative space, forcing a method shift. Agency is clear: she paints patterns of light rather than a figure, a decision that narrows options and commits her to a new aesthetic. The cost is legible—abandoning performative happiness and embracing fog itself—though the escalation is more conceptual than urgently physical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—joy as method, not subject; persistence of beauty within constraint—emerges organically from the fragment observation and mural work. The final image (ancient dancer leaping again under fresh mural glow) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "permission to remember" and "living inside joy all along." The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces ambiguity (fog as both obscurer and medium) without confusion. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with stable distance and character-specific perceptual signature: "watching colors emerge," "ghost-shapes of apple blossoms." Diction remains within Mara's artist lexicon; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: short bursts during epiphany ("Of course"), longer sweeps during mural creation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "imagining") are voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the daydream beat ("let her vision soften") and recovers cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or insight). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "cracked like exposed film" anchors the concept; "light dancing across cracked plaster" closes without overwriting. Minor scaffold in "She'd been commissioned to display" (passive efficiency) and "already imagining" (weak nominalizing construction) but neither obscures causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts serve momentum. Zero artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—joy as method/luminescence rather than depicted subject—feels fresh and earned in hindsight. The fresco fragment as permission rather than template transforms a familiar "artist's block" setup. Phosphorescent pigments and fog-as-medium offer specific, non-obvious grounding. The piece commits to its premise (beauty within constraint) without hedging. Risk is moderate: the contemplative structure and daydream hinge are handled cleanly but not boldly unconventional. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the orchard/fog/light trinity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create key turns: propping the fragment triggers the daydream (beat 1), noticing the ancient artist's method shifts her approach (beat 2), and painting the studio wall commits her to the new mural plan (beat 3). Present in setup (first paragraph), development (epiphany), and closure (final image). Causal pressure: her observation narrows options from "performative" to "patterns of light." Irreplaceable: remove her agency and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears in three beats: arrival/unwrapping (setup), propped observation triggering epiphany (development), catching glow and seeming to leap again (closure). It constrains Mara's perception, provides the "permission to remember," and charges the final image. Causal pressure: the fragment's "light falling across the figure" reorients her method. Specificity: the "dancing figure, half-destroyed, caught mid-leap" is irreplaceable. Cost: abandoning performative joy is tied to fragment-derived insight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Exposed film" appears once as simile ("cracked like exposed film left too long in the sun") in paragraph one. It describes the fragment's surface but does not constrain choices, alter tactics, or return with reweighted meaning. Ornamental: the crack pattern could be described otherwise without structural change. No development or closure participation. Present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is established in paragraph two (neighborhood reputation), enacted through phosphorescent pigment mixing (paragraph six), and demonstrated in the studio mural that "blazed" and "seemed to move" (paragraph nine). Constrains method: she uses "phosphorescent blues and greens" and "titanium white" specifically. Enables the closure: the fresh mural's glow reanimates the fragment. Causal pressure: without this technique, the "living inside joy" payoff and final image fail. Three-beat involvement with visible cost (commitment to fog-based luminescence).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Display" is signaled early (commissioned mural for central square, paragraph six) and drives the dominant stake. Development: Mara's method shift alters what she will display (fog itself rendered in luminescence rather than forced cheer). Closure: she imagines the square mural showing neighbors "what she'd rediscovered." Causal: the need to display authentic joy (not performative) forces the epiphany. Swappability: "create" or "unveil" would weaken the public/visibility stakes. Two gates met; closure participation is anticipatory rather than enacted on-page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The knowledge network is introduced in paragraph four (informal system of artists/historians/scavengers who trade information) and delivers the fragment. Setup participation: it explains how the fragment arrived. No middle development: Mara does not consult or use the network again. Closure link: the phrase "permission to remember" (paragraph ten) echoes the network's implicit gift, but the network itself is absent. One-beat causal role (fragment delivery enables the plot) but replaceable with "a dealer" or "salvage find." Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ruined orchard district with centuries of fog appears in paragraph two (setup), filters Mara's perception throughout ("perpetual twilight," "stubbornly insisting beauty could exist"), and the final mural plan (paragraph eleven) commits to painting "their fog, their ruins, their stubborn gardens" in pure luminescence. The fog constrains her method (phosphorescent pigments needed) and supplies the thematic material (beauty within mist). Three-beat involvement: setup, reflection shaping stakes, and closure image. Irreplaceable: remove the fog and the light-painting logic collapses. Causal pressure and cost tied directly to setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears in paragraph five as Mara softens her vision to stand in the ancient orchard. The phrase establishes a reflective mode but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The daydream enables insight ("When had she last felt that?") but time is untracked; she paints "quickly before the daydream faded" (paragraph eight) without urgency affecting tactics. One-beat participation (setup of reflective space) with no middle constraint or closure reprise. Present but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is named in the title of paragraph four's search ("pre-fog examples of joy—real joy") and dramatized through Mara's hollow murals, the daydream question ("When had she last felt that?"), and the epiphany that joy is method, not subject. Development: the fragment observation shifts her from "forced cheer" to organic luminescence. Closure: painting the district itself as joy-within-fog enacts the rediscovery. Friction between wants (authentic expression) and costs (abandoning performative safety) is visible. Three gates met; causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is embodied in Mara's laugh ("surprising herself," paragraph seven) and the bittersweet recognition that joy persists within fog. Tone is coherent: contemplative with flashes of delight (the dancer's "impossible joy," the mural "blazed"). Modulates with pressure: reflective in daydream, energized during painting, resonant at closure when the dancer "seemed to leap again." The final image charges tone without stating it. Two-beat participation (middle epiphany laugh, closure animation) and coherent modulation under accumulative pressure.</comment>
