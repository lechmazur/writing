<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and her gift creates character-specific perception (tasting fear in vegetables, desperation in grains). Internal conflict exists between her celebrated status and feeling hollow, driving the inciting choice. However, the transformation from planting to distributing lacks concrete struggle—weeks pass in summary, and no on-page mistake or genuine cost tests her commitment. The final scene with the girl feels like repetition rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the greenhouse becomes a pattern of restoration, memory-sharing spreads, and the final image reweights the opening ruin with "different future taking root." However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—authorities "eventually noticed" off-page, seeds "had spread," but no on-page price is paid by Mara herself. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a specific sentence where Mara's choice at the ending forecloses a legible option or exacts a visible personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly realized (corroded glass, rust-flaked soil, panels painted gold at sunrise) and recurs across beats to constrain and charge action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional palate (tasting fear, desperation). The celestial alignment and the fruit's purple glow anchor the speculative logic. Spatial choreography remains clear. The greenhouse's transformation from neglect to beauty directly supports the thematic closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's requirement that setting charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara seeks transformation beyond hollow celebrity, risking government prohibition. The planting itself is a meaningful tightening—she acts during the alignment window. However, escalation afterward occurs mostly in summary: "over the following weeks," "eventually noticed," seeds "had spread." No on-page reversal tests her resolve or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The authorities' late awareness is consequence without dramatized pressure. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but cost legibility at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming forbidden knowledge and shared memory emerges organically from concrete action (planting, tasting, teaching) rather than statement. The rusted greenhouse image evolves from neglect to "beauty from ruins," reweighted in the final line without moralizing. Subtext operates in the alignment's symbolism and the fruit's neural plasticity as metaphor for communal consciousness. However, "what they wanted us to forget" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic echo, and the girl's realization—"never been as alone"—borders on therapeutic summary rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtering through Mara's chef-trained perception ("tasting memories," "rust-flaked soil"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate interiority to wider social consequence. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("synaptic plasticity," "consciousness could be shared without being lost") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. The girl's dialogue is brief but functional. Diction under peak pressure (the first bite) stays grounded, though "gently reorganizing her understanding through synaptic plasticity" reads clinical rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong specifics anchor key images: "rust-flaked soil," "skin warm with stored starlight." However, paraphrase loops appear: "not chaotic, but gently reorganizing" / "didn't replace her own but nestled beside them" restate the same reassurance. "Gentle rebellion—not loud, not violent, but persistent" is template cadence. Filter-verb stacks in reflection ("She could taste," "She tasted," "who'd eaten") dull immediacy. The phrase "synaptic plasticity" recurs three times, twice in exposition, creating scaffold rather than drama. Minimal but measurable drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The banned-knowledge-fruit and memory-sharing via food combines speculative and culinary elements in a purposeful way. The celestial alignment timing and grandmother's legacy add mythic texture. However, the core premise—forbidden fruit that restores suppressed collective memory, spreading via underground network—closely follows resistance-narrative templates without a sharp transformative angle. The grandmother's whispered wisdom, the rusted-place-restored, and seeds-spreading-to-other-gardens are familiar beats. Execution is competent, but the synthesis feels more assembled than inevitable. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes beyond the expected arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chef Mara's ability to taste memories is present from the opening, motivates her hollow dissatisfaction (tasting fear/desperation in commercial food), and enables her to understand the knowledge fruit's embedded stories. Her choice to plant, taste, and distribute turns the plot. The trait appears in setup, middle (tasting the fruit), and implicitly at closure (teaching others to taste stories). However, the gift itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it facilitates but does not complicate. Strong causal role across beats but lacks on-page friction tied specifically to this ability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is handled in multiple beats: Mara holds it in the opening, plants it during the alignment, the tree grows and bears fruit, she tastes one, then distributes pieces over weeks, and seeds spread to other greenhouses by the end. It shapes the inciting action, the middle transformation, and the closure's spread. The object's specificity (banned, alignment-dependent, memory-bearing) is irreplaceable. However, after the initial planting and tasting, its later proliferation is summarized rather than dramatized in distinct beats. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with high causal pressure, but the final-third handling is略 more ornamental than active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" is named explicitly ("Her greenhouse became a gentle rebellion—not loud, not violent, but persistent") and demonstrated through Mara's quiet, nocturnal distribution and teaching. It shapes tactics: she shares "quietly," people arrive "in the dark hours," and the spread is covert. The concept frames the dominant stake and alters closure—by the end, "you couldn't arrest everyone." However, the phrase itself appears as a label rather than emerging purely from action, and the rebellion's gentleness is told more than tested under pressure. Functional across beats but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Informally wise" is attributed to the grandmother in backstory: "informally wise in the way of people who trusted their hands more than books." This trait justifies her counter-cultural knowledge and seed-preservation, enabling the inciting premise. However, the grandmother appears only in memory; Mara herself does not display or enact informal wisdom in a way that constrains an on-page choice. The attribute is setup-only, shaping backstory motivation but not present in middle development or closure. Functional but replaceable with "rebel elder" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pruning appears twice: Mara prunes the tree "carefully, shaping it not for maximum yield but for beauty and sustainability" in the middle section, and returns to pruning in the final line, "shaping beauty one careful cut at a time." The action metaphorically encodes her philosophy (restraint, sustainability, beauty over exploitation) and bookends the narrative. However, no major plot turn hinges on pruning—she could tend, harvest, or cultivate with similar effect. The closure reprise reweights the opening's neglect, but the action itself does not narrow options or enable a unique tactic. Lyric resonance without strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is named three times: in the opening exposition (fruit's property allows neural restructuring), after Mara bites ("gently reorganizing her understanding through synaptic plasticity"), and implied in others' transformations. The mechanism is explained but not dramatized—readers do not see the neural process constrain or enable a specific choice. It functions as world-building flavor rather than a tactical element. The means is signaled in setup but does not shape attempts or complicate escalation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is present in setup (opening line), development (Mara plants and tends there, "restored plants she'd slowly coaxed back to life"), and closure (final scene with the girl; "here in the rust and regeneration"). Its physical state—corroded glass, rust-flaked soil—anchors the transformation motif. The setting provides both concealment (nocturnal visits) and symbolic charge (ruin to beauty). Spatial details like the celestial alignment visible through glass panels tie environment to action. The greenhouse's decay and restoration directly enable and metaphorically charge the ending. Essential across all three gates with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is present in setup (grandmother's instruction, "tonight was different"), triggers the planting at the opening climax ("as the alignment reached its apex"), and the seed "sprouted immediately" because of it. However, after the first scene, the alignment ends ("The alignment was over, but something had shifted") and does not constrain later choices. No clock pressure tightens Mara's middle or final decisions. The timeframe enables the inciting beat but does not shape tactics across the arc. Functional for one turn, then absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"To create something beautiful from what they tried to destroy" is voiced by the grandmother in backstory, echoed when Mara plants ("make something beautiful"), demonstrated through pruning "for beauty and sustainability," and crystallized in the girl's arrival: "you're making something beautiful from the ruins." The motivation drives Mara's planting choice and her teaching method. However, no on-page moment shows this desire in friction with cost—she does not sacrifice yield for beauty in a way that risks failure, nor does she face a trade-off between beauty and safety. The desire is consistent and thematic but not conflicted in action. Present across all gates with closure linkage, but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>
