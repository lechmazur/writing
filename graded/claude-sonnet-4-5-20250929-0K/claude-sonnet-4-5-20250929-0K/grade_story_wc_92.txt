<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shows purpose-driven detail (seven years of reading body language, tactical delays) and her transformation from sentinel to revolutionary is coherent. However, much of her motivation is told rather than tested on the page—she moves through the workshop with practiced ease but faces no meaningful internal conflict or cost in the present scene. The "smallest smile in the darkness" closes without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and Voss's ease ("His tension eased") arrives without friction. The revolution is declared complete before we see Maren struggle with a single trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (vigilant lock sentinel, workshop, blackout). The Drive Lens reads as Causal with mild Situational coloring: the blackout was planned, Maren prepared the sundial, and the revolution unfolds as rehearsed. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the final image ("sparks of change began to glow") recaps the setup rather than altering options. The closure lacks visible cost: Maren smiles, others move with purpose, and the revolution proceeds on schedule. The piece ends in Charged Poise framing, but the stakes are asserted rather than tested, and no live path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, blackened corridors, and workshop are grounded early. The phosphorescent paint (harvested from the cradle of sparks) constrains the method and charges the final image—messages glow only in darkness, tying setting to tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (Maren moves through corridors, Voss steps into the workshop). Minor deduction: the "cradle of sparks" grove is introduced mid-story as exposition rather than discovered through action, briefly stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spark a silent revolution via the coded sundial—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Voss's arrival could complicate but instead he confirms he's an ally ("We disabled the backup systems ourselves"), deflating the only potential reversal. The blackout, presented as dangerous subterfuge, becomes a scheduled three-hour window with no on-page friction. Maren's agency is decision (finishing the sundial, distributing messages), but the cost is deferred off-page. No live option is foreclosed; the revolution proceeds as planned without a visible price paid in this scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, persistent resistance emerges through the phosphorescent paint metaphor and the sundial's transformation from ornament to map. "Words are the finest lockpicks" and "some doors need to be unlocked from the inside" integrate with Maren's role. The final image—"sparks of change began to glow"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. Deduction: the theme is articulated rather than discovered ("The revolution won't be loud…quiet, persistent, impossible to extinguish"), and the ending summary ("prepared to transform") feels stated rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Maren's perceptions (trailing fingers, reading Voss's shadow shifts). Voice carries purposeful diction ("conspirator's cloak," "winking hush") and the dialogue distinguishes Maren's calm replies from Voss's knowing tone. Minor deduction: free indirect thought occasionally over-explains on-page action ("Each key she copied…had been calculated") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the ending beat. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening beats (lamp death, practiced movement, bronze quill holder positioned). Clarity is strong throughout. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "luminous fort…white stone walls glowing" restates the title image, and "quiet, persistent, impossible to extinguish" in dialogue is echoed by "sparks of change began to glow" in narration. The final two paragraphs recycle "darkness" and "glow" without adding new pressure. No grammatical errors; propulsion is steady but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The coded sundial as revolutionary tool and phosphorescent paint from lightning-struck trees offer specific, non-generic angles. The premise—vigilant sentinel as quiet revolutionary—has a fresh irony. However, the "silent revolution" framing and "sparks spread through darkness" metaphor follow familiar template arcs. The blackout as cover and the ally-reveal follow predictable beats. Transformation test: the emotional arc (preparedness → execution → satisfied closure) could transfer to other settings with minor edits. No close proximity to famous material, but the synthesis leans toward the median middle rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren ("vigilant lock sentinel") is on the page throughout and her choices shape all major beats: she strikes the match to study the sundial, applies the luminous paint, and decides to distribute the glowing maps. Her role as sentinel turned revolutionary drives the premise. However, her decisions do not create reversals or escalating cost—she executes a prepared plan with Voss's confirmation of allyship removing the only potential obstacle. The trait shapes tactics (using her position to pass messages, copy keys) but these are recounted rather than dramatized. Present in closure but without a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in two distinct beats: positioned beside the sundial in the workshop (setup), then lifted at the end with mentor backstory ("quills could unlock doors that keys never would"). It returns with thematic reweighting (words as lockpicks). However, its use is static description—Maren dips a quill from it to apply paint, but the holder itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It could be replaced with any paint-delivery method without structural loss. The lyric reprise elevates it slightly but it remains swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" is the grove where lightning struck trees, leaving them phosphorescent; the paint harvested from there enables the glowing coded messages. It shapes the method (paint only reveals in darkness) and ties to the ending metaphor ("sparks of change began to glow"). Introduced in the middle third as exposition ("harvested from the cradle of sparks—that mysterious grove…") rather than discovered through action. It provides a resource but does not constrain a choice or create a trade-off. Present in closure thematically but could be replaced with any luminescent substance with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" describes Maren's approach in one sentence: "Maren had been calmly inventive in her resistance." Her calm is shown (doesn't startle at Voss's voice, hands steady while painting) and her inventiveness is demonstrated (coded sundial design, using locks to pass messages). However, the trait does not create visible cost or constrain a choice—her calm never wavers and her inventiveness succeeds without friction. It characterizes behavior but does not force a trade-off. Functional but replaceable with "methodical" or "strategic."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intrigue" appears as verb and implied action: Maren "used her position to intrigue others, to identify allies." It drives the middle backstory (copying keys, leaving corridors unsealed, delayed reports) that built the network. However, the intriguing itself is summarized rather than dramatized. The present-scene action centers on finishing and distributing the sundial, not active intrigue. The element shaped the setup but does not create a turn in the present beats. Swappable with "recruit" or "persuade" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coded angles in the half-painted sundial are central: Maren studies them in the match-flare, applies luminous paint to complete the pattern, and the glowing angles transform into "blazing instructions" and "a map" in darkness. The method is signaled early (half-painted sundial beside the quill holder), its mechanics matter (paint reveals only in darkness, angles spell meeting times and routes), and it drives the climax (distribution throughout the fort). It could not be replaced without breaking the story's logic. The sundial's dual function (gift façade, revolutionary map) is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" frames the opening image (white stone walls glowing with final light) and closes with internal transformation ("luminous no longer from without but from within"). The fort as prison for progressive thought provides the antagonistic pressure. The blackout plunges corridors into darkness, enabling Maren's movement and the paint's revelation. Setting pressures choices (darkness required for messages, Maren's familiarity with corridors) and the twilight-to-internal-light arc charges the ending. However, much of the fort's oppressive history is told rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is the inciting event (every lamp and torch dies simultaneously) and Voss provides the ticking clock: "The blackout will last three hours." The darkness enables the luminous paint's revelation and constrains the window for distribution. Time pressure is explicit ("Then we have time to distribute these") and shapes tactics. However, the three-hour window is announced rather than felt—no urgency or countdown tightens the scene. The blackout participates in setup, middle, and closure but the temporal constraint does not escalate or force a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to spark a silent revolution"—is stated explicitly and drives her seven-year preparation (identifying allies, copying keys, crafting the sundial). It shapes the central conflict and the ending ("sparks of change began to glow"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction: Maren never wavers, doubts, or weighs a competing want. No cost is paid on the page to pursue the revolution. The motivation is coherent and essential but lacks on-page struggle or visible sacrifice in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Winking hush" describes Voss's voice ("that winking hush he used when he knew more than he pretended") and colors the tone of covert action and knowing complicity. The quiet, conspiratorial atmosphere is sustained (darkness as "conspirator's cloak," footsteps echoing, the revolution spreading quietly). Tone modulates slightly from vigilant tension (Maren waiting in darkness) to satisfied resolve (the smallest smile). However, "winking hush" as a specific tonal signature appears only in Voss's tag and does not permeate the narrative voice or charge the final image directly. Functional accent but not indispensable.</comment>
