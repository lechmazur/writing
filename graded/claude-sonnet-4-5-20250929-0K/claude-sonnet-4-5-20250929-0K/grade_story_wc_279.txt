<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moth's social perceptiveness is shown through concrete sensory experiences ("taste their panic as addresses dissolved"), and her decision to create mandalas demonstrates agency under the unlearning pressure. The old man's hollow eyes and unlearned profession provide embodied emotion. However, the gathering crowd lacks individual differentiation, and Moth's internal contradiction remains understated—she moves through her art-making without visible struggle or competing impulses that would deepen her stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the mandala's creation, the tile flake's warming, and the crowd's gathering, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where "the place where meaning lived, waiting to be remembered" crystallizes with conceptual cost (memories remain lost, but a framework emerges). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The escalation from solitary drawing to collective witnessing provides one meaningful deepening, and the cost—continued forgetting offset by discovered structure—is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's cupped-palm acoustics and dark pool create spatial grounding; the limestone floor becomes a functional canvas that constrains Moth's medium. The mist's lilac cast evolves from "unease" to "almost sacred," tracking emotional progression. The tile flake functions as micro-setting, pressed to her temple to sense memory-shapes, then warming at closure to charge the final moment. Thewhispering gallery fragment's acoustic properties directly enable her perceptive gift and shape the climactic collective attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning amid erasure—is signaled in the opening and tightens when the old man gasps at proto-memories in the pattern, then deepens as the crowd forms an "emergent hush" of collective attention. Moth's agency drives escalation: she chooses to draw, to continue layering despite the gathering observers, and her tile-flake use intensifies from individual sensing to catalyzing group resonance. The cost is visible—memories remain unlearned, but a "framework that could hold memory" emerges as earned compensation, not solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of meaning-making through pattern emerges from concrete particulars: the chalk mandalas, the tile flake's resonance, the crowd's shared attention. The final image—"not meaning itself, but the place where meaning lived"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "you were someone, you loved someone, you meant something" edges toward stated reassurance rather than purely embodied discovery, and the shift from "lilac unease" to "almost sacred" resolves tension somewhat tidily for the complexity of ongoing erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "memories flaking away like old paint," "meaning-wheel" as reinvented vocabulary, sensory details filtered through Moth's social perception ("taste their panic"). The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-appropriate. Diction stays consistent with Moth's artistic, perceptive lens. One minor slip: "the idea of faces, the echo of recognition" in the mandala description momentarily abstracts where concrete imagery would serve POV better, but it doesn't break distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings diversify. "She'd unlearned her birth name three weeks ago along with her address, her mother's face, and the taste of honey" demonstrates strong specificity and information density. However, several minor artifacts accumulate: "the mist and the forgetting" pairs abstract with concrete awkwardly; "an emergent hush fell over them—not the hush of silence, but of collective attention" is a paraphrase loop that restates rather than advances; "whimsical marks" in a high-pressure beat feels register-mismatched. Propulsion remains strong overall, but these slips prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The unlearning premise and the chalk-artist response offer a specific synthesis, and the tile flake from a demolished whispering gallery provides a fresh material anchor. The mandala as "meaning-wheel"—reinvented language reflecting cognitive erosion—shows thoughtful integration. However, the emotional arc of collective healing through art, and the artist-as-conduit-for-shared-trauma frame, follow familiar templates. The ending's affirmation ("you were someone, you loved someone") retreats slightly from the premise's harder implications, choosing comfort over full conceptual risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moth appears in the opening, drives the middle mandala-creation, and continues drawing at closure. Her choice to begin drawing, to use the tile flake, and to invite the old man all create key turns. The final "She smiled and kept drawing" shows sustained agency. However, the whimsical modifier in "whimsical marks" feels ornamental rather than integral to her characterization or choices—swappable with "intuitive" or "spontaneous" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tile flake appears early (paragraph 3), is pressed to Moth's temple to sense memory-shapes (paragraph 4), reappears as she draws (paragraph 7: "pressed the tile flake to her forehead"), and grows warm at closure (paragraph 13). Its whispering-gallery provenance and resonance properties enable her social perception and drive the mandala's effectiveness. Removing it would eliminate the mechanism linking her gift to the grotto's acoustics. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The emergent hush appears explicitly at the story's center (paragraph 10: "an emergent hush fell over them") and shapes the collective stake—the crowd's shared attention creates the framework for meaning. However, "emergent" as descriptor rather than enacted process limits its causal pressure. The hush functions more as atmosphere confirming Moth's success than as a force that alters her tactics or choices. Present in closure participation (the hush transforms into music), but the concept's mechanics remain soft.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moth's social perception is seeded early ("socially perceptive by nature," paragraph 4) and demonstrated through concrete beats: tasting the cashier's grip on a daughter's name, feeling the old man's professional loss. It enables her mandala-making by letting her sense "the shape of things people were trying not to forget." However, no visible tradeoff or cost accompanies this gift—it functions as pure advantage without constraint. The trait shapes her method but doesn't force a difficult choice or limit her options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Don't speak it," Moth interjected quickly. "Just feel it. That's the point." This interjection (paragraph 9) prevents the old man from voicing and thus losing his proto-memory, establishing the stakes and rules: silence preserves, speech erases. The action redirects both the old man's behavior and the reader's understanding of the unlearning mechanics. It creates the condition for the crowd's emergent hush. Removing this beat would require significant rewrite to establish why collective silence matters. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala method is signaled early (paragraph 5: "concentric circles radiating outward, filled with intricate geometries"), governs Moth's middle attempts (paragraph 6: lines curve in unplanned ways; paragraph 7: "spirals, faces seemed to surface"), and delivers the closure payoff (paragraph 12: "a framework that could hold memory"). The mandala's visual-pattern mechanics enable the story's central discovery. Her hands moving through chalk pressure is the story's spine; no other method would preserve the tactile, visual, and collective elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is named in the opening line, its acoustics explained (paragraph 2: "natural acoustics that carried whispers across impossible distances"), and its dark pool provides the drawing site. The grotto's whispering properties amplify the tile flake's resonance and justify the crowd's instinctive gathering. At closure, "The grotto's ancient acoustics caught their breathing and transformed it into music." The setting's acoustic constraint enables the collective hush and meaning-discovery; a neutral gallery would not provide this amplification.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The unlearning is established in the opening (paragraph 1: "three weeks ago"; paragraph 2: "happening to everyone now") and saturates the entire story as the pressure source. It drives Moth's art-making, the old man's loss, and the crowd's gathering. The timeframe operates as continuous present crisis rather than a ticking clock, but its ongoing nature tightens every choice—each memory could vanish mid-sentence. The ending's "waiting to be remembered again" acknowledges the unlearning's persistence. Pervasive and structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Moth's stated goal (paragraph 4: "decided to search through art"; paragraph 8 to the old man: "Looking for what we've lost") drives her scene choices: kneeling at the pool, drawing the mandala, inviting the old man, continuing despite the crowd. The motivation faces implicit friction—meaning may be irrecoverable, and her art could fail—but the text doesn't dramatize doubt or competing desires. The final "Moth had found it" fulfills the motivation cleanly. Visible in choices, modest friction, clear payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lilac unease is anchored in the opening line ("dawn mist turned the air lilac with unease") and modulates at closure (paragraph 11: "The mist thickened, turning the lilac unease into something almost sacred"). The color-emotion pairing tracks the shift from solitary anxiety to collective reverence. However, "lilac" as descriptor appears only twice and doesn't permeate intervening beats; the tone work is carried more by "whispers," "hush," and acoustic imagery. The final modulation charges the ending but the chromatic motif itself remains light.</comment>
