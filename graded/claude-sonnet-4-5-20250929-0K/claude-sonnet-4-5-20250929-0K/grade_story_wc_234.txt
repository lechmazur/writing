<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Solène's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is established early and drives her revaluation project, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("the weight of a moment," "texture of this twilight") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of pressing the sphere into Mira's palm carries cost (risking rejection by the Academy), but the decision feels more like thesis demonstration than genuine struggle between competing goods. Mira functions primarily as audience for exposition rather than applying independent pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("doubt and hope braided together") but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines and maintains single-POV coherence in one continuous scene. Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece deepens through layered metaphor (nautilus spiral = growth = memory) and the final sphere-gift reconfigures the Academy conflict from rejection to testimony, carrying felt relational cost. The cost is legible in Mira's warning ("they'll call this heresy") and Solène's acceptance of transformation ("I'll be someone different"). However, the tightening is more thematic restatement than causal pressure—no live option is foreclosed on the page, only an off-stage future consequence is accepted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus, nautilus shell, and workbench tools anchor the scene with selective sensory detail (copper light, pearlescent interior, glowing apparatus). The shell's columella curl functions as both measurement standard and thematic bridge, constraining Solène's technique ("each chamber a precise measurement"). The twilight setting charges the final image ("twilight's particular melancholy and promise"), meeting the 9+ gate criteria. Spatial choreography is clean (Mira's shadow falls across notes, sphere pressed into palm). Minor issue: "scientifically romantic" drifts toward label rather than lived-in occupational texture, but the core setting work is strong.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving light can be testimony rather than commodity—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens through Solène's demonstration to Mira, but escalation is conceptual (explaining her revaluation) rather than a live choice under pressure. The sphere-gift in the final beat offers a stance crystallization (accepting heresy risk), yet no on-page event forces the decision; she was always going to complete this work. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but mild—thematic intensification without a trade-off that narrows options. Cost is legible in future consequences but not dramatized as a present forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (presence vs. commodity, revaluation of knowledge) emerges organically from the pocket-sun technique and nautilus geometry rather than stated moral. The final sphere image ("testimony") reconfigures prior material without didacticism. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when Solène articulates "I want to revalue everything they taught me" and "light can be more than commodity—it can be testimony," making the conceptual frame too explicit. The nautilus spiral as metaphor (growth = memory) is purposeful but slightly over-determined by the etched formulae. Subtext operates in Mira's silences and the "secret between them" intimacy, lifting the work above pure exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, filtering through Solène's precision and reverence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity," "密度 of actually being here") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is functional but stilted ("Tell me what you've really been doing all this time" / "I've been trying to capture the density of presence")—characters speak thesis rather than pursuing goals with indirection. The prose has textural ambition (lyric cadences, image clusters) but the perceptual signature is generic alchemist-scholar rather than a distinct mind under pressure. Purposeful compression in the twilight imagery works, but the philosophical register undercuts immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("mathematical poem written in calcium and memory," "testimony," "texture of doubt and hope braided together"), creating lyric texture but also overwriting in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. Paraphrase loop present: "the weight of a moment—the way this exact configuration of particles and feeling will never exist again" restates "density of presence" from prior lines without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: repeated "I've been" / "I want" / "I'll be" stems across Solène's dialogue (−0.4). Scaffold: "scientifically romantic in its precision" and "directed spontaneity" read as ornamental intensifiers. Mixed metaphor: "palette of resolve" (visual tool) applied to abstract determination. Stock phrase: "intimate as breath." Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (image + theme) but some merely restate. Overall, the prose is ambitious but cluttered in peak moments, preventing clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemy premise and the revaluation-through-return frame offer a fresh synthesis of craft, science, and intimacy. The nautilus shell as measurement standard bridges math and memory in a non-obvious way. However, the mentor-returns-transformed arc and the Academy-as-unfeeling-institution setup are familiar genre moves. Emotional specificity is present in the Solène/Mira bond ("the weight of all their shared years") but not deeply particularized—we see reverence and confession, not contradictory history. The "light as testimony" thesis is philosophically coherent but arrives through exposition rather than an earned turn. Transformation test: the core emotional arc (artist rejects institution's values, shares secret with friend) could transfer to other crafts with minor edits. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, earning mid-band credit, but lacks the bold risk or singular inflection that would elevate originality into the high 7s or 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Solène's choices (measuring amber, etching formulae, combining elements, pressing sphere into Mira's palm) drive the single continuous scene. She decides to confess her revaluation project and to gift the sphere, altering the relational dynamic. However, no key turn hinges on a difficult Solène decision under pressure—she executes a plan already formed. Present in setup (opening), development (creation demonstration), and payoff (sphere-gift). Causal role in one major beat (the gift), but swappable with another alchemist archetype without breaking logic. Band: functional, shapes one key choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl appears in setup (opening paragraph: "fingers tracing"), development (etched formulae as measurement standard), and payoff (implicit in the spiral geometry of the final spheres). It constrains Solène's technique ("ancient geometry a bridge") and charges thematic resonance (growth = memory). Handled on the page twice (traced, turned to reveal etchings), with reweighted meaning at closure (spiral echoed in sphere depths). Specific enough that a generic shell would not carry the same mathematical precision. Minor gap: the shell is more thematic anchor than tactical constraint—removing it would weaken resonance but not break plot. Band: essential across beats, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" is mentioned once as a label ("her palette of resolve evident in every precise gesture") without dramatizing how a range of resolve-states constrains choices. The concept is thematically present (Solène's determination to revalue) but does not shape on-page tactics or alter options under pressure. No early signal, no development beat where resolve-as-palette matters, ornamental mention only. Band: functional but decorative, replaceable with "determination" or "conviction."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" appears as a descriptor for the sphere's luminescence ("scientifically romantic in its precision") but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. The attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice where precision and romance pull in opposing directions. Present in setup (implicit in opening craft description) and payoff (sphere glow), but no development beat where the tension between modes forces a trade-off. Band: functional, logically consistent, but swappable with "precise yet evocative" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Revalue is the story's central action (Solène revalues light from commodity to testimony, reinterprets Academy training). It shapes the dominant stake and the final gift ("revaluing light, returning to old knowledge through a new door"). Present in setup (implied in opening craft), development (confession to Mira: "I want to revalue everything they taught me"), and payoff (sphere as proof of revaluation). However, the action is more thematic frame than causal lever—no scene turn traces directly to an act of revaluation; it is the ongoing project, not a discrete choice. Swapping "revalue" for "transform" or "reinterpret" would require only minor edits. Band: shapes one key turn (the confession), contributes to ending charge, but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is signaled early ("I must return differently than I left") and frames the closure stance ("When I return to the Academy, I'll be someone different"). The method shapes Solène's internal arc (transformation through presence and attention) but does not constrain on-page tactics—no scene choice depends on *how* she returns differently. Present in setup (opening dialogue) and payoff (final resolve), minimal middle development. The means is more philosophical posture than mechanical lever. Band: functional reprise, shapes ending stance, but easily swappable with "by transforming what I learned" without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight anchors the scene (copper light, perpetual flame) and charges the final image ("twilight's particular melancholy and promise"). Present in setup (opening line), development (reflected in sphere depths), and payoff (final paragraph: "In the ember nexus's perpetual flame"). The setting supplies the light resource Solène manipulates and the twilight time pressure (implicit liminal moment). However, spatial setting does not alter tactics—the work could occur in any alchemist's workshop. Micro-setting (workbench, nautilus shell) does more constraint work than the nexus itself. Band: essential across beats, contributes to ending charge, but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the moment a secret is whispered between friends" is enacted on the page: Mira asks, Solène confesses her true project, and the intimacy tightens stakes (risk of misunderstanding, Academy rejection). Present in setup (Mira's entrance and question), development (the whispered confession: "Tell me," "the words forming a secret between them"), and payoff (sphere-gift seals the shared knowledge). The temporal frame shapes the relational cost (this exact window of vulnerability) and charges the closure image. Time is tracked cleanly within the single scene. The secret-whisper constrains Solène's choice to gift the sphere (trusting Mira with heresy). Band: essential across beats, strong closure linkage, visible cost tied to the moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is Solène's stated motivation (confessed to Mira) and drives her seven-year project. Present in setup (implicit in opening craft reverence), development (articulated: "I've been trying to capture the density of presence"), and payoff (spheres hold "the immeasurable weight of being truly, completely here"). However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page beat shows Solène struggling between capturing presence and another competing want. Friction is asserted ("doubt and hope braided together") but not enacted through contradictory impulses in a choice moment. Band: shapes one key turn (the confession), contributes to ending, but swappable with "preserve lived moments" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" as tone is harder to isolate. The prose carries purposeful lyricism (controlled metaphor clusters, measured philosophical beats) but does not modulate sharply with pressure—emotional intensity stays relatively even from opening reverence through confession to final resolve. The phrase "directed spontaneity" appears once as a character attribute ("Solène replied with directed spontaneity"), feeling more like a label than a tonal shift. Tone is coherent (contemplative, lyric-scholarly) but static rather than charging the final image through cadence break. Present implicitly but not taught or paid off as a tonal strategy. Band: functional mood, minimal development, does not constrain or elevate closure.</comment>
