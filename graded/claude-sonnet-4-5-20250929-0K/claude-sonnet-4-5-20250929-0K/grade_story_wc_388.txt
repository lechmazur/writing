<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and her observational trait drives action, but her interior life remains somewhat flat—she moves through the investigation without meaningful internal contradiction or cost until the very end. The final choice to protect the coordinates shows character evolution, but the path there feels more procedural than psychologically fraught. Embodied emotion is minimal; her steadiness under pressure reads competent but lacks the visceral struggle that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: Vera investigates → finds shredded documents → reassembles them → discovers the diamond → chooses to protect it. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the debunker becomes guardian) with visible cost (she'll publish findings but obscure coordinates, compromising her pure-truth mission). Orientation is clean, the lens is causal throughout, and the final turn reweights her stance. Minor deduction for the ease of the excavation—someone tried to hide evidence but left soil "still loose," softening the discovery's earned quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vivid and purposeful: "luminous fruit against gray sky," radioactive dust, Geiger counter clicks. The setting directly enables the mystery (trees thriving in poison) and the diamond's burial here is causally motivated. The soil looseness and the steel container are concrete anchors. Minor gap: the orchard's spatial layout and Vera's movement through it remain somewhat abstract—we don't feel the roots, the distance between trees, or how the "oldest tree" is identified beyond assertion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the orchard—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure tightens when Vera finds shredded documents (someone is hiding evidence), escalates with the reassembly revealing coordinates, and peaks with the dig. The final choice to protect the location creates a visible trade-off: truth versus hope, debunking versus guardianship. The escalation is linear and competent, but the discovery itself faces little resistance—the diamond is simply there, six feet down, with no complications or second reversal to test her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: "Some truths needed excavating. Others needed guardians." The flawed diamond functions as more than symbol—it's a concrete object whose imperfection creates unexpected good, paralleling Vera's shift from exposing all lies to preserving useful mysteries. The final image reweights the opening: she debunks the curse but leaves the miracle intact, a non-literal answer that carries conceptual cost (her professional identity bends). No explicit moralizing; the resonance arises from the particulars of the investigation and the diamond's dual nature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, professional, and controlled: "Vera dealt in neither" (curses/miracles), "Beautiful nonsense," "uncomfortable truth." The focalization remains tightly Vera's; no head-hopping, and psychic distance is stable. Minor weakness: sentence rhythm becomes somewhat uniform in the middle investigation beats—many declarative subject-verb constructions in sequence. Diction fits the character (scientific, skeptical) but occasionally drifts toward generic narration ("sharp observant eye") rather than showing how her observation differs from others'. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and efficient with strong momentum through the investigation. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances discovery or characterization. Minor issues: "sharply observant eye" is a stock phrase; "steel container about the size of a shoebox" uses an unmotivated simile that slightly softens the scene's texture. The phrase "comfortable lies" appears twice verbatim (opening and closing), which reads intentional but borders on loop. Sentence openings vary adequately, though several middle paragraphs begin with "She" or "Vera" in close succession. No major artifacts, but the prose doesn't achieve the rhythmic precision or figurative originality required for the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—debunker finds scientific miracle, chooses selective silence—is a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic survival and epistemological ethics. The flawed diamond creating a "stillpoint" is conceptually neat and specific, avoiding generic mysticism. Vera's profession (conspiracy debunker) adds a non-obvious angle: her crisis is vocational, not survival-based. Slight derivative pressure: the "cursed object is actually science" reveal echoes common tropes, though the guardian reversal elevates it. The ending resists the obvious paths (exposing everything or destroying evidence), landing on a nuanced middle that feels earned rather than hedged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's role as conspiracy debunker frames her motivation and approach (pattern recognition, methodical evidence gathering). The trait drives her to investigate rather than accept local myths, and her final decision—publishing findings but obscuring coordinates—is a direct reversal of her professional stance. Present in setup (trade and obsession), middle (reassembly work), and closure (selective truth-telling). Deduction: the debunking itself happens off-page; we see investigation and discovery but not the active dismantling of a conspiracy, which slightly softens the occupational specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in the myth (first third), drives the search via reassembled coordinates (middle), and is physically uncovered and reburied in the climax, directly shaping Vera's final choice. Its specific property—imperfection creating a stillpoint—is irreplaceable; a perfect diamond wouldn't create the pocket of life. The element carries conceptual cost: Vera protects it to preserve hope, bending her truth-mission. Minor gap: the diamond's physical interaction is brief (cleared, observed, reburied); more tactile engagement or a second beat where its presence alters her thinking would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "hidden stillpoint" is the story's engine: it explains the thriving orchard, motivates Vera's investigation, and reframes the curse narrative as accidental science. The concept is signaled early (local myth), explored through document reassembly (containment failure, stable zone), and resolved when Vera finds and protects the source. It shapes stakes (why does life persist here?) and the final thematic turn (flawed stability versus perfect truth). The stillpoint's mechanics—diamond lattice creating normalcy—are specific and irreplaceable, driving both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is present throughout: Vera examines soil fragments, recognizes shredded documents, reassembles paper pieces methodically, takes surveying measurements. The trait enables her success—pattern recognition is explicitly named as her gift. However, the attribute is more label than constraint: observation never costs her anything or creates a tradeoff. No moment where her focus on one detail blinds her to another, or where seeing too much complicates rather than clarifies. The trait functions but remains consequence-free.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears explicitly ("she'd learned to intuit the kernels of truth") and drives the investigation's logic: Vera senses truth buried in myths, infers the stillpoint's location from fragments, and feels the diamond's effect ("not mystically, but as an absence"). The action is present in setup (her method), middle (assembling narrative from pieces), and closure (intuiting what to protect). Deduction: the intuition is never wrong or tested—she finds what she seeks without false leads. A moment where intuition misleads, forcing recalibration, would demonstrate irreplaceability more strongly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is the story's central method, occupying substantial middle space: Vera collects fragments, uses clips and weights against wind, works for an hour, and reconstructs the narrative piece by piece ("Project Stillpoint... containment failure... diamond matrix... burial coordinates"). The mechanics are specific and shape the investigation—pattern recognition is her gift, and the physical act grounds the discovery. The method's success directly enables the climax (coordinates lead to the dig). Strong integration; only minor friction: the fragments reveal exactly what's needed with no ambiguity or missing pieces, slightly softening the method's constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is indispensable: thriving trees amid radioactive dust create the central mystery, the Geiger counter provides constant pressure (clicking at her hip), and the orchard's existence post-liquidation frames the entire investigation. The setting supplies both problem (why life here?) and solution (roots reaching the stillpoint). Vera's discovery location (beneath the oldest tree where fragments were found) is spatially motivated. The environment constrains choice—she digs where the evidence and coordinates converge—and charges the final image (walking back through thriving trees, leaving "comfortable lies behind"). Setting is fully weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the timeline in the opening and explains why the orchard attracted attention (three years of inexplicable growth post-government collapse). The timeframe contextualizes the shredded documents (recent attempt to hide evidence by a surviving scientist) and the wasteland state. However, the liquidation itself doesn't tighten Vera's decisions—no ticking clock, no urgency beyond her own drive. The element provides historical context and explains the orchard's significance but doesn't pressure tactics or escalate stakes in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera's drive to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated early ("by trade and obsession") and demonstrated through her investigation—she rejects curse narratives, pursues evidence, and reconstructs the scientific accident. The motivation shapes her approach (methodical, skeptical) and creates the story's central friction: at closure, she chooses to protect a "comfortable lie" (the miracle) while revealing the truth (the science), a direct collision between her stated mission and pragmatic compassion. The conflict between wants (pure truth) and cost (destroying hope) is dramatized in her final choice to obscure coordinates. Minor gap: the internal struggle during that choice is told more than embodied.</comment>
