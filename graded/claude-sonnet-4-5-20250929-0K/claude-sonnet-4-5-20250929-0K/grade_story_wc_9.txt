<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer's interior life is vivid and embodied—trembling fingers, gasps, burned throat—and her internal contradiction (stealing time while seeking repentance) drives the arc. The pivot from card-reader to present mother is earned by the glade revelation and the cloth-tracing ritual. However, the phrase "willingly perplexed" reads as a prompt label rather than dramatized uncertainty, and the epiphany about "ghosts of connection" tilts slightly toward articulated insight rather than pure discovery. Micro-choices (checking her phone in the hospital vision, repeated hand-tracing) anchor the change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift—who, where, when by the opening paragraph—and the causal spine is clear: she ascends to account for stolen time, sees the cost in three card-windows, and chooses to descend with a promise. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she renounces the search and commits to presence, forecloses the upward path, and the final image of reaching into the cradle reweights all prior material. Cost is felt (abandoning her cartomantic pilgrimage, accepting the weight of repeated presence) and the lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive deepening. One minor slip: the phrase "Time… didn't need to be found. It needed to be given" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade is rendered with concrete, PPV-specific sensory detail—moonlight like mercury, star-flowers that burn her throat, luminous sap weeping from the cracked saucer—and the setting constrains choice by making lost time visible as ghostly objects. The birthday tablecloth functions as micro-setting, grounding her decision to trace repeated hands. Spatial choreography is clean: cloud layers, glade, descent, nursery window. The phrase "choking beauty… gorgeous and unforgiving" modulates the tone and charges the final descent, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming presence versus继ng to steal time—is signaled early and tightens through the three card-windows, each narrowing her self-justifications. The reversal occurs when she realizes "the repentance wasn't in the seeking—it was in the choice to descend," forecloses the pilgrimage path, and commits to repeated hand-tracing. Agency is clear (her decision to descend and trace), and the cost is visible (she abandons the glade's revelations and her cartomantic identity). The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening. Minor friction: the climax leans slightly on articulated realization rather than pure dramatic turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tablecloth motif, the weeping tea-set crack, and the repeated hand-tracing: presence as accumulated choice rather than grand gesture. The final image—reaching into the cradle where "real hands could trace real skin"—reweights the entire pilgrimage without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the hospital vision (withdrawn hand), the infant's tracking eyes, and the sap-weeping crack. The story resists easy resolution; she has not erased her past theft, only chosen a new path with visible cost. No thematic echo or label-speak in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and confident, with tight focalization on the cartomancer's perceptions. Diction is character-specific ("cloudbound repentance," "onyx-ink cards," "willingly perplexed") and rhythmic control is strong—short, breathless sentences at the climax ("She gasped"), longer cadences during reflection. The phrase "willingly perplexed" reads as slightly elevated for the moment but remains within plausible lexicon for a mystical practitioner. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices symbolic objects (cards, cloth, crack) through a cartomancer's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density—most sentences advance character, image, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury," "choking beauty") is coherent and voice-motivated. Two minor frictions: the phrase "her daughter deserved better than a mother who climbed clouds to find what she'd already abandoned" is a near-summary that slightly softens momentum, and "the knowledge of what she might still save" edges toward scaffold. No loops, no synonym churn, and the final line is concrete and charged. Opening and closing images are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of cloudbound repentance, cartomancy, and the birthday-tablecloth custom offers a fresh synthesis; the weeping tea-set crack and the traced-hand ritual feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. The piece transforms the familiar "new mother seeks redemption" template through the glade's concrete physics (lost time as ghostly objects) and the ritual repetition as promise. Risk-taking in the lyric closure—she traces her hand again and again—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: the phrase "willingly perplexed" and the cloudbound-repentance framing read slightly prompt-adjacent rather than fully organic to the world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is introduced in the opening line and her choices drive all key turns: ascending to the glade, spreading the cloth, reading her own cards (first time), and deciding to descend and trace repeated hands. Her profession shapes perception (seeing through card-windows) and her final choice—to give time rather than find it—forecloses the pilgrimage path with visible cost. The character is causally active in setup, middle revelation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dolls' tea set saucer crack appears in the third card-window, recognized as a childhood object buried with her mother, and its luminous-sap weeping reveals what lost time becomes. It is handled once (seen through the card) and returns thematically in the closure paragraph ("what she'd almost lost forever"). The crack shapes one key turn (the realization beat) and contributes to the ending's charge, but it does not constrain middle choices or appear in distinct beats. Strong lyric reprise, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance frames the premise (ascending above the world to account for stolen moments), shapes her journey and stakes, and is dramatized on the page: she climbs, reads cards, sees ghosts of lost connection, and chooses descent. The concept alters tactics (she must ascend to see, then descend to act) and charges the final image. Present in setup, middle revelation, and closure decision. The phrase itself reads slightly expository but the mechanics are fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears as a descriptor when she shuffles the cards ("willingly perplexed by what they might reveal"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; the story would function identically without this specific phrase. No middle or closure participation beyond the single mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice with distinct narrative weight: she unfastens the leather case (setup, releasing the cards that trigger the revelation) and unfastens her traveling cloak (closure, shedding the pilgrimage identity to reach into the cradle). Both beats are causally active, irreplaceable, and the final unfastening completes the arc. Major turns trace directly to this action; swapping it for "open" or "remove" would flatten the ritual specificity and closure symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced in paragraph four, furnishes the cloth itself (the reading surface), and supplies the climactic action: she traces her own hand repeatedly as a promise. The method shapes setup (the cloth's history with seventeen mother-hands), middle pressure (her daughter's tiny print), and closure (repeated tracing as covenant). Mechanics matter: the traced hands are not ornamental but causally active, foregrounding presence versus absence. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is anchored in the opening paragraph, provides the space where lost time accumulates (star-flowers, weeping sap, phantom objects), and supplies the vertical axis (ascent/descent) that structures the arc. The setting pressures choice: beauty that "choked" and "hurt in the way that truth hurts" forces her to see cost, and the glade "releases her" at dawn, cueing the descent. Present in setup, middle revelation (card-windows in moonlight), and closure (descent through mist). Environment alters tactics and charges the final act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "three days after the birth" is signaled in the opening line and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("Her daughter was three days old and waiting"). Time tightens the stakes (infant vulnerability, fresh maternal bond) and the dawn-breaking moment cues her descent. However, the glade sequence itself is not clock-pressured; the narrative treats the pilgrimage as a single night without internal escalation by minutes or hours. Functional bracket, moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost time accumulates" is dramatized in the opening paragraphs (she climbs to the glade seeking accountability) and tested through the card-windows, which reveal the ghosts of stolen connection. Desire collides with realization: finding lost time shows her she must instead give time. The friction between wants (to account, to justify) and costs (abandoning presence) drives the middle beats and the closure pivot. Setup, middle conflict, and ending reversal all trace to this motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tone of "choking beauty" is established in paragraph three ("The glade choked her with its beauty… Everything here hurt in the way that truth hurts, gorgeous and unforgiving") and modulates with pressure: sweet fragrance burns her throat, the cards become windows, the crack weeps luminous sap. The tone charges the final image—"carrying the choking beauty of what she'd almost lost forever"—and coheres through setup, revelation, and descent. Rhythm tightens at the climax (short sentences, gasps) and breathes in the closing paragraph. Distinct, purposeful, and integrated into closure.</comment>
