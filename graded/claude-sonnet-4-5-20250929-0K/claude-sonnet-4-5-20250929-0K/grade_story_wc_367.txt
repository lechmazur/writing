<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is articulated ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract; his interior life consists largely of philosophical musings rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in the present. The "accidentally prophetic" trait is told via anecdote (the fisherman, the newspaper clipping) but never dramatized as a micro-choice under pressure. His laughter and storm-calling feel like symbolic gestures rather than character-specific actions grounded in personal cost. The final act—adjusting the wick and steering light—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path that would earn the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when within the first paragraph; the lighthouse, Kael's ritual, and the post-newspaper timeframe anchor cleanly. The dominant stake ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is present but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the green light bends backward through time and people wake "confused but hopeful," but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page—no sentence or image shows what Kael forfeits or what path is foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light, laughter, and prophecy), which the piece holds, but the closure lacks a decisive price that the reader can point to in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse is vividly rendered—green glass walls, Fresnel lens, copper filaments—and its physical mechanics (total internal reflection) constrain Kael's ritual choices. The obsidian sea, storm clouds, and lightning fork contribute atmosphere that modulates with pressure. The lighthouse's green light functions as micro-setting, shaping the final image where light "bends backward through time" and tints the dawn. Spatial choreography inside the lighthouse is clear (spiral stairs, lens positioning), and the environment charges the closure. This lifts the score into mid-7s despite the broader world (post-print society) remaining sketched rather than inhabited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is declared early ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract and untested by concrete on-page friction. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael positions the wick, light erupts, storms answer, dawn arrives green—no opposition or cost visibly alters tactics. The piece accumulates atmospheric intensity but does not escalate through agency or trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image reweights meaning, but without a felt price or foreclosed path, the pressure remains declarative rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—light as teacher of darkness, ritual holding time's boundary, accidental prophecy—emerges organically from the lighthouse mechanics and Kael's laughter. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the green dawn and "shadows that taught them where to place their light" reconfigure the premise without moralizing. However, the thematic question remains abstract; the story invites reflection but the final image leans toward symbolic assertion rather than embodied cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars the prose, and the lighthouse's dual function (warning/prophecy) integrates smoothly, preventing a lower score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering lighthouse mechanics and storm through Kael's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent—"shadowed elation," "temporal uncertainty," "refracted truth"—creating a distinct narrative texture. The prose avoids head-hopping and the register suits the otherworldly premise. However, under peak pressure (light erupting, dawn arriving) the voice does not modulate; it maintains the same lyric remove, missing an opportunity to vary psychic distance. No dialogue appears. One brief filter-verb cluster ("he could see lightning fork") slightly dulls immediacy but does not materially harm distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the prose carries high information density (lighthouse mechanics, prophecy, newspaper clipping) without scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent—"steered not just through space, but through meaning itself," "painted symbols across the sky that no language had words for"—but remains legible and pattern-motivated rather than overwritten. Two minor artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph three ("he'd never spoken to any reporter" / "He hadn't said those words then") and a template-cadence run ("The wick clicked into place. Light erupted… each reflection splitting… The green brilliance shot"). These do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in high-pressure beats. No loops touch the closure image, preventing heavier deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper as storm herald, light bending through time via total internal reflection, laughter summoning weather, accidental prophecy—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "lone lighthouse keeper" trope through the mechanics of shadow/light instruction and the post-print timeframe. However, the emotional arc (Kael laughing at absurdity, tending ritual, steering darkness) does not change materially when character and place are swapped; the freshness resides in concept and atmosphere rather than lived particulars. The risk-taking (lyric register, backward-bending light, temporal uncertainty) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, performs the ritual, laughs to summon storms, and adjusts the wick in the climax. His choices (positioning the wick, steering light with minute adjustments) create the key turn—the green light bending backward through time—but the decision itself lacks visible cost or trade-off that would demonstrate agency under pressure. The character is causally active across setup, development, and payoff, satisfying all three gates, but the action feels inevitable rather than chosen with a price. This places the score in the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick is introduced in paragraph one, handled on-page in paragraph two (alignment with copper filaments), and returned in the climax where Kael positions it with "trembling fingers" and the click triggers light eruption. It appears in three distinct beats (carrying it upstairs, aligning it, positioning it at closure) and its precise angle determines the light's refraction. The wick's mechanics constrain Kael's ritual choices and shape the ending's physical action. All three gates are met, with strong beat involvement and closure linkage, warranting high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine" frames the entire narrative—Kael's nightly ritual at 11:14, described as "plucked from some parallel dimension where logic bent differently." It shapes stakes (holding boundaries of time, projecting instructions into morning) and tactics (infinitesimal wick adjustments). The routine is present in setup (paragraph two), development (the mechanical process of alignment), and closure (the light erupting as ritual completes). The concept constrains choices and alters options by defining Kael's role and the lighthouse's function. This meets all three gates and demonstrates causal pressure, placing it in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "accidentally prophetic" attribute is told via two anecdotes—the newspaper clipping quoting words Kael hadn't yet spoken, and the fisherman joke about storms following laughter. These examples illustrate the trait but do not dramatize it constraining or enabling an on-page choice with cost. The trait does not shape Kael's decision-making in the present scene; it colors backstory but remains label-only in the climactic beats. Present in setup (paragraph four) but absent from middle development and closure participation, meeting only one gate and earning mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael steers the light through minute wick adjustments in the climax, "painting symbols across the sky," and the result—light bending backward through time, green dawn—is the story's decisive turn. The action is signaled early (paragraph two: "ensuring the light would bounce"), developed in the middle (the mechanics of total internal reflection), and executed at closure. Removing "steer" would collapse the premise; the entire ritual depends on Kael's active guidance of light's direction and meaning. All three gates are met with strong causal pressure and specificity, warranting mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Total internal reflection is named in paragraph two ("trapped and amplified within the crystalline structure until it burst forth") and its mechanics are invoked at closure ("bouncing internally through precisely calculated angles, each reflection splitting the beam into component meanings"). The method shapes the how of Kael's ritual—the light must refract internally to achieve its effect—but the story does not dramatize the mechanics as a constraint that alters tactics or presents friction. Present in setup and closure, missing middle development where the process might have resisted or required adjustment. Two gates met, functional causal role, placing it in low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse pressures choices throughout: its green glass refracts starlight, the Fresnel lens requires precise wick alignment, the spiral stairs Kael climbs anchor movement, and the structure's height and transparency enable the light to reach across water and time. The lighthouse supplies the resources (lens system, copper filaments) that make Kael's action possible and its physical properties (total internal reflection) constrain his technique. Present in setup (paragraph one), development (lens mechanics), and closure (light erupting through the structure), with strong causal pressure and specificity. This places it in the 8.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last print newspaper" is established in paragraph one and recalled in paragraph four (the newspaper clipping "dated three days before the presses went silent forever"). It provides historical texture and signals a world where "information traveled only through screens and whispers," but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The nightly ritual occurs "at precisely eleven-fourteen," but no live clock pressure shapes Kael's choices in this scene. Present in setup, absent from middle development and closure participation. One gate met, functional but replaceable, placing it in the 3.0–4.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph five and drives his ritual action—positioning the wick, steering light, projecting patterns that "write instructions into the fabric of morning itself." The desire is present throughout and the ending fulfills it (people wake with "shadows that taught them where to place their light"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; no on-page friction between want and cost appears. All three gates are met but the desire lacks embodied struggle, placing it in the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone—"shadowed elation," laughter at absurdity, joy mixed with isolation—is established in paragraph three ("he laughed… from the absurdity of his existence") and modulates with pressure as storm clouds gather and lightning answers his laughter. The tone charges the final image: Kael descending "still laughing, still prophetic," having "accidentally saved a world." The laughter functions as both character signature and thematic note, coherent across setup, development, and closure. The tone shapes reader experience and amplifies the ending's resonance, warranting low-7s.</comment>
