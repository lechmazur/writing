<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation (illuminate pathways to save eight hundred trapped souls) is clear and drives her choices, but her internal experience of the static-shock transformation reads more as exposition than embodied contradiction. The moment "I'm not certain of anything anymore" gestures at disorientation, yet her subsequent movements feel controlled and purpose-driven without visible struggle or mistake that would ground the cost of her altered state. Dr. Chen functions primarily as audience stand-in; his "affectionate skeptic" label is told rather than shown through conflicting choices that test their relationship under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows a causal lens: static shock + defective pill → Mara perceives thought-architecture → she devises light-painting maps → hope crystallizes for rescue protocol. The closure is Charged Poise: "We start tomorrow" crystallizes intent and the final image ("hope crystallized into something solid—fractally precise, yet warm with possibility") reconfigures the premise with felt optimism, though the cost remains conceptual (her lost certainty) rather than a visible on-page forfeiture that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as micro-setting throughout: the camera rig, long-exposure technique, and "careful darkness" enable Mara's mapping work and constrain her method (she must move through space to trace patterns). The muscovite pendant recurs with shifting charge (shield → sympathy with traced light → warmth at closure), and the studio's residual electricity grounds the inciting shock. The convergence image ("branching structures, fractally precise") uses the studio's visual vocabulary to make the abstract pathways legible, charging the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save eight hundred trapped telepaths) is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Chen grasps the application: "teach them to follow these specific pathways back—through their own somatic markers." Mara's agency is decision and devise-action (mapping the routes tonight), and the cost is her ongoing disorientation plus the deferral of certainty. The escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than a reversal that narrows live options, which keeps the score in the solid but not exceptional range under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (mapping pathways through chaos to restore sovereignty) emerges through the interplay of telepathic entanglement, somatic markers, and light-painting particulars without overt thesis statements. The muscovite's layered structure ("separate yet part of a whole") and the fractally precise trails offer concrete images that invite reflection on consciousness and boundaries. The final image resists a tidy moral and reweights the premise: what was catastrophic (the shock, the defective pill) becomes the key to rescue. Minor weakness: "hope crystallized into something solid" in the closing line tilts slightly abstract rather than remaining anchored in a final sensory particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Mara is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (light trails, fractally precise patterns) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue between Mara and Chen feels natural and goal-driven, though Chen's lines lean expository ("Body-memories. The theory was..."). Minor register slip: "consciousness itself, transparent yet distinct" and "architecture of thought" drift slightly elevated during peak beats, yet remain within Mara's artist-technician lexicon and do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and purposeful rhythm. Two local artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("rewired something fundamental in how her neurons fired" immediately following "The shock had changed her") and a cluster of filter verbs in the final third ("could perceive," "could teach," "could save") that slightly dull immediacy during high-pressure moments. The closing line's stacked modifiers ("fractally precise, yet warm with possibility") blur concrete sense. Information density is strong overall; no major scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis (light painting + telepathy recall + somatic markers + static shock) is specific and non-obvious, though the core "artist's unique perception enables rescue" frame echoes familiar templates. The fractally precise light-trail mapping offers a fresh visual mechanism, and the muscovite pendant's dual function (cultural shield lore + physical layering metaphor) adds texture. Transformation is present but moderate: swap "light painting" for another visual-mapping art and the emotional arc holds with minor edits, suggesting mid-range originality rather than indispensable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dr. Chen ("affectionate skeptic") is present in three beats: examining the pill bottle, explaining somatic markers, and grasping the rescue protocol through the camera. His understanding flood ("Mara, this could save them") enables the closure decision but his own choice-making is minimal; he observes and affirms rather than creating a turn. The attribute is told in the opening dialogue tag and demonstrated only through his doubt/hope blend, not through a decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in four beats: initial description (layered transparency catching glow), Mara touching it for grounding, its swing during her movement (layers "catching and separating light in sympathy"), and warming at closure. It shifts from passive talisman to active participant (its layering mirrors consciousness structure, its sympathy reinforces the mapping work) and charges the final image when it warms, signaling success. The object shapes Mara's understanding and reweights meaning at closure, earning high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is the inciting crisis (eight hundred people trapped in endless connection), motivates Mara's entire mission, and determines the method (somatic markers left by chemical telepathy). It constrains tactics (she must map pathways others can follow) and appears in the closure beat ("eight hundred souls in endless connection" recalled as the problem her maps will solve). The concept is causally active across setup, development, and payoff, and the story's logic would collapse without this exact premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" recurs five times: describing her finger patterns, the captured light trails, the branching structures in the photograph, the final "fractally precise" hope, and implicitly in the "infinitely detailed" trees of thought. The attribute enables the mapping work (her altered perception grants geometric accuracy) and charges the closure image. However, the precision itself does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a cost; it functions more as descriptive intensifier than as a trait with tradeoffs (e.g., precision causing slowness or tunnel vision).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Devise" drives the central action: Mara states "I need to devise a way to map what I'm seeing," begins her mapping choreography, and the closure hinges on her devised routes ("paths of light that would become maps for lost minds"). The action is specific to her altered perception and irreplaceable; the rescue protocol depends on this exact creative-technical synthesis. Two beats (stating intent, executing the devise-action) plus closure participation with causal necessity justify the high score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is signaled early (Chen: "Body-memories... emotional residue in the nervous system"), shapes the method (teaching people to follow body-memory back to separateness), and reappears at the key turn when Chen realizes the application ("through their own somatic markers, their body's memory of being separate"). The mechanics matter: without this exact method, the light paintings alone could not guide trapped minds out. The concept constrains the solution and participates in closure, though the mechanism remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied in a visible on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The light painting studio is the inciting location (where the static shock occurred), supplies the camera rig and long-exposure technique essential to capturing the pathways, and its "careful darkness" and "residual electricity" create the conditions for Mara's work. The setting pressures choices (she must move through space to trace patterns; the studio's tools enable visualization) and charges the closure ("In the darkness of the light painting studio, hope crystallized"). The studio is causally indispensable and participates in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the entire narrative (three days post-shock is noted, the shock's moment is recounted, and "tonight" sets the immediate task). The timeframe shapes Mara's altered state and creates urgency (eight hundred people are drowning now), but the clock does not tighten tactics within the scene or impose a visible deadline pressure. The opening phrase "three days ago" anchors orientation and the "We start tomorrow... Tonight, I map" couplet provides closure pacing, earning mid-band integration without high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to illuminate hidden pathways so others can follow them out") is stated early, dramatized through her mapping choreography, and drives the closure decision ("Tonight, I map every pathway I can see"). The desire conflicts with her lost certainty ("I'm not certain of anything anymore") and the cost of her transformation, creating friction. The motivation is causally active in setup, development (she moves to camera rig, begins tracing), and payoff (the devised maps become the rescue protocol), and the final image reweights the stake with "hope crystallized."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" (fragile yet luminous optimism) is established through "hope in his voice, delicate as spun glass, fragile as willow branches bending toward light" and sustained in the closing image ("hope crystallized into something solid—fractally precise, yet warm with possibility"). The tone modulates with pressure: initial uncertainty, cautious collaboration, then crystallizing confidence. The willowglass metaphor appears once mid-story and is transformed at closure (from fragile to solid yet warm), charging the final beat. Coherence is strong, though the metaphor's single explicit appearance limits its recurring structural role.</comment>
