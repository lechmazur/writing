<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Layla's interiority is concrete and her embodied struggle with retrocognitive loops is visceral ("pulling herself free with effort that left her shaking"). The motivation shift from weapon to preserver carries weight, but her internal contradiction—serving the regime that trapped her—lacks dramatized tension in real time; we're told she refused orders in backstory rather than shown wrestling with a live choice. The final act of naming and mosaic-building reads as determined action but doesn't foreclose a visible path with cost; survivors simply emerge to join her without complication. Micro-choices under pressure are present but the stakes of her current defiance remain abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The retrocognitive loop is established early and the escalation follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of names and tessera fragments builds toward the final mosaic completion and the loosening of the trap. The closure effect—"Memorial of Unbroken Names" declared, loop loosened, survivors emerging—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the plaza's meaning. Cost is implied (regime will come) but not dramatized on the page at the closure beat, leaving the final consequence fuzzy. The lens holds cleanly through to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath the fractured sky is anchored early and the tessera fragments function as micro-setting, constraining Layla's action (she must gather, arrange, read the patterns). The mosaic stepping stone is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image when the last blue fragment is pressed into place. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, gathering, placing). The shattered sky recurs purposefully as both atmospheric anchor and metaphor that tightens at closure without being forced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the retrocognitive trap through remembrance—is signaled early and tightens once when Layla completes the mosaic and the loop loosens. The escalation is driven by her agency (gathering, arranging, naming) under the Accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks visible cost at the moment of closure; survivors appear without complication and the regime's threatened return is deferred off-page. The choice to speak names aloud is meaningful but does not narrow options or force a trade-off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—mercy and remembrance as resistance—emerges organically from the tessera fragments and the act of naming. "Gentle radicalism: to weaponize empathy" risks being too on-the-nose, but the final image of pressing the blue minaret fragment into place reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The plaza's seven renamings and Layla's counter-naming create purposeful pattern. Subtext operates in the mechanical hands cradling fragments and the choice to preserve rather than destroy. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration of the plaza's identity without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Layla; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the augmented fingers tracing patterns and the retrocognitive vision. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("warm coldness, a gentleness edged in steel") that feels more authorial than character-grounded. The phrase "aberrant mercy" and "gentle radicalism" read as thematic labels rather than Layla's natural idiom under pressure. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines) but functional. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are sparse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. However, multiple passages veer into overwriting: "warm coldness," "sky fractured like broken glass," "tessera-studded testament" stack figurative density without clear payoff. The phrase "watched civilizations rise and fall" is stock. Paraphrase loops appear: the regime's binding of consciousness is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the naming sequence ("Mikhail ibn Rashid... Yara of the Eastern Gardens") reads more like a list than dramatized action. Clarity is generally maintained but momentum dips during the reflection-heavy middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The fusion of retrocognitive trap, mosaic remembrance, and steel-armed mercy offers a distinct synthesis. The premise of punishment through enforced witnessing is fresh. However, the emotional arc—soldier refusing orders, being trapped, then breaking free—follows a familiar redemption template. The mechanical hands as instruments of both destruction and preservation is a strong image but not fully transformed into inevitable causality. The survivors emerging at the end without complication softens the boldness of the setup. Specificity in the tessera fragments and the seven renamings elevates the concept above generic "memory as resistance" tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Layla as "gentle radical" is signaled early through her refusal to burn the plaza (backstory) and embodied in the present when she gathers fragments, arranges them, and speaks names aloud. These choices drive the middle beats and shape the ending when she completes the mosaic and declares the memorial. However, the final turn—survivors emerging—is not caused by Layla's decision; it happens to her. The radicalism is demonstrated but the gentleness remains more label than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tessera (single blue tile fragment from the minaret) is introduced in the opening paragraph, handled across multiple beats (tracing, gathering, reading patterns), and returns with reweighted meaning when Layla presses the final blue fragment into place at closure. Its properties (pulsing with captured time, bearing chipped patterns) enable the retrocognitive loop and the method of reading names. The mosaic as a whole is central, but the individual tessera's role is slightly diffuse; the final fragment's specificity (blue, from the minaret) charges the ending but could be swapped for another color or origin with minor narrative adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy"—Layla's refusal to burn the plaza—is established in backstory and shapes the central stakes (her punishment is the retrocognitive trap). It reappears at closure when she declares mercy can "reshape the world." The concept constrains her present situation and motivates her action (preserving names rather than destroying). However, the mercy itself is not tested on the page in a live choice; it's a past decision with present consequences. The concept is thematic backbone but not a live friction in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap is established early ("trapped in this retrocognitive loop as she had been for months") and constrains Layla's opening action when she falls into the vision and must pull herself free with effort. It shapes the dominant stake (breaking the loop). However, after the opening beat, the trap's mechanics fade; we're told it loosens at the end but don't see Layla struggle against it during the middle naming sequence. The cost (shaking, effort) is visible early but not sustained. The trait enables the plot but doesn't constrain tactics in multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Renaming—speaking real names aloud and creating "Memorial of Unbroken Names"—is signaled early when Layla reads the chipped patterns and escalates through the middle beats (speaking Mikhail, Yara, Samir, Chen Wei-Long) to the climactic declaration of the memorial's name. This action directly causes the retrocognitive loop to loosen and redefines the plaza's identity. Swapping "rename" for another act of remembrance (e.g., inscribing, singing) would require structural rewrites. The action is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone are introduced in the opening paragraph and used as the method for reading the banned alphabet names. Layla arranges fragments "according to the method her grandmother had taught her" and the patterns "formed words" that she reads aloud. The method shapes multiple beats (reading, arranging, completing the pattern) and is present at closure when the final tessera completes the pattern. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we don't see how the chips encode letters or why the arrangement matters beyond thematic resonance. The method is functional but could be more concretely rendered.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout (kneeling on stones, gathering from ruins, fractured dome revealing stars). The setting supplies the tessera fragments as resources and the history of seven renamings as context. The shattered sky charges the final image. However, the plaza does not constrain Layla's choices; she moves freely within it and no spatial feature complicates her action. The setting is atmospheric and thematically resonant but more stage than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes the timeframe in the opening and the months-long trap is mentioned, but no live clock tightens decisions. The regime "would come for her eventually" is noted but not tracked. The present action—gathering, arranging, naming—unfolds without temporal pressure or urgency. The timeframe provides context but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is embodied when Layla's mechanical hands (instruments of destruction) now hold tessera fragments "as if [each] were a child." This motivation is signaled early and demonstrated through her actions (preserving vs. destroying). However, the friction between her past role (regime weapon) and present stance (gentle radical) is told in backstory rather than dramatized in a live choice. The desire is clear and drives her gathering and naming, but no on-page moment forces her to choose empathy over another urgent need. The motivation shapes action but lacks conflicted cost in the present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Warm coldness, a gentleness edged in steel" is stated explicitly mid-story and approximated in the opening's juxtaposition of ancient stones and shattered sky, mechanical hands and tender cradling. The tone modulates between the harsh retrocognitive vision (fire, screaming) and the quiet naming sequence. However, the label "warm coldness" itself is ornamental; the prose achieves the effect intermittently (steel hands cradling fragments) but also drifts into elevated lyricism (fractured sky, tessera-studded testament) that leans more toward warmth than coldness. The tone is present but not sustained as a coherent charge through the ending; the final image is more quietly affirmative than edged.</comment>
