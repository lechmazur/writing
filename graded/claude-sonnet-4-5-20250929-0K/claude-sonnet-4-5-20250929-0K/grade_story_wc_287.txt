<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific—her understanding of the rosebush teaching her, the gauge tooth's memorial weight—but the progression from grief to pragmatic hope lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final certainty ("The rosebush would bloom again. She was certain.") feels like unearned epiphany rather than a choice forged under pressure. Micro-choices (adjusting mirrors, watering plants) are present but low-stakes; no single moment forces a trade-off with visible cost. The father's locksmith past enriches texture but remains backstory that tilts present stance only obliquely.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a pattern of reflected light and cultivation, with anchors clear by paragraph two (Mira, fire escape, harbor, twilight). The closure—Mira deciding to mount the gauge tooth as memorial and recognizing her method mirrors her father's—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) that reweights the premise. Cost is visible in the rosebush's death and implied in three years of labor, but the final certainty ("She was certain") softens the price rather than charging it. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers someone else's seedlings, but the tightening is gentle rather than decisive.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor, fire escape, and mirror system create vivid micro-setting that constrains Mira's tactics (angles, reflected moonlight) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "papery lightness of ending," "quivering hush," the harbor's "ancient conversation with the moon." Spatial choreography across multiple fire escapes remains clear. The gauge tooth functions as object-as-setting, returning with reweighted meaning in the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate partially but the broader setting does not alter a closure choice directly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Mira's mission to instill belief that light can reach dark corners—is signaled early and coheres. One tightening occurs when she discovers the neighbor's new plot, affirming her method, but this is affirmation rather than narrowed options or forced trade-off. No reversal or decision point forecloses a live path; the rosebush's death is already complete at the opening, so it cannot serve as an on-page turn. Pressure accumulates gently through the nocturnal rounds but does not escalate under the Accumulative lens sufficiently to reach higher bands. Cost (three years of labor, the father's absence) is present but backgrounded.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—opening what seems closed, finding light through reflection and angles—emerges organically from the locksmith/gardener parallel and the mirror system. The gauge tooth reprise in the final paragraph reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively in the father's hidden tools and Mrs. Chen's quiet approval. The thematic statement "protection didn't mean isolation—that vulnerability could exist within care" edges toward overt articulation but remains anchored in concrete action. The ending offers a resonant answer (mount the gauge tooth, continue the work) without didacticism, though the certainty of future bloom softens ambiguity slightly.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira notices angles, depths, light like a locksmith-gardener hybrid. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout ("wistfully pragmatic efficiency," "quivering hush"). Mrs. Chen's brief dialogue feels natural and advances Mira's internal arc. Psychic distance is controlled, moving inward for reflection on the gauge tooth and outward for spatial navigation. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. The prose carries a distinct texture (measured, nocturnal, technical) that modulates appropriately with Mira's focus shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the mirror-system logic. Minor scaffold appears: "She was certain" recurs twice in closure paragraph, creating a small loop that dulls the final image's charge. One paraphrase loop: "protected vulnerability" and "vulnerability could exist within care" restate the same concept. Figurative language (harbor's "ancient conversation," "papery lightness of ending") is purposeful and coherent. No grammar, tense, or pronoun issues. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle beats (adjusting mirrors, watering basil) but recovers by the discovery of the neighbor's seedlings.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-gardener parallel and mirror system offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis; the gauge tooth as memorial and tool is a fresh inflection. The fire-escape garden premise itself is familiar (urban greening, found-family care), but Mira's technical method (mirrors, angles, reflected light) and the occupational specificity of bitting gauges add particularity. Emotional truth—grief transformed into pragmatic hope—avoids generic templates. The transformation test holds: swapping names and setting would lose the locksmith depth and harbor-light logic. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat but does not attempt structural or perspectival boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Mira is present throughout, making small choices (watering, adjusting mirrors, deciding to mount the gauge tooth). Setup: immediate. Development: middle beats show her tending gardens, a functional choice but low-stakes. Payoff: final paragraph decision to mount the gauge tooth as memorial is the key turn, though it's contemplative rather than decisive action. Causal pressure is moderate—her rounds enable the neighbor's seedlings discovery, which affirms her method. Swappability: a different character could perform similar rounds; Mira's locksmith heritage adds texture but does not constrain the closure action irreplaceably. Two gates met solidly, third (development as high-stakes choice) is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The gauge tooth appears in beat two (found behind brick, recognized as father's) and returns in the closure paragraph where Mira decides to mount it as memorial. Setup and payoff gates met. Development: she touches it in her pocket while talking to Mrs. Chen, a micro-beat that tilts present stance. Its specific property—numbered depths worn smooth—matters: it embodies the father's locksmith work and primes Mira's realization that she measures light as he measured depths. Not fully indispensable (the story could function with a different memorial object) but the locksmith specificity and the mounting decision in closure elevate it. Cost connection: mounting it forecloses keeping it hidden, a quiet but visible price. Three beats, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The phrase "quivering hush" appears twice: opening ("the neighborhood held its breath in a quivering hush") and closing ("the quivering hush deepening as the city slept"). Setup gate met. It contributes to atmosphere and tone but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. Development: absent—no middle choice hinges on this concept. Payoff: the reprise in the final paragraph reweights slightly, suggesting the hush is a space where growth can occur, but it remains thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Swappability: "expectant silence" or similar could replace it. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise), lifting it into mid-5s, but it does not constrain action or charge a closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The attribute appears once: "The system worked with wistfully pragmatic efficiency—she harbored no illusions about transforming the entire block, but these small victories mattered." Setup gate met (first third). Development and payoff: absent—it describes Mira's worldview but does not constrain a later action or trade-off. Label-only mention without visible cost or enabling choice. It enriches voice but is swappable ("realistic optimism," "measured hope"). No beat involvement beyond the single descriptive line. Cap at 4.9 per missing development and closure participation; score reflects decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The action "instill" is the story's spine: Mira is trying to instill belief that light can reach dark corners. Setup: signaled obliquely in the opening (three years coaxing blooms) and explicitly stated mid-story ("trying to instill in this tired neighborhood the belief that light could reach anywhere"). Development: her rounds, mirror adjustments, and the discovery of the neighbor's seedlings all demonstrate this action in progress. Payoff: the final paragraph frames the gauge tooth mounting as continuation of the instilling work. Major turns trace to it: the neighbor's plot is evidence the instilling is working, which shifts Mira's certainty. Not easily swappable—this exact verb captures the mission. Two to three beats, causal pressure solid, closure linkage present. Irreplaceability high but not absolute; "teach" or "prove" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>The phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" appears in the harbor description: "fishing boats rocked with the rhythm of oars in water, slow and hypnotic" and later "waves lapping against the pier with that same rowing rhythm, patient and persistent." Setup gate met. The method is not Mira's—it describes the harbor's motion, which serves as atmospheric backdrop and possible thematic parallel (patient, persistent work). Development and payoff: it does not shape Mira's attempts or mechanics; her method is mirrors and angles, not rhythm. The harbor rhythm remains ornamental. Swappability: high—any atmospheric harbor detail could replace it. No beat involvement in Mira's choices. Cap at 4.6 per missing development and closure participation; score reflects lyric presence but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is present throughout, providing the light Mira's mirrors reflect. Setup: immediate (paragraph one and two). Development: the moonlight enables her mirror system to work—without it, the plants couldn't grow—so it supplies a resource that affects tactics. Payoff: the final image references "reflected moonlight" in the dark corners, charging the closure. Causal pressure: moderate—the harbor is the light source, but Mira's mirrors are the active mechanism. Swappability: any bright night (streetlights, starlight) could substitute, though "luminous" and "moonlight" add poetic charge. Three gates met, but the harbor itself does not constrain a choice; it is infrastructure. Specificity is high (harbor, moonlight, fishing boats), but pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" anchors the opening sentence and primes the closure's certainty that it will bloom again. Setup gate met. Development: the petal drop has already occurred; Mira sweeps them up in beat one, marking an ending that frames her realization. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—she is on her nightly rounds, which are routine, not urgent. Payoff: the closing paragraph returns to the rosebush, stating it will bloom again, a thematic closure but not a time-driven pressure. The timeframe is more symbolic marker than live clock. Swappability: "after the rosebush dies back" or "at the end of the growing season" would function similarly. Lyric reprise lifts it toward mid-5s, but it does not alter tactics or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mira's motivation—to reflect light into dark corners—is dramatized across the entire story. Setup: implicit in the opening (three years tending the rosebush) and explicit mid-story. Development: every mirror adjustment, every plant watered, the discovery of the neighbor's seedlings all serve this desire. Payoff: the final paragraph crystallizes it ("She measured light and shadow to help things grow") and the decision to mount the gauge tooth is framed as continuation. Friction: her wistful pragmatism suggests no illusions of total transformation, a small want-versus-reality tension, but the neighbor's plot validates her, so cost is minimal. Swappability: low—this exact phrasing ties to the mirror mechanics and the light-into-darkness theme. Three beats, causal pressure strong, closure linkage direct. Could reach higher if the want faced sharper on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The tone "protected vulnerability" is embodied throughout: plants in "recycled containers," "seedlings... reaching upward in protected vulnerability, trusting her system of reflected light," the neighborhood's "quivering hush." Setup: present by first third. Development: each fire-escape garden (coffee can basil, pepper plants in recycled containers) demonstrates this tone—fragile life sustained by careful system. Payoff: the final image of "something stubborn and green... learning to thrive" in "dark corners now touched by reflected moonlight" charges the closure with this exact duality. Coherence: the tone modulates with Mira's focus (technical precision, then soft hope) without breaking. The explicit phrase "protected vulnerability" in the middle is a minor label but is immediately anchored to the seedlings trusting her system. Three gates met, tone charges the final image strongly, but the mid-story articulation of the phrase edges toward telling. Irreplaceability: high—this exact pairing captures the story's core dynamic.</comment>
