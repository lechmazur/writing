<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is textured and specific—brown-stained hands, magnifying-glass precision—but her emotional arc leans too much on told epiphany rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization ("I kept everything") feels asserted rather than wrestled with under pressure. Returnees remain decorative; their presence validates her work but doesn't force a genuine choice with visible cost. No micro-choices that foreclose a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through archival work → artifact arrival → physical return of townspeople. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant "regenerated not through magic but through...witnessing." Cost is conceptual—loneliness acknowledged—but the felt price remains abstract; the ending delivers thematic explanation rather than an image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Causality holds; the tightening is modest but present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Blooming jetty, walnut ink, and twilight are vivid and selective. The locket is handled twice (arrival, examination) and the jasmine scent returns at closure to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the coastal road and jetty-end positions track coherently. The jetty's recurring blooms constrain the covenant's meaning, elevating this past postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the covenant can regenerate—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates gently: locket arrival → recognition → returnees appear. The tightening is one meaningful deepening (the act of preservation enabled return), but no on-page choice by Maren narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Returnees validate her work without testing her commitment. Cost at closure is conceptual (loneliness named) but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing as preservation, small moments accumulating into return—emerges organically from archival work and the scratched inscription. The final image reweights the covenant's failure through the metaphor of steeping, avoiding overt moral. Subtext operates in "haunted euphoria" and Mrs. Corvin's smile. The ending avoids sermonizing but leans slightly abstract; "simple, gently thorough act of witnessing" borders on thematic statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Maren's archivist lens filters everything through documentation instinct. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("We steep ourselves in leaving..."). Voice is consistent and textured ("specific sepia that made even new documents look ancient"). Under peak moment (returnees' arrival), diction stays controlled. Minor slip: "understanding was beginning to dawn like the stars" is a stock construction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory detail. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loops: "haunted euphoria" appears twice (photo description, Mrs. Corvin's smile); "steep" recurs three times in close proximity (inscription, returnees' explanation, Maren's reflection). Template cadence in final paragraph: "And she would use walnut ink, as always, to make sure it looked as important as it felt" echoes the earlier phrase too closely. No artifacts touch closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archivist-as-preserver premise is fresh; walnut ink and "proximate causes" specificity elevate above generic memory-keeper tropes. The covenant's failure-then-regeneration through documentation offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking is modest: the structure is linear, the returnees' arrival feels slightly convenient (all received artifacts simultaneously), and the emotional resolution lands softly without challenging Maren's worldview. Transformation test: plot could work with different objects/locale, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her archival work is central to the premise. She examines the locket, recognizes the Corvins, and her preservation efforts are credited at closure. However, her choices don't create key turns; she observes and receives validation rather than deciding under pressure. Present in setup, development (examination), and payoff (returnees acknowledge her), but largely reactive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Locket appears in arrival beat (morning), examination beat (magnifying glass, scratched inscription), and Maren holds it at closure ("looked at the locket"). The inscription "We steep ourselves in leaving..." directly shapes the thematic payload. Handled in multiple beats and returns with reweighted meaning when Mrs. Corvin explains its function. Causal role in recognition but doesn't narrow Maren's tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Covenant is setup early (paragraph 4), developed through backstory (families signed, promised return), and directly addressed at closure ("covenant regenerated"). Mrs. Corvin's explanation reframes its purpose from binding-to-return to steeping-in-choice, altering the story's conceptual stakes. The concept shapes the dominant stake and appears causally in the ending's reconfiguration. Essential to plot logic and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" appears as direct label in final paragraph and in Mrs. Corvin's dialogue ("simple, gently thorough act of witnessing"). The trait is told rather than dramatized through constrained action. Maren's examination of the locket shows thoroughness (magnifying glass, edge examination), but no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the attribute. Label-only mention at closure; setup weak, development partial, payoff present but asserted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steep" appears in the locket inscription, returnees' explanation ("steep in our choices"), and Maren's reflection ("steeping too"). The metaphor reframes the covenant's failure and enables the thematic turn. Present in middle and ending; causally active in reweighting meaning. However, "steep" is metaphorical action, not physical; the story could function with a different metaphor ("marinate," "distill") with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Proximate causes are setup early (Maren's archival focus: "how one family's departure led to another's") and mentioned at closure ("proximate causes revealed their ultimate effects"). Method shapes Maren's worldview but doesn't constrain her on-page tactics. The mechanics—tracing causality in archives—are told rather than shown affecting a choice. Present in setup and thematic payoff but ornamental in development; swappable with "detailed records" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blooming jetty is setup in opening line, present throughout (Maren stands at its end), and charged at closure ("The blooming jetty held them all"). Jasmine scent intensifies at the peak moment, and the jetty's annual blooms are tied to the covenant's timing. Setting constrains the gathering spatially and supplies the covenant's trigger (blooms = return). Micro-setting that shapes both the covenant's logic and the final image; essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When context changes" is invoked in opening paragraph ("wondered if this was finally the moment when context would change everything") and echoed at closure ("why the context could finally change"). Timeframe is thematic rather than tactical; no live clock tightens decisions. The covenant's 30-year gap and annual blooms provide temporal structure, but urgency is absent. Present in setup and payoff; development shows temporal markers (morning arrival, twilight) but no escalating pressure from time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is setup clearly ("the only way to preserve the weight of small moments...by making them look as important as they felt") and dramatized through Maren's ink-staining and archival dedication. Desire is told more than shown in friction; no on-page moment where preserving small moments costs her something immediate. Returnees validate the motivation at closure, but Maren doesn't choose it over a competing want. Present across beats; causally relevant but not conflicted with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named in the photograph description (woman's expression) and echoed when Mrs. Corvin smiles "that same haunted-euphoric smile." Tone modulates through twilight melancholy, archival solitude, and tentative hope at the returnees' arrival. The paradox charges the covenant's emotional texture. Present in setup, development, and payoff; coheres through turns and inflects the final image. Not fully embodied in Maren's own state, limiting depth.</comment>
