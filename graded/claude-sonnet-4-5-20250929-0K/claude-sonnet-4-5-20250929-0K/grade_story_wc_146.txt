<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains a cipher throughout—her motivations are asserted ("infinite patience," "understanding of how broken things harmonize") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. The town's residents are sketched in brief gestures (baker, schoolteacher, old Matthias) but never press back or complicate her work; their joining her rhythm feels automatic rather than earned through struggle. No meaningful internal contradiction appears, and the protagonist's arc is a straight line from arrival to success without visible cost or trade-off. The label "infinite patience" is invoked but never tested by an on-page obstacle that forces her to choose between speed and thoroughness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural design: footsteps accumulate, residents join, the bell seals. The closure—bell crack healing, town revived—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract; no character forfeits a concrete option or pays a visible price. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (who, where, when anchored by ~100 words). However, the escalation reads as additive accumulation without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options; each week "something shifted," but no single beat forces a trade-off or reconfigures stakes. The ending asserts prevention of collapse without showing what specific choice or sacrifice made the difference.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ashwood is anchored clearly: ancient archway, cobblestones, hollow-eyed buildings, the tower bell. Sensory detail is present but generic ("amber light," "wild hush," "wind through empty spaces") and rarely filtered through POV urgency. The cobblestones and archway recur, and the bell tuner's footsteps on stone function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the bell seals. Spatial choreography is legible; the tuner walks the square, climbs the tower, exits through the archway. However, setting description often stalls momentum rather than interweaving with action, and the "wild hush" tone is invoked more than embodied through lived sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the town's collapse—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle threatens to derail the bell tuner's work. She walks, listens, walks more; residents join without resistance. The text asserts "balance had been lost" and "the frequency of hope" has grown faint, yet no beat dramatizes what would happen if she failed or what specific cost she pays to succeed. The bell sealing reads as a result of accumulated effort rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is present in her method (footsteps, tuning fork), but no reversal or tightening forces her to choose between competing goods or accept a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—restoration through rhythm, patience, and collective memory—emerges through the pattern of footsteps and the bell's healing. The piece avoids overt moralizing in the final paragraph, instead offering the image of sealed crack and continued footsteps. However, the thematic vocabulary ("frequency of hope," "resonance between them," "harmonize themselves whole") tilts toward abstraction and risks label-speak. The ending invites reflection, yet the bell tuner's cryptic statements ("I rebuild what's breaking… with pattern and resonance") function as thematic echo rather than letting scene work alone. The motif of footsteps recurs with purpose, shaping the closure, but the thematic insight—patience and rhythm heal—feels familiar rather than reweighted by the story's particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to external observation of the bell tuner with occasional dips into residents' impressions ("felt something shift in their chests"). The prose has a measured, fable-like texture ("infinitely slowly," "ghost town remembered how to live") that suits the tone. However, the bell tuner's interiority is opaque by design, and the residents speak in brief, functional lines that lack distinct idiom. Dialogue ("What are you listening for?" / "The frequency of hope") advances exposition but carries minimal subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "appeared") stack in several beats without clear voice motivation. The perceptual signature is consistent but generic; no character-specific bias in noticing emerges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; grammar and usage are clean. However, the prose carries noticeable template cadence and scaffold: "Left foot, right foot, pause" repeats verbatim; "infinitely slowly" and "infinite patience" echo; "hollow-eyed" buildings and "wild hush" read as stock descriptors. Several beats paraphrase prior content without added pressure ("slowly—infinitely slowly—the ghost town remembered how to live" restates the prior paragraph's arc). Figurative language ("heartbeat," "harmonize themselves whole," "frequency of hope") clusters without embodied grounding, and the register drifts toward abstraction ("resonance between them," "collective heartbeat") that clashes with the fable-simple diction elsewhere. The loop and scaffold artifacts do not break causality but dull momentum, especially in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a mystical artisan arrives to heal a dying town through symbolic labor—echoes familiar folktale and magical-realism templates. The bell tuner's cryptic dialogue, timeless appearance, and departure before gratitude can be expressed follow archetypal patterns without fresh transformation. The specific method (footsteps on cobblestones, tuning fork humming notes) offers a concrete anchor, yet the emotional arc and stakes feel generic: hope fades, patience restores, community remembers. The piece commits to its premise but does not surprise; the bell sealing and the collapse that "never came" land as expected outcomes rather than a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cryptic bell tuner is present throughout and her actions (walking, listening with the tuning fork, climbing the tower) drive the plot. However, her choices are unopposed and automatic; no on-page decision narrows options or accepts a trade-off. She observes, explains cryptically, and succeeds without friction. Setup and payoff are clear (arrival → bell sealing), but middle development lacks a moment where her agency is tested by conflicting pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in the opening ("catching the last amber light"), recurs when she holds it to walls and doorframes, and is placed against the bell in the climax. It is handled across at least three beats and its final use (humming a pure note) contributes to the bell's sealing. However, the fork's properties are not meaningfully constrained or its mechanics made specific; it functions as a symbolic prop rather than a tool whose limits shape tactics. The reprise charges the ending but does not reweight prior material with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the explicit premise, signaled early ("dying for decades," "population dwindling") and resolved on the page when the bell seals and "streets were no longer empty." The concept shapes both stakes (prevent collapse) and tactics (footsteps, tuning fork). It is present in setup, development (residents join the rhythm), and payoff (the collapse "never came"). The concept is not merely thematic but alters on-page options: the bell tuner's method is a direct response to the town's condition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is invoked twice ("infinite patience, the kind that comes from understanding…") but never constrains or enables a specific choice under pressure. No beat dramatizes her choosing patience over speed, or paying a cost for moving slowly. The trait is label-only; removing it would not alter any on-page action. Late first articulation (second paragraph) and ornamental use keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" frames the bell tuner's purpose ("I rebuild what's breaking") and shapes her method (walking, listening, bell-tuning). It is present in setup, middle (her explanation to Sarah), and payoff (bell seals, town revives). However, the action is diffuse rather than concentrated in a single decisive turn; the piece accumulates rebuilding across many beats rather than hinging on one irreplaceable moment. The element is essential but not indispensable to a single major reversal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones—is signaled early (second page), developed through middle beats (residents matching her pattern, "Left foot, right foot, pause"), and explicitly linked to closure ("rose from the cobblestones, from the rhythm of footsteps"). The mechanics matter: her walking pattern calls forth memories, settles stones, and generates the note that seals the bell. The method shapes attempts and alters tactics (residents join the rhythm, "maintaining the pattern"). It is present across setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ancient archway appears in opening and closing (she moves through it twice) and is mentioned as humming when footsteps create harmonics. It frames the narrative but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The archway is ornamental setting rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics. Setup and payoff are present, but middle development is absent; removing the archway would require only minor edits to the framing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Three days before the collapse" is invoked in opening and closing but functions as a conceptual frame rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. No beat dramatizes urgency imposed by the approaching deadline; the bell tuner works at her own pace without time pressure. The timeframe is summary-only; removing it would not alter any on-page choice. Late articulation in the final sentence and ornamental use keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Restore shared balance" is articulated mid-story ("balance had been lost—between staying and leaving…") and her method (walking, tuning fork) enacts it. The motivation shapes her actions across beats but is never shown in friction with a competing desire or cost. She explains the goal to Sarah, and the ending confirms success ("you know how to maintain the balance"), yet no on-page moment dramatizes her choosing balance over another want. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but the motivation is told more than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is invoked once ("The wild hush that had settled over Ashwood—that peculiar quiet of abandonment mixed with wind") and modulates slightly ("began to feel less like an ending and more like anticipation"). The tone is coherent and supports the fable-like register, but it remains largely static; no sharp shift in tone marks the escalation or charges the final image with new pressure. The tone is present in setup and referenced in development, contributing a quiet atmosphere to closure without decisive reweighting.</comment>
