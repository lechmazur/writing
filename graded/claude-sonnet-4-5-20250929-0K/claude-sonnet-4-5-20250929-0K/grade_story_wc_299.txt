<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interior life is concrete and embodied—touching the grille cloth, trembling hands, eyes closed for tactile judgment. Internal conflict operates well: he recites facts to insulate against fear, then pivots to trusting instinct despite prior failure. The final choice (trusting feel over certainty) is earned by on-page causality and forecloses the path of defensive fact-recitation with visible cost. Minor slip: Sarah's function is purely utilitarian pressure without her own stakes, and the "confidently uncertain" phrase from the station manager feels like imported exposition rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens is Causal with a lyric accent: Marcus's public failure motivates the quarry job, the bottles trigger memory and doubt, and his decision to trust instinct closes the loop with felt cost (accepting future failure risk). Orientation is swift (quarry trailer, Marcus alone, post-vase-debacle). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he renounces defensive certainty, accepts intuition's fragility, and the grille cloth's final twist signals purpose returning—options are reweighted, cost is palpable. One meaningful tightening (bottles force the crisis of judgment) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry trailer—aluminum, drafty, dust-settled machinery outside—supplies concrete constraint and mirrors isolation. The grille cloth functions as micro-setting (tactile anchor, charged reprise in the final image). Spatial choreography is clean (desk, lamp, crate, door). The trailer's metal space amplifies Sarah's voice "valley-deep," a subtle sensory choice. Setting pressures the choice: Marcus is physically isolated in a failed operation, no escape from his own judgment. Entering 7+ because the trailer and cloth together constrain tone and charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: can Marcus trust his judgment again after public failure? One meaningful tightening: the bottles force him to choose between defensive recitation and vulnerable instinct. Agency is decision with visible cost (risking another failure). Sarah's impatience adds time pressure. The escalation is sufficient—Marcus moves from paralyzed self-doubt to active trust—but the reversal is somewhat compressed; the pivot from reciting facts to "I'm just going to trust what I feel" lands quickly without prolonged tactical struggle. Cost is legible (future vulnerability) but the immediacy of consequence is muted since the appraisal's accuracy isn't tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (purpose after applause, authenticity vs. imposed expertise) emerges from concrete particulars: roadie past, blown speaker, Ming vase failure, bottles in hand. The grille cloth recurs with reweighted meaning (prayer flag → echo of returning purpose). Final image is resonant and non-literal: "echo of purpose… like the last reverb after the lights come up" reweights the opening without moralizing. Marcus's insight is earned through tactile experience, not platitude. Minor thinning: "confidently uncertain" and "wrest some meaning" feel slightly prompted, and the station manager's phrase is tell-only.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (musician's vocabulary: feedback loops, reverb, speaker vibration). Voice modulates under pressure—recitation steadies trembling hands, then breaks into honesty. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Sarah's impatience drives the beat. Minor slips: "valley-deep with concern" is an odd metaphor for voice resonance, and the introspective monologue ("After the applause dies…") edges toward essay register, though it's anchored in the bottle-holding action and tracks Marcus's lexicon (stage, roadie, sound).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences do double duty (grille cloth swaying = loss + roadie identity). Information density is high. Opening and closing images frame cleanly. Weaknesses: "holy silence" is elevated diction that clashes with roadie idiom; "insulating emotionally with facts" is abstract therapy-speak in narration; "valley-deep with concern" mixes vehicle (valley = spatial depth, not vocal quality). Paraphrase-loop candidate: "After the applause dies, after everyone goes home" restates "roar that came after the applause, when crowds dispersed." These artifacts don't obscure closure but accumulate to −0.6 to −0.8 range within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Core synthesis (roadie-to-appraiser, trusting craft instinct over academic facts) is specific and emotionally honest. The grille cloth as talisman and the quarry as isolating crucible avoid cliché. Premise is somewhat familiar (regaining confidence after public failure) but the roadie angle and the tactile appraisal method add freshness. Transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would alter the story's texture significantly. Risk is moderate—no bold structural choices—but the piece commits fully to its emotional logic without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ex-roadie/appraiser duality is signaled early (grille cloth, Marshall stack, '87 tour), creates the Ming vase failure premise, and drives the bottles decision (trusting roadie instinct over academic facts). Two beats: vase backstory shapes stakes, bottles force the climactic choice. Causal pressure: the character's dual identity narrows his options (can't retreat to pure expertise) and the final stance (trust feel) is irreplaceable for this exact background. Present in closure (trusting vibration-sense). Cost: accepting future fallibility. High score because removing the roadie past breaks the story's logic and thematic hinge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Grille cloth appears in beat one (swaying from lamp, tactile anchor), is touched mid-scene (memory trigger), and returns in the final image (twisting in draft, "echo of purpose… last reverb"). Three touches across beginning/middle/end. Lyric reprise reweights meaning (loss → faint return of purpose). Constraint is soft—doesn't alter tactics, but charges the closure image with sensory/metaphorical resonance. Irreplaceable: the cloth's specific origin (Marshall stack, blown speaker) ties to Marcus's roadie identity and "vibration" instinct. Mid-to-upper 6s because it's a charged callback with cost linkage (purpose = sound/reverb metaphor) but doesn't constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After the applause" is voiced early (roar after applause, crowds dispersing, holy silence), shapes the dominant stake (finding purpose after the performance/career ends), and recurs in Marcus's monologue ("after the applause dies, after everyone goes home"). The concept drives his crisis: he's lost the post-show purposeful silence and can't trust his new role. Payoff: final image ("last reverb after the lights come up… something quieter") directly answers the concept with cost (accepting a quieter, less certain purpose). Two beats: memory anchor and climactic insight. Causal: the concept defines what Marcus has lost and what he's trying to recover.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is named once (station manager's assessment, backstory) and implicitly enacted when Marcus hesitates over the bottles (reciting facts while trembling, "Was he certain? Could he be certain?"). The attribute constrains his approach (he oscillates between confidence and doubt) but doesn't create a visible on-page tradeoff—it's more descriptive of his state than a tactical choice-driver. Present in two beats (vase failure context, bottle appraisal paralysis). Not in closure action, though the resolution (trusting despite uncertainty) answers it. Mid-5s: functional in shaping internal conflict but not irreplaceable or cost-linked at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in Marcus's monologue ("I need to wrest some meaning from this") as a verb for his active search for purpose. It's present in the crisis beat but doesn't recur or drive a second turn. Swappable with "extract," "find," "salvage" without structural loss. The action it names (forcing meaning from experience) is thematically apt but not mechanically necessary—Marcus's shift to trusting instinct would work without this exact phrasing. One-beat presence, no closure linkage, replaceable diction. Mid-5s: shapes one moment but isn't load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is explicitly named in narration ("insulating emotionally with facts the way he always did when fear crept too close") and enacted twice: reciting crate details (pine, dovetails, 1880s) and bottle features (hand-blown, typeface). The method shapes his tactic under pressure (defensive recitation as armor) and the climax hinges on abandoning it ("I brought facts to something that needs feeling"). Present in setup, middle, and closure turn. Causal: renouncing this method is the story's decisive shift. Cost: future vulnerability. High-7s because the method is named, demonstrated, and reversed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quarry trailer is anchored early (aluminum box, drafty, limestone dust, machinery shut down) and recurs in spatial description (door bangs, desk, weak afternoon light, "cold trailer at the edge of an empty quarry" in final lines). Setting supplies context (post-failure isolation, bank seizure pressure) and tone (metal space, valley echo). Micro-constraint: the trailer's isolation removes escape routes, forcing Marcus to face his judgment alone. Present in three beats (opening anchor, Sarah's entrance, closing image). Not tactically load-bearing (the choice would work elsewhere) but charges atmosphere and mirrors internal emptiness. Mid-6s: consistent presence, tonal contribution, soft constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after failing publicly," "quarry shut down two weeks," "former owner's collection before bank seizure") is signaled early and shapes stakes (Marcus is in the aftermath, under deadline pressure from bankruptcy). The vase failure is recent enough to wound but not so immediate as to paralyze; the bank timeline implies urgency though no clock ticks on the page. Present in setup (vase debacle context) and implicit in Sarah's impatience. Not tracked beat-to-beat but frames the entire situation. Mid-to-upper 6s: necessary context that constrains Marcus's options (he's already failed, needs this job) but doesn't tighten tactics within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Discovering purpose after loss" is the dominant stake, voiced early (grille cloth as "prayer flag for everything he'd lost," "purpose felt solid" in roadie past) and pursued in every beat: vase failure strips confidence, bottles test whether he can find new ground, final choice accepts a quieter purpose. Conflicted: Marcus wants certainty (facts) but needs instinct (feeling). Two costs: risking another failure, accepting a diminished sense of purpose ("something quieter"). Present in setup, middle crisis, and closure. Causal: the desire drives the entire arc. High-7s because the motivation is dramatized through action (touching cloth, holding bottle, closing eyes) and the friction between want (expertise) and need (trust) creates the turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" coheres through diction (roar → silence → echo, reverb, valley-deep voice) and imagery (quarry = literal valley, dust settling, aluminum box = resonant chamber). Tone modulates: opens elegiac (tattered prayer flag, decades of loss), sharpens during the bottle appraisal (trembling, fear), softens in the monologue (honest vulnerability), and closes with restrained hope (faint echo, quiet sustenance). The valley metaphor charges the final image ("last reverb after the lights come up"). Present across all beats. Consistent modulation under pressure without flatlining. High-7s because tone is coherent, tied to sensory/spatial anchors, and charges closure without forcing symbolic convenience.</comment>
