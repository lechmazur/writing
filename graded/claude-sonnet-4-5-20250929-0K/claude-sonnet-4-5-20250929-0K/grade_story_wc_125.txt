<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interior is concrete and specific in places—"reverence he'd once reserved for particularly elegant metaphors," tracing rope wear "like braille"—but his stakes remain abstract contemplation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The protagonist observes transformation but never faces a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; Sarah's appearance and fade feel like confirmation rather than complication. The renunciation or stance crystallization required for Earned Stasis is absent; Marcus ends where he began, bearing witness without agency-driven cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: rope reading, mandala arrangement, and Sarah's appearance layer meaning without because/therefore linkage. Orientation is clear by the grotto descent. The closure image—Marcus deciding to walk on with new verses, leaving the rope as shrine—offers Conceptual Repricing of "impossible choices" but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no tactic changes, no foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, but the final image reweights abstractly without undeniable pressure or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto, starlight as visible threads, and the rope's wear patterns are vivid and purposeful. The rope functions as micro-setting, its seventeen temporal layers discovered through touch, and it constrains Marcus's reading ritual. The mandala arranges itself across clay floor, shaping the witness act and charging the final shrine image. Sensory detail—candlelight, warm clay walls, rust-red formations—filters through Marcus's poet lens without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's quest to discover meaning in post-arrival fragments—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma. Sarah's appearance offers revelation rather than complication; no reversal or tightening narrows options. The rope reading deepens understanding but imposes no cost or trade-off. Under Accumulative logic escalation reads as density increase, yet the final shrine choice feels ordained rather than pressured; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of "impossible choices" emerges through Sarah's escape layers and the beings' arrival dilemma, grounded in rope particulars rather than abstraction. The final image—shrine under questioning stars—offers resonance without moralizing. However, "impossible only means we haven't evolved our choices yet" edges toward thesis statement, and Marcus's certainty that witness = courage flattens ambiguity. The rope mandala charges thematically but the conceptual answer feels assured rather than earned through friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and literary: "space folded differently now, time leaked at the edges" carries distinct texture. Psychic distance remains stable in Marcus's focalization. Sarah's dialogue—"multiple directions," "infinite variations"—maintains the voice's metaphysical register. However, phrases like "ethically playful, a cosmic koan" and "passionate certainty" drift toward meta-commentary. The perceptual signature is poet-specific but some constructions ("末端 showing not breakage but dissolution") read as authorial flourish rather than Marcus's lived syntax under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in rope-reading passages. Clarity is mostly strong, though "末端" (Chinese character) appears untranslated, breaking immersion. Some template cadence: "Here: where she'd gripped hardest... There: where the rope had caught..." and minor redundancy: "particular to this voice and setting" recaps what "distinct" already conveys. The mandala formation and Sarah's flicker are vivid, but figurative density—"wound in the hillside," "dandelion seeds," "mandala of sorts"—accumulates without pattern-teaching. No major loops, but mid-pressure beats favor description over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The energy-beings premise and rope-as-temporal-archive offer fresh synthesis, and Sarah's probabilistic escape transforms prison-break tropes. However, the post-apocalyptic wandering poet and witness-as-courage arc feel familiar; the emotional beats could transplant to other speculative settings with minor edits. The rope mandala and starlight threads show ingenuity, but Marcus's passive observation and Sarah's tidy validation retreat from bolder stakes. Conceptual risk is present; character risk is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout, but his "choices" are observation and arrangement rather than decisions that narrow options. He picks up the rope, descends, examines, arranges—all scripted witness acts without friction or cost. His decision to walk on and leave the shrine is signaled early and never contested. Present and functional but observation-dominant; no key turn traces to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rope appears in beat one (Route 9 discovery), is examined mid-story (wear patterns, temporal layers), arranged into mandala, and left as shrine at closure. It drives Marcus's reading ritual, Sarah's backstory reveal, and the thematic mandala image. The rope's dissolution末端 and seventeen temporal layers are specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables discovery but does not narrow options—yet it charges the final image meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is named explicitly ("humanity's central dilemma") and embodied in Sarah's escape layers. The concept shapes theme and the rope mandala represents choice-mapping. However, it does not constrain Marcus's on-page tactics or force him into a dilemma; he observes impossible choices rather than facing one. Present in setup and closure thematically, but lacks middle development that narrows his options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" appears once as label: "Marcus found the question ethically playful, a cosmic koan." No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The phrase describes his stance toward the beings' dilemma but does not shape his rope-reading method or shrine decision. Label-only mention without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pattern" appears throughout: wear patterns in rope, starlight threads, mandala spirals, Sarah's "breadcrumbs, these objects of transformation." Marcus reads and arranges patterns, and the mandala formation is a key beat. The action shapes his discovery method and the closure shrine, but could be replaced with "trace" or "map" without major structural loss. Present across beats and at closure, but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled early (uncoiling rope, examining strands) and executed mid-story: seventeen temporal layers, wear patterns revealing grip points and wire-catch moments. The method drives the rope-reading ritual and Sarah's escape reconstruction. It shapes Marcus's witness tactic and the mandala arrangement, appearing in setup, development, and implicitly at closure (shrine as layered meaning). Mechanics matter and enable the discovery arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The grotto provides shelter and stage for the rope reading; its warm clay walls and candlelight frame the ritual. The mandala arranges itself "across the clay floor," and Sarah appears at the entrance backlit by stars. Setting shapes the shrine choice and charges the final image with "glowing faintly under stars." More than postcard—alters tactics by providing contained space for the ritual—but pressure is moderate; the grotto enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is established (three nights post-arrival, Sarah escaped two weeks ago, beings' third manifestation) and colors world-logic (time "pooled," "leaked," "crystallized"). However, time does not tighten Marcus's decisions or create urgency; he has indefinite time to wander and read. The rope contains temporal layers but Marcus's present-tense clock remains slack. Functional world-building but no live countdown altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated: "feeling time's texture in its fibers," "time no longer flowed uniformly; it pooled." The motivation frames Marcus's wandering and rope examination, shaping his witness goal. However, it is told more than dramatized in friction; no competing want (safety, connection, escape) challenges his discovery drive. Present in setup and development, with mild closure linkage (shrine as time-texture artifact), but lacks on-page cost or obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends subdued lyricism with charged images: "wound in the hillside," "starlight fell in visible threads," Sarah "flickering between states." It modulates from contemplative (rope examination) to heightened (Sarah's arrival) without jarring breaks. The final image—shrine glowing under questioning stars—carries passionate restraint. However, explicit passion claims ("passionate certainty") and overt philosophizing occasionally tell the tone rather than embody it. Coherent and purposeful, with moderate charge at closure.</comment>
