<comment>Marcel's motivation is clear and his professional identity anchors his choices, but his interior life remains largely functional rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The dreams provide exposition more than dramatized internal conflict; his decision to close the parlor and descend feels compelled by plot mechanics rather than wrestling with competing values. The ghosts are handled competently but remain a collective presence without individual pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—"strange stillness that had settled in his bones" gestures at interiority but doesn't show contradictory feelings acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Marcel receives the package, dreams provide knowledge, he descends and performs the ritual restoration that allows the ghosts to release. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Tuesday, funeral parlor, Marcel). The closure—ghosts fading after the lens installation and Marcel's acknowledgment—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the library gains "an address," the scholars release their vigil) with visible cost (Marcel's exhaustion, days of labor in liminal time). One weakness: the dreams function as convenient exposition rather than earned discovery, and the underwater journey's impossible physics (breathable atmosphere "through sheer stubborn refusal") arrives without prior setup, reading as a late rule introduction that solves problems it didn't help create.</comment>

<comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered with purposeful impossible geometry: "corridors that bent through time, reading rooms existing in multiple depths simultaneously." Sensory details are selective and atmospheric—brine and decay, bioluminescent light, coral-crusted shelves—and the broken lens returns charged in the climax, transforming the dome into "a cathedral of refracted illumination." The funeral parlor and boat function as transit; the library itself constrains Marcel's work and charges the final image. Spatial choreography of the descent and threshold passage is clean, though the diving bell's mechanics remain vague.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—giving the drowned scholars rest—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Marcel's dreams and his decision to descend, but the middle sequence lacks meaningful resistance or cost that narrows his options; he works "for days or hours" restoring the library without obstacle, and the ghosts cooperate immediately. The climax (lens installation, acknowledgment, release) provides a tightening that reweights the vigil as devotion rather than foolishness, but this reframing happens through declaration ("You can rest now") rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. No visible price paid during the work itself—his exhaustion is mentioned but never constrains tactics.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges clearly through particulars: devotion to knowledge as vigil, rest requiring acknowledgment and proper address, the liminal space between endings and relocation. The broken lens accumulates meaning—distress signal, salvaged relic, restoration tool, refracting cathedral light—and charges the closure without overt moralizing. "They'd needed someone to acknowledge their vigil, to see that their refusal to abandon their posts hadn't been foolishness but devotion" articulates theme a bit directly but grows from prior imagery. The final image of empty dreams provides quiet resonance. One slip: "Death wasn't an ending but a relocation" borders on thesis statement, though it's framed as Marcel's epiphany rather than authorial pronouncement.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Marcel; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, slightly archaic diction that suits the undertaker's perspective and the otherworldly premise—"inadvertently stubborn in their devotion," "eliciting rest a permanent address"—though some phrasing tilts toward elevated register without clear motivation ("occupying the threshold between worlds"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and reflective passages. One weakness: the prose occasionally slips into summary exposition ("The dreams showed him everything") that tells rather than dramatizes Marcel's discovery process. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the single quoted line to the ghosts feels slightly stiff but fits the formal tone.</comment>

<comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively; the final image resolves through concrete detail (empty dreams, glittering surface). Information density is high in the library sequences. However, several passages rely on abstract summary rather than concrete action: "He worked for days or hours—time flowed strangely here—repairing catalogs, shelving scattered books, creating order from chaos" compresses the central labor into generic verbs. Occasional filter-verb stacks ("Marcel understood," "they'd needed") dull immediacy. Minor paraphrase loop: "suspicious absence / strange stillness" and "impossible architecture / architectural impossibility" recycle near-synonyms within close proximity. No major loops or template cadence, but compression of key beats into summary lowers propulsion.</comment>

<comment>The premise—undertaker as ritualist for drowned scholars in an impossible library—offers a fresh synthesis of gothic and maritime elements. The impossible geometry and liminal architecture feel specific rather than generic fantasy. However, the emotional arc (professional called to sacred duty, performs ritual, grants peace) follows a familiar trajectory without significant transformation; swapping Marcel for another caretaker figure wouldn't fundamentally alter the structure. The broken lens as communication device and restoration tool shows ingenuity. Risk-taking in the surreal physics and atmosphere is present but doesn't fully commit—the piece hedges with explanations ("sheer stubborn refusal to acknowledge physical laws") rather than trusting the reader to accept the reality. The scholars' devotion and Marcel's gentle acknowledgment provide emotional truth, but the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through surprise.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Marcel appears in every beat from receipt through descent through restoration through closure. His decision to close the parlor and hire the boat are concrete choices that alter tactics; his work restoring the library drives the middle sequence; his installation of the lens and spoken acknowledgment trigger the ghosts' release. Weariness colors his initial state and final exhaustion but doesn't visibly constrain action during the work itself. The character is essential to the frame but his specific undertaker skills (embalming tools mentioned but never used) prove less integral than his willingness to acknowledge and ritualize.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The lens appears in four distinct beats: arrival in the package (inciting incident), Marcel's packing (preparation), its role as the ghosts' distress beacon (backstory reveal), and its installation in the dome (climactic image that refracts light and enables release). Its fractured state is specific and irreplaceable—"despite its fractures, it caught and multiplied the bioluminescent light, transforming the space into a cathedral of refracted illumination"—and removing it would collapse both the distress-signal logic and the restoration's visual culmination. Early setup, causal middle involvement, and closure transformation all present with visible cost (the scholars' long vigil).</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Distress signals appear explicitly in the dreams ("flickering lights through broken windows, patterns of phosphorescence spelling SOS") and implicitly frame the scholars' vigil and the lens's refracting function. The concept shapes the premise and Marcel's understanding of his mission but doesn't constrain on-page choices during the restoration work—he doesn't decode signals, respond to changing patterns, or adapt tactics based on signal interpretation. Present in setup and thematically at closure (the cathedral light as final transmission), but the middle development treats it as static backstory rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is applied to the scholars ("inadvertently stubborn in their devotion to knowledge") as a label explaining why they stayed as waters rose. This trait shapes the backstory logic—their refusal to abandon posts created the haunting—but doesn't constrain or enable a present-tense choice with visible cost. Marcel's own persistence in navigating by dream-compass and descending could reflect parallel stubbornness, but the text doesn't frame it as inadvertent or explore its costs. The attribute illuminates theme (devotion vs. foolishness) more than it drives action; present in one beat with thematic weight but no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Revitalize" appears explicitly in the resolution: "he began to revitalize the library itself, understanding that these scholars needed their sanctuary restored before they could release their grip." This action—repairing catalogs, shelving books, creating order—occupies the middle sequence and is framed as necessary for closure; Marcel "wasn't here to bury them" but to restore their world. The verb defines his approach and contrasts with traditional burial; removing it would require structural rewrites. The action earns credit for causal centrality, though the actual work is summarized rather than dramatized in specific gestures, limiting how deeply its mechanics shape tactics.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is woven throughout: the library exists "at three different depths" simultaneously, maintains breathable atmosphere, houses "corridors that bent through time, reading rooms existing in multiple depths." This method defines the setting's logic and explains why the scholars are stuck in a threshold rather than fully dead. The phrase appears in Marcel's realization ("these souls had no proper address. They occupied the threshold between worlds") and grounds the spatial horror. However, the mechanics don't constrain Marcel's tactics—he moves through the spaces without navigating their contradictions or using their properties to solve problems. Present in setup and atmospheric development; shapes understanding more than choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The underwater library is introduced in dreams (first third), becomes the descent target (middle), and houses the restoration and closure (final third). Its impossible architecture provides both obstacle (the scholars can't leave) and resource (Marcel's tools work there; the dome accepts the lens). The setting's specific features—flooded stacks, card catalogs opening to different centuries, the central dome—are handled on the page and shape the restoration work and lens installation. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment charges the final image (light refracting through water and glass). Removing this exact setting would break the premise, the method, and the tonal register. Strong setup, causal middle pressure, and indispensable closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Time anchors at "Tuesday" for the package arrival and tracks "three nights" of dreams and "the fourth morning" for departure. Once underwater, time becomes deliberately vague ("days or hours—time flowed strangely here"), which fits the liminal logic but means the timeframe stops constraining decisions. The element establishes sequence and frames Marcel's mounting exhaustion but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics—no ticking clock forces choices. Present in setup; mentioned in middle; absent from closure pressure. Functional for chronology but replaceable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Marcel's motivation—"to give rest a permanent address"—is articulated explicitly at closure and dramatized through his decision to close the parlor, hire the boat, and perform the restoration. The desire grows from his professional identity ("Death wasn't an ending but a relocation, and these souls had no proper address") and his dream-knowledge. Friction appears in the captain's skepticism and Marcel's own exhaustion, though internal conflict about abandoning his living clients or risking his life is minimal. The motivation drives every major beat from packing through descent through restoration through the spoken acknowledgment that releases the ghosts. Causally central with visible cost (labor, risk, closure of business), though the cost could be more dramatized.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>"Chased stillness" captures the piece's tonal register: Marcel pursues the "strange stillness that had settled in his bones," the library exists in "perfect stillness beneath crushing depths," and his final dreams are "blessedly empty." The tone modulates from the brine-and-decay unease of the opening through the mounting dream pressure to the cathedral-light resolution and the quiet relief of the ending. Coherent through turns; the stillness paradoxically intensifies (he chases it by descending into action) before resolving. The tone charges the final image (empty dreams, glittering surface) and is difficult to separate from the piece's atmosphere and thematic weight, though "chased" as an active pursuit is more implicit than dramatized in Marcel's tactics.</comment>
