<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's initial motivation ("quietly inspired by the work") is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her turn from passive observer to active agent arrives late and feels abrupt—the line "Mara's motivation crystallized" tells rather than shows the shift through on-page contradiction or cost. The realization that accelerating hourglasses signal unraveling truth lacks embodied internal friction; Mara moves smoothly into solution mode without struggle. Desta's role as guide reduces Mara's agency in the discovery phase, limiting the protagonist's ownership of the central insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the hourglasses slow as the archive transforms from "tomb of random objects" to "living map of human connection"—but the cost remains abstract. The causality linking button arrangement to visitors' changed behavior is asserted ("They added to the archive") without on-page dramatization of who comes, what they bring, or how the shift occurs. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, so no penalty there. The midpoint tightening (discovery of the pattern) narrows options, but the resolution relies on off-page collective action rather than Mara's decisive choice with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vivid and purposeful: honey-colored light, cavernous space, and the archive's spatial organization ground the premise. The canyon echo jar constrains the final turn—Mara uses it as a tool to demonstrate connection—charging the closure image. Micro-setting details (button archive, chronometers, deep corners) shape Mara's movement and discovery. Minor slip: the cliffs above remain abstract; we never see or feel them as a spatial presence that pressures choice, only as a source of the echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving meaning before forgetting erases it. The accelerating hourglasses create urgency, and the button-pattern discovery narrows Mara's tactical options. However, the resolution bypasses on-page protagonist agency—visitors arrive and contribute off-stage, deflating the cost. The line "The hourglasses began to slow" presents outcome without showing Mara's concrete action or sacrifice that forced the change. One meaningful tightening (pattern discovery) is present, but the closure lacks a visible trade-off or price paid by Mara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (human connection across loss) emerges organically from the button archive and canyon echo without overt moralizing. The final image—"I was here. I mattered. I lost something. I found something. We continue"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The metaphor of buttons as encoded collective wisdom is specific and earned. Minor slip: "Time moves differently when we know we're not alone in it" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature (her attention to chronometers, buttons, echoes). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Desta's single line of dialogue ("We're unscrambling history…") carries subtext and goal, though her voice is not tested against Mara's in extended exchange. Minor tension: the narration occasionally drifts toward elevated registry ("unearthed silence," "prophecy of human behavior") that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon as an hourglass turner. The prose modulates well with emotional beats, compressing when urgency rises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor scaffold: "She began to study the buttons with new urgency" tells rather than showing the study; the next beat jumps to Desta's charts without dramatizing Mara's work. The phrase "shared wisdom written in fragments" is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. No loops or template cadence; figurative language (ribbon echo, amber light) remains coherent and controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—archive of lost objects as living map of human connection—offers a fresh angle, and the canyon echo jar is a specific, non-obvious device. The button-pattern discovery synthesizes archival logic with emotional resonance. However, the core arc (isolated worker discovers collective meaning, opens the archive to visitors) follows a familiar template without a bold structural risk or unexpected turn. The resolution's off-page shift (visitors arrive and contribute) retreats from confronting Mara's personal cost or stakes, choosing safety over dramatic specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in the opening, discovers the button archive and echo jar (middle beats), and places the jar at the entrance to catalyze the ending. Her choice to reframe the archive as a living map drives the closure, but the decision is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page friction. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but her agency in the climactic beat is told, not shown, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar is introduced in the middle third, opened to release the sound (one beat), and placed at the entrance to demonstrate connection (closure beat). It appears in two distinct beats and charges the final image by proving "even loneliness reaches out." However, its late arrival (second third) and lack of early setup limit its causal role. The jar enables the resolution but does not help create the problem it solves.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is present as a thematic claim—buttons encode "wisdom written in fragments"—but it remains abstract. The concept does not constrain Mara's tactical choices or alter on-page options. It echoes in the final reflection ("We continue") but is not dramatized as a force that shapes decisions under pressure. Functional but ornamental, closer to label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is asserted in the opening line but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Mara's inspiration does not create friction with other desires or force a trade-off. The attribute remains a label without behavioral pressure—removing it would not alter the plot or her decisions. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unscramble" appears explicitly in Desta's dialogue ("We're unscrambling history") and implicitly in the button-arrangement work. The action shapes the middle discovery beat (arranging buttons reveals the pattern) and contributes to the closure (visitors see the completed charts). However, the action is shared with Desta and partly summarized ("they worked through the night"), diluting Mara's singular agency. Present in two beats but swappable with "decode" or "interpret" without major structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is introduced early (button archive, Desta's explanation), drives the middle discovery (arranging buttons by chronology and type reveals the pattern), and shapes the ending (completed button charts displayed alongside the echo jar). The method constrains tactics—Mara must work through the archive to find meaning—and its mechanics (sorting by size, material, chronology) matter on the page. Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is anchored early (opening paragraph), supplies resources (button archive, echo jar), and structures Mara's movement through space (deep corners, entrance). The warehouse's transformation from "tomb" to "living map" provides the conceptual frame for closure. The setting pressures choice by organizing the archive's resources and charging the final image. Minor slip: the cliffs remain backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" is signaled by the accelerating hourglasses, which create urgency and tighten Mara's window for intervention. Time pressure shapes her motivation ("Soon, no one would remember") and the resolution reverses it ("The hourglasses began to slow"). However, the mechanics remain abstract—no live clock tracks elapsed hours or deadlines—and the slowing is outcome, not dramatized process. Present in setup and payoff but lacks middle-beat specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is declared in Mara's interiority ("She didn't want the buttons to merely predict repetition") but not dramatized through on-page friction or cost. The desire motivates her final action (placing the echo jar) yet the motivation arrives late (final third) and does not create a visible trade-off or force a choice between competing goods. Functional but told rather than shown through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" anchors tone from the opening ("cavernous space," "barely louder than breath") and modulates with pressure—quiet discovery, nocturnal urgency, the echo's "loneliness and wonder." The tone charges the final image ("In the warehouse's quiet, she heard the echo of countless voices"). Coherent through turns and present in the closure beat, though a single emotional register (contemplative reverence) dominates without sharp contrast.</comment>
