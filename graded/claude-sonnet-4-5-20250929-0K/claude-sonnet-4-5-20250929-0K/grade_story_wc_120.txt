<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is vivid and embodied through the nautilus shell handling and morning ritual, though her epiphany about "translating" rather than "predicting" arrives with light preparation—the shift feels more declared than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The chronological homesickness remains largely a therapist's label rather than constraining specific choices with visible cost. Grandfather's presence is rich but operates as backstory scaffold; the final descent with "ready to write fortunes that sang" tells the transformation rather than dramatizing a renunciation or concrete trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (glass spire, frozen lake, pre-dawn climb). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and memory-mapping build toward the realization that fortunes should "translate" rather than predict, culminating in Mira's shift from hollow prediction to present transcription. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (purpose found, homesickness resolved), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than decisively on-page—she writes thirty pages and descends "ready," yet no live option is visibly foreclosed or path abandoned with material consequence in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are anchored early and sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pre-dawn light through crystalline walls, ice groaning with temperature shift, mirrored horizon dissolving). The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her realization when she presses it against glass and sees its chambers as "a score, a visual symphony." The environment charges the final image—"upturned hush" and "surrounded by spirals and mirrors and light"—though the spire itself does not block or enable a tactical choice during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape hollow fortune-writing) is signaled early. Mira's agency is attention and transcription—she shifts method from predicting to translating—but the escalation is primarily internal realization rather than a choice that narrows live options or imposes visible trade-off. The story delivers one meaningful deepening (grandfather's method reinterpreted), yet the final act lacks a decision that forecloses a competing path with on-page cost; she simply writes thirty pages and descends "ready," with exhaustion arriving as backdrop rather than forcing a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (finding purpose through present attention rather than future prediction) emerges organically from the mirrored horizon, nautilus spiral, and grandfather's translation practice. The final image—Mira descending with nautilus in pocket, "ready to write fortunes that sang"—offers resonance without overt moralizing. The chronological homesickness and "conductor of unheard symphonies" frame the question clearly, though the answer leans toward affirmation without counter-pressure or ambiguity that would deepen complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (nautilus chambers as musical notation, horizon as "visual harmony"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from sensory immediacy to reflective memory without head-hopping. Diction remains character-appropriate, though phrases like "chronological homesickness" and "mapping childhood memories like cartography" edge toward elevated register in peak beats. No dialogue present; interior voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (mirrored horizon, nautilus chambers, grandfather's cosmic symphonies). Minor template cadence in the memory sequence: "Back then, the world hummed... Back then, everything meant something" is purposeful parallelism but borders on decorative. The phrase "upturned hush of dawn settled around her like blessing" in the final third layers elevated metaphor without clear propulsion. No paraphrase loops or factual breaks; clarity and grammar are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writing, nautilus-as-musical-score, and mirrored-horizon symmetry is specific and non-obvious. Execution follows a familiar epiphany arc (isolated artist finds purpose through grandfather's legacy and natural beauty), and the emotional turn—hollow to fulfilled—resolves without friction or competing cost. The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid but not structurally risky; the ending delivers clear transformation without ambiguity or bold formal choice that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her profession frames the hollow-fortune problem. Her decision to "translate" rather than predict drives the ending, and she writes thirty pages, but the pivot is realized understanding rather than a choice that narrows competing options with visible cost. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle beats rely on memory and sensory observation more than active fortune-writing choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nautilus shell appears early (carried in palm, chambers catching light), is handled at the peak beat (pressed against glass, triggering the score realization), and is carried in pocket at closure ("secure in her pocket, ready to write fortunes that sang"). Its spiral chambers are irreplaceable—they unlock the translation metaphor and charge the final image. Three distinct beats and closure linkage with specific causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon is dramatized on-page ("where sky met frozen lake, the world doubled itself perfectly"), triggers Mira's epiphany about symmetry and translation, and dissolves as "sun climbed higher," marking the window in which she completes her transcription. Setup, middle realization, and closure all reference it. However, it remains primarily a catalyst for insight rather than constraining tactical choices or imposing cost; swappable with another symmetry image with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Chronological homesickness is named once ("therapist called it") and contextualizes Mira's longing, but it does not visibly constrain an on-page action or force a trade-off. The trait operates as thematic label rather than decision-shaping attribute. Late first appearance (second paragraph) and no middle or closure beat where it alters tactics or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dawn is setup anchor ("before dawn," "pre-dawn light," "first rays touched the horizon") and the mirrored-horizon effect depends on it. Mira's transcription window ends as "sun climbed higher, dissolving the perfect mirror." The action shapes the closure beat (she captures the moment before light shifts), but the realization about translation could occur at any liminal time with minor edits; dawn is apt but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mapping childhood memories is signaled midpoint ("the method her grandfather had taught her—mapping childhood memories like cartography") and executed on-page (Saturday mornings, telescope, cosmic melodies). The method bridges past and present, priming her shift to transcription. However, it is recounted memory rather than a procedure that constrains present choices; the ending pivot is sensory transcription, not memory-mapping. Setup and development present; closure participation is thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass spire is setup anchor (spiral staircase climb, uppermost chamber, crystalline walls), provides the mirrored-horizon vantage, resonates with wind to produce tone, and frames the closure image ("In the glass spire above the frozen lake, surrounded by spirals and mirrors and light"). It enables her transcription and charges the final moment. Three beats, closure linkage, and environment shapes the peak choice—strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is setup cue ("before exhaustion could claim her again") and closure bracket ("By the time exhaustion finally arrived, she had filled thirty pages"). It provides a soft deadline that motivates her climb and frames the window, but exhaustion does not tighten tactics or force a visible trade-off—it simply marks completion. Present in setup and closure; no middle pressure where the clock alters a decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to conduct unheard symphonies is seeded via grandfather's example (translating cosmic radiation into music) and crystallizes at the ending ("conducting symphonies the world played every moment"). It drives her shift from prediction to translation and charges the closure image. However, the motivation is largely realized understanding rather than conflicted choice with competing cost; no on-page friction between this want and another need that forces sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("upturned hush of dawn") and maintained through quiet sensory accumulation (spire resonance, ice groaning, pre-dawn light) to the closure image ("upturned hush of dawn settled around her like blessing"). The hush modulates with Mira's attention shifts—memory to transcription—and charges the final moment. Coherent and purposeful, though the single static register (reverent calm) limits range; no tonal break or intensification under pressure.</comment>
