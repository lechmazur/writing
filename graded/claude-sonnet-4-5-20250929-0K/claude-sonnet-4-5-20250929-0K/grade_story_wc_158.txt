<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interior life is vividly rendered through her insomnia and transformation metaphor, with embodied choices like keeping the postcard and reading her work aloud. However, the character operates in near-total isolation for 300 years without meaningful internal contradiction or on-page friction between competing impulses. The final beat repeats her established stance rather than testing it with cost; she "began again" without forfeiting a live option or crystallizing a changed hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered metaphors (shell/coral/photosynthesis/galaxy), but the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Orientation anchors are clear early (poet, shell, centuries). The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via repetition of routine ("began again"), yet no visible cost accompanies this return; the final image reiterates rather than reweights prior material. The piece teaches its pattern by midpoint but does not charge the closure with a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vividly established with spiral chambers, nacre, and reef-shadows; sensory details are filtered through the poet's 300-year residence and photosynthesis metaphor. The shell constrains her existence (cave/cathedral both) and recurs in the final image with reef-shadows across poem-covered walls. However, the environment does not materially alter a choice or tactic on the page; it anchors atmosphere without forcing a trade-off. Micro-setting participation earns mid-7s but not higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining her vigil to transform suffering into beauty—is signaled early and coherent. However, no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or live friction tests her commitment; she writes, reads aloud, and begins again without a forfeited path or visible cost. The postcard and wind arrive as observations, not obstacles. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the final beat restates the established pattern with no reweighting of options or stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—longing as beauty, peace with ache—emerges organically through the photosynthesis metaphor, coral-reef imagery, and "blossom armistice" poem. Subtext operates in the galaxy postcard and off-key wind as emblems of imperfect persistence. The final image ("began again") offers continuity rather than a resonant answer; the piece restates rather than reweights the central question. No late thematic echo penalty, but the ending does not deepen the ache with fresh cost or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority is stable and richly textured, with perceptual signature rooted in the poet's metaphor-making ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesized"). Diction remains character-bound and purposeful. A minor register drift appears in "constitutionally unable to achieve" and "ensconcing each mundane detail within metaphor"—slightly elevated phrasing that edges toward exposition—but these do not obscure voice or closure. No head-hopping, no elision debt. Distance is consistent and the prose reflects the mind of the focalizer throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled, sentences vary in structure, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (shell/coral/photosynthesis/galaxy metaphors interlock). However, mild overwriting appears in high-concept beats: "the accumulated weight of all wars, all the centuries of longing" and "converting it through attention's light into oxygen others might breathe" add metaphor on metaphor without propulsion. No loops or scaffold detected. Template cadence does not intrude. Information density is high but occasionally tips into decorative layering rather than advancement. Line-level clarity remains strong enough to avoid artifact penalties, but the piece does not reach the propulsion needed for 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet in a shell, photosynthesis of pain into beauty, and galaxy/spiral motif form a coherent synthesis. However, the premise closely tracks a familiar literary template (isolated artist transforms suffering over centuries) and the story does not meaningfully transform it through lived friction, non-obvious moral calculus, or risky structural choice. The "blossom armistice" poem-within-poem and off-key wind offer fresh inflections, but the arc remains observational and affirms the premise without testing it. Swapping names/places would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and her choices (keeping the postcard, writing "Blossom Armistice," reading aloud) shape beats. Setup is clear; middle beats show her writing process; the ending reprises her routine ("began again"). However, these choices do not create key turns or narrow options with cost—she observes, reflects, and continues without forfeiting a path. The character enables the narrative but does not drive a causal reversal or crystallization. Mid-band functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in paragraph 3, is held and studied in paragraph 9, and returns in paragraph 10 as a reminder of longing's beauty. Three distinct beats with reweighted meaning at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The postcard does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic, but its lyric reprise charges the final image with thematic resonance. Solid integration via recurrence and thematic linkage; not indispensable to story logic but purposeful across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is the title of the poem the poet writes tonight and frames the ending's thematic resolution ("peace with the ache itself"). Present in paragraph 5 and echoed conceptually in the final paragraphs. The concept shapes theme but not tactics or on-page choices; it remains a metaphor rather than a pressure point. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent. Functional thematic integration but swappable with another peace metaphor. Mid-band lyric use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" appears twice as a descriptor (paragraph 2 "worked shyly…proved unstoppable," paragraph 9 "shy and unstoppable"). Setup and closure reprise present, but the trait is told rather than dramatized in a constrained choice. The poet's method is consistent (tucking verses, accumulating poems), yet no on-page beat shows the trait enabling or costing a decision. Label-only use without visible tradeoff; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears once in paragraph 6 ("ensconcing each mundane detail within metaphor"). Late first mention (beyond 40% mark), describes her ongoing method rather than driving a turn. No setup, minimal development, ornamental closure participation. The action could be replaced with "weaving" or "embedding" without structural change. Swappable and summary-only; trends low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies on off-key wind appear in paragraphs 4, 10, and implicitly in the ending. Setup, middle reprise, and closure participation gates met. The wind is observed and added to her mental storehouse but does not shape her method or tactics; it remains atmospheric input rather than a constraint or means. The element is present across beats and contributes thematic resonance (persistence despite inability), but its mechanics do not matter to outcome. Lyric reprise with thematic charge earns mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is established in paragraph 1, houses her vigil throughout, amplifies her voice in paragraph 8, and casts reef-shadows in the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The shell constrains her existence (cave/cathedral, spiral chambers) and supplies the acoustic resource that sends her words into the world. Two distinct beats (amplification, final shadows) and closure linkage. The shell is essential to setting and thematic architecture but does not force a tactical choice under pressure; high integration via recurrence and necessity to atmosphere, borderline indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" frames the premise (300 sleepless years, postcard left two decades ago, accumulated poems). Present in setup and closure but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. The timeframe is backdrop rather than clock; no urgency or countdown constrains her choices. Functional scale-setting but vague and untracked as a live pressure. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Photosynthesizing pain into beauty is stated in paragraph 2, elaborated in paragraph 7 ("taking darkness of pain…converting it through attention's light"), and echoed in the ending's method. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The motivation drives her vigil and writing but is not dramatized in conflict or friction; she enacts it without visible cost or competing want. Told-only desire with thematic consistency; lyric reprise earns 6+ but no higher without on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears in paragraph 4 as "that particular happiness found in dim, filtered places where small bright things survived against odds." Tone is coherent and modulates gently (the poet smiled, the wind "failed beautifully"), supporting the accumulative design. Present in middle and implied at closure (morning light casting reef-shadows). The tone charges atmosphere but does not sharpen under pressure or crystallize in the final image with new weight. Functional mood-setting; lyric reprise without decisive intensification earns mid-5s.</comment>
