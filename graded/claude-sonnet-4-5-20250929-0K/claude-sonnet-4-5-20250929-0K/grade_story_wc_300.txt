<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's professional detachment transforms into purposeful witness through concrete, on-page discovery of artifacts. His interior voice remains consistent, filtering setting through inspector's eyes ("checking ventilation systems and water supplies"). The final choice to "catalog these objects not as inventory but as testimony" demonstrates clear motivation shift. However, the epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly; the move from clinical detachment to emotional mission could have been grounded in one more micro-choice showing internal resistance before acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus's professional purpose reconfigures from inspection to restoration, with visible cost (abandoning detachment, accepting emotional burden). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—discoveries deepen understanding until the final image reweights his mission. Orientation anchors clearly (bunker inspector, crystal caves, present survey). One meaningful deepening occurs when he reads the confession and understands the owner's realization, narrowing his options to witness and return. Cost is legible in "gathered...carefully" and the commitment to find and return, though the transformation compresses quickly in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal caves constrain choice physically (alcove where crystals grow densest houses the shrine) and charge the final image (facets transforming solitary light into radiance that touches every surface). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "faceted walls," "constellations of light," pearl's "inner glow," shell's "minute script." The caves respond to confession ("facets beginning to pulse"), creating environmental pressure that validates Marcus's decision. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (main chamber, alcove, shrine, surrounding artifacts).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding what people lose when they prepare for catastrophe—emerges clearly through the confession and artifact discoveries. One meaningful tightening: Marcus moves from clinical inspection to emotional witness when he reads "hope doesn't survive in vaults." The pearl warming and caves pulsing provide external confirmation that narrows his path to action. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse: he accepts the burden of finding people and returning artifacts, a commitment that will alter his profession permanently. Agency is clean—his choice to gather and catalog drives closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confession and artifacts: preservation versus living, isolation versus connection. The shell's spiral inward "toward some hidden truth" and the pearl's latent-to-alive radiance avoid overt symbolism while charging the concept. The final image—"radiance no longer latent, but alive"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the confession's explicit articulation ("hope doesn't survive in vaults...needs hearts beating in proximity") borders on thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. The closing paragraph's "what makes survival worthwhile" and "dissolve the walls between hearts" risks slight over-articulation of the theme already embodied in image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Marcus's inspector lens colors all perception ("clinical detachment," "catalog these objects not as inventory"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices structural elements first, then emotional artifacts. Diction remains controlled and character-appropriate. The prose modulates effectively from professional assessment to emotional recognition without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "understood") appear but serve the gradual awakening rather than dulling immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as Marcus engages with the confession and artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative structures giving way to shorter declarations at key moments ("He understood his new purpose"). Information density is high—most lines advance discovery or understanding. However, some template cadence appears in the middle section: "He would catalog...He would find...And if they didn't, he would ensure." The phrase "latent radiance" recurs three times, appropriate for the core concept but verging on echo. "Hearts beating in proximity" and "hearts and" repetition in the confession creates minor synonym drift. The closing image "radiance no longer latent, but alive" effectively recharges the opening's latent quality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bunker-as-mausoleum angle and confession-in-shell offer fresh inflection on doomsday-shelter material. The pearl warming and caves responding to witness provides a non-obvious synthesis of setting and emotional arc. However, the inspector-finds-meaning-in-abandoned-place and the redemptive-return-of-lost-objects both trend toward familiar emotional arcs. The specificity of artifacts (paintbrush, sheet music, singed photo) grounds the concept, but the transformation from detachment to mission follows a well-traveled path. The "confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral" provides memorable particularity, though the caves' literal responsiveness (pulsing, brightening) edges toward convenient symbolic confirmation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus as inspector frames expectation early and his professional lens filters all observation. His choice to shift from cataloging for inventory to testimony drives the ending. However, much of his role is observational—he reads, discovers, and decides, but the key turn (understanding the bunker's true nature) arrives through reading rather than active inspection choices that test his expertise. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure commitment, but the inspection work itself could pressure his decision more directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pearl appears in three beats: discovery at shrine, warming in Marcus's hand during confession reading, and implied in the gathering at closure. Its warming provides tangible confirmation of the latent-radiance concept and validates Marcus's shift. However, it functions more as atmospheric confirmation than as an object whose properties constrain or enable specific tactics. Its "inner glow" and warming are described but not manipulated or tested. Present across the arc with reweighted meaning (dormant to awakening), yet its exact properties remain symbolic rather than mechanically integral.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Latent radiance shapes stakes directly: the owner's realization that "hope doesn't survive in vaults" without witness, the pearl's awakening when held, the caves' responsive pulsing, and the final transformation from "solitary light" to radiance "alive." The concept governs Marcus's understanding that preservation requires witness and connection. It appears in setup (pearl's inner glow), intensifies in middle (warming pearl, pulsing caves), and charges closure (radiance no longer latent). The mechanics—dormant beauty requiring witness to ignite—drive both the owner's departure and Marcus's new mission.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus "acquires" the understanding of abandoned hopes through reading and then physically gathers artifacts, but this attribute functions more as closure realization than as a trait constraining earlier choices. The owner collected fears and hopes, then left; Marcus decides to return them. The attribute is present at closure and motivates his new purpose, but it doesn't pressure his actions during the inspection itself. Label-present in the confession and final commitment, but lacks middle development where acquiring/stewarding hopes would create visible tradeoffs or complications.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The word "crown" appears twice: "crown of thorns" in the confession (the owner's burden) and "Crown yourself with these abandoned hopes" as exhortation. Neither instance is a physical action Marcus performs on the page. If "crown" is meant metaphorically as Marcus accepting the burden, that happens through gathering and committing rather than a discrete crowning action. The element is present thematically but not enacted as a distinct beat. Swappable with "accept," "bear," or "carry" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Confessions etched inside the shell's spiral are signaled early, shape the middle revelation (Marcus reads the spiral inward "toward some hidden truth"), and the confession's content directly changes his understanding and purpose. The spiral mechanic—moving inward toward core truth—mirrors Marcus's journey from surface inspection to emotional core. The method's specificity (minute script along spiral interior, requiring tilt toward light) grounds the discovery and makes reading a physical, effortful act. Present in setup, drives middle understanding, and the confession's final line directly commands the closure action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves are essential across all beats: the faceted walls multiply light and create the "constellations," the alcove's dense crystal growth houses the shrine, the caves' reflective properties respond to the confession by pulsing, and the final image depends on facets transforming solitary light into radiance touching every surface. The setting is not merely backdrop—its optical properties make latent radiance literal and dramatize the theme's mechanism. Removing this exact setting (substituting a concrete bunker, for instance) would collapse the light-multiplication mechanics and the environmental confirmation of Marcus's shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The phrase "during the heartbeat of a hesitation" appears once when Marcus reads the confession's first line and "understood." It marks the pivot moment when his purpose shifts. However, the timeframe doesn't constrain later choices or create urgency—the inspection proceeds at contemplative pace. The heartbeat image is vivid and marks the threshold of understanding, but the story doesn't maintain or return to this micro-temporal pressure. Present at a key turn with charged specificity, yet it functions more as a lyric marker than as a live clock altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to dissolve the walls between hearts" appears explicitly in the confession's final command and implicitly drives Marcus's closure decision to return artifacts and reconnect people. It is seeded (owner's isolation, people's retreat), developed (confession's realization that hope needs "hearts beating in proximity"), and enacted (Marcus will find people and return fragments). However, the motivation is the owner's articulated insight that Marcus adopts rather than a desire Marcus wrestles with. It shapes his final purpose but doesn't create friction or cost during his discovery; he accepts it rather than struggles toward it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant hush is established in the opening ("silence so profound...heartbeat echoing"), maintained through quiet discovery beats (no dialogue, contemplative pace), and charges the final image ("resonant hush of the crystal caves" explicitly named before closure). The tone modulates appropriately—clinical opening, wonder during discovery, solemn commitment at closure—without breaking the hush. The caves' acoustic properties (echo, silence, resonance) integrate the tone into setting mechanics. The final brightening occurs within the hush rather than shattering it, keeping tone coherent through transformation.</comment>
