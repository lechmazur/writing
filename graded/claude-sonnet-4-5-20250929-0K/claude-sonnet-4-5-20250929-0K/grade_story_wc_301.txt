<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior life is concrete and embodied—wading deeper, recording observations, adding graffiti responses—and her hydrologist background shapes her perceptual lens. The medication-stopping frame drives her raw sensory recalibration and her methodical approach creates character-specific tension. However, the final turn ("Subject remains upright") feels more stated than earned by prior on-page struggle; the journey toward self-forgiveness is reflected upon extensively but lacks a decisive interior contradiction forcing a visible choice with cost at closure. Backstory integration is functional but edges close to the reflection ceiling without always tilting present stance through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (disused station, three weeks post-medication, river chronicler) land by the first paragraph. The piece tracks an Accumulative/Textural lens: daily wading progression, graffiti dialogue, and the accordion's visible repairs build pressure through pattern and intensification rather than causal reversals. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis moving toward Charged Poise)—Maya positions herself to return tomorrow with her raw attention, the river teaching acceptance without judgment—but the cost is more conceptual (ongoing vulnerability) than viscerally legible in the final image. The "path she'd been chronicling all along" risks telling the closure rather than showing a decisive reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ivy-claimed railway station is richly specific (rusted benches, shattered windows, crumbling bathroom, station master's office) and filters through Maya's hydrologist lens. The river's current physically tests her on day twenty-nine, water rushing past her thighs while she holds the journal high—micro-setting constrains the wading choice. The accordion's taped bellows return in the final third to charge the ending image (repairs as unapologetic persistence). Spatial choreography stays clean across platform, bathroom, office, and river's edge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding self-forgiveness—is signaled early and pressured through daily wading progression and graffiti wisdom. The twenty-ninth-day wading to river's center offers a tightening (deeper water, held journal, recorded clarity: "Subject remains upright"), but the escalation reads more as symbolic deepening than a choice that forecloses a path with visible consequence. The graffiti exchange and accordion reframing provide textural intensification under the Accumulative lens, yet the final "current you learn to swim in" realization feels reflective rather than enacted through a decision with on-page cost. Agency is present (wading, writing, positioning the accordion) but the price paid remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The river-as-mirror theme emerges through concrete particulars: sediment from upstream, contamination traveling invisibly, systems failing under pressure. The graffiti dialogue ("forgiveness flows downstream, never up" evolving to "What if forgiveness isn't a destination but a current you learn to swim in?") develops the question without overt moralizing. The accordion's visible repairs offer a resonant non-literal answer—mending as persistence—though the final paragraph's "truth, like water, doesn't judge its own course" edges toward stating the thesis. The ivy's patient resurrection and the station's simultaneous unmaking/remaking provide thematic texture, but the ending leans slightly toward summary of what Maya "was beginning to glimpse" rather than an image that reweights prior material without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with Maya's hydrologist perception signature (flow rates, water quality, coordinates, sediment metaphors) filtering every observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during wading, wider during reflection—and the "daringly methodical" lens holds. The graffiti dialogue feels authentic and advances thematic pressure. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "raw and solace-seeking attention" and "testament to stubborn preservation," which elevate slightly beyond the POV's spoken idiom during crisis, but the voice remains coherent and the scientific precision anchors her particular way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "raw with feeling" / "raw and solace-seeking attention," "precision could anchor her" / "daringly methodical," "claimed / claiming dead spaces." The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("moving timelessly forward while somehow remaining itself, teaching her what she'd come to learn") that summarize rather than propel. The accordion's "repairs upon repairs testament to stubborn preservation" and "elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect" carry elevated diction that doesn't fully match the established voice under pressure. Figurative language (river as mirror, ivy as resurrection) remains coherent but is present in most reflective beats without pattern-teaching or decisive payoff at closure, triggering mild overwriting concern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hydrologist-off-medication-at-abandoned-station frame offers a fresh angle on self-forgiveness narratives, and the graffiti dialogue creates texture beyond solitary reflection. The accordion with visible tape repairs provides a specific, non-obvious through-line. However, the river-as-teacher and ivy-reclaiming-ruins motifs are familiar, and the emotional arc (raw → methodical observation → acceptance) follows a recognizable template. The "forgiveness flows downstream" wisdom and its bathroom-wall evolution risk proximity to therapy-speak metaphor conventions. Transformation is present (Maya shifts from observation to participation by wading deeper) but the final insight ("truth doesn't judge its own course") resolves into a tidy synthesis that hedges bold specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout, and her observations drive daily structure. Her choices—wading deeper each day, photographing graffiti, adding her own messages, positioning the accordion—create incremental turns. The day-twenty-nine wading to river's center is the strongest decision beat, though it's more symbolic deepening than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path with immediate consequence. Her chronicler role shapes perception but trends toward observation over agency at the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The accordion appears in paragraph four (found in station master's office, bellows patched with tape, wheezing when knocked), returns in the penultimate paragraph where Maya sees the repairs differently ("so visible and unapologetic"), and she positions it deliberately in afternoon light before leaving. It's handled twice with reweighted meaning and its "repairs upon repairs" quality charges the self-forgiveness theme. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—Maya observes it, doesn't play it—so it functions as thematic echo more than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Map references appear explicitly once: "coordinates marking where she'd last felt whole, tributaries named for choices that had redirected everything, depths measured in regrets." Maya records coordinates on day twenty-nine. The concept is present and thematically consistent (hydrologist mapping her recovery), but it doesn't shape on-page stakes or alter tactics—it's a lens for reflection rather than a mechanism that changes options. Swappable with "journal entries" or "scientific notation" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is labeled in paragraph three ("she was daringly methodical in her approach, pushing herself to wade deeper...while maintaining rigorous scientific notation"), and the trait is demonstrated through the daily wading progression paired with water quality readings and flow calculations. The cost—"as if precision could anchor her against the vertigo of unmedicated consciousness"—is present but mostly reflective. The trait enables her to wade on day twenty-nine and keep the journal dry, a visible action with mild embodied cost, but the tradeoff isn't decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Allude" appears in paragraph five: "She began alluding to her past through careful metaphors, writing about how the river carried sediment...how systems could fail." This indirect communication method shapes her journal entries and connects to the graffiti dialogue (both oblique). The bathroom graffiti exchange is the clearest enactment—she alludes rather than declares. It's present in the middle development and informs her final graffiti question, but the climactic day-twenty-nine beat relies on direct recording ("Subject remains upright") rather than allusion. Not easily swappable, but doesn't redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bathroom graffiti wisdom is introduced early (paragraph three: "Forgiveness flows downstream, never up"), photographed and added to her chronicle, shapes the reflective question in paragraph six, prompts her to contribute her own messages (paragraph seven and later), and receives an anonymous response that influences her thinking. Her final graffiti ("What if forgiveness isn't a destination but a current you learn to swim in?") is the penultimate paragraph's anchor. The method is signaled, repeated across beats, and directly shapes the thematic progression—removal would collapse the dialogue structure driving her evolving stance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is established in the opening line, supplies the bathroom (graffiti site), station master's office (accordion location), and platform workspace. The ivy's daily progress is documented with the same care as the river (paragraph eight), and the "cathedral of green silence" provides the sanctuary enabling her work. The river's eastern edge position anchors spatial choreography. The setting doesn't constrain a choice under pressure (she can access all areas freely), but it provides the resources (graffiti, accordion, river proximity) that enable the narrative's three-part structure and charges the final image (afternoon light on the accordion, the station being unmade/remade). Essential backdrop that shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Three weeks after stopping the medication" is anchored in the first paragraph, and "day twenty-nine" marks the wading climax. The timeframe establishes her raw sensory state and tracks progression, but it doesn't tighten decisions—there's no countdown or urgency. The twenty-nine days accumulate evidence rather than impose a live clock. The medication-free window matters thematically (relearning perception) but doesn't alter tactics under pressure. Functional setup, minimal development, no closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is named in paragraph six ("what did that mean for someone trying to forgive themselves?") and drives the graffiti dialogue and river metaphors throughout. Maya's daily wading and observation are framed as seeking this path. The desire is dramatized through her adding messages, wading deeper despite cold water, and documenting her state. However, the friction between wants and costs is mostly internal and reflective—no on-page scene forces her to choose between self-forgiveness and another live stake. The final "path she'd been chronicling all along" tells the attainment rather than showing a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Raw solace is present from the opening ("raw with feeling," "green silence where she could finally hear herself think") through the ending ("raw and solace-seeking attention"). The tone modulates with pressure: softer during observation, sharper during the day-twenty-nine wading ("water rushing past her thighs"), reflective during the accordion reprise. The accordion's "wheezing breath" and the "patient resurrection" of ivy maintain the raw-yet-gentle texture. The final image—positioning the accordion in afternoon light, the river "refusing nothing"—charges the tone with acceptance without flattening its raw edge. Coherent and present, though static across turns rather than escalating with conflict.</comment>
