<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the patchwork jacket, calloused fingers, and sternum-pull sensation. The progression from observer to builder to understanding is earned through on-page physical engagement with objects. Internal conflict operates through contradictory pulls—the reverse migration's tug versus her need to navigate what remains—without therapy-speak. The final choice to "build in earnest" for future navigators forecloses passivity with visible cost, though the brother/mother losses feel briefly mentioned rather than charged throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (station, three weeks dead, Mara alone) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout, building density through the midnight calls, salvaged tech assembly, and patina observations. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the realization that the migration moves toward temporal density rather than place, with Mara's counter-stance ("I navigate what remains") creating Charged Poise—options crystallized with felt cost even if not yet paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding shifts from spatial to temporal navigation, reweighting all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dead station with broken dome, observation deck, and abandoned technology functions as micro-setting that supplies the gyroscopes and magnetic cores essential to Mara's device. The bronze censer foot serves as both object and conceptual anchor, its patina shifting constraining her interpretive choices. Sensory detail (starlight through broken dome, patina colors) is selective and tied to discovery moments. The coastal temple, repair shop, and valley below provide spatial coherence for the reverse migration without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the migration occurs—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's assembly work and midnight conversations. The reversal when patina reveals duration rather than direction narrows her interpretive frame and enables the final insight. The device functions as protagonist-driven escalation, each component choice building pressure toward the dawn realization. Cost is legible: Mara accepts solitude and the "different kind of weight" to serve future returnees, foreclosing the option to follow her family.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reverse migration concept: collective memory creating gravitational pull versus individual navigation of loss. The bronze patina functions as chemical calendar rather than mere symbol, encoding time through decay. The final insight—"They're trying to build it backward, memory by memory, until loss becomes impossible"—arises from concrete device assembly rather than assertion. Mara's counter-choice to navigate "what remains" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, the "raw solace" settling as earned stance rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: navigation charts as fabric, corrosion as map, device-building as answer. The midnight caller's voice carries purposeful mystery without withholding facts Mara knows. Diction matches the technical-mystic register consistently ("temporal density," "gravitational well of shared history"). The phone dialogue advances plot through cryptic guidance that Mara interprets via physical engagement. Distance modulates appropriately from external observation to intimate interiority at the sternum-pull moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The phone rang at midnight, as it had every night since she'd arrived" versus the longer device-assembly sequence). Information density is high: the jacket description simultaneously establishes character, world-state, and thematic direction. Minor template cadence appears in "traced…remembering…moved" sequence and the "Green toward…black toward" construction feels slightly mechanical. The "fish-line wrapped around her heart" is vivid but borders on stock metaphor. Closure image ("began to build in earnest") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The reverse migration premise transforms the familiar "going home" trope through temporal rather than spatial magnetism—people seeking collective memory density to "bend time itself into return." The patina-as-calendar innovation feels earned and specific. The midnight-call structure could trend toward mystery cliché but the caller functions as catalyst rather than oracle, with Mara's physical assembly driving discovery. The patchwork jacket of failed expedition maps is a fresh, character-specific detail that encodes theme without forcing. Risk-taking in the abstract physics concept succeeds without obscuring emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all key turns: assembling salvaged components, interpreting the patina, arranging gyroscopes in response to the caller's guidance, and reaching the temporal-density insight through hands-on building. Her final decision to "navigate what remains" for future returnees forecloses following her family. Present in opening, middle assembly, and closing stance with causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot appears in three distinct beats: lifted from workbench with patina description, observed shifting green-to-black under starlight leading to duration insight, and rotating at device center during dawn operation. Its specific property (oxidation as chemical calendar) enables the temporal-density realization. Irreplaceable: the inherited altar fragment carries both personal loss and functional discovery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reverse migration shapes every stake and tactic: Mara's brother and mother's departures create the dominant loss; the abandoned technology trail supplies her device components; the pull's fluctuation with moon phases constrains her timing; the collective movement toward temporal density structures her final understanding. The concept defines both problem and solution space, making it indispensable to plot logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is signaled mid-story by the caller ("Stronger at the dark, weaker at the full") and constrains Mara's experience ("the moon thinned toward darkness, and she felt it in her sternum"). It shapes the timing of her final device operation at dawn after the moon thins. Present in setup and payoff with modest causal pressure, though the constraint could be more actively limiting her choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Building drives the entire narrative: salvaging components from the valley, arranging gyroscopes, wiring magnetic cores, interpreting the caller's guidance through assembly choices. The act transforms from unconscious gathering ("building for weeks, though she hadn't known what") to purposeful device construction to the climactic dawn operation that yields understanding. The closing "began to build in earnest" reweights all prior work. Removing this action collapses plot, character arc, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cryptic midnight calls structure the narrative: the opening "phone rang at midnight, as it had every night"; the patina-direction guidance; the moon-phase explanation; and Mara's proactive final call ("picked up the phone before it could ring"). The method shapes her interpretive process, delivering information that redirects her assembly work. The caller's smoke-textured voice and elliptical style are consistent and functional throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dead signal station supplies essential resources (salvaged gyroscopes, magnetic cores, observation deck workspace) and creates isolation that forces Mara's solo problem-solving. The broken dome allows starlight that triggers the patina insight. The locked antenna pointing "uselessly toward a constellation that no longer mattered" establishes obsolescence theme. The valley below provides the trail of discarded tech. Setting actively constrains and enables throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The three-week timeframe since hydraulic failure is established early and frames Mara's device-building duration. The story tracks time progression (weeks of assembly, midnight calls "every night since she'd arrived," moon thinning, dawn breakthrough) with the temporal anchor shaping the assembly's gradual nature. However, the timeframe doesn't create urgent pressure or deadline that alters tactics; it marks duration rather than tightening choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Navigating loss is dramatized through every major choice: studying the geography via brother's abandoned wrench and mother's cooling dinner, interpreting patina as map, building the device to understand why rather than following the pull, and finally accepting the "different kind of weight" to serve future returners. The friction between the sternum-pull toward family and the need to "navigate what remains" creates authentic tension with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Raw solace coheres throughout: the dead station's beauty, the midnight caller's smoky guidance, Mara's solitary competence, the patina's shifting colors, and the ending's acceptance of purpose despite loss. Tone modulates appropriately from opening melancholy through assembly focus to the closing "raw solace of that purpose settled into her bones"—the exact phrase charging the final image without sentimentality. The phrase "raw solace" appearing verbatim in the closure beat demonstrates purposeful tonal design.</comment>
