<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's interior life shows texture through professional expertise and the grandmother's memory, but her decision to copy old files lacks genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page friction between competing goods. Her "softly deliberate certainty" describes a fait accompli instead of dramatizing the cost of foreclosing alternative paths. The grandmother's dream carries weight, but Sera's present-tense emotional complexity remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Sera, archive, tonight). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the comparison sequence, pattern breaks when Sera grasps the corruption mechanism, and the final copying decision reweights the dominant stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her stance and reconfigures the archive's purpose with conceptual cost (she'll distribute difficult dreams). The cost is felt but primarily conceptual; the social or professional price remains offstage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blooming library's glass petals and cloud-height setting charge the atmosphere and recur purposefully at closure. The river stone constrains Sera's hand across three beats and anchors the grandmother's memory, charging the final console placement. Spatial choreography through the stacks is clear. The archive's verticality and the dusk clouds mirror internal states without overt symbolism, and the comparison console serves as micro-setting that enables the key discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve authentic hope vs. archive corruption) signals early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera compares footage and realizes shared dreams are "killing" hope—this narrows options and drives the copying decision. The escalation is cognitive rather than external, fitting the Accumulative lens. Visible cost is modest: Sera will distribute harder, less comforting dreams, but the on-page price (professional risk, community friction) remains implied rather than dramatized in a confrontation or refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (authentic vs. commodified hope; shadows as proof of substance) emerges through the footage comparison and the grandmother's "luminous regret" rather than assertion. The shadow-unbound concept integrates thematically but stays abstract; it reweights prior material without becoming mechanical. The final image (stone beside copied files, dusk light-and-dark) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One deduction: "luminous regret" and the shadow metaphor veer toward the prompt's lyric language rather than idiomatically grounded particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate steps," archive-professional lexicon. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("metamorphosed before her eyes," "saturated with luminous regret") occasionally drifts into elevated register during key beats, but the compression feels voice-motivated rather than template-driven. The rhythm modulates cleanly from expository beats to the decision moment. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Figurative language clusters in the middle comparison section ("liquid starlight," "saturated with luminous regret," "painted the clouds in shades of amber and ash") without obscuring causality, though the density approaches decorative at the grandmother's-dream paragraph. One paraphrase loop: the shadow-unbound explanation in paragraph 9 restates the prior comparison conclusion. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor filter-verb stack ("had become," "had been") in the comparison beat is functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (shared dreams commodified, authenticity lost) is familiar from Black Mirror and nostalgia-tech critiques, but the archive setting and professional archivist lens add specificity. The shadow-unbound metaphor transforms "darkness as necessity" through the light-and-shadow physics conceit. The grandmother's unshared dream and the focus-grouped flowers provide fresh detail. Risk is modest: the piece commits to its lyric mode but avoids structural boldness or a non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sera's noticing triggers the comparison and drives the copying decision across two beats. Her professional trait (sharp-eyed dusk noticer) is named early and demonstrated through the footage analysis, then returns in the penultimate paragraph to charge the dusk imagery. The observation enables the key turn, but the decision itself lacks on-page friction or competing pressure, lowering causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>River stone appears in three beats: initial hold (paragraph 2), warming during realization (paragraph 8), and final console placement beside copied files (paragraph 11). It anchors the grandmother's memory and gains symbolic charge through recurrence. The stone's warmth moment reads passive (it "grew warm") rather than Sera making a choice with it. The final placement reweights it as a talisman but doesn't constrain a tactic or enable an action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shadow unbound" is explained thematically in paragraph 9 (dreams cast no shadows, are flat) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Sera does not face a choice between light and shadow, nor does the concept constrain her method. It remains a metaphor for the theme rather than a story engine. Present in setup (implied by corruption) and closure (dusk light-and-dark) but ornamental at the middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice: describing Sera's steps through the stacks and her decision certainty. It colors her manner but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—she could move quickly or hesitantly without altering the plot. The trait signals temperament rather than creating friction or a tradeoff in a pressure moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphosed" appears once when differences in footage become clear to Sera, triggering her realization. This verb marks the key cognitive turn that drives the copying decision. It is setup for the major choice but not repeated or used in a way that makes its exact properties (transformation, irreversibility) mechanically necessary. Swapping for "became clear" or "emerged" would weaken the lyric charge but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage from 2087 vs. 2142 is signaled early (paragraph 4), occupies the middle analysis beats, and directly produces the corruption insight that drives Sera's decision. The method's mechanics (frame-by-frame, old vs. new) matter: she finds the differences by juxtaposition. It shapes the attempt and enables the realization. The specificity (silent video, grainy, decades apart) is plot-essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blooming library three thousand feet above clouds is established in the opening line, recurs in the spiral chamber description, and returns in the final paragraph to frame the closure image. The verticality and glass walls provide atmosphere and a lyric anchor but do not pressure Sera's choice—she could perform the same comparison and copying in a ground-level archive. The dusk view charges the ending but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe (after dreams become shareable, spanning 2087–2142) is established in paragraph 1 and drives the entire premise: commodification occurs over decades. The comparison method depends on this span. Sera's motivation (preserve pre-algorithm dreams) is unintelligible without the timeframe. The fifty-five-year arc shapes the corruption mechanism and the stakes, making it essential to causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sera's motivation to preserve hope's shape is named in paragraph 10 and enacted through copying. It is dramatized in her choice but lacks on-page friction—no cost (job risk, community backlash) or competing want (safety, approval) tests her commitment. The desire is present in setup (implied by her noticing role), middle (realization), and closure (copying files), meeting all three gates, but the choice feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luminous regret is named for the grandmother's dream (paragraph 7), colors the dusk description (amber and ash), and charges the final line ("luminous regret of dusk"). The tone modulates from archival neutrality through discovery to the bittersweet closure image, staying coherent under emotional pressure. It saturates the ending without becoming static or melodramatic, and the oxymoron (luminous + regret) reweights hope and loss throughout.</comment>
