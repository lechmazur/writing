<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her editor's eye for pattern is character-specific, but her certainty ("as if she already knew what she'd find") undercuts genuine struggle. The final choice to drill is presented as predetermined rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Petrov functions as a sounding board without applying meaningful pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves from observation to departure without friction or stakes that test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Charged Poise: Mira steps onto ice "older than cartography" with beacon active, crystallizing her readiness to herald the discovery. The cost is implied through years of preparation and isolation but remains atmospheric rather than dramatized. Orientation anchors quickly (falcon, outpost, frozen lake). The accumulative lens (condensation pattern → satellite data → falcon tracking → departure) coheres, and one meaningful tightening occurs when the falcon's return confirms her hypothesis. Causality holds within the contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensation on glass create vivid atmosphere. The ice constrains Mira's timeline ("finally thin enough") and the outpost's decay signals isolation. Sensory detail is selective (ice crystals on falcon wings, breath patterns, rust-streaked walls). However, the setting primarily frames rather than pressures choice; Mira's departure feels scheduled rather than forced by environment. The final image of "ice older than cartography" charges the ending but the micro-setting does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the singular convergence point—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is primarily accumulative rather than escalatory: condensation → falcon data → departure. The falcon's three-day return provides one tightening moment, but Mira's subtly confident posture means no live option is foreclosed with visible struggle. Her choice to drill is presented as inevitable confirmation rather than a trade-off. The piece lacks a second pressure point or complication that would test her commitment with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: water tracing origins, cartographic errors revealing hubris, myths rooted in physical truth. "The method matters as much as the discovery" and "water itself pointed the way home" carry subtext without moralizing. The ending image (ice older than cartography keeping secrets) reweights prior material with quiet resonance. No forced epiphany; insight accrues through years of editing rivers. The final condensation pattern fading as Mira departs creates earned ambiguity about whether discovery will remake understanding or remain hidden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature is distinct: she reads meaning in ephemera, traces convergence, spots cartographic errors. Diction fits her technical background ("tributary maps," "hydrological," "watershed patterns"). Petrov's dialogue ("You're still chasing ghosts") and Mira's dry correction establish voice contrast. Psychic distance remains consistent. Vocabulary choices like "worrying tranquility" and "ghost of its convergence" are purposeful. One minor slip: "subtly confident posture" is told rather than shown through gesture, though the trait manifests in her speech and certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong imagery ("ice crystals frosting its wings," "circles within circles"). Rhythm varies and information density is high. However, several template stems appear: "She had learned," "She had seen," "She had photographed," "She had her gear ready—had kept it ready." The phrase "worrying tranquility" appears twice verbatim. Metaphors are coherent. The final paragraph's short declarative sentences create effective cadence. Minor filtering ("She pulled out her tablet") slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—climate change revealing a hidden river source beneath Arctic ice—offers a fresh angle on origin myths. Mira's profession (atlas editor who catches cartographic errors) feels specific. The convergence of condensation, falcon tracking, and decades of hydrological data creates earned discovery rather than convenience. However, the execution follows a familiar contemplative-preparation-to-action arc. Mira's certainty from the opening undercuts surprise. The piece commits fully to its premise but lacks a bold complication or moral calculus that would elevate freshness into the upper bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout, frames the quest, and her editor's eye for pattern drives the discovery. Her dry-witted correction of Petrov ("Not ghosts...Just following the water") and her decision to document "the way it reveals itself" show character-specific choices. However, the final choice to depart with gear is presented as inevitable rather than a turn. She observes and interprets more than she decides under pressure. Present across all three gates but causally passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears once in Petrov's introduction ("kept his phrasebook in his breast pocket, its corner dog-eared from constant consultation—a habit from when the outpost had hosted researchers from twelve nations"). Described but never handled or revisited. No mechanical use, no reweighted meaning. Purely ornamental backstory detail that could be cut without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Singular convergence is seeded early (condensation droplets flow to "a singular point"), developed through Mira's hydrological analysis ("every major river system...should originate within forty kilometers"), and drives her departure to find "the singular point from which countless waterways had once flowed." The concept shapes her motivation and the story's stakes. It appears in all three gates and the final image gestures toward it ("what it had been keeping cold and secret"). However, convergence does not constrain a tactical choice or create visible friction; it remains thematic rather than operationalized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is told once ("Petrov studied her subtly confident posture") and shown through Mira's certainty ("as if she already knew what she'd find"). It enables her willingness to depart alone but does not constrain or create a tradeoff. No moment where confidence costs her or forces adaptation. Present in setup and implied at closure but not tested under pressure. Label-heavy and one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Herald" appears twice: Mira says "we herald it properly" and the final line states she is "ready to herald the discovery." The action frames her intent to document and announce but is not dramatized on the page. She prepares to herald rather than heralding; the story ends before the act. Present in middle and closure framing but not executed as a turn. The method of heralding (falcon beacon, documentation) is mentioned but not shown altering her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Condensation pattern is introduced early ("breath forming patterns on the thick glass window—circles within circles"), analyzed mid-story ("condensation traced a single point where all droplets seemed to flow"), and revisited at departure ("studying the pattern on the glass one final time...had photographed it, had documented the method"). The pattern teaches Mira that "water itself pointed the way home." Present across all three gates and charged at closure. However, the method does not mechanically constrain her attempts or create friction; it confirms rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake anchor all action. Mira watches from the observation deck, keeps gear in the outpost, and walks onto the lake in the final beat. The lake's thinning ice enables her departure ("the ice finally thin enough"). The setting provides atmospheric pressure (isolation, two winters of preparation) and the final image ("ice beneath her boots was older than cartography") charges closure. Present in all three gates. However, the setting does not force a tactical adaptation or create a resource constraint; it stages rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the title and opening ("The falcon returned at dawn") and brackets the story (three days out, three days back = six days). However, time does not tighten decisions. Mira's departure feels scheduled rather than urgent. No clock pressure, no deadline that alters tactics. The falcon's return triggers narration but not a crisis. Functional framing but replaceable; the story would work identically if the falcon had returned "yesterday" or "last week."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is seeded early ("find where the rivers begin"), developed through years of editing river systems and noticing "watershed patterns never quite balanced," and drives her departure to "taste the water that fed continents." Petrov calls it "obsessive" and Mira acknowledges the mythological pull. Present across all three gates and tied to closure ("redraw every map she'd ever edited"). However, the motivation is told and explained more than dramatized under friction. No moment where her desire conflicts with cost or another want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" appears twice: "the worrying tranquility of the morning pressed against the windows" and "She stepped into the worrying tranquility of the frozen morning." The oxymoron creates atmospheric tension (calm that unsettles) and fits Mira's poised readiness. The tone is coherent through contemplation and modulates slightly at departure. The phrase charges the final image by making stillness ominous. However, tone does not shift meaningfully under pressure; it remains static rather than escalating or breaking.</comment>
