<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's scarred identity and obsessive firefighting read as consistent traits, and his choice to return the box to his daughter is motivated by the ridge-path reflection. However, the piece leans heavily on summary-mode backstory (the Riverside fire, the girl, the marriage collapse) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final choice feels announced more than tested under live pressure, and the interiority occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("bargained innocence," "translate everyone's pain") that no one would use mid-crisis. The moment where he reframes the crack as "where light got in" edges toward epiphany cliché without sufficient on-page cost to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/reflective lens: Marcus walks, reflects on past fires and family rupture, and arrives at a decision to take leave and reconnect with his daughter—a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost (foregoing the fire tower, facing his daughter with the broken box). The closure is legible and on the page. However, the bulk of the story is retrospective summary rather than pressure-driven scene work, and the cost (leaving the department, risking vulnerability) is stated more than dramatized. The ridge walk itself imposes no immediate obstacle or reversal; the tightening is internal and thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, charred stumps, and regenerating aspens provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Marcus's firefighter lens. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (carried, then opened) and its physical presence anchors the ending image. Sensory hierarchy is appropriate: silvered aspens, burn scars catching moonlight. However, the celestial dance motif (Jupiter, Mars, the moon) reads as ornamental rather than constraining any choice or charging the final image with spatial or temporal pressure. The valley overlook functions as a contemplation stage, not as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus reconciling his firefighting obsession with his absence from his daughter—is signaled early and sustained. The decision to take leave and return the box constitutes one meaningful tightening (a renunciation with felt cost). However, the escalation is entirely internal and retrospective; no on-page obstacle or reversal complicates his choice. The Riverside incident and marriage collapse are recounted, not dramatized, so the pressure remains abstract. The final act (descending with the box, planning to give it back) is a stance crystallization rather than a live conflict turn, fitting an accumulative/reflective lens but offering minimal agency under immediate duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of trading one precious thing for another (salvation vs. enlightenment, firefighting duty vs. family presence) emerges through Marcus's scarred body, the broken box, and the "hard softness" closing image. The crack as "where light got in" and "armor with a door built in" are fresh inflections on resilience metaphors, though they approach direct statement. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "some fires needed fighting at home" and "learning that hard softness was its own kind of strength" edge into thematic summary. The ending offers a non-literal answer (carrying the box down, ready to open) but the resonance is dulled by the explanatory tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (firefighter's lens on burn scars, celestial time-keeping, forest regeneration) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "topography of burn scars," "bargained innocence," and "hard softness" occasionally drift into elevated metaphor that feels authorial rather than Marcus's own idiom under duress. Psychic distance is appropriate for reflective mode. The prose rhythm modulates between summary and image effectively. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not judged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening and closing images (moonlit ridge, cracked box, aspens). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, several phrases repeat structural stems without variation: "he'd been," "what haunted Marcus," "another bargain, another exchange." The closing metaphor cluster ("hard softness," "armor with a door built in") stacks figurative language in adjacent lines without clear vehicle coherence, approaching overwriting. Grammar and tense are clean; spatial choreography is legible. The Text Artifact Screen finds minor scaffold but nothing that obscures causality or dulls the closure image significantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The firefighter-scarred-by-rescue premise is familiar; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious world logic or moral calculus. The "cracked container as metaphor for damaged identity" and "celestial bodies as indifferent backdrop" are well-executed tropes but not fresh. The turn—choosing family over fire tower duty—is emotionally honest but predictable. The "hard softness" closing phrase offers a specific synthesis, though it edges toward paradox-for-its-own-sake. The piece commits fully to its reflective premise without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus (scarred firefighter) is present throughout and his choice to take leave/return the box constitutes a key turn. However, most beats are retrospective summary of prior fires rather than on-page decisions under live pressure. Setup: present from line one. Development: his reflection narrows options (middle). Payoff: his descent with the box and resolve shapes the ending image. Causal pressure is moderate (internal stance shift). Cost is stated but not dramatically tested. Two gates met; causal work is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box appears in the opening (carried), is opened mid-story (revealing relics), and is closed/carried down in the ending with reweighted meaning ("crack now seeming less like damage and more like the place where light got in"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. It constrains Marcus's hand (he carries it, handles it gently) and charges the final image. However, the box does not enable or block a tactical choice under pressure; its role is symbolic accumulation rather than causal lever. Three gates, two beats, closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" is stated explicitly in Marcus's reflection on the rescued girl ("She'd traded her unquestioning faith in safety for the knowledge that everything could burn"). It recurs as a thematic label but does not shape on-page options or alter tactics. The concept is ornamental: a post-hoc interpretation rather than a live stake that Marcus navigates in scene. Setup: mid-story explicit mention. Development: restated as parallel to his daughter. Payoff: absent from the closure beat. Two gates, ornamental, no causal pressure, swappable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" is mentioned once in backstory ("He'd been gently skilled once, known throughout the department for talking down panicked homeowners..."). It establishes a before-state that contrasts with his current scarred, obsessive identity, enabling the reader to measure change. However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it is summary-only. Setup: present in first third. Development: implicit in his choice to soften/return. Payoff: the "hard softness" closing phrase obliquely reprises it. Two gates, label-only, no visible tradeoff in scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Enlighten" appears in Marcus's reflection: he was "the instrument of both her salvation and her enlightenment, the one who'd shown her that adults couldn't always keep their promises." The action is retrospective and attributed to the past rescue, not a present-tense beat. It does not drive a major turn in the ridge-path scene; Marcus's choice to return the box and reconnect with his daughter is motivated by his own need to stop running, not by a fresh act of enlightenment. Setup: mid-story mention. Development: thematic echo. Payoff: oblique (he will "explain" to his daughter). One gate solidly met, summary-only, swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" is stated in the text: "He'd come here to reflect deeply, as his therapist suggested—to find meaning in the pattern of his choices." The method is signaled, and the ridge walk is structured as a sustained reflection that reweights his priorities and leads to the decision to take leave. Setup: explicit signal mid-story. Development: the entire middle passage enacts deep reflection on past fires, scars, and family cost. Payoff: the reflection yields the closure choice (descending with the box, planning to give it back). Three gates met, mechanics matter (the walk and memory structure the story), causal pressure moderate. However, the method is told more than shown through distinct attempts; the piece is one continuous reflective mode rather than multiple tries.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path appears in the opening, provides the walk-and-reflect frame, and the descent closes the piece. The charred stumps and regenerating aspens supply vivid detail. However, the setting does not pressure Marcus's choice or supply resources that alter outcome; it is a contemplation stage. The overlook moment ("Marcus stopped where the path widened, overlooking a valley") is static observation. Setup: opening line. Development: walk continues. Payoff: descent mentioned in closing. Three gates, but the path does not constrain tactics or charge the final image with spatial friction. Postcard-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears as atmospheric description: "The celestial bodies moved overhead in their ancient choreography—Jupiter rising, Mars setting, the moon traversing its arc with patient inevitability." Marcus notes he "learned to measure time by such movements," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The walk occurs in one continuous night; no clock pressure. Setup: first third. Development: mentioned again ("The celestial dance continued overhead, indifferent and eternal"). Payoff: present as backdrop but not causal. Two gates, ornamental, vague tracking, no live clock effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To translate pain into a universal language" is stated once: "What haunted Marcus... he couldn't translate everyone's pain into something bearable. He couldn't be the universal language between suffering and sense." The motivation is declared in reflection, not dramatized through conflicted choices. It explains his firefighting obsession but does not create friction between wants and costs in scene. Setup: mid-story explicit mention. Development: implicit in his pattern of running to fires. Payoff: the closure is framed as accepting he cannot be that universal translator, but the cost is told. Two gates, told-only, no on-page dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hard softness" appears explicitly in the closing line: "learning that hard softness was its own kind of strength: armor with a door built in, finally ready to open." The tone throughout balances stoic restraint (scars, silent endurance) with vulnerability (carrying the broken box, planning to reconnect). The moonlit imagery, measured prose rhythm, and controlled metaphor sustain the tone across beats. Setup: implicit from opening (scarred but gentle handling of the box). Development: the reflection on needing to stay rather than run. Payoff: explicit closure phrase that charges the final image. Three gates, coherent modulation, closure linkage strong, but the final phrase states the tone rather than embodying it purely through image.</comment>
