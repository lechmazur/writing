<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motives are clear and her astronomical expertise is established, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves from detection to plan execution without genuine doubt clouding her choices. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears but isn't dramatized through embodied hesitation or visible cost in the peak moment when the tricksters turn their attention on her. Her competence is strong but the struggle feels more conceptual than visceral, and the final choice to "maintain broadcast" lacks the forfeited alternative that would charge it with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore links: Mara detects convergence, composes subsonic puzzle, tricksters redirect attention, campus chaos subsides. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tricksters shift to a different game) with conceptual cost legible in the spiral pattern and warmth replacing cruelty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lights flicker and "something vast turn[s] its attention toward her directly." The orientation is clean by ~80 words (Mara, WKRU, overnight DJ, three years), well within the 120-word window, so no penalty applies and the waiver is confirmed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio station setting is purposefully chosen: the transmitter is handled ("pressed her palm"), the broadcast capabilities are the tricksters' target, and the tower becomes the convergence point that triggers Mara's intervention. The subsonic hum and station lights constrain her choices and charge the closure moment. Sensory detail is selective (subsonic vibrations, aching fillings, blurred vision) and filtered through Mara's expertise. The micro-setting (desk, headphones, transmitter) functions as constraint and resource, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake (prevent tricksters from scaling chaos beyond campus) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the convergence pattern. The escalation is driven by her agency: she composes the subsonic puzzle, broadcasts it, and holds steady under scrutiny. The cost is conceptual and relational—she becomes visible to cosmic entities—but the tradeoff is legible when "something vast turn[s] its attention toward her directly" and she must "maintain her broadcast" through their scrutiny. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tricksters shift from chaos-making to pattern-solving, narrowing the danger without eliminating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of coexistence with cosmic entities who treat reality as a game emerges through specifics (circuit patterns resembling laughter, impossible colors, charts rearranging) rather than assertion. The final image—charts spiraling away, warmth replacing cruelty—offers a non-literal answer to whether humanity can redirect rather than defeat such forces. However, the closing line "outwitting the tricksters one frequency at a time" inches toward thematic summary rather than letting the spiral and warmth carry the full weight. The concept of "power plays" and "dividing the community" is dramatized through campus factions but resolved off-stage (surveillance feeds show fading colors), which softens the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara; psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-consistent. Diction is elevated but matches an astrophysics-trained DJ who interprets celestial signals ("ionosphere," "subsonic frequencies," "harmonics"). The perceptual signature is distinct: she notices vibrations that make her fillings ache, reads patterns others miss, and frames chaos as game mechanics. Under peak stress (lights flicker, weightless charts, vast scrutiny), syntax tightens appropriately without losing coherence. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high and most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "the tricksters were getting closer" in paragraph one is echoed by "the tricksters converging on the radio tower" in paragraph six without added pressure between. Template cadence appears in paragraph three with repeated "The [group] blamed [target]" structure across three consecutive sentences, triggering the −0.4 deduction for template runs. No mixed metaphors or register drift; sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. The final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cosmic-trickster premise is a known SFF trope but receives a specific inflection through subsonic frequencies and astronomical charts as the interface. The radio-station setting and DJ protagonist offer a fresh angle on first-contact stories, grounding the cosmic in campus infrastructure. The turn—redirecting tricksters to a puzzle rather than defeating them—feels earned and non-obvious. However, the "mass hysteria" / "equipment failures" / "campus factions blame each other" setup echoes familiar campus-mystery templates, and the resolution (off-stage fading of symptoms, on-stage chart rearrangement) splits the payoff between summary and image, softening the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (celestial signal interpreter) is present from the opening line, her interpretation of subsonic frequencies drives the middle choice (composing the puzzle-track), and her decision to broadcast and hold steady under scrutiny is causally active at closure. The role is irreplaceable: without her expertise, the convergence pattern wouldn't be detected and the subsonic invitation couldn't be composed. Her choice to "maintain her broadcast" during the lights-flicker beat alters the tricksters' trajectory, and the final image (updating charts, adjusting layers) shows her continuing the role with visible tactical cost (buying time, not permanent safety).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in paragraph two ("spread across her desk"), are studied in paragraph four ("latest chart, mapping where the signals intersected"), and rearrange themselves at closure ("charts had rearranged themselves into a new configuration—not the pattern of approach... but a spiral pulling away"). They are handled and their changing state signals the tricksters' response, meeting the multi-beat requirement. However, the charts function primarily as a display device for information Mara already possesses; they don't constrain her choices or enable a tactic she couldn't pursue otherwise. The reprise at closure is charged (spiral versus approach) but the object itself is somewhat swappable with any visual readout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Power plays" is declared in paragraph six ("The power plays happening across campus were escalating") but the on-page dramatization is thin: Dean Morrison's emergency meeting "made things worse" (summary), students report colors (summary), newspaper editorial (summary). The actual power dynamic that matters—Mara versus the tricksters—is framed more as a game of attention and pattern than as a power play. The concept shapes the atmospheric context (campus factions blaming each other) but doesn't constrain Mara's choices or alter her tactics in the peak beats. One causal beat: the escalation prompts Mara to act, but the power-play frame is replaceable with "chaos" or "disruption" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in paragraph five ("She was cautiously hopeful about her plan, though hope felt dangerous") but not embodied in a visible tradeoff. The trait should narrow her tactics or force a hedged choice; instead, she executes her plan without visible hesitation or fallback. The word "cautiously" doesn't alter the broadcast action—she holds steady under scrutiny without wavering. Late first appearance (paragraph five of nine) and label-only use trigger caps; no middle development or closure participation where the trait constrains a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Interfere" is signaled in paragraph six ("She'd decided to interfere after finding the pattern") and executed in paragraph seven (keying up the track, broadcasting the puzzle). The action is causally central: without interference, the tricksters would gain full broadcast access and scale chaos. The method (subsonic puzzle-track) is specific to this interference and not easily swappable. The action drives the closure turn (lights flicker, charts rearrange, tricksters redirect). However, the interference is framed as already-decided and executed smoothly without visible cost or second-guessing in the moment, which softens the felt stakes of the action itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies appear in the opening line (vibrations that make her fillings ache), are explained as the message medium in paragraph five ("subsonic frequencies she'd been generating for the past month—too low for human ears but perfectly audible to beings who experienced time as humans experienced light"), and return at closure ("subsonic hum shift," "subsonic layers, maintaining the conversation"). The method is irreplaceable: the tricksters' mode of perception requires this specific frequency band, and Mara's expertise enables her to compose the harmonics. The mechanics matter across three beats (detection, composition, ongoing conversation) and shape her tactics with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The university radio station is named and located in paragraph two, houses the transmitter Mara touches, and is the convergence target ("If they gained full access to the station's broadcast capabilities, they could reach beyond campus"). The setting provides the resource (broadcast range) that defines the stakes and the tool (transmitter, subsonic layers) that enables Mara's tactic. The station's lights flicker at the closure beat, and the final image returns to "the next song faded in" and "adjusted the subsonic layers," grounding the ongoing conversation in the physical space. The setting is functional across setup, middle, and closure, though the university context (campus factions, Dean, observatory) is more atmospheric than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As the community divides" is signaled in paragraph three ("The community had started dividing two weeks ago") and paragraph six ("The power plays happening across campus were escalating"), establishing urgency. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten Mara's tactics on the page—she's been generating subsonic frequencies "for the past month," and the closure sequence (lights flicker, charts rearrange) isn't governed by a visible clock or deadline. The division provides context for why she acts but doesn't create a ticking pressure that alters her choices beat-by-beat. The time element is present and causally relevant but not live enough to score in the higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters is introduced in paragraph four ("something vast and playful was testing humanity's frequencies") and paragraph five ("invitation to a different game, one with rules that might satisfy their appetite for mischief"). It's dramatized in paragraph seven (composing the puzzle-track as "a challenge and a puzzle simultaneously") and paragraph eight (holding steady under scrutiny). The desire is specific and shapes her method: she doesn't plead or threaten but invites a different game. However, friction between want and cost is muted—the plan proceeds smoothly without visible sacrifice or doubt in the execution moment, and the "cautiously hopeful" internal conflict is labeled rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is coherent: "subsonic frequencies," "celestial signals," "impossible colors," and "something vast" supply the ethereal layer, while "fillings ache," "vision blur," "pressed her palm against the transmitter," and "holding steady through the ethereal grit of their scrutiny" supply tactile resistance. The tone modulates from detection (subsonic hum) to confrontation (lights flicker, weightless charts) to tentative resolution (warmth, intrigued laughter). The final image—"adjusting the subsonic layers, maintaining the conversation, outwitting the tricksters one frequency at a time"—marries the ethereal (frequencies, conversation) with grit (incremental tactical work). The phrase "ethereal grit" appears explicitly in paragraph eight, which is late but charges the closure moment directly.</comment>
