<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pianist's core motivation and internal state are established clearly through embodied detail (winding the useless key, memorizing departures). However, the husband's return feels insufficiently earned by prior characterization—his sudden appearance bypasses the psychological preparation needed for such reunion. The protagonist's decisive creative act (splicing the film) reads as motivated but the emotional payoff lacks contradiction or visible cost beyond the surface longing. Minor: "strategically creative" appears as a label rather than emerging from demonstrated traits under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Hybrid (Causal mechanics in the splicing sequence, Accumulative/textural in the station setting and longing motif). Orientation anchors appear by ~150 words (pianist, tidal arbor terminal, twilight, compasses). The closure unit—husband's return triggered by the spliced film-music performance—lands on the page but the causal linkage feels convenient: the mechanism (compasses triangulating across time via hidden film frames) is asserted rather than earned through prior rule-setting. The cost at closure is emotional reunion, but no visible price or foreclosed path accompanies it; the broken clock ticking backward gestures at temporal magic without dramatizing the stakes or sacrifice required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal arbor suspended above clouds with glass floor, flickering compasses, and perpetual twilight creates a vivid, purposeful setting that shapes atmosphere and constrains the world's logic. Spatial choreography is clear (piano, projector, terminal doors). The setting charges the final image (stars reflected in glass floor, compasses steadying) and the clouds' violent churning mid-performance ties environment to escalation. Minor: occupational detail (projectionist lore, dirigible routes) enriches texture but doesn't constrain a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reuniting with the lost husband. The protagonist's decision to splice the film and play the score creates one meaningful tightening that narrows options (she commits to the performance as temporal intervention). However, escalation depends on coincidence and asserted mechanics (compasses suddenly triangulating, husband appearing) rather than earned pressure or visible tradeoff. The final reunion carries emotional charge but no legible cost—no path is foreclosed, no capability spent, no relationship altered beyond restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of longing and creative agency emerges through concrete particulars (winding the clock, splicing frames, playing the score) rather than statement. The final image—compasses pointing to "moments when longing became strategically creative enough to bend the world"—overreaches into thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The story resists tidy morals but the closure dissolves tension into reunion without a resonant counter-pressure or ambiguity. The anniversary clock's backward motion and "hidden sections between frames" accumulate symbolic weight, though the map metaphor feels slightly imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature (pianist's texture: memorized cracks, wistful playing, ritual winding). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("tidal arbor," "steely longing," "temporal displacement"). The husband's single line of dialogue—"I heard music... Between the frames. I followed it home"—carries appropriate register and subtext. Minor slip: "strategically creative" in the motivation paragraph feels slightly elevated for the established voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The compasses weren't malfunctioning—they were triangulating across time" immediately followed by restating the station's suspension in nearly identical terms. Template cadence in the opening ("just as her heart had memorized every departure") and filter-verb reliance in reflective beats ("she realized," "she had watched") slightly dull immediacy. The final paragraph's "smiled and played a song about arrival" edges toward summary rather than image. Figurative language (clouds rolling like ocean waves, horizon inviting darkness) is vivid but occasional mixed registers ("temporal displacement," "strategically creative") jar against the lyric texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The suspended station setting, broken anniversary clock, and film-splicing mechanism combine into a memorable synthesis. However, the core reunion-through-creative-act template and the magical-realism resolution (compasses triangulating across time, husband stepping through clouds) echo familiar tropes without sharp transformation. The "hidden sections between frames" conceit offers a fresh angle but the climax—magical reunion with no visible cost—resolves into comfort rather than risk. Specificity in setting and the splicing action provide texture, but emotional and structural choices remain median-safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, the pianist makes the decisive choice to splice the film and perform (middle beat), and the husband's return at closure is her direct result. She drives all three gates and the ending would fail without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken clock appears in the opening third (frozen at seven-fifteen, wound nightly), recurs as emotional anchor mid-story, and at closure shudders into backward motion—reweighting prior ritual. Two distinct beats plus closure participation, but the clock's mechanism remains described rather than handled; it does not constrain a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Flickering compasses frame the terminal's disorientation early, pulse in rhythm during the performance, and steady at closure. They shape world logic and signal the temporal distortion but do not narrow the protagonist's options or force a trade-off; their role is atmospheric until the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is named once mid-story as a motivation label but not demonstrated through prior action or constrained choice. The film-splicing is creative, but the label itself remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Refuge" appears late (middle third) in the line "finding refuge in moments that existed outside linear progression." It is thematic commentary rather than an action that shapes a turn; easily swappable or removable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early (projector in corner, "hidden sections" lore), becomes the protagonist's chosen method in the middle beat (splicing frames), and the husband follows the music "between the frames" at closure. Three gates met; the mechanics matter and drive the ending. Minor: the mechanics are asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is named and anchored in the opening third, the glass floor and clouds participate in the middle escalation (violent churning), and the final image grounds reunion on the star-reflected glass. Setting constrains world rules (compass confusion, suspension above choice) and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" is named as motivation mid-story and closure occurs as "the horizon had fully invited night now." The timeframe brackets the action but does not tighten tactics or create visible urgency; it functions as atmospheric boundary rather than clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated mid-story and drives the splicing decision. However, it is told rather than dramatized through prior friction, and the encore itself faces no visible obstacle or cost—she simply acts and succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is embodied early (winding the useless key, playing wistfully) and the tone modulates through the performance (clouds churning, compasses pulsing) to the reunion. Coherent across turns and the final smile-and-play moment shifts longing to arrival, charging the ending. Consistent and purposeful.</comment>
