<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's shift from isolation to creating community space shows motivation, but the arc feels schematic. Her interior contradiction—rational forager who dismisses superstition yet enables it—is told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The reconciliation scenes are summarized ("Henrik reconciled with his daughter") rather than dramatized with visible struggle. The final realization about rationality and human need arrives as an epiphany without prior embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the glass eye as framework rather than magic, and truffles as proof that "hidden things could flourish even in damaged soil." Orientation is clean. The weaknesses: key reconciliations (Henrik and daughter) are summarized off-page, and Mira's decision to "let people come" lacks on-page cost or visible trade-off at the moment of choice. The ending image reweights the premise but the cost remains implied rather than felt in a specific sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in a storm-ravaged ravine supplies vivid setting and constrains access (hemp ladder, rope bridges). The glass eye's physical weight and "impossible green swirled through with gold" anchor tactile detail. Spatial choreography remains clear across the market and orchard scenes. The orchard directly enables the closure—people come *because* it's "a world apart"—so setting participates in the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement partially. Truffles and fungal networks recur with thematic charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rebuilding human connection after the empathy virus. Mira's opening avoidance of "psychological minefield" sets the problem, and her final choice to host gatherings provides one tightening. However, the decision itself ("I'll make a deal") lacks visible cost or on-page resistance; it's presented as insight rather than a trade-off that forecloses a safer path. Coincidence doesn't resolve, but summarized reconciliations (Henrik's arc) undercut escalation. Pressure is legible but the felt cost at the peak choice is thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grace between truth and lies, frameworks as necessary scaffolds—emerges from image and event: the glass eye does nothing, yet belief in it creates "space for intention." The final image (truffles in damaged soil) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. One deduction: Mira's realization "that rationality wasn't about dismissing human need for ritual" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the particulars carry the weight. The closing image of the weathered eye "catching light like a beacon" effectively reconfigures prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable distance and clean focalization through Mira's pragmatic lens. Diction is controlled ("storm-churned soil," "jagged confessions"). One register slip: "occlude painful memories" and "cultivating psychological safety" feel elevated for Mira's established voice as a forager-turned-dealer. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Henrik's plea carries subtext. Perceptual signature—mapping fungal networks, dismissing superstition—remains consistent. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and supports the reflective tone at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "fractured something essential," "brutal honesty replaced social grace," "weight in her palm felt significant" all advance character and world efficiently. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One minor slip: "psychological minefield" and "cultivating psychological safety" lean on the same clinical register within a short span, creating faint repetition. Rhythm modulates well—short sentences at the glass-eye discovery, longer ones for reflection. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise (involuntary truth-telling) is fresh and the hanging orchard setting vivid. The twist—relic does nothing, belief creates grace—feels earned in hindsight. However, the transformation arc (isolation to community facilitator) follows a familiar template: lone pragmatist learns the value of human ritual. The closing image (truffles in damaged soil) is particular and resonant, lifting the piece above median originality. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise but plays it safe on emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's rationality—mapping fungal networks, tracking rainfall, avoiding superstition—frames her character early. Her decision to host gatherers is a key turn, though the choice itself lacks on-page resistance. She appears in the closure paragraph observing others and understanding her shift, which is participation but not decisive action. Two beats: the market encounter and the orchard hosting. Causal role is present but the forager trait itself (truffle-hunting) doesn't constrain the closure; her rationality does.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in three beats: discovery in mud, market display where Henrik identifies it, and final post at the orchard entrance "catching light like a beacon." It's handled physically ("weight in her palm"), identified as a medieval relic, and returns in the ending image with reweighted meaning—now a symbol of the grace between truth and lies. Setup, development (passed between reconciling pairs), and payoff all present. The eye is causally active: people come *because* of it. Specificity ("impossible green swirled through gold") and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept is introduced early (Henrik's identification) and shapes the central tactic: people believe the relic can occlude compulsive honesty, creating psychological space. The concept drives the gatherings and charges the thematic question. However, the smuggling backstory (ship in the ravine flood) is exposition without on-page pressure; the "smuggled" detail doesn't alter choices. The relic-as-framework does, so the core concept participates in closure. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The involuntary truth-telling virus is backstory context that motivates the gatherings but doesn't constrain on-page action. We see its past effects (destroyed relationships, Henrik's confession to his daughter) but no character demonstrates the trait on the page. Mira is uninfected. Henrik and others are infected off-page. The attribute exists as label and premise, not as a visible trade-off in scene. It shapes the world but doesn't enable or constrain a beat with dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Occlude" appears once in exposition: the Weeping Saint could "occlude painful memories." The gatherings involve people trying to "rebuild conversations," which implies occlusion of compulsive honesty, but the action itself—holding the eye, speaking carefully—is described as creating "space for intention" rather than active occlusion. The concept matters thematically but the verb "occlude" is not the driver; "belief in occlusion" is. The action is present and relevant but could swap for "suppress" or "filter" without structural change. Middle-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "discredited textbooks" are mentioned once by Henrik ("the old textbooks mention cures") and once in Mira's reflection ("pre-scientific texts claiming that certain relics could absorb unwanted truths"). The method is signaled but its mechanics don't matter on the page—Mira dismisses it as "nonsense" and the relic does nothing. The method exists as red herring rather than shaping attempts. Setup present, but no development or payoff beyond thematic contrast. Functional but replaceable with any folk-cure frame.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is introduced in the opening sentence and supplies the isolation, access constraint (hemp ladder descent), and "world apart" atmosphere that enables the gatherings. Storm-battered ravine details recur (storm-churned soil, rope bridges groaning in wind). The orchard is the literal stage for reconciliations and appears in the closure: "the orchard's entrance" with the glass eye post. It constrains choice (descent required, separation from village) and charges the final image. Setup, development (Henrik reconciles on a rope bridge between apple trees), and payoff all present with high specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "three years ago" is mentioned once early and "since the virus swept through" anchors the world state. The passage of time within the story ("word spread quickly," gatherings over implied weeks) is vague. The "after" condition motivates the entire plot—Mira's isolation, the need for the relic—but the time element doesn't tighten tactics or create a deadline. It's context rather than pressure. Setup clear, closure linkage weak. Functional but not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "cultivate psychological safety" is named late ("She'd been cultivating psychological safety in her own way"). Her actions—isolation, then hosting gatherings—dramatize the shift. The motivation is present in her recognition that "isolation wearing a protective mask" isn't safety, and her final hosting choice enacts the desire. However, the phrase "psychological safety" itself is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The friction between isolation (want) and connection (cost) is present but soft. Two beats: realization and hosting. Causal role moderate; cost implied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured-grace tone is coherent throughout: "jagged confessions," "brutal honesty replaced social grace," "difficult grace between them," "proof that hidden things could flourish even in damaged soil." The tone modulates with pressure—clinical at the opening (fungal networks, rainfall patterns), warmer at closure (truffles as metaphor for resilience). The final image ("catching light like a beacon") charges the tone shift. The tone is purposeful, present across beats, and supports the thematic question. Strong fit; fully integrated.</comment>
