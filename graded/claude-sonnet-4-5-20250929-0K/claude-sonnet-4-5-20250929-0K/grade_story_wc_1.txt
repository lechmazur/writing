<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear—survival and truth-seeking—and her glass-artist expertise shapes her perception (frost as "nature's glass"). However, the final choice feels undercooked: Galloway's surrender happens off-page, robbing the confrontation of earned cost. The "steadily adaptive" trait is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure, and the interior monologue about glass and patience reads as thematic packaging rather than embodied thought during a gunpoint standoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (canyon, post-explosion, luminous glass artist). The Drive Lens reads as Causal with a situational accent: Vera follows ledger → finds cache → confronts Galloway. However, the climactic reversal—Galloway's capitulation and binding—occurs in summary ("Galloway bound and following, his ledgers and location traded for clemency"), deflating the closure beat. The cost is asserted but not dramatized: we don't see the negotiation, the physical struggle, or the moment of his choice, only its aftermath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: morning frost as diagnostic tool, hidden cave, rockfall camouflage. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop three miles behind, narrow gorge, cave mouth). The frost patterns constrain Vera's discovery method and the kiln bookends the piece with thematic charge. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artist's lens, grounding the world without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Vera's survival and uncovering the conspiracy—is signaled early. The tightening from observation (charred ledger strip) to discovery (gunpowder cache) to confrontation follows a coherent arc. However, the peak conflict deflates: Galloway's gun and his regret are introduced, then Vera delivers a thematic monologue, and the resolution is summarized. No visible trade-off or on-page cost at the confrontation; the "clemency" deal happens off-stage, undercutting escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through patient understanding versus rushed violence—emerges organically from Vera's craft and the gunpowder reveal. The glass/fire motif recurs with purpose, and the final kiln lighting offers a resonant (if quiet) answer. However, Vera's speech to Galloway ("Glass demands patience… You're just burning without purpose") edges into thematic statement rather than dramatized insight. The ending image is evocative but slightly abstract, and the "steadily adaptive" framing feels authorial rather than emergent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Vera's perceptual signature: she reads frost as glass, sees "drifting resonance" in Galloway's face. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with elevated but apt phrasing ("tapestry of stars," "liquid fire to solid light"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and Galloway's lines carry subtext. One mild register slip: "drifting resonance of regret" reads slightly ornamental for the moment's tension, but the prose remains clean and propulsive overall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is solid: varied syntax, concrete imagery, no major loops. Opening and closing beats carry thematic charge. However, a few phrases feel overwritten for their moment: "luminous glass artist, known throughout the territory" front-loads exposition, and "drifting resonance of regret" stacks metaphor during a gunpoint scene. The phrase "scorched testament" appears twice in similar constructions, creating minor redundancy. The summary transition ("The stars had faded to grey when she walked back…") compresses the climax into tell, reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The glass-artist protagonist and the gunpowder-smuggling plot offer a fresh synthesis, and the frost-reading method is a specific, earned detail. However, the emotional arc—artist confronts violent conspiracy, wins through moral suasion—follows a familiar template. Galloway's capitulation without visible struggle or cost undercuts the premise's boldness. The piece commits to its vision but retreats from full risk at the confrontation, choosing thematic summary over dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera (luminous glass artist) drives all major beats: she retraces, investigates, discovers the cache, confronts Galloway, and returns to her kiln. Her occupation shapes her perception (frost as glass, patience as craft principle) and the final choice to create rather than flee. Present throughout, causally active, and integral to closure. However, her climactic choice—binding Galloway—is summarized, not shown, reducing the element's visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The charcoal smuggler's ledger strip appears early (charred in rubble, name "Galloway" visible) and returns at midpoint when Vera connects it to the gunpowder cache ("The scorched testament in her pocket suddenly made terrible sense"). Two beats, early signal, causal pressure. However, it does not reappear or charge the final image; closure centers on the kiln, not the ledger. Functional across the arc but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is named twice as a descriptor for the ledger strip but does not function as a distinct concept that shapes tactics or stakes. It reads as atmospheric phrasing rather than a mechanic or constraint. The broader idea of evidence-after-fire is present, but the phrase itself is ornamental, not structural.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is introduced early and linked to Vera's glass-shaping skill and her survival thinking. It frames her investigative method but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost; the trait is told ("Survival required the same fluid thinking") rather than enacted in a trade-off. Present and thematically consistent, but not dramatized as a lived friction or enabling condition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Retrace" anchors the opening ("everything demanded retracing") and drives the plot: Vera retraces the explosion, follows the ledger clue, retraces boot prints and wagon ruts to the hidden cave. The action is causally essential—without retracing, she does not discover the cache or confront Galloway. It shapes the middle arc and primes closure. Solid integration, though the final kiln scene pivots away from retracing to creation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Patterns in morning frost are introduced as Vera's diagnostic lens ("nature's glass, ephemeral and honest") and used once to reveal disturbance (boot prints, wagon ruts cutting through frost lacework). The method is specific, purposeful, and enables the cave discovery. However, it does not return or charge the ending; the frost serves one beat well but is not indispensable to closure. Early signal, one causal beat, then absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quiet canyon under stars frames the opening and provides spatial architecture (rockfall camouflage, hidden cave, narrow gorge). The setting enables the plot (remote cache location) and charges the thematic atmosphere. The final beat returns to the workshop, not the canyon, but the canyon's "witness" is invoked at closure. Two-gate presence (setup, middle); ending echo is thematic rather than causal. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the premise and creates urgency (Vera is hunted). However, the timeframe is not tracked or tightened on the page: dawn approaches, frost forms, stars fade to grey—atmospheric markers without tactical pressure. The "after" posture is present throughout but does not constrain decisions or escalate toward a deadline. Setup and thematic consistency, but no clock-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is introduced early as Vera's philosophical stance ("purpose in the pauses—those moments between breaths when glass transformed"). The motivation frames her return to the canyon and her final kiln lighting, but it is not tested or conflicted on the page; Vera never doubts or trades off this purpose under pressure. Told and thematically consistent, but not dramatized as a live friction or choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears once to describe Galloway's regret and arguably colors the prose's elevated, lyric register. The tone is coherent—contemplative, measured, elegant—and modulates slightly at the confrontation (tension rising) and resolution (quiet affirmation). However, "drifting resonance" as a phrase is not taught or reprised; the tone itself does steady work, but the exact element is more ornamental label than structural principle.</comment>
