<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and specific ("sensibly eccentric," bottling petrichor, psychometry), and her final choice to wade into the lagoon is earned by her established traits and Henrik's precedent. The psychometry readings provide embodied access to Henrik's determination without overt exposition. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between her practical side (pharmaceutical contracts, geological maps) and her belief that "water remembered what touched it," driving her deeper despite surface-world ties. The final renunciation—removing boots, leaving the compass—forecloses return with visible cost, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (quarry/lagoon), and when (three weeks post-closure) within the first two paragraphs. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the descent, psychometry layers deepen understanding, and the final dive reconfigures the premise (seeking versus becoming mystery) with conceptual cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara's immersion crystallizes her stance toward irreducible strangeness, and leaving the compass on shore forecloses her former identity. The cost is conceptual—she steps beyond definition—but legible in "become something the surface world had no name for." One minor slip: Henrik's fate is told rather than discovered through dramatized beats, slightly weakening causal texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is rendered with purposeful sensory specificity: phosphorescent limestone, "resonant hush," petrichor "magnified a thousandfold." Spatial choreography is clear through the two-hour descent and Mara's wade to chest-depth. The water constrains her final choice—she must remove boots, the coolness is "inevitable"—and charges the closure image when she dives. Micro-setting works effectively: the compass, vials, and her body in water function as setting elements that alter tactics and meaning. The factory closure frames temporal context without occupying excessive real estate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's drive to capture mystery and decide whether to follow Henrik—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the lagoon. One meaningful deepening occurs when the psychometry reading reveals Henrik chose immersion deliberately, not accident, reweighting her options. Her agency is renunciation: she leaves the compass and steps beyond measurement, foreclosing return. The cost is conceptual and felt in the final image ("something the surface world had no name for"), though a sharper physical or relational price would elevate pressure. Escalation is driven by her choices under the Accumulative lens, satisfying that mode's deepening requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—seeking the place where explanations fail, irreducible strangeness versus certainty—emerges organically from Mara's vocation (bottling petrichor), the factory's extraction logic, and Henrik's acoustic measurements. The compass and collection vial function as motifs that constrain choice: she fills the vial, then sets the compass down, reversing her collector role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: immersion rather than capture. No overt moralizing; the final image ("primordial storms") and stilled compass reweight prior material. One hairline slip: "hinged awakenings" as a phrase borders on abstract poeticism, but it's grounded enough in her psychometry history to avoid full abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices geological detail, scent, acoustic properties. Diction remains controlled ("petrichor," "delve," "phosphorescence") and voice-motivated for a character steeped in geology and scent taxonomy. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "irreducibly strange" and "architecture of certainty" edge toward elevated abstraction in a few beats, though they stay within Mara's plausible lexicon given her education. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful elision (Henrik's exact fate mechanism) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor overwriting: "resonant hush" appears three times; "the place where..." construction recurs ("the place where sound behaved strangely," "the place where explanations fail," "the place where measurement instruments spun"). These near-repetitions slightly dull propulsion in the middle third. The final image—compass stilling, dive into "primordial storms"—is vivid and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of petrichor collection, psychometry, and subterranean mystery is specific and non-generic. Mara's sensibly eccentric profile (pharmaceutical contracts meet mystical belief) avoids stock eccentricity. The transformation of the compass from tool to offering, and the reversal from collector to collected, feel earned. The premise—woman who bottles scent follows lost explorer into irreducible mystery—is fresh enough. Minor derivatives: the descent-into-earth-to-find-self arc and the mystic-versus-industrial tension are familiar beats, though executed with sufficient specificity to avoid cliché. The final dive risks the "transcendence through immersion" trope but commits fully without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, makes the key turn (wade in, dive), and her vocation (petrichor collector) enables the pharmaceutical cover story and frames her worldview (scent holds memory). She fills a vial at the lagoon and renounces collection by leaving the compass. Her choices drive all major beats.Swappability test: another mystic-adjacent profession (sound recordist, water diviner) could substitute with minor edits, but "petrichor collector" is specific enough to resist easy replacement. Scores mid-7s for causal involvement across setup, middle choice (filling vial), and closure (dive), with visible cost (leaving surface identity).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The compass appears in beat one (warm against thigh), drives the psychometry reading (middle beat), and is left on shore as an offering at closure—three distinct touches. It shapes Mara's understanding (Henrik's determination, "the place where natural law grew uncertain") and its needle-spin signals the lagoon's properties. At closure, the compass "finally stilled, pointing toward nothing and everything," reweighting its earlier function. Removing it would lose the throughline from Henrik to Mara and the motif of measurement failing. Strong integration, though slightly shy of indispensable: another artifact (Henrik's notebook, a measuring device) could serve with moderate structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hinged awakenings" is named and historicized (age seven, fifteen) in one reflective passage and frames Mara's psychometry origin, but it does not constrain a present choice or recur with reweighted meaning at closure. The concept is thematic—moments when understanding shifts—but functions as backstory exposition rather than active pressure. The final dive could be read as a third hinged awakening, but the text does not explicitly close that loop or charge it with cost. Functional and present, but not load-bearing in the story's causal spine. Scores mid-5s for lyric resonance without middle-beat involvement or closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is label-described ("practical boots," "believed that scent held memory") but does not visibly constrain or enable a peak choice with tradeoff. Her eccentricity is consistent (bottling petrichor, living among maps, accepting mysterious compass delivery), but no on-page beat hinges on this trait forcing a sacrifice or tactical shift. It colors voice and world but remains ornamental in terms of causal pressure. Late first appearance as an explicit attribute (paragraph two) and no closure linkage cap the score. Functional characterization, but replaceable with "unconventional" or "idiosyncratic" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Delve" is the inciting instruction on yellowed paper, frames the entire descent, and culminates in the literal dive into the lagoon. Every major turn traces to this action: accepting the compass, descending two hours through quarry levels, wading deeper, and the final submersion. Removing "delve" collapses the story's spine. The word itself is charged (Henrik's command, Mara's obedience) and the action is irreplaceable—no synonym (explore, investigate) carries the same connotation of depth and commitment. Scores high-8s for indispensability across setup, escalation, and closure, with felt cost (immersion beyond return).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry is signaled early (paragraph five: "letting her psychometry reading unfold"), used twice on-page (touching the compass, touching the water), and its mechanics matter (reading Henrik's determination, understanding his deliberate choice). The readings change Mara's knowledge and reweight her stakes, enabling the final decision. The skill's origin story ("hinged awakenings") occupies reflective space but anchors her ability. Swappability test: another mystic skill (clairvoyance, object-divination) could substitute with moderate edits, but psychometry's tactile specificity (touch-triggered) fits the compass and water beats. Scores mid-6s for two-beat involvement and setup-to-closure presence, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is the story's fulcrum: it pressures Mara's choice (wade or leave), supplies the phosphorescent light and "resonant hush" that charge atmosphere, and hosts the closure dive. Setup (paragraph five: "place where sound behaved strangely"), middle development (lagoon opens, Mara kneels, touches water), and payoff (immersion to throat, dive) all depend on this exact setting. Removing it breaks the story's logic. The limestone's properties (phosphorescence, acoustic anomaly) are specific and irreplaceable. Scores high-8s for indispensability across all three gates, with visible cost (Mara's transformation). Barely shy of 8.5+ because another liminal underground water body could function with heavy rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The factory closure (three weeks prior) frames Mara's availability and the quarry's silence, and the compass arrives "three days after," but these markers do not tighten tactics or create urgency on the page. The descent takes "two hours," but this duration is told rather than felt. No live clock pressures Mara's choice at the lagoon; she could linger or leave without consequence. Setup present, weak middle development (time of descent noted but not dramatized), no payoff. Scores low-5s for functional framing without causal pressure or closure linkage. Swappable with other recent closures or time gaps.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desire "to find the place where explanations fail" is dramatized through Mara's vocation (capturing petrichor, believing water remembers), Henrik's theory, and her final choice to immerse rather than merely observe. The motivation is conflicted: she bottles mystery for pharmaceutical profit yet seeks irreducible strangeness. The friction between collecting (surface world) and becoming (lagoon) drives the closure choice, with visible cost (leaving compass, removing boots). Setup (Henrik's quest), development (Mara understands his deliberate immersion), payoff (her dive). Scores low-7s for integration across beats and closure participation, though the motivation is slightly told ("she understood") rather than fully embodied in earlier micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" appears three times, modulates with pressure (quiet factory, thick air in descent, lagoon's hush), and charges the final image ("primordial storms" contrasts and fulfills the hush). Tone is coherent through turns: contemplative in setup, textured in descent, reverent at the lagoon, immersive at closure. The phosphorescent light and acoustic properties reinforce the tone without static repetition. The final dive maintains the hush while deepening it into sensory immersion. Scores high-7s for coherent modulation and closure linkage, with the recurring phrase earning its keep by reweighting silence as presence. Shy of indispensable because another tonal anchor (stillness, depth) could serve with edits.</comment>
