<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("creeping normality" as therapeutic diagnosis, the archaeology of feeling). Her micro-choices—pocketing the orris root, arranging objects, touching the door frame—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The internal contradiction between wanting to fix hollow spaces and needing to simply witness them is dramatized through action. However, the final turn from "sanctifying through offerings" to "houses need witness" feels slightly expositional rather than fully earned through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through collected objects and ritual until the house exhales, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—Mara's realization that her offerings are attention, not magic, reconfigures her method and charges the final image of the lit house. One meaningful deepening (objects → witness) tightens the dominant stake. Causality within the accumulative frame is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bay, tideline, and Kettering house are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective: "violets and earth," windows catching light differently, weeds in deliberate patterns. The orris root functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (porch steps, windowsill, door frame). The streetlight frame anchors time and mirrors Mara's liminal awareness. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it supports rather than forces the turn, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens once: the orris root and ritual arrangement produce the exhale, narrowing Mara's theory from "offerings sanctify" to "witness sanctifies." The tightening is meaningful but not urgent; the house's response arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Agency is attention and arrangement, which aligns with the accumulative lens, but the lack of a live opposing pressure or cost that forecloses an option keeps this from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—witness as sanctification, gradual change as motion—emerges organically from Mara's collecting, arranging, and final realization. The orris root, displaced objects, and "creeping normality" are concrete particulars that charge the ending without stating a moral. The final image (house holding light "like a promise") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates cleanly in the shift from "offerings" to "noticing." Minor slip: "inadvertently profound" in the ritual description edges toward authorial label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices hedges creeping, pharmacy transformations, light caught "dreaming." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("shard of hush," "archaeology of feeling"). The psychic distance narrows smoothly at the climax ("the house exhaling"). However, "inadvertently profound in her ritual, though she would have laughed at such a description" momentarily breaks focalization with authorial commentary, undercutting the otherwise clean POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense with strong propulsion: "bottle caps, smoothed glass, a waterlogged paperback" and "a shard of hush, sharp enough to cut through the constant noise of existence." Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minimal loops; information density is high. However, "inadvertently profound" and "hushed blaze of recognition" edge toward elevated diction that slightly tensions the POV's lexicon in peak beats, and the stacked metaphors in the climax ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze") risk overwriting density without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of object-collecting, "creeping normality," and houses-as-witnesses is specific and non-obvious. The frame (streetlights dreaming, displaced objects, ritual arrangement) feels fresh and particular to Mara's voice. The emotional arc—hyperawareness as gift rather than curse—avoids generic templates. However, the core ritual (offerings to empty houses) echoes familiar quiet-magic tropes without radical transformation. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise but does not venture into bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's noticing shapes the entire arc: she collects displaced objects, perceives the house's shift, and arranges the ritual. Her observation drives the method and the realization. However, her choices (pocket, arrange, touch) are enactments of pre-existing habit rather than turns under pressure. The final insight (houses need witness) reweights her method but arrives through revelation rather than a dilemma that her noticing creates and then solves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris root appears in three beats: discovery wedged in rocks, placement at the center of the altar, and implicit presence in the house's exhale. Its smell (violets and earth, memory and transformation) charges the ritual and the closure. The root's specific origin (perfumer's shop closure) ties it to the displaced-object theme. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it functions as symbolic anchor rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" appears twice: Mara's thought during the still moment and the story's lyric frame. The phrase charges the climax—silence as a physical, sharp thing—and reweights the concept of noticing as intervention. However, the concept does not shape tactics or narrow options; it operates as thematic resonance rather than on-page stake. The early seed and final reprise lift the score into the mid-5s under the lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is applied once, labeling Mara's ritual. It does not constrain or enable an action with cost; the label sits outside her awareness and does not shape her choices. The authorial intrusion ("though she would have laughed at such a description") undercuts POV modesty. The attribute is ornamental, describing rather than dramatizing a trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is the story's pivot: Mara arranges objects "to sanctify these hollow spaces," then reweights the concept at closure—houses are sanctified through witness, not offerings. The action drives the ritual, the climax (house exhaling), and the final realization. Removing "sanctify" would break the thematic and causal arc. The term appears in middle and ending beats with clear conceptual cost (shift from magic to attention).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—placing displaced objects in empty homes—is signaled in the first third, enacted in the middle (altar arrangement), and reweighted at closure (objects as markers of witness rather than talismans). Mara's months-long practice and the specific gathering (marble, sea glass, key, orris root) demonstrate mechanics. The method shapes her attempts and the house's response. However, the method does not face resistance or require adaptation; it succeeds on first try, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay frames the opening and closing, and the Kettering house is the ritual's locus. The tideline supplies the orris root and earlier objects. Sensory details (streetlights, weeds, windows) are vivid. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it supports mood and mirrors theme without constraining tactics. The bay and house are stage rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in the opening and closing, anchoring dusk as a liminal frame. The timeframe mirrors Mara's between-state awareness and charges the atmosphere. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the ritual unfolds without clock pressure. The phrase is a lyric seed and reprise that reweights tone but does not create urgency or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to understand why some houses feel alive is dramatized through her collecting, ritual, and final realization. The motivation drives every choice: noticing the Kettering house's shift, arranging the altar, interpreting the exhale. Friction between her initial theory (offerings wake houses) and the closing insight (witness wakes them) creates cost—her method is reframed, her role redefined from magician to observer. The desire is tested and reweighted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is embodied in the climax: "a shard of hush…sharp enough to cut" paired with "hushed blaze of recognition." The tone modulates from quiet observation (tideline collecting) to charged stillness (house exhaling) to steady resolution (streetlights waking). The oxymoron holds throughout, balancing restraint and intensity. However, the phrase "hushed blaze" appears only once on the page, limiting its charge; the tone is more consistently "hushed" than "blazing," creating slight imbalance.</comment>
