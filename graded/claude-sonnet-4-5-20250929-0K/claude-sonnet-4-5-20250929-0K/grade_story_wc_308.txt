<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and his perceptual signature (harmonic reading) is distinctive, but the arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—he arrives knowing his art and executes it with only mild weariness. The grandmother's teaching and his "last practitioner" status are told rather than embodied in a choice that forecloses a path. The final smile and turn toward work read as competent execution rather than a decision that costs him something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The arrowhead's pulse deepens through the ravens' flight into a diagnostic understanding, and the final turn toward the third tower registers as Charged Poise—options crystallize (weeks of realignment work) with the cost felt in "centuries already" and his weathered resolve. Orientation anchors (Kael, canyon, bone towers) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulation of echoes and resonances successfully reweights the premise by the end, though the discovery of the fracture arrives somewhat conveniently without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and arrowhead as object-setting all constrain Kael's perceptual method and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional filter (harmonic signatures, bird geometry, stone pulse). The third tower's fracture becomes the spatial anchor for closure. Micro-setting (the arrowhead in his palm) functions as both tool and constraint throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the harmonic network) is signaled early and tightens when the arrowhead's pulse reveals the third tower's fracture. One meaningful deepening occurs: passive listening becomes active diagnostic appraisal that narrows his task to weeks of realignment. The cost is legible (time, solitary labor, "centuries" of patience required), though the discovery itself is more coincidental than earned by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as navigation, stillness as journey—emerges organically from the arrowhead's layered pulses and the grandmother's teaching without overt statement. The final image ("time itself was just another pattern to be read") offers a resonant answer to the central question through concrete particulars (stone, echo, raven geometry). The recursion of "patterns in a flock of birds in flight" and the arrowhead's completion-seeking pulse charge the ending without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Kael's perceptual signature (harmonic resonance vocabulary) is distinct and internally consistent. Diction remains within his contemplative, specialized lexicon throughout. The elevated register ("appraise," "harmonic matrices," "recursive geometries") fits his role without feeling forced. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Compression in the final two paragraphs maintains voice while accelerating cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, but several figurative constructions blur precision: "sound itself had become a physical thing, layered like sediment" mixes metaphor vehicles (sound-as-matter, sediment-as-time). "A pulse left wandering" recurs as a poetic phrase without mechanical grounding until the ending. Minor filter-verb stacking ("began to appraise," "allowed it to guide") in the middle beats slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffolding; clarity remains strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harmonic-stone-skimmer premise and "navigate without moving" offer a fresh synthesis of synesthesia, archaeology, and meditation. The bone towers singing with wind and ravens tracing recursive geometries are specific and vivid. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lack of external antagonist heightens thematic coherence. The third tower's fracture as discovered problem trends toward convenient setup, slightly reducing inevitability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's role as harmonic stone skimmer frames the opening and drives his diagnostic appraisal in the middle beat; his decision to turn toward the third tower at closure is a tactical choice shaped by his ability. Present in all three beats (setup, middle diagnostic, ending turn), but the final choice is more acceptance than a decision that forecloses an alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arrowhead is handled in the opening, thrums through the middle diagnostic beat (synchronizing with ravens), and its "steady, patient rhythm" anchors the ending turn. It enables Kael's perceptual method (harmonic reading) and supplies the 3,000-year timeline that validates his understanding. Reweighted from memory-object to diagnostic tool; its pulse shapes all three beats. Irreplaceable: no other object carries this specific history and harmonic signature.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" is seeded early, recurs in the middle beat as the arrowhead "sought completion," and settles into "steady, patient rhythm" at closure, reweighting from restless to resolved. It charges the thematic question (navigation through resonance) but does not directly alter Kael's tactics on the page—he reads it rather than being constrained by it. Present in setup and payoff; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears as a label in paragraph two ("maintained the historically reverent traditions") but never constrains an on-page choice or creates friction. It colors his stance (he will restore the towers rather than abandon them) but the cost of that reverence is not dramatized. Mentioned once; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Appraise" is seeded early ("began to appraise the stone's harmonic signature"), executed in the middle beat (diagnostic reading of the fracture), and frames the ending commitment ("weeks of careful work"). The action is specific to Kael's method and drives the turn from passive meditation to active restoration. Present in all three beats; swapping it for "read" or "sense" would weaken the professional specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ravens' flight is introduced early, their recursive geometry mirrors "deeper structures," and their synchronization with the arrowhead's pulse in the middle beat enables Kael's understanding of the canyon's 3,000-year timeline. They scatter at closure, marking the shift from diagnostic to commitment. Present in setup and middle; payoff is brief but purposeful. The method matters: their pattern unlocks the arrowhead's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bone towers anchor every beat: Kael stands at their base in the opening, the third tower's fracture becomes the discovered problem in the middle, and his turn toward it at closure commits him to weeks of realignment. The canyon's acoustics (standing waves, harmonic matrices) are the mechanism that his people depend on. Setting supplies both the problem and the constraint; micro-setting (his position at each tower's base) will structure the restoration work. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" seeds the timeframe in the opening sentence; the arrowhead's 3,000-year age is discovered in the middle beat; "centuries already" recurs at closure. Time deepens rather than tightens—it is accumulative context, not a live pressure that alters Kael's moves on the page. Present in setup and payoff; thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To navigate without moving" is articulated early (grandmother's teaching: "journey through time and space while remaining perfectly still") and demonstrated in the middle beat (Kael travels perceptually, not physically). The closing image ("those who listened with stillness could travel farther than those who walked") reprises it with cost implied (weeks of stationary meditation ahead). Desire is clear and shapes method, but no on-page friction tests it—Kael already embodies this mastery without struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is embodied in the opening ("weathered hands") and returns explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("his face creased by years of weathered resolve"). Tone modulates from contemplative opening through diagnostic intensity (arrowhead synchronization) to patient commitment at closure. The final smile and acceptance ("the echoes would wait") charge the ending image with earned calm rather than static mood. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
