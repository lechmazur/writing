<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority leans heavily on philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her motivation (discovering why some echo) is established but her choices feel contemplative rather than conflicted—she descends, listens, realizes, decides to teach. The sister's voice-in-shell revelation lands as exposition; the final choice to sing and return with others reads earnest but lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes, progressive disclosure motif, lyric atmosphere). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Mara's decision to sing and teach, but the cost is asserted rather than felt—no path is visibly foreclosed, no immediate sacrifice dramatized. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words. The shell's progressive revelations provide structure, yet the sister's preserved message feels convenient rather than causally earned by prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, canyon acoustics, and starlight filtering through cracks create vivid sensory grounding. Petroglyphs and the seashell provide tactile anchors. However, setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—Mara's choices are not narrowed by access, proximity, or environmental pressure. The canyon does not force her hand; it facilitates discovery without cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why some echo) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Mara's descent and listening do not tighten options or raise tangible costs; discoveries arrive through the shell's disclosure rather than protagonist agency forcing reversals. The final decision to teach feels additive rather than earned by a prior narrowing of paths. No visible price paid on the page that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—connection, witnessing, the price of solitude—emerges organically from the shell's revelations and Mara's realization about her sister. The sister's recorded message ("echoes require two things—a voice and a listener") verges on thematic statement but is framed as dialogue, mitigating directness. The ending's commitment to teaching and communal listening offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("richly perceptive," "webs of intrigue"). Perceptual signature is present but passive—Mara notices and interprets rather than misreads under stress. The sister's voice in the shell is clearly framed. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("progressive disclosure," "reed-blown melancholy") but remains coherent. No dialogue on the page to test distinctness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid imagery ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "canyon walls that curved like ancient spines"). However, prompt-label language clusters heavily: "serpentine nexus," "richly perceptive," "webs of intrigue," "progressive disclosure," "reed-blown melancholy" appear as inserted phrases rather than earned diction. Template cadence in reflective beats (e.g., "She understood then...," "The seashell fell silent...") and synonym loops around "echo" and "listen" accumulate. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts and −0.3 for label-driven register drift. Information density is moderate; momentum sags in the middle third during exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—sound preservation in canyon stone, inheritance via seashell—offers a poetic angle but leans on familiar "memory-in-landscape" tropes without transformative specificity. The sister's message and Mara's epiphany feel anticipated rather than surprising. Risk is modest: lyric atmosphere and progressive disclosure are handled competently but safely. The final turn to communal teaching is earnest yet predictable. Proximity to stock metaphors (echoes as memory, listening as empathy) without fresh inflection limits originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Canyon echo singer: present in setup, middle, and ending. Mara's observation and listening drive beats, but her final choice to sing and teach is additive rather than a turn that narrows prior options. She does not face a tradeoff tied to her role. Functional but replaceable—swap "echo singer" for "sound archaeologist" and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whispering seashell half: introduced early, handled in multiple beats (listening, warming, cooling), and shapes the progressive disclosure structure. The twin-shell mystery seeds future tension. However, the shell functions as a passive receiver; Mara does not trade or risk it, and its revelations feel convenient rather than hard-won. Present in closure (it "cooled") but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Webs of intrigue: mentioned once as abstract concept ("webs of intrigue her sister had tried to map") without shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The story explores connection and witnessing, but "webs of intrigue" is ornamental labeling rather than a dramatic mechanic. No visible cost or choice hinges on this framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Richly perceptive: label-only attribute applied to Mara ("richly perceptive mind") without on-page cost or tradeoff. Her perceptiveness enables understanding but does not constrain action or create friction. Swappable with "keen" or "sensitive" without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ensure: Mara's commitment to ensure others are heard drives the ending's teaching resolution. However, the action is declared rather than dramatized with immediate cost—no on-page teaching scene, no sacrifice made visible. The verb is present in closure framing but does not redefine prior options through a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Through progressive disclosure: signaled early ("through progressive disclosure, the seashell began sharing") and structures the shell's revelations across beats. The method is named rather than demonstrated through mechanics that matter to tactics. Functional but the exact phrasing feels inserted; the story would work as "layered revelation" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight: present throughout, vivid in description, and provides acoustic chambers that enable Mara's quest. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply pressure—Mara moves freely, and the nexus facilitates rather than complicates. Starlight appears in opening and closure but does not reweight meaning. Functional setting without tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>While the universe hums its secret song: poetic timeframe mentioned in opening and once mid-story but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Time is untracked; Mara's descent could span minutes or hours with no consequence. Ornamental framing device without stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To learn why some people echo: motivation signaled early, drives Mara's descent and inquiry, and is answered by the shell's revelation. However, the desire is told and pursued without friction—no competing want, no moment where curiosity costs her something immediate. The motivation structures the quest but remains abstract rather than conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Reed-blown melancholy: named once mid-story ("reed-blown melancholy, that particular sadness unique to canyons") and evoked through atmospheric description. Tone is coherent and lyric throughout but remains static—no modulation with pressure or shift at closure. The exact phrasing is ornamental; "canyon sadness" would serve equally. Present but not indispensable.</comment>
