<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and specific—her cool-headedness under pressure reads as trait, not label. The grandmother's wisdom anchors motivation without becoming therapy-speak. Her choices (driving the spike, shaping the silence, holding still) show embodied decision-making under escalating frequencies. Minor slip: the captured echo's emotional specificity ("being held while falling") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than letting the reader infer, but the cost (it "nests" in her bones) keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors immediately (garden, night, Mara fishing for frequencies). The closure—echo crystallized in her chest, constellations resuming order—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the captured frequency reweights all prior hunting) with felt cost (it changes her "from the inside out"). One meaningful deepening when the goddess's echo enters the shaped silence and the garden responds. Causality holds under the accumulative lens: the sleepwalking constellations signal the goddess's presence, Mara casts shaped silence, the echo crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is micro-setting done right: acoustic flowers, compressed air pools, frequency nodes constrain Mara's tactics (where to cast, when to hold still). The rail spike grounds her against relocating gravity—a tool that matters. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (frequencies "sharp enough to draw blood," ferns manifesting joy as arpeggios) and the sleepwalking constellations charge the final image when they halt and drift back. The garden's physicality (zigzag spirals, feral lullaby hum) pressures every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch the goddess's echo) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One tightening: the echo's arrival forces Mara to hold perfectly still despite her thundering heart, a visible constraint. The resolution is earned by her shaped silence and patience. The cost is legible—she carries the echo "carefully," knowing it will change her. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres: rising frequencies, zigzag flowers, then crystallization. No antagonist required; the garden's wildness and the constellations' drift supply situational opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: silence as negative space that sound rushes to fill, emotions translating back to their original tongue. The rail spike (distance/departure songs) and the echo (mother's hands catching a child) operate as charged motifs without stating a moral. The final image—fisher returning with the rarest catch—reweights the entire hunt as proof that "translated emotions could find their way back to their original tongue." No thematic echo or sermon; the crystallized feeling in Mara's chest is the answer, non-literal and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; Mara's perceptual signature (cool-headed fisher's patience, acoustic details filtered through her grandmother's teaching) is distinct. Diction stays consistent—elevated but voice-motivated ("achingly aware," "feral lullaby"). Purposeful compression ("by voicing silence, you create a negative space") reads as teaching passed down, not filter clutter. Minor wobble: "the goddess who transliterated all human feeling into the universe's fundamental frequency" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward explanatory summary, but the final beat recovers with image (walking home, carrying the echo).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. High information density: nearly every line advances Mara's hunt, the garden's behavior, or the constellations' drift. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor overwriting in the penultimate paragraph: "a gift and a memory and a promise all at once" stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would sharpen. The figurative language (constellations as somnambulists, feral lullaby) is coherent and voice-integrated. Zero artifact debt in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—fishing for emotions-as-sound with a rail spike anchor in a frequency garden while constellations sleepwalk—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The concept (emotions transliterate into sound; the goddess's echo holds the original feeling) is bold and fully committed. Risk-taking (shaped silence as a fishing line, gravity relocation, zigzag spirals) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending reprise (fisher returning, echo nested beside heartbeat) transforms the opening frame. No template echoes; the premise reads as singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's cool-headedness drives every key turn: she drives the spike (anchoring choice), casts shaped silence (method execution), holds perfectly still when the echo arrives (restraint under pressure), and walks home carrying it carefully (closure action). Present in setup, middle choices, and ending. Her trait enables the capture and shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rail spike appears early (anchoring against gravity), is used mid-story (driven into earth at the seventh node, vibrates with old train songs during the hunt), and is pulled from the earth in the resolution. Two distinct beats. Its "distance and departure" songs charge the moment but don't irreplaceably shape the closure—could be another anchoring tool with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sleepwalking constellations frame the entire hunt: their broken trajectories signal the goddess's movement, the acoustic flowers follow their new paths, and they shudder to a halt when the echo crystallizes—marking success. Present in setup, middle escalation (zigzag spirals mirror constellation drift), and closure (resuming positions). Their movement redefines the garden's state and validates Mara's catch. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Transliteration operates throughout: the garden auto-translates emotions (joy as arpeggios, grief as low-frequency puddles), and Mara hunts for the untranslated original. This contrast shapes her goal and the echo's value. Present in setup exposition and the ending realization ("translated emotions could find their way back to their original tongue"). One key constraint: she must distinguish translation from original. Missing a middle beat where the mechanic alters a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zigzag appears once in the middle escalation: the acoustic flowers "began to zigzag their growth, spiraling in impossible directions, following the sleepwalking constellations' new paths." This signals the garden's intensified response to Mara's shaped silence and marks the goddess's approach. Then they "stopped their zigzag dance and resumed their orderly spirals" at closure, bracketing the peak moment. Two beats (middle and ending), clear cause (shaped silence), visible consequence (marks the echo's arrival). Could be replaced with another growth-pattern term, but the impossible-direction specificity fits the constellations' influence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By voicing silence" is taught early (grandmother's wisdom), signaled in setup, executed in the middle hunt ("Mara shaped it like longing"), and directly enables the echo's capture ("the echo entered her carefully shaped void and crystallized"). Three beats. The method is irreplaceable—the entire climax depends on shaping a negative space that the goddess's echo fills. Mechanics are clear and the cost (holding perfectly still, deepening the silence) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden pressures every choice: its wild frequencies can draw blood, gravity relocates, acoustic flowers amplify unpredictably, nodes matter (seventh node), and the feral lullaby hum brackets the action. Mara's tactics (where to anchor, how to cast) depend on garden mechanics. Present in every beat from setup through closure ("the garden settled around her"). The garden's response (frequencies colliding, flowers zigzagging, then settling) validates the capture. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" is the timeframe condition: the sleepwalking constellations breaking from fixed positions trigger the goddess's echo becoming catchable. Present in setup (grandmother's warning, constellations drifting), drives the middle hunt (broken trajectories enable the echo's movement), and closure confirms pattern restoration (constellations drift back). The condition shapes when Mara can succeed. Not a ticking clock but a causal window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to catch the goddess's echo—is established early ("That's what Mara hunted"), conflicted (it's rare, she heard it once three years ago, "the memory still resonated"), and dramatized through her patient casting, restraint under pressure ("held perfectly still, cool-headed despite her thundering heart"), and careful return home. The desire drives setup, middle escalation, and closure. The cost (it will change her "from the inside out") is acknowledged on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "feral lullaby" tone—tenderness with teeth—is introduced mid-story ("The garden responded with a feral lullaby, all teeth and tenderness") and reprised at closure ("the garden settled around her, still humming its feral lullaby"). The oxymoron charges both beats and modulates with the garden's pressure (wild during the hunt, settling after). Coherent through escalation and the final image. The tone could be more present in the opening to seed expectation.</comment>
