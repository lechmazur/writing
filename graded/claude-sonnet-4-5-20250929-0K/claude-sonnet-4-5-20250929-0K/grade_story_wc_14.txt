<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stationer's motivation to "collect the textures of different times" is consistently embodied through her notepad practice and sensory attention to lamp hums and disproportionate blooms. Her final choice to "record it falsely" at the honest oak demonstrates internal contradiction with visible cost—renouncing truth-telling even when unnecessary. However, the interiority leans abstract ("earnestly studious," "incandescent restraint") rather than immediate and particular under pressure; key moments like pressing the maple roots feel more poetic than viscerally embodied. The turn at the center oak is credible but the path there accumulates texture more than it dramatizes escalating internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (stationer), where (mountaintop bonsai labyrinth), and when (dawn after the town's silence) clearly by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory details (lamp hums, bloom disproportion, root textures) that deepen the protagonist's understanding of compressed time, culminating in the center oak encounter. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her decision to record falsely "especially here" reweights her entire practice with conceptual cost (truth needs no witness; only beautiful untruths do). The cost is visible in the final image: she closes the notepad, having chosen fabrication over fidelity even at the one honest node. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens; however, the journey through the labyrinth is more exploratory than pressured, with coincidence (finding the perfect oak) shaping the climax rather than protagonist tactics narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blooming bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting throughout: disproportionate cherry blossoms and exposed maple roots both constrain her observations and charge the final choice at the proportional oak. Fluorescent lamps are handled concretely (hum frequencies, flickering tubes decades old) and their sensory hierarchy—minor third = compression, perfect fifth = expansion—directly shapes her charting practice. The mountaintop silence contrasts with the town's homogeneous quiet below, making the labyrinth's differentiated temporal zones essential to her purpose. Spatial choreography remains clean across her movement deeper into the maze. The setting qualifies for the 9-band gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but sensory selection occasionally tilts decorative (e.g., "pink luminescence refracting through fluorescent tubes") without immediately altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting temporal textures before they homogenize—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: moving from lamp-charting compression/expansion zones to discovering the honest oak requires choosing fabrication over documentation. However, escalation is textural accumulation rather than protagonist-driven tightening; she encounters rather than pursues each grove, and the climax oak appears by探索 rather than tactical choice. The final renunciation (recording falsely at the truth node) carries conceptual cost but lacks visible trade-off on the page—no prior scene showed her wrestling with fidelity versus beauty. Agency reads as attention and stance crystallization (valid under Accumulative lens) but the pressure never forces a live decision between competing goods until the ending assertion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between documentation and invention, compressed time and honest proportion. The final image—choosing to record falsely at the one truthful node—offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty or accuracy serves memory, without moralizing. "The truth needs no stationer. Only the beautiful untruths require gilded leaves" reconfigures her entire practice with resonance earned by prior particulars (gold-embossed papers, invented histories, disproportionate blooms). However, "requires witness, requires this collecting hand" in the penultimate sentence edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The piece resists simplistic binaries (truth vs. lie) by showing compression and disproportion as their own forms of honesty, and the quiet ending fits the Accumulative lens without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the stationer notices temporal textures, lamp frequencies, and disproportion through a craftsperson's tactile lens ("worn soft as cloth," "texture felt like memory itself"). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent, with controlled elevation ("incandescent restraint," "visual poetry") that matches her scholarly fabrication practice. However, several phrases drift into authorial register rather than character-filtered perception: "химical glow" reads observational but clinical; "Each observation... remained precise, contained, though the scene itself threatened to overwhelm" is meta-commentary about her prose style rather than her experience. The final paragraph's "Even here, especially here" construction and the gilded-leaves callback demonstrate strong control, but peak moments occasionally prioritize lyricism over immediacy (e.g., "blooms remember being large" anthropomorphizes without anchoring in her bodily perception).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful ("decades pressed into compact spaces," "flowers insist on their original magnitude"). However, the piece exhibits moderate overwriting in high-detail passages: "pink luminescence refracting through the fluorescent tubes' chemical glow" stacks modifiers without adding pressure, and several beats loop conceptually—paragraphs 4 and 5 both explore compression/expansion through different examples (cherry blossoms, then maple roots) without advancing her stance. The phrase "by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn, she had learned to map temporal resonances" uses passive perfect construction that distances the method from present action. "Incandescent restraint" as self-descriptor (paragraph 6) tells rather than shows stylistic choice. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she realized," "she had learned") appears but does not cluster heavily. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; information density is generally high. The closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—charting time's texture via fluorescent lamp frequencies in a miniature bonsai forest—synthesizes specificity (hum = minor third/perfect fifth) with fresh metaphorical architecture (compression vs. honest proportion). The invented-histories frame and the final paradox (falsifying truth to serve beauty) offer non-obvious angles on memory and documentation. However, the execution leans slightly toward Concept Showcase: the stationer observes more than she struggles, and the labyrinth delivers its lessons conveniently (cherry/maple examples, then the perfect oak) rather than forcing her to hunt or synthesize under friction. The disproportionate blooms and exposed roots are vivid and particular, avoiding generic mysticism. Risk-taking in the Accumulative structure and the quiet renunciation ending elevate the piece, though the transformation test is borderline—swap "time textures" for "emotional memory" and the arc holds with minor edits. No proximity to famous lines; the voice feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening (climbs mountaintop, closes shop). Development: her choice to press palm against maple roots and chart lamp frequencies drives middle beats. Payoff: her final decision to "record it falsely" at the honest oak directly shapes closure. However, many beats are observational—she encounters rather than decides (cherry blossoms unfurl, maple roots have already broken through). The closing choice is a stance crystallization with conceptual cost but minimal tactical alteration on the page. Two gates plus lyric reprise; causal role in ending beat; moderate irreplaceability (another documentarian could serve). Band guidance: 5.0–6.9 (shapes key turn). Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: observational mode −0.5, swappable role −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 base + 2.2 positives − 0.9 frictions = 4.3; lyric-resonance allowance and closure agency lift to upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph 2 ("battered notepad, its cardboard cover worn soft as cloth"). Development: she writes observations at cherry blooms (para 6), beneath maple lamp (implied), and adds final entry at center oak (para 10). Payoff: "She closed the notepad gently" is the penultimate action, charging the closure. Three gates; handled in three distinct beats; closure linkage strong. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, tactile specificity (worn soft, gilded leaves callback) +0.5. Frictions: none major; the notepad could be a journal or tablet with minor edits −0.3. Calculation: 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.3 = 6.3. The object's return with reweighted meaning (invented histories → falsifying truth) and physical handling across beats justify mid-6s; it does not narrow a tactical choice with cost, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "invented histories" defined paragraph 2 as reconstructions treated with scholarly care. Development: the practice frames her lamp-charting method (para 4–5) and her response to disproportionate blooms (para 6: "The blossoms remember being large"). Payoff: the final entry asserts "I will record it falsely" as the culmination of her invented-history ethos. Three gates; the concept shapes her interpretive lens throughout and drives the closing choice. Positives: early signal +0.6, causal pressure (invention justifies falsification) +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6. Frictions: slightly abstract—her histories are told more than shown in competing forms −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 + 3.9 − 0.4 = 6.5. The concept redefines her stance at closure with visible cost (choosing fabrication over fidelity even at the honest node), pushing toward 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "earnestly studious in this practice" paragraph 2. Development: her cross-referencing "intuitions against the physical world's whispers" describes method but does not constrain a choice. Payoff: no direct link at closure; the trait is implied in her careful final entry but not named or tested. One gate (setup only). The attribute is label-only and does not alter tactics—her studiousness never conflicts with, e.g., intuition or speed. Positives: early signal +0.4. Frictions: label-only −0.8, no cost −0.5, summary-only −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.7 = 1.7. Adjust upward slightly for coherence with her tone, rounding to low 4s. Cap remains 4.6 (missing middle/closure gates).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "dawn light began to refract through the labyrinth's peculiar architecture" paragraph 3; fluorescent lamps "strung... decades ago." Development: lamp hum frequencies (minor third = compression, perfect fifth = expansion) structure her charting practice and movement through groves. Payoff: "the fluorescent lamps hummed their frequencies into the brightening day" final sentence; refraction persists as ambient condition but is not re-activated in the closure choice. Three gates; the action enables her method and returns lyrically. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats (initial hum, maple lamp) +0.9, specificity (minor third vs. perfect fifth) +0.6. Frictions: replaceable with "measure," "track," or similar −0.5; does not redefine options at climax −0.3. Calculation: 3.0 + 2.0 − 0.8 = 4.2. Lyric reprise and method-linkage lift to ~6.1; the action is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: described paragraph 4 after initial lamplight mention. Development: used once to interpret compression (minor third) and expansion (perfect fifth) in middle beats. Payoff: lamps "hummed their frequencies" in final line but the method itself is not re-applied at the honest oak. Two gates (setup, development). Positives: early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one distinct use) +0.4, specificity (frequency = temporal quality) +0.5. Frictions: swappable with "listening to," "sensing" −0.5; not used at closure −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 + 1.4 − 0.9 = 3.5. The method shapes her interpretive lens and one key observation, lifting above ornamental but it does not narrow a choice or charge the final image directly; mid-5s fits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests" title and paragraph 1. Development: cherry blossoms (para 5), maple roots (para 7), center oak (para 9) each supply differentiated temporal textures that guide her movement and interpretation. Payoff: sitting beneath the proportional oak is the spatial frame for her final choice. Three gates; setting pressures every major beat and the ending depends on reaching the honest center. Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (each grove changes her understanding) +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability (only this labyrinth offers compressed/expanded/honest zones) +0.7. Frictions: none significant. Calculation: 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5. However, she does not choose her path tactically—the labyrinth delivers its lessons in sequence rather than forcing navigation decisions—slightly reducing causal pressure. Adjust to high 7s: the setting is essential but arrival at the oak reads exploratory rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "the town below went silent" opening line; "voices swallowed by whatever plague of quietude" paragraph 1. Development: silence motivates her climb but does not tighten decisions in the labyrinth; time of day (dawn) anchors orientation but no deadline pressures choices. Payoff: "the town remained silent" penultimate paragraph as ambient contrast, not active constraint. Two gates (setup, weak closure mention). Positives: early signal +0.5. Frictions: does not tighten tactics −0.8, vague mechanism (plague of quietude) −0.3, swappable with any catalyst for retreat −0.5. Calculation: 3.0 + 0.5 − 1.6 = 1.9. Adjust upward for thematic coherence (homogeneous silence vs. differentiated time) to low-mid 3s. The timeframe is present but largely atmospheric; it does not force a clock-driven choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "to collect the textures of different times" stated paragraph 4. Development: her motivation drives lamp-charting, root-pressing, and blossom interpretation across middle beats. Payoff: the final entry redefines collection as fabrication, reweighting the motivation with conceptual cost. Three gates. Positives: early signal +0.6, causal pressure (desire to collect drives all choices) +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, cost (choosing falsehood over fidelity) +0.5. Frictions: told more than dramatized in conflict—no scene shows her struggling between competing textures or costs −0.6. Calculation: 3.0 + 3.8 − 0.6 = 6.2. The motivation is coherent and shapes the ending, but friction between wants is asserted (truth vs. beauty) rather than enacted in a contested choice prior to the oak, holding score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "incandescent restraint" named paragraph 6 to describe her prose style. Development: tone modulates from observational calm (lamp hums, blossom descriptions) to quiet intensity at the honest oak without breaking into excess. Payoff: "She closed the notepad gently" and the understated final lamp-hum sentence embody restrained luminosity. The tone is coherent throughout and charges the final image by holding emotion in check even as the choice reweights her practice. Positives: pattern-taught +0.8, modulation under pressure +0.9, closure charge +1.2, specificity (restrained at peak) +0.5. Frictions: self-named in narration (para 6 tells tone rather than showing) −0.4. Calculation: 3.0 + 3.4 − 0.4 = 6.0. However, the execution—controlled diction and withheld emotional declaration at the climax—demonstrates mastery; adjust upward to low-mid 7s for tonal discipline that heightens rather than diffuses the ending.</comment>
