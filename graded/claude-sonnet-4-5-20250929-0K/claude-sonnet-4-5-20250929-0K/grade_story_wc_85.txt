<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's guilt and her chosen penance method are established early, with embodied emotion ("trembling fingers") and a concrete history. The flashback to Elias's case provides clear motivation. However, her interiority relies on therapeutic framing ("the weight of unspoken words," "the ritual of examining each piece") that flattens rather than complicates. The confrontation crystallizes her renunciation cleanly, but the path there leans heavily on reflection rather than on-page contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who, where, when anchored in the opening paragraph). The causal chain from backstory crime → watch hand arrival → shore ritual → Elias confrontation → commitment to dismantle remains coherent. Closure is Earned Stasis: Mara accepts accountability and commits to ending her lies, foreclosing her former career with visible cost ("destroyed her soul," tomorrow's dismantling). The cost is named rather than shown in a final concrete action, which keeps it from the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("driftwood accumulated like broken promises," "sand mixed with salt and sorrow"). The driftwood functions as both setting and ritual object, constraining Mara's nightly penance and charging the final image when she holds wood and watch hand together. Spatial choreography (terrace steps, twenty-foot distance) is clear. The setting pressures her isolation and frames her reckoning, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraint or charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's need to confess and reckon with her crime—is signaled early and tightens when Elias arrives, turning her internal struggle into an unavoidable confrontation. His demand ("end it") narrows her options decisively, forcing the commitment to dismantle all lies. The escalation is causal (protagonist agency drives the encounter's stakes), and the cost is legible: she loses her livelihood and must undo years of fabrications. One meaningful deepening with visible consequence meets the length requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action: guilt, accountability, and the cost of convenient lies. The driftwood ritual and watch hand create a pattern of particulars that resonate without overt statement. The ending reweights Mara's prior fabrications through Elias's witness and her commitment to "the dismantling," offering a non-literal answer to the question of how to bear the weight of withheld truth. No diagnostic label-speak appears in the final paragraph; the closing image of sifting through remains delivers earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's perceptual bias ("driftwood accumulated like broken promises"). Elias's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the confrontation without expository clutter. Some diction edges toward elevated register ("tempered regret," "crystallized into something sharper") but remains voice-consistent. Filter verbs ("she'd found," "she'd built") are acceptable and purposeful. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Psychic modulation supports emotional beats cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is maintained throughout. However, the piece carries template-cadence runs in the backstory section ("She'd built," "She'd found," "They died") and paraphrase loops around Mara's guilt ("the weight of unspoken words," "the enormous weight of truth," "the weight of a withheld truth"). Stock metaphors ("time had stopped," "weight of truth") and therapy-speak labels ("tempered regret," "quell the panic") appear in peak beats, dulling immediacy. These artifacts prevent entry into the 8+ range and trigger the −0.6 baseline deduction for template cadence plus −0.3 for label reliance in emotional moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The genealogist-turned-fabricator premise offers a fresh angle on guilt narratives, and the driftwood ritual as penance is specific and memorable. However, the core emotional arc—professional guilt → confrontation → renunciation—follows a familiar template. The "sieved hush" concept is mentioned but not developed into a distinctive operational constraint. Elias's arrival and his demand provide a credible turn, yet the resolution into tomorrow's dismantling reads as a standard redemption gesture. Specificity in setting and object elevates, but the moral calculus remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's identity as a guilt-ridden black market genealogist is established in paragraph two and drives every beat: her nightly ritual, her failed contact attempts, and her acceptance of Elias's demand. Her choice to "begin the dismantling" tomorrow is the story's decisive change, altering her options permanently. The character is present in setup, development (shore ritual as active penance), and payoff (confrontation + commitment), meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is strong; her prior fabrications create the conflict and her final choice forecloses her career with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in paragraph one (setup), slips into the sand mid-story (beat involvement), and is held alongside driftwood as Elias explains its origin (payoff). It returns with reweighted meaning: initially a symbol of guilt, it becomes evidence of the real parents' loss. However, its mechanical role is passive—Mara holds it but does not use it to alter tactics or make a choice. It charges the final image by association but is not causally indispensable. Two-gate presence with moderate reprise and causal linkage place it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is named once in paragraph two as Mara's method of filtering information for clients. It does not constrain an on-page action, shape a choice, or return at closure. The concept functions as thematic color rather than a mechanical or tactical element. Present in setup but absent from development and payoff, it remains ornamental and swappable with any synonym for selective information control.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's manufacture of false memories is dramatized in the Elias backstory (paragraph three): she created seamless fabrications that "withstood legal scrutiny" and severed him from his true ancestry. This attribute enables the central crime and generates the story's guilt-driven conflict. However, the trait is established in summary rather than shown through on-page action during the present timeline. It appears in setup, constrains the backstory conflict, and is revisited at closure when Elias names what she did. Functional across two beats with moderate cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quell" appears once in paragraph five: Mara's ritual of examining driftwood "helped quell the panic that woke her most nights." The action is tied to her nightly penance but does not drive a major turn or alter her options on the page. Elias's confrontation, not the quelling ritual, forces the story's decisive change. The action is functional but not load-bearing; easily swappable with any ritual of self-soothing or reflection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is introduced in paragraph five as Mara's penance method and recurs in paragraphs six, eight, and the final line. The method is signaled early, shapes her nightly ritual (middle development), and charges the closing image ("sift through these remains and remember what it meant to be accountable"). However, the mechanics do not alter her tactics or enable a choice during the confrontation; the method is contemplative rather than causal. Lyric resonance across setup and payoff with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace is named in the opening and closing lines, framing the story spatially. Mara descends from it to the shore, establishing vertical geography and her movement toward reckoning. However, the terrace does not supply a resource, constrain a choice, or pressure the confrontation; it functions as scenic framing. Present in setup and payoff with spatial clarity but minimal causal involvement. Lyric reprise without tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" is named in paragraph six as Mara's need tonight and echoed in the final third. Time is vague: "three years" since the crime, "six months ago" for the watch hand's arrival, "tonight" for the ritual. No clock tightens her attempts; the confrontation is coincidental (Elias finds her) rather than time-driven. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical, mentioned but not dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated in paragraph six and underlies her nightly shore visits and failed contact attempts. The desire is dramatized through her ritual and confrontation but is not conflicted—she seeks accountability without competing wants pulling her away. The friction is between her guilt and her inability to voice the confession, not between wants and costs. Present across setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal pressure, but the lack of internal contradiction keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tempered regret permeates the prose from the opening ("trembling fingers," "forgotten shore") through Elias's mirrored "tempered regret" and Mara's quiet acceptance at closure. The tone modulates appropriately: restrained guilt in the ritual, sharper crystallization during confrontation, and muted resolve in the final image. It coheres through turns without flattening into monotone and charges the ending's quiet commitment. The explicit phrase "tempered regret" in Elias's line borders on label-speak but is framed as observation rather than self-diagnosis.</comment>
