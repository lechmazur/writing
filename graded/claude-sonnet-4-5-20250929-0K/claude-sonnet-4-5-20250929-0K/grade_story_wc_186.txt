<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Esme's retrocognitive gift is established but functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her choice to journey reads as inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing desires. The interior relies on elevated diction ("prayers in disguise," "frost flowers") that reads more poetic than character-particular. The pivot from "refused to believe in accidents" to accepting her mission lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of star-mapping and broken-prism symbolism early, but closure arrives as stated intention ("she would prove it") rather than on-page action or image that reweights prior material with cost. The tremor coinciding with the Red Wanderer crossing establishes situational pressure, but Esme's retrocognitive vision of "future-echo" at the end retroactively grants certainty, flattening the stakes. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the prism "had always been meant to break," but this is told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass pavilion's "song" recurs and is vivid, but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Esme's choices. Spatial grounding is coherent (tower, beacon chamber, ruins below), and the star charts overlay onto the collapsed city creates a purposeful detail. The three locations (Temple of Echoes, Whispering Gallery, Silence Archive) are named but not visited on the page, reducing their pressure. The "shard of hush" concept is intriguing but remains abstract; no tactile interaction or sensory limit shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rekindle the beacon by proving pattern over coincidence. The discovery that the prism's breakage is a map constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the path forward is revealed to Esme via retrocognitive vision rather than forced by a dilemma or trade-off, so agency tilts toward observation. The ending beat ("she descended... carrying the broken prism like a promise") describes intention rather than enacting a choice with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the journey ahead is framed as certain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—coincidences as meaning waiting to be proven—emerges through the prism's breakage and star-path alignment, integrated into event and image. The glass pavilion's hum and "thistle-hope" create a recurring texture. The final image ("broken prism like a promise") offers a resonant callback but stops short of reweighting prior material with conceptual cost; Esme's certainty at the end ("she would prove it") declares theme rather than testing it. The "future-echo" moment borders on authorial guarantee, reducing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice leans poetic and elevated ("frost flowers," "thistle-blown hope," "tapestry larger than collapse or chaos"), which reads more authorial than Esme-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she saw") cluster in high-information beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains stable but the diction does not degrade under urgency. No dialogue on the page. The perceptual signature tilts toward lyricism rather than Esme's occupational or emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Figurative language appears frequently without pattern-taught payoff ("prayers in disguise," "frost flowers," "glass-song and thistle-hope," "shards of hush"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several lines restate concepts: "coincidences were prayers" / "coincidences... were simply meaning waiting to be proven." Template cadence in the middle section: "The first location... The second marked... The third indicated..." without variation. Elevated register ("retrocognitively blessed," "coherence," "convergence") does not match the urgency of rekindling a failed beacon. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize future intention rather than advancing present action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-collapse lone custodian and mystical-gift-reveals-hidden-pattern premise are familiar SFF templates. The "shards of hush" concept is evocative but not developed beyond label. The retrocognitive power delivers exposition conveniently rather than creating friction or cost. The star-path overlay onto ruins offers a fresh visual detail, but the emotional arc (doubt → certainty) follows a straight line without transformation. The story could retain the same beats with a different gift (divination, prophecy) and similar place-names, indicating moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Esme is present throughout and makes the decision to journey, but her choice is framed as inevitable once the vision arrives. She touches the prism and receives the map; no competing desire or constraint forces a trade-off. Her role tilts toward observer until the final paragraph's stated intention.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken prism is handled in at least three beats: the drop during the tremor, the retrocognitive touch that reveals its history, and the realization that its three pieces map to three locations. It returns in the final image ("carrying the broken prism like a promise"), reweighted as map and symbol. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a visible cost on the page; its meaning is declared rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shards of hush" are named as the object to retrieve from the Silence Archive and framed as necessary to rekindle the beacon, but no shard is handled or used on the page. The concept remains abstract; no mechanics or sensory detail demonstrate how hush would combine with starlight. Mentioned in setup and closure intention but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Esme's retrocognitive gift enables her to see the prism's history and the future-echo, serving exposition and revelation. It is signaled early and used twice. However, no visible cost or constraint accompanies its use; she presses her palm and receives answers. The trait does not force a trade-off or complicate her choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is the stated goal and frames the journey Esme will undertake, but the action occurs after the story ends. On the page, she gathers supplies and descends the tower with intention. No pivot or reversal traces to an attempt to rekindle; the beacon's failure is the inciting event, not a choice point.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is demonstrated when Esme overlays charts onto the map of the city, yielding the three intersections. The method is signaled early (grandfather's teaching) and used in one key beat to discover the pattern. It does not constrain or complicate; the charts deliver the answer cleanly. Present in setup and development but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is vividly described with its crystalline panels, star-etched trajectories, and wind-driven hum. It recurs as setting and auditory motif. It provides the star charts and the beacon platform but does not constrain Esme's movement or force a tactical choice. The pavilion's hum shifts to "a new song, higher and clearer" at the end, offering tonal support but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The post-collapse timeframe is established early with vivid ruin imagery and shapes the world's desolation. It informs the stakes (Esme is alone, civilization is gone) but does not tighten decisions on the page. No clock or deadline presses her; she has watched "seventeen stars die" before this moment, suggesting ample time. Present in setup and atmosphere but not as live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Esme's refusal to believe in accidents and her desire to prove pattern over coincidence are stated early and frame her interpretation of the tremor and prism break. The motivation drives her decision to journey, but no on-page friction tests it; she receives confirmation via vision rather than enduring doubt. The ending declares her certainty ("she would prove it") without demonstrating cost or conflict between desire and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" (and variants "thistle-hope," "fragile but persistent") recurs as descriptor and appears in the final paragraph. The tone is elegiac and hopeful throughout, modulating slightly when the pavilion hums "a new song, higher and clearer." It charges the final image but remains consistent rather than shifting under pressure. The phrasing is evocative and supports closure without becoming a static label.</comment>
