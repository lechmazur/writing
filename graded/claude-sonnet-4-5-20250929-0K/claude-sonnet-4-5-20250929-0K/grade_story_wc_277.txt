<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and her intellectual approach is well-rendered through specific actions (pen work, cross-referencing archives). The moment of realization "You clever old ghost" shows earned discovery, but the father remains a construct serving the plot rather than a felt presence—his cowardice-or-calculation question is answered too tidily. The decision to publish feels inevitable rather than costly; we don't see what she's risking (circulation, legacy, personal safety) in concrete terms. Interiority leans toward expository philosophizing ("proof by contradiction" becomes a frame rather than embodied struggle) and the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid—the piece moves through investigative discovery beats toward a decision. Closure arrives on-page (she will publish everything) with conceptual cost articulated in "silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender," but the felt price remains oblique; we don't see what publishing will cost her personally or institutionally. The proof-by-contradiction frame supplies logical scaffolding and the retraction-as-dare reversal is clean. Orientation is immediate (observatory, Celeste, post-call). One tightening: documents → cross-reference → realization → decision, sufficient for this length, though the middle compress into summary rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered (copper instruments, echoing dome, telescope pointed downward) and it constrains her approach—she thinks in celestial terms, uses astronomical tools for journalistic work. The rosewood nib and sextants weight the documents physically. The clouds-below framing recurs purposefully at open and close, and the echo motif threads through multiple beats, charging her solitary voice. Micro-setting (pen, instruments, observation table) functions as tactile anchor. Minor slip: "vaulted chamber where starlight bounced off copper instruments, creating whispers that multiplied into conversations with themselves" verges on ornamental; the mechanism isn't explained and doesn't recur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether to publish her father's suppressed investigation. One meaningful tightening when she realizes the retraction itself was strategic, narrowing her question from "was he a coward?" to "what was he setting up?" and compelling the publish decision. The cross-referencing beat (developer lawsuit, public filings) provides external validation that shifts her stance. Cost is conceptually present ("orbit of regret finally found its proper ellipse") but not viscerally felt—we don't see competing pressures (board opposition, family reputation, personal danger) that would make the choice agonizing. The "proof by contradiction" method supplies logical escalation but emotional escalation remains muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden-versus-revealed truth emerges through the retraction-as-proof conceit and the observatory-as-investigative-site metaphor. The "orbits of regret" motif recurs purposefully, shifting from circular to "spiral and ascending" at closure. "Silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender" offers a resonant reframing without overt moralizing. The grandfather/father/Celeste lineage threads through (rosewood nib, devotion to delicate instruments) and charges the ending. Minor deduction: "some truths required instruments more delicate than printing presses" and "hidden things only stay hidden if you stop looking up" veer toward theme statements rather than embodied discovery, and the final paragraph's "proof by contradiction was complete" over-explains the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the voice carries a consistent elevated register ("vaulted chamber," "sextants and astrolabes," "midnight between stars"). The observatory's echo serves as a purposeful device for her isolated reasoning. Psychic distance is controlled. Two deductions: (1) "devotedly observant" and "solemnly playful" are prompt-label intrusions that appear in exposition rather than emerging from scene action; (2) some interiority over-explains: "The Method was simple, really—proof by contradiction. Assume he was wrong..." reads as scaffolding for the reader rather than Celeste's natural thought process under pressure. Dialogue with Marcus is efficient but brief; no second on-page character to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and several images land well ("ink the color of midnight between stars," "echoing walls, which caught her words and threw them back like questioning companions"). Sentence openings vary. Information density is generally high. Three frictions: (1) Minor paraphrase loop: "The observatory echoed with the scratch of nib on paper" closely restates "her strokes as precise as plotting stellar coordinates" without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "a moon of doubt refusing to settle" is generic astronomy imagery. (3) Figurative density in the opening runs high (starlight-whispers-conversations, rosewood talisman, orbit of regret, creature waking) without clear pattern payoff, verging on ornamental. The final paragraph's "proper ellipse—not circular and endless, but spiral and ascending" over-explains the metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory-as-investigative-lens frame and the retraction-as-dare reversal offer a fresh angle on the inherited-guilt premise. The proof-by-contradiction method supplies structural ingenuity, though it's more scaffolding than embodied discovery. The synthesis of celestial observation and journalism is specific and purposeful. Two frictions: (1) The heiress-who-prefers-stars-to-empire setup is a familiar romantic trope (competence-meets-obligation) executed cleanly but not transformed. (2) The father's strategic retraction hinges on a coincidence (the developer lawsuit six months later) that validates Celeste's reading without her agency driving the discovery; the piece tells us it happened rather than showing her uncover causal proof.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Celeste appears throughout and her choices drive all major beats: she spreads the documents, cross-references archives, realizes the retraction was strategic, and decides to publish. Her heiress status shapes the stakes (inherited newspaper, obligation versus passion) and appears in the opening, middle ("monument to inherited obligations"), and closure. The newsprint-empire detail constrains her choice—she has the power to publish and the legacy burden. Cost is conceptually present but not viscerally dramatized (we don't see board opposition, circulation risk, or personal danger). Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure, but the emotional cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: pocket touch as talisman (paragraph 2), drawing connections on documents (paragraph 6), and writing the editorial (final section). It's a gift from the grandfather who "understood that some truths required instruments more delicate than printing presses," linking legacy and method. The nib enables her documentary work and the final act of writing. Two frictions: (1) the symbolic freight ("talisman," "delicate instruments") is asserted rather than earned through on-page use that alters tactics, and (2) the nib could be swapped for any writing instrument without breaking story logic—its rosewood specificity doesn't constrain her method or charge the closure beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" appears as a metaphor in paragraph 4 ("the orbit of regret that had kept her circling this same question") and returns transformed at closure ("her father's orbit of regret finally found its proper ellipse—not circular and endless, but spiral and ascending"). The concept frames her investigative stance (she's "searching for the pattern") and the proof-by-contradiction logic (assume-test-resolve). However, it functions primarily as thematic language rather than shaping on-page tactics or narrowing options. The "orbit" framing is ornamental astronomy imagery that could be replaced with "cycle of doubt" or "pattern of guilt" without altering her actions. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" appears as a label in paragraph 1 ("Here, devotedly observant, she tracked celestial patterns") and is asserted again in the final editorial description. The trait is illustrated through her documentary work (spreading papers, cross-referencing, drawing connections), but these actions would occur regardless of the specific label. The phrase reads as prompt language rather than a character-specific capability that enables or constrains a choice. Her investigative method could be described as "meticulous," "analytical," or "patient" with identical on-page beats. Functional but swappable; the exact wording doesn't charge the closure or create visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intervene" appears in Marcus's line: "He'd known someone would eventually intervene, would pick up the thread he'd left dangling." The father's retraction anticipated future intervention, and Celeste's decision to publish is the intervention that completes his strategy. The word is present and thematically apt, but the action itself (deciding to publish) would occur regardless of this specific verb. The intervention concept doesn't constrain her method or create a distinct cost; it's a label for the climactic choice rather than a tactical requirement that shapes her approach. Present in middle and implied at closure, but easily replaceable with "act," "expose," or "finish his work."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is explicitly named and demonstrated: "Assume he was wrong to retract. Assume the evidence wasn't circumstantial. Then what would that mean?" This logical structure drives her middle investigation (if evidence was strong, why retract? Unless the retraction was the proof). The method appears in setup (paragraph 5), structures her documentary work, and is declared complete at closure ("The proof by contradiction was complete"). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—we see the conclusion but not the step-by-step reasoning under pressure. The method could be replaced with "close reading" or "pattern analysis" and the beats would function identically. All three gates met, but the method is scaffolding rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The observatory appears throughout: opening description, telescope adjustment, document table weighted with instruments, echo device for her voice, and final telescope-pointed-downward moment before dawn. The setting enables her investigative method (she uses astronomical tools for journalism, thinks in celestial terms) and the echoing acoustics literalize her solitary reasoning. The clouds-above-below framing charges the opening and closure. The observatory's isolation shapes her tactics (no interruption, no collaboration) and its specific tools (sextants, astrolabes) weight the documents physically. The "above the clouds" detail recurs purposefully. Strong integration across all beats with causal and atmospheric pressure; the exact setting is difficult to swap without losing the celestial-investigative synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The journalist's call occurs "three hours earlier" and anchors the present scene; all action unfolds "tonight" in the observatory after that trigger. The timeframe is signaled early (paragraph 2), brackets the investigation, and ends with "approaching dawn," creating a single-night window. However, time doesn't tighten decisions—there's no deadline pressure or clock that alters her tactics. She could take days to reach the same conclusion. The "three hours" detail and dawn arrival mark duration but don't constrain choices or escalate urgency. Present in setup and closure, functional but not causal; a vague "recently" would change little.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is dramatized through her documentary investigation and explicitly stated in the final editorial: "motivated by the understanding that hidden things only stay hidden if you stop looking up." Her love of the observatory (paragraph 1: "what she truly loved was this") and her question about the father's retraction drive the investigation. The motivation appears in setup (tracking celestial patterns her editors call irrelevant), structures all middle beats (searching for the pattern, connecting dots, cross-referencing), and justifies the publish decision. Minor friction: the stated motivation is broad and could apply to any investigative journalist; the specific cost of truth-seeking (what she risks by publishing) remains abstract. All three gates met with clear causal drive, but emotional friction is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Solemn playfulness is asserted in the final editorial description ("solemnly playful with truth") and is illustrated through moments like "You clever old ghost" and the echo device ("questioning companions"). The tone blends elevated diction (vaulted, astrolabes, ellipse) with light touches (the observatory "groaned...like a creature waking," "devoted observant" has archaic gravity). However, the balance tips heavily toward solemn—most of the prose is earnest investigation with only brief flashes of play. The tone doesn't modulate with pressure; the climactic realization and publish decision are delivered in the same register as the opening. Present as intent and occasionally illustrated, but not coherent across turns or decisive at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
