<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shows through perception ("tranquilly perceptive," reading "dust patterns"), but her motivations remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The decision to open the box arrives without visible internal friction—she "knew she shouldn't" but proceeds with minimal cost shown on the page. The spirits are vivid in their silent testimony, yet their transformation at the end hinges on witnessing rather than Mara's agency, leaving her role more observational than transformative. Embodied emotion is present in careful gestures but therapy-adjacent phrasing like "self-imposed prison" dilutes the specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spirits dissipate when their words are witnessed) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: Mara commits to curating silenced truths in a wasteland. The causal lens holds—letter discovery → reading aloud → spirit release → Mara's new role—but the spirits' liberation feels convenient (they thin "one by one" without resistance or complication). Orientation anchors early (beehives, copper sun, seven seasons), and the single-scene structure fits scope. The cost is felt but not deeply personal to Mara; she gains a purpose without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, bleached hives, and lone eucalyptus create a vivid, purposeful frame. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, charged with meaning and handled across beats. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("copper sun," "crumbled at her touch," "light like captured honey"). The oasis geography is coherent, and the ghosts' nightly gathering at the spring constrains Mara's timing and staging of the ritual. The setting directly enables the closure moment, charging the final image with place-specific resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of silenced words that trap the spirits—is clear and signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara finds the letter, understands the covenant's poison, and chooses to read it aloud despite the taboo. The reversal is modest: the spirits' release hinges on Mara's act of witnessing, but no complication arises; the outcome is frictionless. The cost is conceptual (Mara's new burden as keeper of silenced truths) but not viscerally tested on the page. Agency is present but the escalation is linear without a meaningful obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ghosts' silent testimony and the letter's revelation: unspoken words become hauntings, witnessing releases them. The stained glass box, bees, and covenant motifs recur with shifting weight, and the final image—Mara cultivating "the garden of necessary speech"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. "Mute eloquence" operates through image and gesture, avoiding abstraction. The story resists tidy resolution; Mara's choice is generative, not conclusive, leaving ambiguity about her own cost. One line—"what we don't say becomes the ghost that haunts us"—edges toward thesis statement but is cushioned by being quoted from the letter rather than narrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Mara's perceptual filter ("astonished recluse," "tranquilly perceptive"). Diction is controlled and poetic without purple excess, though phrases like "self-imposed prison" and "mute eloquence" occasionally drift toward meta-commentary. No dialogue on the page; all speech is Mara reading the letter aloud, which fits the mute-world logic. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the box discovery and widening for thematic reflection. The prose texture is consistent and lyric, with rhythm that breathes in step with Mara's measured movements. Minor filter-verb presence ("she saw," "she understood") is voice-appropriate and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in beats like the box description and letter reading. Clarity is strong with no loops or synonym churn in key moments. Minor scaffold appears in transitional phrases ("Today she found something new," "They came as shadows lengthened") that could be tighter. Figurative language is controlled and grounded ("light like captured honey," "morning mist"), with no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: "unspoken apologies, smothered love, honest anger buried beneath false peace" restates the covenant theme without advancing pressure. No grammar or punctuation errors; pronoun references are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghosts-as-unspoken-words with the beekeeping covenant offers a fresh angle on silence and witnessing. The stained glass box as confessional vessel and Mara's role as keeper of silenced truths feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. The premise avoids template plot by anchoring theme in the logic of bees (truth-tellers) versus covenant (enforced silence). Emotional truth drives the turn—spirits released by acknowledgment, not exorcism—without gimmickry. Minor proximity risk: the "words we don't say haunt us" conceit is familiar, but the oasis setting and beekeeping frame transform it into something particular. Risk-taking in tone (lyric restraint, silent ghosts, no dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choice to open the box drives the central turn. "Astonished recluse" is demonstrated through her daily marveling at the ghosts and solitary study of the oasis. However, the astonishment is asserted early then dropped; by the time she opens the box, her decision reads as calm and predetermined. The trait shapes her observational method but does not constrain or complicate her final act—she proceeds without visible internal conflict. Setup clear, closure participation present, but causal pressure on this exact trait is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears at the story's midpoint, is handled physically ("lifted it carefully"), and returns in the final beat when Mara places it on the tree roots with a promise to fill it with "other found words." Its amber-and-gold bees visually encode the covenant theme, and its role as container for the silenced letter directly enables the climax. The box's return in the ending reweights it from discovered artifact to tool of Mara's new mission. Strong beat involvement (discovery, opening, placement) and closure linkage. Irreplaceability high: the stained glass and bee imagery tie it to the beekeeping oasis and the theme of transparency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tangled covenant" is introduced early, explained through the letter, and drives the central conflict: the families' silence poisoned the oasis, and breaking the covenant releases the ghosts. The concept shapes Mara's understanding of why she "shouldn't open" the box and provides the stakes for her act of reading. It directly alters options (to honor the covenant or break it) and the outcome (ghost release) depends on violating the covenant through public speech. Setup clear, middle constraint present, closure participation strong. The cost is conceptual but legible: Mara inherits the burden of voicing what others silenced.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is label-applied in the opening and demonstrated through Mara's reading of "dust patterns" and "the way shadows fell." The trait frames her observational method but does not constrain a key choice or create visible cost. She moves through the oasis calmly, but the story could function with a different temperament (e.g., anxious, angry) without structural change. The attribute supports voice but is not causally indispensable. Setup present, closure participation absent, no demonstrated tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gaze" operates throughout: Mara "had learned to gaze at these spirits with patience," watching their "pantomimed speeches." Her patient observation culminates when she watches the spirits dissolve after reading the letter. The act of witnessing (rather than exorcism or dialogue) is the mechanism of release, tying the action to closure. However, "gaze" is largely passive; the decisive act is reading aloud, not gazing. The action is thematically central but functionally secondary to speech. Setup clear, middle presence modest, closure participation present but not the primary driver.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is demonstrated when Mara reads "the angle of a broken frame suggesting violence or neglect, the arrangement of dried flowers indicating love or mourning." This method enables her to understand the covenant's poison and the ghosts' nature. However, it does not mechanically shape her choice to open the box or the outcome; the letter's content, once read, is explicit rather than contextual. The method frames her expertise but is not indispensable to the climax. Setup clear, middle constraint modest, closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" is vivid and integral. The setting provides the bleached hives where the box is hidden, the eucalyptus and spring where ghosts gather (constraining Mara's timing), and the thematic link between bees (truth, harmony) and the covenant's false peace. The wasteland frames the stakes: nothing grows except Mara's new "garden of necessary speech." The setting supplies resources (the tree, the water that draws ghosts) and pressures the choice (isolation, scarcity, the weight of the dead). Setup immediate, middle constraint strong (ghost gathering site), closure image charged by setting ("wasteland where nothing grew").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" establishes the timeframe early ("ever since the ghosts began appearing") and situates Mara's seven-season residency. The ghosts' nightly gathering at dusk imposes a schedule on Mara's ritual, and the phrase "Tomorrow she would fill the box" marks the story's temporal boundary. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or narrow options; Mara could have acted at any point. Setup clear, middle tightening absent, closure participation modest (the nightly cycle continues). The ghosts' visibility is a backdrop rather than a ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" drives Mara's final commitment: she will "be the keeper not of bees, but of what people had been too afraid to say." The motivation is signaled when she decides not to let the box "add another ghost to the wasteland" and is dramatized in her choice to read the letter aloud despite the covenant. The desire faces friction (the covenant's taboo, the risk of adding to the haunting) and the cost is visible in her new burden. Setup clear, middle choice constrained by this want, closure participation strong. The motivation is transformative: it shifts from preventing a new ghost to actively cultivating speech.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is sustained throughout: the ghosts' "mouths moving in silent testimony," the letter read aloud in "the only sound across the wasteland," the final image of words "read and witnessed and finally, mercifully, released." The tone modulates with pressure—quiet observation, rising tension at the box discovery, lyric restraint at the climax—without breaking coherence. The oxymoron of mute eloquence (silence that speaks) charges every beat and peaks in the spirits' soundless release and Mara's voiced reading. The tone is not static; it tightens around the act of speaking the unspeakable. Setup immediate, middle consistency strong, closure image directly charged by this tone.</comment>
