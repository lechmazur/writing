<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's arc from isolation to purpose is earned through the pillbox discovery and Sarah's final message, but his interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("silver hush," "unused courage waits") rather than embodied contradiction. The epiphany "You were never broken, only afraid" arrives as authorial comfort rather than dramatized realization through prior micro-choices. Emma appears too late and remains functional rather than pressured by her own stake. The final descent feels declared rather than tested by competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with a secondary Accumulative overlay (seasonal motifs). Closure lands on-page: Marcus descends with restored purpose, Emma sets truth in motion, promises kept—a Decisive Change with visible cost (isolation abandoned, risk embraced). Orientation anchors late: "Marcus Kaine" and "burned spy" arrive quickly, but "zephyr bluff" and "village below" remain spatially vague until the valley overview. The snow-code discovery and three-day clock create legitimate pressure, and the pillbox's interior engraving reweights prior material, but the final beat summarizes next steps rather than showing a single high-cost choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, and melting snow patterns create atmospheric specificity and the seasonal clock constrains tactics (three days to document). The pillbox is handled across beats and its worn surface reflects Marcus's anxiety. However, spatial choreography between bluff, valley, and village remains impressionistic; Emma's "cluttered desk" is the only interior anchor. The setting guides choice through the melt-clock but doesn't constrain the final image—Marcus simply descends with purpose restored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Sarah's evidence before spring erases it) is clear and tightens once: three days forces immediate action. Marcus's choice to involve Emma narrows options and raises exposure risk. The snow-code discovery is a meaningful reversal—what seemed lost is recoverable but perishable. However, the final act summarizes systemic payoff ("codes would reach the right people") rather than showing a visible price paid in the closure beat. The trafficking ring opposition remains abstract; no immediate antagonist tests Marcus's rekindled agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of repair and courage emerges through the pillbox message and Marcus's progression from isolation to action, but "fixing what's broken" is stated explicitly in Sarah's dying words and then glossed in the penultimate paragraph: "fixing what's broken meant recognizing that some fractures made you stronger." The snow-as-archive and seasonal cycle offer non-literal resonance, yet the ending pivots to a thesis statement rather than letting the final image do that work. The piece resists false equivalence (the trafficking ring is unambiguously evil), but the thematic answer is delivered rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with controlled psychic distance. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "vouchsafe this information" and "metastasized, spreading through legitimate businesses" drift into elevated register during moments of urgency. Dialogue with Emma is minimal but functional; her "Show me" is crisp. The perceptual signature is somewhat generic (burned spy observing from isolation), and the prose occasionally moves into summary mode ("They worked through the night") rather than sustaining scene pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with purposeful rhythm, but several phrases loop or lean on stock constructions: "silver hush" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "the kind of dead drop only Sarah would devise, prudently daring enough" stacks modifiers; "careful reserve" and "careful steps" echo within proximity. The opening and closing gestures (mist, zephyr, Marcus descending) create symmetry, but "unused courage had been waiting all along in the space between fear and action, between winter's end and spring's brave beginning" stacks abstractions at a peak beat. High information density in the snow-code reveal, but scaffolding persists ("he'd assumed she meant," "he realized").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The snow-code archive is a fresh dead-drop mechanism, and the seasonal clock adds urgency. However, the burned-spy-redeemed-by-dead-partner's-final-mission structure is familiar, and Marcus's arc follows a well-worn template (trauma → isolation → renewed purpose). The pillbox's double-reveal (coordinates, then interior engraving) is a competent twist but feels engineered. Emma's idealism and the "right authorities" resolution lean generic. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't transform the spy-redemption template through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus (burned spy) drives the key choice to involve Emma and document the codes, altering tactics from passive observation to active exposure. Present throughout; his burned status motivates isolation and the stakes of returning to action. However, his profession is more backdrop than active constraint—no tradecraft detail shapes his approach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pillbox appears in the opening (pocket, worn smooth by anxious fingers), mid-story (coordinates cross-referenced with snow patterns), and ending (interior engraving read, then pocketed). It drives two beats: the pilgrimage to the bluff and the final realization. Its engraving reweights Marcus's self-perception at closure. Swapping it for a letter would require structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is Sarah's dying instruction, frames Marcus's quest, and is explicitly restated in the penultimate paragraph. It shapes the dominant stake (repair what Sarah died protecting) but becomes a theme label rather than an on-page tactical constraint. Removing the phrase would leave the redemption arc intact with minor dialogue edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" appears once as a descriptor of Sarah's snow-code method ("prudently daring enough to hide intelligence in plain sight"). It does not constrain Marcus's choices or recur. Label-only; easily cut or replaced with "ingenious" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears in Marcus's pitch to Emma ("vouchsafe this information to the right authorities without the corruption swallowing it whole"). It articulates the plan's stakes and Emma's role, shaping the climactic choice to involve her. However, it's a single-use verb; substituting "deliver" or "protect" would not alter the turn's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The snow-codes are signaled early (strange patterns observed for weeks), drive the three-day urgency (southern exposures melting), and are documented via Emma's drone at the climax. The method's mechanics (seasonal preservation, satellite-proof) matter to the plot. Swapping for carved-tree codes would require rewriting the seasonal stakes, but the "codes" themselves could be any medium.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The zephyr bluff provides the vantage for discovery and frames the opening and closing (Marcus ascends, then descends). Mist lifts to reveal the codes. However, the bluff is more stage than constraint—Marcus could observe from any high point. It charges atmosphere but doesn't alter his tactical choices or the final image's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Spring's early arrival creates the three-day clock that forces immediate action; the "tilt of the earth toward spring" frames the opening and closing. Time pressure shapes Marcus's choice to involve Emma and the urgency of documentation. However, the timeframe is more thematic bracket (winter's end/spring's beginning) than a live countdown that shifts tactics beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Where unused courage waits" is articulated in the narration ("afraid to find where unused courage waits in the hollow spaces of a broken man") and restated at closure ("unused courage had been waiting all along"). It names Marcus's internal conflict but is told rather than dramatized through competing wants. The motivation shapes the arc but doesn't create visible friction between desire and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs three times (opening, midpoint retreat, final dawn) to establish tone of quietude and isolation. It modulates subtly—from oppressive to purposeful—but remains a consistent atmospheric layer rather than intensifying under pressure. The mist and soft dawn at closure support the tone, which charges the final image of Marcus descending with restored purpose.</comment>
