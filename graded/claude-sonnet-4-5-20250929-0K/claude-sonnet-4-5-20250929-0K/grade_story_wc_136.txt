<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's analytical-artistic duality is established early and shapes her approach to mapping the fortress. Her choice to "dare" is motivated by seven years of charting routes and sensing hidden patterns, though the internal contradiction between rationality and mystery-seeking could be more viscerally embodied. The moment she finds her own name in the fortress reads as convenient self-discovery rather than earned revelation through prior on-page struggle. Her final mapmaking action aligns with established traits but the cost of validation feels abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: mist-cathedral-arrows-fortress build density toward a final reconfiguration where Mara completes a map acknowledging both rational streets and mysterious passages. Orientation anchors (Mara, station platform, 4 a.m.) land within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (map completion that validates both modes), though the cost—what she sacrifices by charting unspoken truths—remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. The conductor's punch "validates passage" but the mechanism and price blur into metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station vault, mist, orange security lights as constellations, and pavement cracks as arrows are vivid and selective. The "starlit vault" returns in the final line, charging closure. Spatial choreography through the tunnel is coherent, and the fortress chamber's walls of suppressed confessions constrain Mara's final choice to map rather than merely observe. The micro-setting (notebook, cracks) functions as tool and guide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the hidden city beneath the visible one—is signaled early and tightens when Mara descends into the tunnel. Her "dare" is a meaningful choice that forecloses retreat, and the conductor's warning deepens risk. However, the fortress revelation (her own name carved in stone) arrives without prior on-page resistance or tactical cost; she walks, finds, and begins to draw. The final mapmaking is agency, but the intervening journey lacks a visible obstacle or trade-off that narrows her options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths calcified into architecture emerges from concrete images (cracks as arrows, fortress of silence, names in stone) rather than assertion. The final map—acknowledging both rational and mysterious passages—offers a resonant answer to the question of mapping around hidden truths without stating a moral. "Some truths unmake the lies we've built ourselves upon" is a thematic echo but remains tied to the conductor's warning rather than Mara's own epiphany. The closing image (completing the map at dawn) reweights prior material with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (analytical mind catalogues angles while her hand moves intuitively) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue with the conductor is spare, carries subtext, and advances plot. The conductor's archaic uniform and brass punch distinguish her voice from Mara's modern analytical idiom. However, phrases like "trembling certainty" and "starlight contract" drift into elevated metaphor that edges beyond Mara's established cartographer diction under pressure. Psychic distance holds cleanly with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at the dare, longer accumulative sentences in the tunnel). Clarity is high; no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is dense ("starlit cathedral," "fractal complexity," "calcified silence") but controlled and legible. Minor overwriting: "trembling certainty, that particular state of being utterly convinced while remaining fundamentally terrified" is a paraphrase loop that could compress to one phrase. The final paragraph's "dawn's hour had arrived" is slightly redundant after "The clock struck five." Information density is strong; sentences do multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phantom conductor and hidden-city-beneath-the-map premise feel familiar from urban-fantasy templates, though the analytical-artistic mapper adds a specific angle. The fortress of unspoken truths as architectural metaphor is evocative but not wholly surprising. The final image (mapping routes for others to follow when ready) is earned but trends toward the safe middle—neither boldly open nor decisively closed. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, yet lacks a single turn or cost that feels irreversible in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's route-mapping trait is present from the opening and shapes her response to the cracks (sketching with "quick, elegant strokes"). Her analytical mind catalogues while her hand moves intuitively, and she explicitly states maps won't help in the fortress but will help her understand the way back. At closure, she draws a new kind of map. Two distinct beats (initial sketching, final mapmaking) and closure linkage; causal pressure is moderate (the trait enables her method but does not visibly constrain or cost her). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.8, decent specificity +0.4 = baseline ~6.7; swappability (could be another meticulous profession) −0.3 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phantom ticket punch appears when the conductor materializes and is used once (validating Mara's passage with an intangible mark). It does not return or reweight at closure; the final map is Mara's own tool. Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, moderate specificity (brass, gleaming, antique) +0.4, causal link (validates passage, shifts something in her chest) +0.7 = baseline ~5.0; ornamental after its single use and absent from closure −0.6, late first appearance (second third) −0.2 = 4.2, but the validation enables the journey so lift slightly to 5.8 under Accumulative lens tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unraveling mysteries is the dominant stake from the opening (investigating reports of the phantom conductor, seeking the hidden city) and drives Mara's descent into the tunnel. The fortress of unspoken truths is the mystery's heart, and the final mapmaking is her method of sharing what she unraveled. Early signal +0.7, three beats (investigation, descent, discovery) +1.4, causal pressure (shapes all tactics) +1.3, closure linkage (the map completes the mystery) +1.2, high specificity +0.6 = baseline ~8.2; swappability (any quest concept) −0.5, cost connection is oblique −0.6 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "analytically artistic" trait is stated early ("logic and aesthetics intertwined") and shown in Mara's dual approach (cataloguing angles while finding beauty, analytical mind and intuitive hand). It enables her to perceive both rational streets and mysterious passages in the final map. Early signal +0.6, two beats (initial sketch, final map) +0.9, moderate causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (the map acknowledges both modes) +1.0 = baseline ~6.3; label-only in places ("analytical mind catalogued") −0.3, swappability (any hybrid skill) −0.4 = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "dare" is the hinge action: Mara's reply "I dare" triggers the conductor's validation and her descent into the tunnel. It forecloses retreat and enables the journey to the fortress. Setup +0.6 (anticipated by the conductor's question), one key beat +0.4, high causal pressure (redefines her options) +1.2, closure linkage (she dares to map for others) +1.0, specificity +0.5 = baseline ~7.7; slight swappability (any commitment verb) −0.4 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cracks forming arrows are introduced in the opening paragraph, guide Mara into the tunnel, and multiply inside ("arrows multiplied, spreading across walls and ceiling in fractal complexity"). They are the mechanism of discovery. Early signal +0.7, two beats (platform observation, tunnel navigation) +0.9, causal pressure (they direct her path) +1.1, specificity (northeast intention, crude arrows, fractal) +0.6 = baseline ~6.3; absent from closure image −0.4, could be replaced by another sign system −0.4, but lift slightly for strong middle development to 6.8 under Accumulative tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" is established early (station's vaulted ceiling, mist rolled thick, constellations in condensation) and returns in the final line ("in the starlit vault of the station, the clock struck five"), reweighting the opening with dawn's promise. The setting frames the journey but does not constrain a tactical choice; it is atmospheric. Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise that reweights +1.0, tone support +0.5 = baseline ~5.1; ornamental (postcard description without pressure) −0.7, swappability −0.4, but the reprise is purposeful so lift under lyric allowance to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "four in the morning—that liminal hour when night's vices surrendered to dawn's promises" opens the story and closes with "the clock struck five. Dawn's hour had arrived," bracketing the journey and charging the closure with symbolic completion. Time pressure is symbolic rather than tactical (no visible urgency or deadline). Early signal +0.7, closure linkage (dawn arrival) +1.1, moderate specificity (liminal hour) +0.5 = baseline ~5.3; ornamental (no tactical constraint) −0.6, but thematic reweighting lifts under Accumulative lens to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Finding the fortress of unspoken truths is Mara's explicit motivation from the opening (months investigating the phantom conductor, seeking the hidden city) and drives every choice (descent, daring, final mapmaking). The fortress contains her own name, suggesting she was searching for a personal truth. Early signal +0.8, three beats (investigation, descent, discovery) +1.4, high causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage (she maps the fortress for others) +1.3, cost connection (validation and what she found) +0.5 = baseline ~8.4; the personal truth is told rather than dramatized −0.6, slight abstraction −0.4 = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Trembling certainty as tone is established ("prepared for this moment with trembling certainty, that particular state of being utterly convinced while remaining fundamentally terrified") and recurs in Mara's steady voice despite her hammering heart and her analytical confidence paired with mystery-seeking. The tone modulates across the descent and charges the final image of completing the map. Early signal +0.6, coherent through turns +1.0, modulates with pressure +0.8, closure charge (map completion holds both conviction and lingering uncertainty) +1.0, specificity +0.5 = baseline ~6.9; paraphrase loop in the definition −0.3, slight overstatement, but lift for strong closure coherence to 7.0.</comment>
