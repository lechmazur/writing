<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradictions are embodied through self-harm and plant communion—"how could she learn to read their stories if she kept them covered"—but the interiority occasionally tips into label-speak ("accidentally telepathic") and over-articulated realization. The final choice to christen the hourglass with blood is earned by prior causality and forecloses pursuit for justice, visible cost present. Dr. Venn remains functional but flat, his betrayal revealed rather than dramatized in present pressure. Micro-choices (picking scars, pressing hourglass to wrist) reveal hierarchy of values under the meteor's constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—plant memories, coffee rings, and scar tissue layer toward the final revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's final act ("pressed the hourglass against her reopened wrist, letting her blood christen its frozen surface") crystallizes her shift from closure-seeking to justice, with visible cost (self-wounding, confrontation ahead). Orientation anchors by ~150 words (tower, meteor hush, Mara waking). One meaningful deepening: the roses' memory of Dr. Venn dragging Sarah changes knowledge and tactics. The cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower's stone walls, climbing roses, wooden table, and frosted hourglass all constrain choices and charge the closure—Mara learns by touching objects with root-knowledge, and the hourglass becomes the vessel for her blood oath. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "Coffee rings overlapped on the wooden table like sedimentary layers." Spatial choreography is clean (tower room, workspace, windows). The meteor's fifty-mile radius creates a coherent constraint (no electronics, telepathy with plants) that shapes every tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: learning Sarah's fate through plant telepathy. One meaningful tightening: the gap in coffee-ring patterns leads to the table's memory of Dr. Venn dragging Sarah, narrowing options from closure to justice. Agency is decision and endurance—Mara asks surgeons to reopen the wound, presses the hourglass to her wrist—forecloses passive grief with visible cost (self-harm, confrontation ahead). Escalation is accumulative and constrained by the meteor hush; coincidence (meteor, plant telepathy) complicates the premise but does not resolve. Cost is legible: blood, reopened scars, shift from witness to accuser.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—scars as text, plants as witnesses, the frozen hourglass as displaced miracle—without explicit statement. The final image offers a resonant answer to "how do wounds tell truth": by opening them and charging objects with intention. Motifs (coffee rings, roses, scars) recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the roses' "silent screaming," the table's forest memory, Mara's blood oath. The piece resists tidy morals: justice and self-destruction intertwine. One slip: "accidentally telepathic" reads slightly label-like, though the meteor hush grounds it in world logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptual signature: she notices root-knowledge, coffee sediment, scar layers. Voice modulates with pressure—early lyric drift ("patient and green") tightens into action at closure. No dialogue present; not applicable. Free indirect style is clean: "But how could she learn...?" blends narration and thought without filter clutter. One minor register slip: "accidentally telepathic" feels slightly convenient/modern against the otherwise mythopoetic diction. Psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping; single focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives in crisis ("There—a gap"), longer accumulative sentences in memory immersion. Information density is high—most lines layer world, memory, and motive. Two minor loops: "The roses would testify. The table would remember. Even the coffee rings held their truth" recycles parallel structure without added pressure; "Some wounds opened themselves" echoes "Some scars wrote themselves" without clear payoff. Figurative language is mostly coherent ("sedimentary layers," "root-knowledge") but "displaced miracle" appears three times without fresh angle. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—plant telepathy in a meteor-hushed tower used to solve a sister's murder—synthesizes fresh elements (coffee rings as timeline, table's forest memory) that feel specific to this world and voice. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact mechanics. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative revelation through object-memory) heightens stakes without gimmickry. One familiarity: the "scars as text" metaphor is well-worn, though here it's literalized through surgical reopening and blood oath. The roses as frustrated witnesses and Dr. Venn as betrayer offer non-obvious synthesis. No close echoes of famous lines; voice coheres as singular mythic-forensic stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—picking scars during recovery, asking surgeons to cut deeper, pressing the hourglass to her reopened wrist—create key turns and the final reconfiguration from closure-seeking to justice. She appears in setup, drives middle revelation (coffee-ring gap → table memory), and enacts closure with blood oath. Cost is visible throughout: self-harm, morphine fog, shift to confrontation. The character is causally active across all three gates and the final image would fail without her wound-opening agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in setup ("sat beside her notes"), returns at closure ("picked up the frosted hourglass... pressed... against her reopened wrist, letting her blood christen its frozen surface"), and is reweighted from miracle-token to oath-vessel. It constrains understanding (time stopped for sand, not people) and charges the final image. Two touches across distinct beats (observation, ritual use). Causal role: its impossible permanence models Mara's own frozen grief until she acts. The hourglass could be replaced with another symbolic object without breaking logic, limiting irreplaceability. Cost linkage is present but the object does not itself narrow options mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The displaced miracle (meteor hush, frozen hourglass, plant telepathy) shapes stakes and tactics on every page: no electronics force reliance on plant witnesses; the hourglass models paradox; telepathy enables investigation. Setup explains the meteor's fifty-mile silence and Mara's ability. Development: she tunnels through rose memories because the hush allows it. Closure: blood on the frozen hourglass merges miracle and justice. The concept is causally essential—remove the meteor and the plot collapses. Three gates met with high specificity and cost (isolation, self-harm).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy constrains investigation (Mara must touch or be near plants, tunnel through layers) and enables the revelation (roses, moss, table all testify). Setup signals it early; development shows her "weeks learning to tunnel through the roses' memories"; closure links it to the table's forest memory of Dr. Venn. Cost: the labor of weeks, self-wounding to deepen contact. One friction: the trait is told more than shown in embodied action—we see results (memories) but not the somatic or perceptual price of accessing them beat-by-beat. Two gates solid (setup, development); closure participation is present but passive (she receives memory rather than wrestles it). Swappability is low; irreplaceable within this world.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears explicitly ("Mara had spent weeks learning to tunnel through the roses' memories") and the action drives the major turn: pushing past surface impressions to root-knowledge reveals the "warmth, a presence" that later resolves as Dr. Venn. Setup teaches the method, development applies it to roses, closure applies it to the table. The tunneling metaphor is causally essential—surface memories alone would not expose the doctor. Cost: weeks of effort, self-harm to access scar-stories. The term itself is somewhat generic (could be "delve" or "excavate") but the layered-memory mechanic it names is specific and irreplaceable. Three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coffee rings as timeline-reading device appear in setup ("how the rings revealed timelines, how the breaks in their circles showed where memories fractured"), are examined at the climax ("studied the coffee rings again... There—a gap"), and yield the key insight that sends Mara to the table. Two distinct beats. Causal pressure: the gap in coffee-ring pattern is the trigger for seeking the table's memory. The method is specific to Mara's investigative idiom. One friction: the mechanics remain slightly abstract—why rings break where memories fracture is asserted, not dramatized through cost or failed attempt. Still, removal would break the plot's investigative spine. Three gates present; mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn frames the entire story: isolation enables plant communion, the stone walls hold ivy memory, dawn light lets Mara examine her wrist, and the tower's history (abandoned research station, three hundred years) grounds the premise. Setup anchors location and its rule (no EM frequencies). Development: Mara works at the tower table, accesses the building's witnesses. Closure: "the quiet tower at dawn" appears in the final paragraph, charging the reconfiguration. The setting constrains choices (isolation = no outside help, reliance on environment) and supplies resources (ancient plants, wooden table from local trees). Micro-setting (body, table, hourglass) all function within the tower frame. Three gates met with coherent constraint and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening ("morphine fog lifted as dawn touched") and explains Mara's physical state (surgical recovery, fresh blood). The waking moment triggers examination of the reopened wrist and the drive to read scars now. One friction: after the first paragraph, the post-anesthesia state does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—Mara moves freely through memory and investigation without time pressure or recovery limits affecting tactics. The frame sets mood and injury-state but does not escalate. Two gates (setup, mild development via embodied pain); closure does not depend on time elapsed or narrowing window. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to learn to read the stories in scars—is dramatized through contradictory choices: she promised Dr. Venn she'd leave scars alone, yet picks them during recovery and asks surgeons to cut deeper. The desire is present in setup ("how could she learn to read their stories if she kept them covered"), drives development (tunneling through plant memories to access hidden truth), and charges closure (pressing hourglass to reopened wrist as oath). Friction between want (knowledge) and cost (self-harm, surgical risk, isolation) is visible across beats. The motivation is specific, conflicted, and irreplaceable—remove it and the wound-opening logic collapses. Three gates met with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meteor hush as tone—silence, patience, slowness of living things, telepathic intimacy—is coherent from opening ("the meteor passed close enough to hush all electromagnetic frequencies") through closure ("in the meteor's eternal hush"). The tone modulates appropriately: lyric calm in plant-memory immersion, tightening urgency when the gap appears, charged stillness in the blood oath. The hush is not merely mood but constraint—it enables plant telepathy and isolates Mara. The final image ("quiet tower at dawn," blood on frozen hourglass) is saturated with this tone. Three gates met; tone shapes the ending's resonance and is irreplaceable. One minor slip: "accidentally telepathic" phrase feels slightly at odds with the otherwise mythic register.</comment>
