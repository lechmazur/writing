<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is specific and embodied through her meticulous journals and grief over vanishings. The old woman's backstory about losing her archive grounds her transformation credibly. However, Mira's final shift from pure documentation to planting feels slightly rushed; the pivot occurs more through conversation than through on-page contradiction forcing the choice. The secondary character (the woman) applies clear pressure but the relationship itself doesn't evolve with visible cost—it remains tutorial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density of vanishings, guerrilla gardens, and the bread's warmth build pressure toward the final seed-planting realization. Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, courtyard, post-vanishing city) within the first paragraph. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the journals will now map gardens, reweighting documentation from elegy to transformation. The cost is conceptual (accepting forgetting) and felt (giving up pure preservation), made legible in "forgiving myself for remembering" and the pocket seeds. One meaningful deepening—from recording loss to nurturing growth—suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard with wisteria and greenhouse-glass tea house grounds the scene vividly and selectively. Sensory details (jasmine scent in November, impossible goldfinches, warm bread six weeks old) signal magical realism and filter through Mira's noticing. The guerrilla gardens constrain the woman's method and charge the closure when Mira commits to planting sunflowers. Spatial choreography is clean; the courtyard's wildness mirrors the city's forgetting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to respond to the city's self-erasure) is clear from the opening and tightens when the woman offers seeds and a new framework. The tea house encounter forces Mira to choose between documenting loss versus transforming it—a real fork with visible cost (accepting the vanishings cannot be stopped). The bread as last artifact and the woman's archive loss provide escalation through accumulative texture. Agency is present: Mira's decision to pocket the seeds and plan tomorrow's planting forecloses pure preservation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (sacred in the ordinary, transformation vs. preservation) emerges organically from the bread, guerrilla gardens, and Mira's journals without thesis statements. "Tenuous absolution" and "forgiving myself for remembering" avoid platitude by rooting in the woman's archive loss and Mira's three-year grief. The final image—seeds as absolution, sunflowers as guerrilla monument—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "making beauty of the impossible present" in the final line edges toward purple thematic announcement rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) is stable with distinct perceptual signature: she notices absences, keeps records, tracks patterns others dismiss. Diction is controlled and literary without register breaks. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Not covering. Transforming."). However, some phrases verge on elevated poeticism that slightly exceed Mira's established voice under pressure: "heuristically gentle," "embodied every perfect loaf," "defying season and sense" read slightly authorial. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied with strong imagery (bronze lions, vines as patient conquerors, pressed flowers). Information density is high; sentences multitask. However, minor overwriting appears: "bread that embodied every perfect loaf" and "understanding blooming like the guerrilla gardens themselves" are slightly ornate metaphors in high-pressure beats. "Tenuous absolution" and "creeping normality" feel prompt-adjacent. Some filter verbs ("watched goldfinches") dull immediacy where directness would sharpen. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise (city forgetting itself, guerrilla gardens as response) offers a fresh angle on urban decay and memory. The tea house structure and the woman's pivot from archivist to gardener provide specific, non-generic detail. However, the "magical memory loss" and "wise elder teaches lesson" pattern are recognizable tropes executed well but not transformed radically. The synthesis feels coherent but not startling; the moral calculus (accept loss, plant beauty) is earnest but arrives at a fairly comforting resolution without deeper friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira as "creeping normality noticer" frames the story (her journals, her three-year tracking) and drives the tea house encounter. Her observation habit enables the plot but her decision to plant transforms only in the final third after tutorial dialogue. Present in closure (pocketing seeds, planning sunflowers) but the noticing itself doesn't create a key reversal—it's the woman's reframe that does.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bread appears early, is handled (set on table, broken, tasted), and returns with reweighted meaning: not preservation but transformation, memory made physical then offered forward. It anchors the impossible (warmth six weeks later) and the sacred-ordinary theme. Shapes the closure beat by embodying Kasmir's vanished labor and priming Mira's shift. Essential across setup, middle sharing, and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly mid-story ("You're forgiving the city") and echoed in the final line ("seeds felt like absolution, tenuous but growing"). It shapes Mira's stake—how to respond to grief—and the woman's method (forgiving herself for remembering). However, it reads more as thematic label than a force that alters on-page tactics. The woman's absolution is backstory; Mira's is future-oriented. Functional but closer to concept-as-theme than concept-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" describes the woman's tea-pouring in one beat ("movements heuristically gentle, each gesture refined through decades of repetition into something approaching kindness"). The word choice is specific and conveys learned patience, but the attribute itself doesn't constrain a choice or create visible cost. It characterizes manner without altering tactics. Present and apt but closer to descriptive flavor than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once: the woman "uncloaked her work with casual pride, gesturing to the courtyard." It's a single gesture that reveals the guerrilla plantings but doesn't drive a turn—Mira had already deduced the woman's role two paragraphs earlier ("You're behind the gardens"). The revelation is confirmatory, not transformative. Swappable with "revealed" or "displayed" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is signaled early (rosemary where butcher stood, lavender overwhelming post office), demonstrated mid-story (strategic plantings, pressed flowers, seed packets), and becomes Mira's adopted method at closure (planting sunflowers as guerrilla monument). The mechanics matter: choosing sites of vanishing, using flowers as transformation and wayfinding for other noticers. Drives two beats (woman's practice, Mira's future action) and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret tea house in overgrown palace courtyard is anchored early, materialized "between blinks," built from salvaged doors and greenhouse glass. It supplies resources (tea, seeds, wisdom) and pressures Mira's choice by existing only for noticers. The wildness (shoulder-high wisteria, impossible goldfinches) mirrors the city's state and the woman's transformation ethos. Essential to closure: Mira leaves it to enact what she learned there. Setting enables the encounter and symbolically supports the theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south that autumn" appears in one sentence describing when the courtyard went wild. The timeframe signals wrongness (jasmine in November, goldfinches post-migration) but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency. It's atmospheric context, not a pressure mechanism. No countdown or seasonal constraint alters Mira's tactics. Present as setting detail but replaceable without affecting escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is dramatized through the bread (perfect crust, dawn labor), the tea ritual, and guerrilla gardens turning absence into beauty. Mira's journals document the ordinary made sacred by loss; her final commitment to plant is a choice to honor rather than preserve. The motivation drives her grief and her shift, but it's articulated more than conflicted—the woman's lesson resolves rather than complicates it. Shapes two beats (observation habit, closure planting) with thematic cost (accepting impermanence) but friction is modest.</comment>
