<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her actions align with her beliefs about "screaming tenderness," but her interior life relies heavily on reflective exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices (polishing the lens, placing the soil, adjusting the pulse) serve the concept more than reveal genuine internal conflict. Thomas functions as a foil but exerts minimal pressure; his conversion feels unearned because we never see him truly resist or force Mira into a hard trade-off. The final smile and the peaceful resolution lack visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no genuine struggle dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as accumulative/conceptual: the piece builds meaning through the night-garden motif and vibrations-of-intent framework, culminating in the ship's safe passage. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). However, the closure lacks felt cost: Mira succeeds without sacrifice, Thomas converts without friction, and the ending summarizes theme ("Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence") rather than letting the image speak. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence shows what Mira gave up or risked. The conceptual repricing is asserted, not earned through dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt air, dawn light, and harbor are rendered with specific sensory detail (chipped paint, "rose and gold"). The vial of night-garden soil functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat, and the lantern room's windows serve as tactical anchor points. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Mira's method (she must work within the lighthouse's physical structure) and the breaking heat wave creates atmospheric shift, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the fishing vessel drifts toward rocks, but the resolution lacks genuine escalation: Thomas reaches for the horn, Mira says "Wait," and the captain corrects course with "unhurried precision." No reversal, no cost, no forced trade-off. The captain's compliance feels convenient rather than earned by Mira's agency. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweigh options; here it simply validates Mira's premise without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of "screaming tenderness" emerges through the grandmother's teaching, the night-garden scent, and the contrast with Thomas's horn-blasting. The final image of the lighthouse pulsing "steady as breathing" offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the last two paragraphs slide into direct thematic statement ("Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly") rather than trusting the image. The conceptual work is present but diluted by exposition; the piece would gain power by cutting the moralizing and letting the ship's safe passage carry the full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds steady; psychic distance is controlled and Mira's perceptual signature (sensing "vibrations of intent," filtering through her grandmother's teachings) is distinct. The dialogue snippet ("Wait" / "How did you—" / "The vibrations of intent...") feels functional but slightly expository. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling") are voice-appropriate and not overused. One slip: "Background said" is a textual error (likely "Mira said"), breaking immersion at a key beat. Prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure, and diction remains within Mira's idiom throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but several passages drift into near-paraphrase loops: "Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly... Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence" restates the same idea. The final three paragraphs stack thematic summary rather than advancing image or action, dulling momentum. "Background said" is a typo that breaks the closure beat. Figurative language ("like light through breaking clouds") is serviceable but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but the ending lingers in reflection rather than propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper uses night-garden scent and adjusted light pulse to guide a ship—offers a fresh angle on maritime-guidance tropes. The "vibrations of intent" concept and the grandmother's "screaming tenderness" philosophy feel specific to this voice. However, the emotional arc (gentle wisdom triumphs over force) follows a familiar template without significant transformation. The captain's immediate compliance and Thomas's easy conversion lack the friction or surprise that would elevate ingenuity. The story commits to its premise but plays it safe, avoiding bold risk or unexpected cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's role as assistant keeper frames expectation early, and her choices (preparing the lens, placing the soil, adjusting the pulse, beckoning Thomas to wait) drive the central beats. Her decision to prove her method shapes the entire night's action and the closure hinges on her approach succeeding. The character's choices create key turns, though Thomas's acquiescence limits the friction. Causal pressure is present; the element is essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in two beats: Mira retrieves it ("worn smooth from handling, stained dark"), then works it free and replaces it at the end. Early description primes its significance, and the final act of pressing the cork back in signals preservation of what remains. However, the cork itself is not causally active—the soil's scent does the work. The cork's physical properties (smoothness, staining) do not constrain choice or alter tactics. It functions as container rather than tool, meeting the lyric-resonance allowance but not reaching full causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is introduced early and explained through Mira's grandmother's teaching. It frames Mira's lens-polishing meditation and Thomas's eventual understanding. However, the concept remains abstract—no on-page beat shows intent changing the lighthouse's physical properties or the captain's perception in a way that narrows options. The concept is discussed and thematically claimed but not dramatized as a concrete constraint or enabling force. It shapes Mira's philosophy more than her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's act of purifying intentions through lens-polishing is described: "Each circular motion... clarifying her purpose: not to prove Thomas wrong, but to prove whispers right." This constrains her emotional stance and primes her method. However, the purification is internal and reflective; no on-page cost or trade-off arises from it. The attribute is present in development but does not enable a visible tactical shift or foreclose a path. It reads as character flavor rather than plot-driving trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's beckoning gesture ("her hand raised—not blocking him, just beckoning him to pause") is the pivotal action that stops Thomas from blasting the fog horn and allows the captain to respond to the scent and light. The beat is dramatized and the action is irreplaceable in that moment—without it, Thomas would have used the horn and the test would fail. However, the gesture itself is brief and its success depends more on Thomas's compliance than on Mira's active pressure. It shapes the major turn but feels partly contingent on luck.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The night-garden scent (jasmine, moonflower, nicotiana) is signaled in the vial retrieval, explained through the grandmother's teaching, and deployed when Mira places soil at each window. The captain emerges on deck, tilts his face upward, and breathes in "the impossible scent of night-blooming flowers reaching across the waves," then adjusts course. The method is set up, executed, and causally linked to the outcome. Its mechanics (scent carried by breeze, evoking calm attention) shape the attempt and the success. Strong setup-to-payoff integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is anchored at dawn in the opening line and returns in the closing image ("painted... rose and gold"). The lantern room's windows serve as tactical anchor points where Mira places the soil. The lighthouse's physical structure (spiral stairs, iron railing, lens) grounds the action. However, "at dawn" as a timeframe is less active than "cobalt lighthouse" as setting; the dawn light bookends the piece but does not pressure choice. The setting constrains Mira's method and charges the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance and two-of-three gates (setup, payoff; development is weaker).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" is mentioned in the opening ("three weeks of relentless heat... the heat wave finally broken") and frames Mira's readiness to begin. The breaking weather provides atmospheric relief and signals a turning point, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock during the main action. The timeframe is setup flavor rather than a force that narrows options. It appears early but does not return or shape tactics meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts—is dramatized through her preparation, her contrast with Thomas's horn-blasting, and her execution with the scent and adjusted pulse. The desire drives the entire night's action and is tested when the fishing vessel appears. Internal friction is present in her meditation ("not to prove Thomas wrong, but to prove whispers right"), though it remains mild. The motivation shapes setup, development, and closure, and the cost is the risk of failure (though that cost never materializes on the page). Strong integration despite low-stakes tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is introduced as the grandmother's phrase and becomes the thematic spine. The tone modulates between reflective calm (lens-polishing, dawn imagery) and the quiet intensity of the midnight test. However, the tonal charge peaks in the grandmother's aphorism rather than in lived contradiction or pressure. The final paragraphs summarize the tone ("fierce love speaks most quietly") instead of embodying it through image alone. The tone is coherent but didactic at closure, missing the chance to let "screaming tenderness" pulse through the ship's safe passage without commentary.</comment>
