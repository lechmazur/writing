<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Helena's interiority is concrete and character-specific throughout: preprocessing through spreadsheets and decade catalogs, then transferring that methodology to the butterfly scales. The final choice to begin again with caterpillars in spring carries visible cost—accepting impermanence and her own pattern-making limits. Internal contradiction operates clearly: she chose butterflies to escape analysis, yet the flood strips that pretense and she returns to what she knows, now with "kindled humility." Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "preprocessed reality" framing, but the trait shapes on-page choices consistently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (greenhouse, three weeks post-flood, Helena among the wreckage). The closure—documenting seventeen scale types and deciding to begin again—reconfigures the opening stakes: she sought incremental beauty but discovers that transformation persists even in decay, with cost legible in her acceptance of cyclical loss ("More water, more damage, more opportunities"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from mourning lost butterflies to seeing "what she'd missed while the butterflies lived," narrowing her stance from possession to witnessing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse supplies concrete constraints: shattered glass, waterlogged plants, torn panels overhead guide her physical search and limit what remains. The portable microscope and glass slides anchor the documentation work tactilely. The final sensory note—"humid air outside smelled of wet earth and coming rain"—charges the ending by signaling the cycle will repeat, making her choice to rebuild consequential. Minor cap: while vivid, the setting could be slightly more differentiated from generic research-space destruction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: recovering what remains of the butterfly collection, which deepens to recovering meaning from loss. The tightening occurs when Helena realizes "the flood had done the stripping" she'd sought, forcing a shift from control to acceptance. Her agency is endurance with visible cost: she catalogs what's left, commits to repairs and a new cycle, accepting that "transformations happen whether you documented them or not." One meaningful pressure point—realizing the scales hold information even as dust—reweights her relationship to gradual change under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the neutron-star/butterfly pairing: both are evidence of catastrophe, both involve gradual transformation, both leave traces after the source has moved on. The final image—pulsars spinning in "perfect decay" like butterflies scattering across the universe—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to live with loss and impermanence. No moralizing; the ending reweights the opening's "needless drama" desire by showing drama is inherent, and meaning persists in patterns. The "space between" reflection deepens rather than states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Helena's analytical lens: "overlapping shingles of chitin" and "decay curves she plotted for rotating stellar remnants" root perception in her profession. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightest during microscope work, pulling back for the walk home. One minor slip: "The comparison wasn't frivolous" feels like authorial reassurance rather than Helena's thought. Otherwise, perceptual signature is consistent, vocabulary matches her expertise without lecturing, and the rhythm slows appropriately during documentation, quickens at the ending's release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, shorter fragments during observation ("The butterflies were gone, of course") expanding into longer analytical cadences during microscope work. Two minor issues prevent higher scoring: "kindled humility, warm and unfamiliar" edges toward abstract label rather than staying concrete, and "had been real, had been beautiful, had mattered in its moment" repeats structure for emphasis but borders on overdetermination. No loops or major artifacts; clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The neutron-star/butterfly synthesis is fresh and earns its parallels through specific detail rather than forcing metaphor. The transformation of a hobby-for-presence into a lesson about evidence-after-catastrophe feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the scientist-learning-from-nature frame is familiar, and the piece doesn't fully escape the "analytical person discovers emotional truth through loss" template. The execution elevates the premise through specificity (androconial scales, pulsar timing data), but the emotional arc follows a recognizable path. Risk-taking is moderate rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Helena's professional identity shapes her response throughout: she catalogs memories by decade, creates systematic records of scales, analyzes decay curves. Her choice to document seventeen scale types and commit to beginning again next spring is causally rooted in her researcher disposition. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (photographing, measuring, documenting), and payoff (final decision to start with caterpillars). The character is essential to the story's particular execution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The wing dust drives three distinct beats: initial collection with soft brush, microscope analysis revealing architecture, final arrangement on slides creating systematic record. Setup early (second paragraph), development through middle section (ground scales, cover scales, androconial scales), payoff in final image held to fading light. The dust enables Helena's shift from mourning living butterflies to seeing transformation-as-information. Removing this exact object would eliminate the story's central mechanism for accessing meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gradual change shapes stakes directly: Helena chose butterflies specifically for "attention to gradual change rather than catastrophic events," creating ironic pressure when the catastrophic flood forces her to find gradual change in its aftermath. The concept alters her tactics—she documents incremental scale differences, recognizes neutron stars' millennia-long spin-down. Present in motivation (paragraph 3), method (afternoon documentation), and closure (understanding "the space between"). The concept is weight-bearing, not merely thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" is established early and enables her documentary response to loss: spreadsheets for divorce, decade catalogs for grief, systematic scale records for the flood. The trait constrains her emotionally—she can't feel directly—but enables the discovery that transforms the ending. Visible in two beats: the flashback examples and the afternoon's methodical arrangement. Cost is present: she wanted butterflies to escape this pattern but returns to it, now with humility. Would score higher with one more on-page moment showing preprocessing actively blocking then enabling a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Decay operates across three layers: butterfly decay to wing dust, neutron star spin-down, and Helena's gradual acceptance. Setup in opening wreckage, development through scale documentation ("Decay was just transformation observed patiently"), payoff in final pulsar image of "perfect decay." The action is irreplaceable—substituting "loss" or "transformation" alone would lose the scientific precision that makes the parallel work. Slightly below indispensable because the story's surface plot is recovery/documentation, with decay as interpretive frame rather than driving physical action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method appears in setup (collecting dust with soft brush), shapes middle development (photographing, measuring seventeen distinct scale types across four stages), and charges the ending (final slide held to light, stars as "trails of light through accumulated time"). The mechanics matter: dust patterns reveal what she missed while butterflies lived, creating the knowledge shift that enables her acceptance. Removing accumulated-dust-patterns and substituting direct butterfly observation would fundamentally alter the story's logic about finding meaning in aftermath.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies concrete constraints: buckled roof lets butterflies escape, shattered glass and waterlogged plants limit salvage, workbench becomes "small island of order" where documentation occurs. Setting pressure is present in three beats: opening search, afternoon arrangement creating order within wreckage, final locking of door before leaving. The damage state matters—intact greenhouse would eliminate the story's core dilemma. Would score higher if repairs or spatial navigation shaped a middle choice more actively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Three-weeks-post-flood timeframe establishes emotional distance from the event and explains why she's returning to assess rather than rescue. Future time appears in closure (tomorrow repairs, next spring caterpillars). The temporal position matters for her reflective stance but doesn't tighten decisions within the dramatized afternoon. Meets setup and closure participation gates solidly, but middle development is minimal—the afternoon's duration is unmarked and creates no urgency. Swapping to "four weeks" or "two weeks" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to strip needless drama is established in paragraph 3 and drives her butterfly choice, creating ironic pressure when flood delivers stripping she didn't want. Friction between want and outcome shapes her afternoon realization: "She had wanted the butterflies to strip needless drama...Instead, the flood had done the stripping." Cost is visible in accepting cycles of damage. Present in setup and payoff with clear reversal. Would reach 8+ if the motivation created one more active choice in the middle rather than mostly framing retrospective understanding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone modulates from grief-tinged mourning (opening loss) through methodical calm (documentation work) to quiet acceptance charged with awareness of impermanence (final walk). "Kindled humility, warm and unfamiliar" appears explicitly but is better earned through the shift from wanting control to accepting "transformations that happened whether you documented them or not." Coherent through turns, charges the final image of stars and pulsars with earned reverence. Minor deduction for one moment of direct tone-telling rather than pure embodiment.</comment>
