<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's interiority shows embodied emotion—"satchel heavy," pendant "warm against her chest"—and her motivations drive specific choices: borrowing time, releasing it to free the echo. Internal contradiction surfaces when she must uncage what she worked to trap, a genuine micro-tension. The backstory about her mentor is economical and anchors the present search, but the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally urgent, keeping emotional range in mid-high rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera uncages the echo she sought, setting revelation free with felt cost (temporal scars, spent power in the pendant). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—cadence builds through sensory detail and the echo's metaphysical unveiling, deepening pressure via the giant's breath and borrowed time. Orientation is clear early (rooftop canals, giant napping). One meaningful tightening occurs when she releases stolen minutes and watches the phenomenon unfold, reweighting her quest from capture to liberation. The cost is visible ("interrupted cadences would heal eventually") and conceptual (truth requires liberation), meeting Conceptual Repricing criteria as well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rooftop canals, bronze towers, and the giant's breath provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Vera's naturalist lens. The architecture constrains her search: "narrow gap between two aqueducts" is where the echo is born, making setting essential to discovery. Micro-setting (the pendant, specimen jars, canals) charges the final image when she descends "before the giant woke." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the giant's breathing functions as both atmosphere and pressure device.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the birthplace of echoes—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: Vera detects temporal scars, stretches time, locates the echo, then must choose whether to keep it caged or free it. The uncaging decision narrows options (she releases borrowed time, accepts fading scars) with on-page cost, though the choice feels more philosophical than agonized. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the echo must be liberated to be understood, altering her approach from capture to release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth requires liberation, capture distorts revelation—emerges through action rather than statement. The infinity pendant, temporal scars, and the caged bird's song accumulate meaning without overt moralizing. The final image reweights the quest: Vera sought to cage a mystery but learns she must free it, a non-literal answer to the central question. The resolution avoids tidy binaries; temporal scars persist, a quiet cost. Minor slip: "some mysteries weren't meant to stay caged" borders on thesis articulation, though rooted in prior beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-particular: "gossamer thing," "silk made of memory," "temporal hiccups" reflect a naturalist's lyric precision. Psychic distance stays controlled; POV knowledge remains consistent (she's learned to feel temporal scars, her mentor's fever delirium). Diction modulates purposefully—compression during time manipulation ("syrup," "crystallizing") then releases into observation. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature tied to Vera's craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "leather satchel heavy with specimen jars and charcoal sticks" anchors profession, physicality, and purpose). Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Minor slip: "Between the towers, where water catches breath before falling" and the mentor's near-identical quote feel paraphrase-adjacent, a micro-loop. Figurative language ("gossamer thing," "silk made of memory") enriches without overwhelming, though "borrowed time" recurs frequently. No major scaffolding or clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Core premise—time sculptor seeking echo birthplace—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy mechanics and natural history illustration, specific enough to avoid template plots. The twist that echoes are born with sound, not after, feels earned by prior setup (temporal scars, the caged bird). Emotional particularity (mentor's delirium, pendant's warmth) grounds the fantastical. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphysical stakes elevates without obscuring. The giant-beneath-city frame is vivid but slightly ornamental, not fully integrated into Vera's choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's role as natural history illustrator shapes her goal (find/document echo birthplace) and her method (sketching frantically, seeking "original template"). Her choice to uncage the echo—releasing borrowed time—creates the climactic turn. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure action. Causal pressure is moderate; the role enables but doesn't deeply constrain. The sketching itself is summary-only at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Infinity pendant appears in opening (passed from mentor), signals her time-sculpting gift, and returns charged at closure ("glowing faintly with spent power"). Three beats, thematic linkage (twin/original echo loops), but its mechanics are told rather than shown in action. It frames the gift but doesn't constrain a specific choice under pressure. Lyric reprise lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is signaled early ("temporal scars, places where time limped"), drives Vera's method of detection ("frequencies that didn't quite match"), and shapes the central discovery. She identifies the hiccup, manipulates it, then accepts that scars will heal—closure cost. Appears across setup, middle search, and ending reflection. Specific mechanics (temporal limping) matter tactically. Slightly abstract but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Time-sculpting ability is demonstrated on-page: Vera borrows five minutes, stretches the present, slows water to syrup, enabling her to see the echo. The act has visible cost (temporal scars, pendant glows with spent power). Present in two beats (manipulation, release) and essential to the discovery. Mechanics are shown, not only labeled. Could score higher if the trade-offs were more agonized or constrained her further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uncaging the echo is the climactic action that completes Vera's arc: she gathers stolen minutes back, releases them, watches the echo burst free and multiply. The choice transforms her quest from capture to liberation, directly shaping the closure image and thematic payoff. Central to the final third and indispensable to the ending. Slightly summary-driven in the sketching aftermath, but the release itself is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Borrowing time is signaled early ("by borrowing minutes from one moment and grafting them onto another"), demonstrated mid-story (borrows five minutes from giant's third hour), and released at the climax. The mechanics shape her access to the echo and impose cost (temporal scars). Present across three beats. Slightly abstract; the "how" is more metaphor than concrete procedure, but it constrains her window and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rooftop canals provide the architecture essential to discovery: "narrow gap between two aqueducts" is where sound meets itself, the birthplace of echoes. The giant's breathing and bronze towers create the resonance conditions. Setting pressure: she must finish before the giant wakes (timeframe overlap). Water's behavior under slowed time reveals the phenomenon. Setting is indispensable to the central mystery and shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Giant's seven-hour nap frames the window ("time enough for her task, if she moved carefully"), signals early, and returns at closure ("descended before the giant woke"). The timeframe creates urgency but isn't actively tracked beat-to-beat. The giant stirs slightly mid-story, a micro-pressure beat. Present in setup and ending, functional but not tightly integrated into moment-to-moment escalation. More atmospheric constraint than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding the birthplace of echoes drives Vera's every choice: climbing to the rooftops, listening for temporal scars, borrowing time, uncaging the phenomenon. Signaled early via mentor's delirium, pursued actively in the middle, and resolved at closure when she witnesses and sketches the echo's division. The quest shapes tactics and carries conceptual cost (liberation over capture). High specificity and causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>
