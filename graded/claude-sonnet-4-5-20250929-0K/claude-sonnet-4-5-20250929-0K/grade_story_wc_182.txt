<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marin's motivation to rescue the seventeen is stated but her internal contradiction—scholarly desire versus rescue urgency—never produces a visible on-page choice that costs her something. The time traveler and the seventeen lack distinct interiority; they exist as conceptual vessels. The final negotiation with the bookstore reads as assertion rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal Marin's hierarchy of values under pressure. The "carefully resourceful" trait is labeled (battery life, water, breadcrumb markers) but never constrains a tactical decision where she must sacrifice one resource for another.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal negotiation layered over Accumulative texture) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bookstore agrees to exchange rather than consumption, the seventeen rise with agency intact). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (mountain bookstore, Marin, botanical diary). However, the negotiation itself—Marin's key speech—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality; no prior beat demonstrates that the bookstore can be reasoned with or that Marin has tested this approach. The cost is implied (the bookstore "makes space") but the visible price to Marin or the seventeen is vague, undercutting closure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bookstore's labyrinthine geometry, spiral shelves, and "unheard symphony" are vividly rendered and perceptually specific. The botanical diary functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image (blank pages filling). However, the environment does not constrain a choice during the descent; Marin's careful resource management (battery, water, markers) is mentioned but never forces a tactical trade-off. The setting's sensory signature (frequencies in bone and blood, dust in meaningful configurations) is memorable and filtered through Marin's arcane-linguist lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescue the seventeen) is clear and announced early. The piece tightens once—Marin finds them transformed, then negotiates—but the escalation lacks agency-driven causality: Marin does not attempt a failed rescue tactic that then forces her to pivot to negotiation. The bookstore's pause and consideration reads as coincidental rather than a response to pressure Marin applied through prior moves. The cost of the resolution (the bookstore "makes space," the seventeen carry fragments of knowledge) is conceptual but not felt on the page; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path is shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme (knowledge grows through exchange, not isolation; unlearned lessons as practice) emerges from the botanical diary's plants and Marin's negotiation. The final image—diary pages filling in a language Marin is "only beginning to understand"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the time traveler's speech ("The Library of Unlearned Lessons isn't a place, it's a practice") veers into explicit thesis statement, reducing subtext. The concept of "unlearned lessons" is evocative but remains abstract; the story does not dramatize a specific lesson being unlearned or relearned on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marin's perceptual signature as an arcane linguist is consistent and specific: she recognizes proto-linguistic fragments, hears the symphony's mathematical structure, chooses "words that existed between languages." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The time traveler's dialogue ("You can hear it too") and Marin's negotiation carry subtext and goal pursuit. Minor: the phrase "unheard symphony" recurs but risks becoming a label rather than a lived texture; once in the final paragraph, "unheard symphony shifted into a new movement" feels slightly mechanical rather than filtered through Marin's embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (shelves branching like neural pathways, features phasing between ages) is vivid and controlled. The piece avoids scaffold loops and maintains clarity. However, several high-register abstractions appear in peak beats without concrete anchors: "frequencies that bypassed ears entirely," "knowledge that couldn't exist in conventional reality," "lessons yet unlearned" (repeated twice in the final paragraph). The closing phrase "The mountain would keep its library, but now it would share" tells the resolution rather than showing a specific image or action that embodies the new exchange.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of living bookstore, arcane linguist, botanical diary of impossible plants, and "unlearned lessons" is specific and non-obvious. The negotiation frame (rescue as exchange rather than extraction) offers a fresh angle on the "person trapped in magical place" trope. However, the piece does not fully transform its speculative-fiction template: the climax is a persuasive speech rather than a choice that grows from Marin's internal contradiction or a cost she must pay. The emotional truth of the rescue—what Marin risks or loses to bring them back—remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marin is present throughout and her linguist expertise colors perception (proto-linguistic fragments, "words between languages"). She makes the key decision to negotiate rather than extract. However, her choice is not constrained by prior failure or internal conflict; it arrives as insight rather than being forced by pressure. Setup clear, middle development weak (observation dominates), closure participation strong (she speaks, holds the diary). Two gates met solidly, third partial. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high (linguist lens unique); closure linkage strong. Band ~5.5–6.0 fits the profile; settling at 5.8 for the weak middle gate and lack of visible cost tied to her decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (first paragraph), is handled and read multiple times (Marin traces pages, opens to final entry, receives it back, watches new entries fill blank pages), and charges the final image. Three gates met. Beat involvement: at least three distinct moments (opening examination, negotiation prop, closing transformation). Causal pressure moderate (it proves unlearned lessons can grow, but does not constrain Marin's choice). Closure linkage strong (final image). Specificity high (plants representing abandoned evolutionary paths). Elevating toward 7.2 for strong closure work and recurring functional use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The rescue mission is stated as context ("rescue missions couldn't wait") and Marin's goal is to bring the seventeen back, but the concept does not shape on-page tactics. Marin descends, finds them, negotiates—no failed rescue attempt, no visible trade-off between rescue urgency and scholarly discovery. Setup present (stated early), middle development weak (no tactical constraint), closure participation weak (resolution is exchange, not extraction; the concept pivots rather than resolves). Swappable with "recovery mission" or "retrieval." Functional but largely ornamental to the negotiation climax. Band ~4.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is labeled in one sentence (battery life, water, breadcrumb markers) but never constrains an on-page action. No moment where Marin must choose between resources or sacrifice one to gain another. The trait does not enable a key turn or impose a cost. Setup weak (label only), middle development absent, closure participation absent. Ornamental mention. Band ~3.0–3.5; rounding to 3.2 for presence in the text without functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marin's renegotiation speech is the peak action and the hinge of the resolution: she proposes exchange, the bookstore pauses and agrees, the seventeen rise. The action is signaled ("she needed to renegotiate the terms") and executed on the page. Setup clear, middle absent (no prior negotiation attempt), closure participation total. Beat involvement: one major beat. Causal pressure strong within that beat (the speech changes the bookstore's stance). Closure linkage decisive. Specificity moderate (the speech itself is brief and abstract). Irreplaceable within the chosen climax. Strong closure work elevates to ~6.7 despite single-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early ("spent weeks researching gaps in the bookstore's catalog system, finding patterns in what wasn't there") and enables Marin to find the chamber (the missing volumes create a map). Setup strong, middle development strong (the method guides her descent), closure participation weak (the negotiation does not rely on gap research). Beat involvement: one extended sequence. Causal pressure moderate (it gets her there but does not shape the negotiation itself). Specificity high (catalog gaps as negative-space map is a distinctive method). Two gates met solidly; third weak. Band ~5.0–5.8; settling at 5.4 for lack of payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is introduced immediately, pressures Marin's navigation (she uses markers, descends through impossible geometries), supplies the seventeen as both obstacle and resource, and is the entity Marin negotiates with at closure. Three gates met emphatically. Beat involvement: setup, descent, negotiation, final reorganization—four moments. Causal pressure high (the bookstore's hunger and sentience drive the conflict). Closure linkage total (Marin addresses it, it responds, it reorganizes). Specificity high (organic growth through mountain core, shelves as neural pathways, dust configurations, unheard symphony). Indispensable. Strong case for ~7.8–8.0; settling at 7.9 for comprehensive integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" is mentioned ("arrived last Tuesday") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock pressure; Marin's descent and negotiation proceed without time constraint. The time traveler's arrival is backstory setup, not an active timer. Setup present (last Tuesday mentioned), middle development absent, closure participation absent. Ornamental temporal marker. Band ~2.5–3.0; 2.8 for presence without functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Marin's desire to find the Library of Unlearned Lessons is stated early ("She'd come seeking") and contextualizes her descent, but the goal does not produce on-page friction or choice. She finds the chamber, then pivots to rescue negotiation without the library goal complicating her decision. The time traveler's revelation ("The Library isn't a place, it's a practice") resolves the question but occurs as told insight rather than dramatized realization. Setup clear, middle development weak (goal does not constrain her path), closure participation moderate (reframed thematically). Two gates partial. Functional but not pressure-driving. Band ~5.0–5.5; 5.1 for lack of internal conflict between the library goal and rescue urgency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" recurs throughout as a tonal and sensory signature: Marin feels its structure, it grows stronger as she descends, the time traveler mentions it, and it shifts "into a new movement" at closure. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (complex harmonies deepen, then pause during negotiation, then shift). Three gates met. Beat involvement: four moments. Causal pressure weak (the symphony does not constrain Marin's choice). Closure linkage strong (the shift signals the bookstore's agreement). Specificity high (frequencies in bone and blood, mathematical precision). The tonal metaphor charges the final image but remains more atmospheric than causal. Band ~6.2–6.6; 6.4 for strong atmospheric integration with moderate causal weight.</comment>
