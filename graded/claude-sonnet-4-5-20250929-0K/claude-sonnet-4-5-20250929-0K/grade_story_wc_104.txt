<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's planning and strategic patience are consistently shown through micro-choices (decoding keys, arranging them by piano octaves, working calmly under time pressure). Her motivation to preserve seed diversity drives concrete actions from escape to final planting. However, the character feels more like a vehicle for thematic delivery than a person with contradictory impulses; her competence is never genuinely threatened, and the escape unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or cost that might foreclose alternate paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with situational elements (wall demolition provides cover). Orientation anchors arrive early (kneeling, carnival setting, prisoner status). The closure—planting seeds in wasteland—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she chooses to "bind herself to something greater"), but the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; we don't see what she sacrifices by going to the wasteland instead of distributing evidence immediately. The key-decoding sequence provides a meaningful tightening, but the arrow's discovery and her escape proceed without friction, weakening the sense of earned consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: decaying stuffed animals, crooked prize wheel, boarded windows create atmosphere while the piano bench and prize wheel constrain her search pattern. The setting actively shapes Mira's movements through the space (keys point toward stage, ticket booth, wheel). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The final wasteland with "cracked" soil waiting charges the closure image with tactile specificity that makes the planting decision concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: escape with evidence to expose the regime's engineered famine. The wall's demolition provides external pressure and a ticking clock that creates one meaningful tightening. However, Mira's competence nullifies most opposition—the guards never materialize as a threat, the key arrangement solves itself, chains unlock conveniently. The arrow discovery lacks complication; it simply rests where promised. The final choice to plant seeds rather than immediately distribute evidence introduces a new priority without showing what tactical options it forecloses or what urgent cost she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of patient, strategic resilience versus monoculture control emerges organically through the seed vault, key-decoding, and final planting action. The image of "seeds splitting concrete" and "roots finding purchase in impossible places" concretely embodies the resistance philosophy. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "liberation meant nothing without the wisdom to sustain it" comes close to spelling out the moral. The arrow's pressed-leaf fletching is a strong particular that makes regime crimes concrete. The closing image of planting while others celebrate effectively reweights celebration as insufficient without grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature is purposeful: Mira notices piano patterns, seed characteristics, soil conditions—details filtered through her expertise and mission. Diction maintains elevated literary register that fits the narrative stance: "staggering grace," "hydraulic groan," "patient truth." However, some phrases drift toward thesis-delivery rather than character-specific thought: "true liberation required strategy over force" reads as narrator wisdom rather than Mira's lived idiom under pressure. Rhythm modulates appropriately between action beats and reflective moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with vivid images ("dust motes danced," "chains singing their quiet song") and good sentence variety. Information density is high in the key-decoding sequence. However, several lines carry metaphoric overload without earned payoff: "staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete" appears twice in different forms, and the phrase "patient truth" + "slow, certain return" in the final paragraph stacks abstractions. The phrase "chained liberator, now freed, chose to bind herself" toggles the bind/free concept mechanically. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She lifted... She began... She moved..." sequence flattens momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of seed-vault resistance, carnival setting, piano-bench cipher, and wall demolition creates a memorable scenario. The arrow with pressed-leaf fletching is a specific, striking detail. However, the core arc—political prisoner escapes during regime change to continue resistance—follows a familiar template without sufficient transformation through lived particular cost. The piano-bench decode unfolds too smoothly; Mira's mastery of every challenge (cipher, chains, guards) undercuts the sense of earned discovery. The seed-planting ending, while thematically coherent, arrives without the friction that would make the choice feel urgent rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira ("chained liberator") drives key choices: decoding keys, retrieving the arrow, escaping, choosing to plant seeds rather than immediately distribute evidence. She shapes setup, middle turns (key arrangement, arrow discovery), and the ending image. However, her choices never face meaningful resistance—every decision succeeds as planned—so agency reads more as execution of a blueprint than decisions under pressure that narrow options with cost. The final planting choice introduces a new priority late without showing what urgent path it forecloses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The arrow appears in setup (promised by mentor), middle (discovered behind prize wheel, fletching examined), and closure (tucked against chest, mentioned as future evidence distribution). Its pressed-leaf fletching and engraved dates provide specific, irreplaceable evidence of regime crimes, making it more than ornamental. However, once found, the arrow becomes static—carried rather than used in a way that alters tactics or costs. Its closure participation is passive (mentioned in coat while she plants seeds) rather than causally active in the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seed vault shapes the inciting stakes (regime calls her terrorist for maintaining it), motivates her imprisonment, and drives the closure action (planting seeds from the vault in wasteland). It's present across setup (mentioned as reason for arrest), middle (seeds in coat pocket established), and ending (seeds planted with specific traits: drought-resistant, thriving in poor soil). The concept constrains her tactics—she must both retrieve evidence and preserve the seeds—and the final image makes seed-planting inseparable from the closure's meaning. Removing this element would collapse both motivation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is demonstrated on the page through her three-month planning, calm work under time pressure ("worked with the calm of someone who understood that haste would impede"), and systematic key arrangement by piano octaves. The trait constrains her method—she cannot rush—and this patience contrasts with the urgency of wall demolition, creating tension. However, the cost of patience is never tested; everything succeeds on schedule without forcing her to abandon careful strategy for improvisation. The attribute trends toward label reinforcement rather than creating a visible tradeoff or limitation that alters a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Impede" appears once as philosophical stance: "haste would only impede her purpose." It describes her mindset but does not drive a major turn where she must actively slow or obstruct something on the page. The action is label-only rather than dramatized—we don't see her choose to delay, sabotage, or block a live threat in a way that changes options or costs. The word could be replaced with "ruin" or "undermine" without altering the narrative structure, signaling swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The piano-bench key arrangement is signaled early (mentor's message, "chaos of old keys"), developed in the middle (Mira arranges keys by piano octaves: brass to C, silver to D, creating coordinates), and pays off by revealing the arrow's location (three keys point to stage, five to booth, two to wheel). The method constrains her approach—she must decode rather than search randomly—and the mechanics matter to the sequence. However, the solve unfolds too smoothly without failed attempts or cost, making it feel more like a puzzle exposition than a pressure point that alters tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carnival prize redemption center shapes setup (shelves of decaying toys, boarded windows, moonlight shaft establish atmosphere and constraint), middle action (piano bench holds keys, prize wheel hides arrow, spatial layout guides her search), and closure (broken window enables escape). The setting is not merely backdrop; its specific architecture—bench, wheel, panel—provides the resources and obstacles that structure her escape sequence. Removing the carnival and substituting a generic warehouse would require rewriting the entire cipher and search mechanics, demonstrating tight integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Wall demolition is established early ("hydraulic groan" she's been "waiting for"), provides external urgency (chaos covers her escape, guards distracted), and frames the ending context (crowds celebrating while she plants). The timeframe tightens her decision—she must act during the demolition window—and the contrast between others celebrating the wall's fall and her choosing to plant seeds charges the closure thematically. However, the wall's demolition unfolds conveniently without complicating her plan or forcing adaptations; it serves as enabling backdrop rather than a constraint that alters her tactics under pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "plant resilience" is established in setup (seed vault maintenance, regime's monoculture ban), motivates middle actions (carrying seeds in coat, retrieving evidence of crop destruction), and drives the closure choice (planting drought-resistant seeds in wasteland instead of immediately distributing evidence). The motivation faces friction: distributing the arrow could expose the regime now, but she prioritizes long-term agricultural resilience, a trade-off with conceptual cost. The final image—kneeling to dig holes, "each seed a promise"—makes the motivation inseparable from closure and demonstrates visible enacted desire with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" is signaled explicitly ("staggering grace of seeds splitting concrete") and implicitly through Mira's calm, purposeful movements under pressure, the lyrical description of chains "singing their quiet song," and the deliberate pacing. Tone remains coherent through action beats and reflective passages, modulating between urgency (wall demolition, escape) and meditative patience (key arrangement, seed planting). However, the phrase "staggering grace" is stated rather than fully embodied at closure; the ending drifts toward thesis ("patient truth," "slow, certain return") rather than charging the final image with the tonal paradox of violent beauty the phrase promises.</comment>
