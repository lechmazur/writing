<comment>Mara's "desperately jocular" mask is label-only until Emil names it, then it's credited to others off-page; we never witness her perform this trait under pressure in scene. The seventeen relief workers arrive as a collective with minimal individuated choices—Yuki, Marcus, and Seraphine are named but never speak or act, so the cast feels like a roster rather than a crucible. The ending shift from motion to staying is asserted ("choosing, finally, to stay found") rather than dramatized through a visible on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses the nomadic path. Interior contradiction and embodied struggle are absent; Mara's loneliness is told and the "cure" is summarized in the final paragraphs without a choice that costs her something live on the page.</comment>

<comment>Orientation is prompt (station, Mara, moon rock by paragraph two). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the group choosing to stay), but the decision happens off-page between "someone suggested combining" and "suddenly she understood"—no on-page negotiation, resistance, or visible sacrifice that forecloses the nomadic pattern with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (loneliness motif, fragments gathering), yet the final "permission to stay found" is asserted thematically without a cadence shift or image that reweights prior material with pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived because anchors land early, but the lack of on-page closure cost and the summarized pivot ("they still disappeared… but they always returned") prevent higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The disused railway station with ivy-covered platforms and moss-covered benches is vivid and anchors the setting early. The station functions as meeting-point and later "anchor point," but it does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Mara could coordinate from any ruin. The moon rocks rest "on a shared table" in the final paragraph, charging the image mildly, and the ivy recurs in the closing sentence, creating a purposeful frame. Spatial choreography is clean (ticket office, doorway, platforms), and the "abandoned places where infrastructure failed but nature persists" motif is consistent, but the environment remains atmospheric rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled in paragraph two. The arrival of Emil and the other sixteen workers constitutes accumulation rather than a causal reversal—no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by resistance. The combining of fragments is a non-event ("didn't merge or glow or do anything mystical"), and the shift to "permission to stop moving" is conceptual rather than a choice with on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the ending tells us they "chose, finally, to stay found" but summarizes future behavior ("they still disappeared… but they always returned") without a present-tense decision or visible price paid in the closure beat. Agency is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Theme of reciprocity and mutual aid emerges organically from the flood-survivor's gift and the rumor-chain structure. The "invisible currency" metaphor and "permission" realization avoid overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, where "mutual aid began with aiding each other" and "disaster relief for those who'd forgotten they were disasters too" veer toward thesis statement. The moon rocks as permission rather than magic is a solid conceptual move, but the ending's "We heard a rumor" line and the framing of the station as "infrastructure no relief organization provided" flatten ambiguity into a tidy thematic package. The desperately-jocular-to-genuine laugh progression is told, not shown through image or action that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent register ("rumor made flesh," "polite anarchy," "desperately jocular bark") that tilts literary-archival without breaching plausibility. Dialogue is minimal and functional—Emil's "harder to locate than credible information" and "bloody lonely" feel natural—but the group remains largely silent; we hear no negotiation or friction when they decide to stay. The narration occasionally over-explains ("that desperately jocular bark she'd perfected to deflect genuine emotion") where the gesture alone would suffice. Psychic distance is controlled, and diction is mostly consistent, though "catalyze" and "networkers" lean slightly corporate for the established voice.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. The opening image (ivy through broken windows) and closing frame (ivy-covered station) create purposeful bookends. Minor loops appear: "desperately jocular" recurs three times in similar phrasing, and "disaster relief for those who'd forgotten they were disasters too" is near-paraphrase of "cure for loneliness" and "so bloody lonely." The transition "Over the following days, others arrived" compresses time efficiently, and the "permission" triad is concise. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final summary paragraph ("they still disappeared… built the infrastructure… when asked how…") flattens momentum slightly by telling future behavior rather than landing on a single charged image, but clarity and information density remain solid throughout.</comment>

<comment>The premise (disaster-relief workers receive moon rocks to cure loneliness via reciprocity network) synthesizes familiar tropes—found family, mutual aid, magical realism—into a coherent frame. Mara talking to the moon rock and the "rumor made flesh" arrival are fresh touches. The "permission to stop" insight and the non-magical stones transform the setup from mystical to psychological, but the emotional arc (isolation → collective belonging) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious cost or complication that resists tidy resolution. The ending's "We heard a rumor" callback is clever but surface-level; the story does not explore what staying costs Mara individually or what conflict arises when nomads anchor. Specificity (Jakarta, Naples, Morocco) adds texture, but the leap from seventeen strangers to permanent commune is convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mara is on the page throughout and makes two choices: keeping the moon rock (paragraph two) and understanding "permission to stop" (closure). The first is low-stakes; the second is realization rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. She does not coordinate relief logistics on the page, so the "elusive logistician" trait remains ornamental. The ending shift to "stay found" is collective and summarized, not driven by Mara's individual turn. Setup is early, middle beats involve her listening to Emil, payoff is conceptual; two gates met → eligible for mid-band. Causal pressure is weak (no option narrowed), closure linkage is thematic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Moon rock appears in paragraph two (Mara keeps it on her desk), is invoked when Emil seeks "the moon rock fragment" (beat two), and recurs in the ending ("remained on a shared table"). Three beats; two gates clearly met (setup, closure presence). It does not constrain a middle choice—combining the fragments is passive and "didn't do anything mystical"—so Development gate is absent. The shift from skeptical ornament ("she didn't believe it was actually lunar") to "permission" catalyst charges the object's meaning at closure, but the mechanism is told rather than shown through a handling beat that alters tactics. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (any gift could symbolize reciprocity) −0.5 and ornamental middle use −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Reciprocity is named in paragraph three ("invisible currency"), demonstrated when Mara receives the rock as thanks, and returns as the thematic anchor at closure ("bound by reciprocity"). It shapes the inciting gift and the final network-building choice, meeting Setup and Payoff gates. Middle Development is weak—no on-page trade or tactical constraint where reciprocity narrows Mara's options under pressure. The concept charges the ending's "mutual aid" declaration but functions more as theme than live stake. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but swappability (gratitude or solidarity could substitute) −0.5 and summary-only middle −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Desperately jocular" is attributed to Mara in paragraph two ("that desperately jocular bark she'd perfected") and applied to the whole group ("Each wore the same desperately jocular mask"), then shifts to "genuinely" in the ending. Label-only across all mentions; no on-page gesture, speech, or micro-choice where the jocular deflection constrains an action or incurs cost. Setup gate met (paragraph two), Development and Payoff gates absent (the final "genuinely" is told, not shown through contradictory behavior). Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, but label-only trait −0.8, swappability −0.5, summary-only payoff −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>"Catalyze" appears in Emil's line ("trying to catalyze something") and in the final summary ("catalyzed something immediate"). The action itself—bringing the seventeen together and combining fragments—happens on the page but is passive ("someone suggested") and produces no dramatized shift ("didn't merge or glow"). The resulting "permission" is realization, not a physical act that redefines options. Setup in dialogue (middle third), Payoff thematic; Development gate unclear. Two beats +0.9, but late first appearance −0.3, ornamental middle use −0.7, and swappability (gather, unite, summon could replace) −0.5.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Improbable rumor chains" are described in paragraph four ("I heard from a doctor in Jakarta who heard from a nurse in Naples") and invoked in the closing line ("We heard a rumor"). The method brings Emil and the others to Mara, but we never see a middle beat where a rumor-chain failure or distortion forces a tactical adjustment—arrival is smooth. Setup and Payoff gates met; Development absent. The mechanics (coordinates, not addresses) are explained but not tested under pressure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental middle −0.6, swappability (network, word-of-mouth) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The disused railway station is anchored in the opening sentence and recurs in the final paragraph ("ivy-covered station where trains no longer ran"). It provides atmosphere and a meeting-place but does not constrain a choice—Mara could coordinate from any ruin, and no spatial feature (locked door, crumbling platform, hidden supply) alters middle tactics. Setup and Payoff gates met; Development absent. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (ivy, moss, ticket office) +0.5, but swappability (warehouse, abandoned school) −0.6 and ornamental middle use −0.7.</comment>

<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"When the story changes" is Mara's line at the pivot ("This is when the story changes") but functions as meta-commentary rather than a temporal constraint. No clock tightens decisions; "three weeks ago" and "over the following days" are vague. The timeframe does not force a rushed choice or escalate pressure—arrivals happen "over days" with no urgency. Setup absent (meta-line arrives at closure), Development absent, Payoff weak (the phrase reweights meaning mildly). One beat +0.4, but late first appearance (closure only) −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, swappability (turning point, moment of change) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Mara's loneliness is named in paragraph two ("the only disaster no one sends aid for") and drives the entire arc; Emil echoes it ("so bloody lonely"), and closure answers it ("cured of loneliness"). Setup, Development (Emil's arrival as response), and Payoff gates all met. The motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page beat where loneliness forces Mara to refuse help or make a costly trade. Friction between want (connection) and cost (stopping) is conceptual, not shown through a decision that forecloses the nomadic path with visible sacrifice. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, but summary-only middle −0.6 and told-only cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Polite anarchy" is named in paragraph four ("practiced anarchy") and returns in the final summary ("polite anarchy of people"). The tone—wry, slightly literary, mixing disaster-logistics pragmatism with lyric imagery—is coherent but static; no modulation where pressure shifts diction or rhythm. Emil's "bloody lonely" and Mara's moon-rock monologue carry the affect, but the ending's "desperately, jocularly, and finally, genuinely" is told rather than shown through contradictory speech or gesture. Setup and Payoff met; Development absent (no tonal shift under pressure). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, but static mood −0.5 and label-reliance −0.4.</comment>
