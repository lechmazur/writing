<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is coherent and her micro-choices (selecting what to play, advising Mr. Chen to write about pancakes rather than apology) are purposeful. Mr. Chen's motivation—executing a flawless goodbye—reads authentic and his shift from surgical precision to vulnerability is earned. Rebecca remains largely offstage; her guardedness is told rather than embodied, and the reconciliation happens behind a summary veil ("their tone: tentative, then cracking, then flowing") that prevents us from testing her agency. The final choice lacks visible cost on the page; we're told reconciliation occurred but don't witness a trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through music, memory, and the ticking clock. Orientation is prompt (hospice, Mr. Chen, 48 hours). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (reconciliation with vinyl fragments held together), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page: we don't see what Rebecca or Mr. Chen surrendered to achieve reunion. The transition from letter-writing to Rebecca's arrival compresses thirty hours in a single paragraph, eliding the middle escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs (Maya's counsel shifts Mr. Chen's approach), satisfying the length allowance, but the final image ("two broken pieces learning they could still make music") abstracts rather than anchors the cost in concrete action or dialogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hospice floats "three thousand feet above the valley" with "clouds drifting through open courtyards," establishing a distinct spatial frame. Micro-setting qualifies: the shoebox of memories, the jagged vinyl piece, and the cello case are handled across beats and constrain Mr. Chen's choices (he clutches the fragment, later produces its mate). The "scent…green and beginning" in Room 408 charges the reconciliation moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the recurring motif of floating/radiance ties setting to tone without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mr. Chen's need to reconcile before death, signaled early via the 48-hour prognosis. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maya redirects his apology impulse toward specificity ("Write her…the pancakes"), narrowing his tactical options under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation remains modest—Rebecca's arrival and the reunion happen offstage, summarized rather than dramatized, so the reader cannot witness the trade-offs or resistance that would raise cost. The vinyl fragments function as a charged object but do not constrain a live choice at closure; they're presented as fait accompli rather than a decision point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation through mundane specificity rather than grand gesture—emerges organically from Maya's counsel and Mr. Chen's letter. The "hymning of mundane moments" and the broken vinyl held together offer a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Maya's playing ("the rhythm of pancake batter stirring") and the fragments that "no longer separate" but "not quite fitting." The final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. A minor slip: "The scent of hope…smells like Sunday mornings" edges toward thematic echo, but remains tied to concrete detail (pancakes, spatula conducting) rather than abstract thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maya with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she recognizes "the particular quality of light that preceded death" and filters sensory detail (antiseptic vs. "something green and beginning") through her professional lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("decisively kind," "hymning"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Maya's lines pursue goals (redirect Mr. Chen's approach) and carry subtext. One brief filter-verb cluster ("saw her pause…saw Rebecca take") in the reconciliation paragraph slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the beat. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor loop: "the scent…of something green and beginning, impossible to name but unmistakable. / The scent of hope, she thought, smells like Sunday mornings" restates the same content across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the reconciliation beat: "saw her pause…saw Rebecca take…saw her father produce" (three identical stems) dulls propulsion (−0.4). Figurative language ("light…pulsing with a stillness," "hymning the mundane") is purposeful but occasionally elevated ("cleaved their relationship like an axe through wood") in a way that borders on stock metaphor. Scaffold is minimal; no clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hospice-above-clouds frame and music therapist POV offer specific angles, but the core arc—estranged parent and child reconcile before death—follows a familiar template. Transformation is modest: the vinyl fragment and "hymning the mundane" add texture but do not fully reconfigure the emotional or moral calculus. The proximity to end-of-life reconciliation narratives is close, and while the execution is competent, the story does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. Emotional specificity (pancakes, spatula conducting) elevates the piece above generic abstraction, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya present in setup (opening), middle (counsel to Mr. Chen), and payoff (watches reconciliation, plays at memorial). Her decision to play "the sounds between you" and her advice to "write…the pancakes" alter Mr. Chen's tactics, enabling the reunion. She shapes two beats and contributes to closure. Causal pressure is moderate; her serene demeanor and professional role remain stable rather than tested under personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vinyl fragment present in setup (Mr. Chen holds it), middle (he describes breaking it), and payoff (he and Rebecca hold the two halves together). Handled across three beats with evolving meaning: memory of conflict → vehicle for letter → symbol of reconciliation. The object's broken state mirrors the relationship and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high; no near-synonym fits. Cost connection is implied but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "scent of hope" appears only in the final third, framing the post-reconciliation atmosphere. It does not shape stakes or alter tactics during the central conflict. Usage is thematic rather than causal: it describes the outcome rather than constraining choices. No middle development or early signal. Late arrival and ornamental use cap the score despite the lyric reprise in the closing line.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is labeled once in the opening third ("decisively kind in the way she had perfected") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Maya's advice and musical choices are purposeful but her kindness is not tested against competing impulses or resource limits. The trait is consistent with her behavior but does not enable a tradeoff or foreclosure. Functional but replaceable with "professional warmth" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reunion is the story's hinge: setup (the breach described), middle (Maya and Mr. Chen prepare for it), payoff (Rebecca arrives and reconciliation occurs). The action drives the arc and closure effect depends on it. Causal pressure is moderate: the reunion is enabled by the letter and fragments but happens offstage, summarized rather than dramatized, so the reader cannot witness resistance or trade-offs. Swapping "reunify" for "forgive" or "reconnect" would require only minor edits; specificity is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled in setup (Maya's role, the pancake-spatula memory), enacted in the middle beat (she plays "the rhythm of pancake batter stirring"), and echoed at closure ("hymning the mundane miracle"). The method shapes Mr. Chen's letter-writing tactic and charges the memorial service. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage. Mechanics are purposeful but the term "hymning" edges toward ornamental diction; its specificity matters less than the general principle (focus on small particulars).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hospice is described vividly in the opening and closing frame ("floated three thousand feet above the valley," "radiant," "clouds drifted through open courtyards"), and "Room 408" anchors the central action. Setting pressure is mild: the altitude and radiance establish tone but do not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The room's atmosphere shifts (antiseptic → "green and beginning") but this is descriptive rather than tactical. Postcard vividness without micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The 48-hour prognosis appears in setup, creates urgency in the middle (Rebecca is "somewhere over the Pacific, racing against time zones"), and the 30-hour arrival window tightens suspense. The clock is present across beats but not tracked granularly; we do not see moments where time runs out or forces a trade-off. Rebecca arrives "thirty hours later" (within the window) so the deadline is met without dramatized cost. The three-day denouement after reunion relaxes temporal pressure rather than sustaining it to the end.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mr. Chen's desire to "execute a flawless goodbye" is stated explicitly in the middle beat and drives his initial impulse toward apology. Maya's redirection ("perfection wasn't what would reunify them. Authenticity was.") creates friction between his want (surgical precision) and the cost (vulnerability). The motivation shapes his letter-writing choice and is dramatized in his weeping and search for words. Closure effect (holding the fragments together) reflects the shift from flawless to authentic. One beat of live friction; higher scores would require the conflict to operate across multiple attempts with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" appears in the opening ("light…pulsing with a stillness") and closing frame ("pulsing with its particular stillness"), establishing a coherent tonal bracket. The tone modulates with pressure: quiet opening, emotional middle (Mr. Chen weeping), restrained reconciliation, and return to stillness at memorial. The phrase charges the final image by recalling the opening's "light that preceded death" and reweighting it as ongoing rather than terminal. Tone is stable and purposeful but does not intensify under peak pressure; it remains ambient rather than actively shaping choices.</comment>
