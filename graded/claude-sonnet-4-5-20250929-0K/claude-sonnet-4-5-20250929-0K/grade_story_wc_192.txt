<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is clear—her deliberate burning of bridges and role as shadow keeper—but her present-scene choices lack moment-to-moment contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The girl's scar-lattice backstory is vivid yet her interiority remains thin; we see her need but not the warring forces within her during the encounter. The therapy-speak phrases ("self-erasure," "emotional flatlining") label rather than embody emotion at key beats. The final handclasp and teaching offer feel declarative rather than earned through on-page friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when promptly (Mara at the sanctuary, tonight, after cutting contact three months ago). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the girl's arrival and Mara's teaching accumulate pressure through image and charged callback (threshold, scars, ash) rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the girl crosses over, takes Mara's hand, and the threshold seals—but the cost remains implied rather than legible in a single on-page sentence or image, weakening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary's charcoal pillars, ash underfoot, and silent doorknocker create vivid texture and anchor the tone. Spatial choreography is coherent: Mara seated among pews, the girl at the entrance, then inside without stepping forward. The setting charges the final image (stars watching, pillars as witness) but does not materially constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to reclaim breath and set boundaries—is signaled early and coherent. The girl's arrival and Mara's teaching offer one meaningful deepening (from declaration to the handclasp and sealing threshold), but escalation is gentle: no reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off on the page. The girl's acceptance is smooth rather than contested; Mara's role as guide encounters no resistance. Cost is asserted ("bridges burned," "suffocating became breathing") but not dramatized as a forfeiture or tactical shift within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries, self-preservation, reclaiming agency—emerges through concrete images (burned bridges, linking scars, breath metaphor) rather than direct statement. The silent doorknocker and fading threshold function as charged motifs that reweight meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("where the suffocating became the breathing, where bridges burned like offerings") rather than letting the handclasp image carry full weight. Subtext operates well in gesture (scars meeting, the girl's hand dropping), and the piece resists moralizing until the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during interior reflection, wider during the girl's approach). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("You already have" reframes entry as internal shift). Mara's perceptual signature—tender, deliberate, image-oriented—remains distinct. Minor register drift: "method of linking through scars" and "loaded emptiness" read slightly elevated for the established voice, and the final paragraph's declarative cadence ("This is space. This is the oxygen...") flattens rhythmic variance under the story's peak emotional moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with strong images (doorknocker from melted wedding bands, scars like embroidery, footprints in ash). Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the contemplative tone. However, multiple filter-verb stacks appear in high-pressure beats ("watched it," "recognized the pattern," "understood"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "suffocating became the breathing" restates "how to make suffocating breathe" without added pressure. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent; "loaded emptiness" and "beautiful devastation" edge toward oxymoron without clear grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary-as-healing-space premise and bridge-burning metaphor are familiar but given specific texture through the silent doorknocker, scar-linking, and ash setting. The fading threshold that dissolves upon readiness offers a fresh inflection on crossing-over narratives. Yet the mentor-teaches-novice frame and the one-session transformation follow well-worn therapeutic-journey templates without subversion or complication. The girl's immediate acceptance and the frictionless handclasp feel median-safe rather than bold; no risk-taking heightens stakes or meaning.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (tender shadow keeper) appears throughout and her past choices (burning bridges, building the sanctuary) frame the story. On the page she watches, speaks, rises, walks, extends her hand—but these are facilitative rather than pressure-generating decisions. She does not face a competing want or make a choice that narrows her own options; the girl's arrival confirms rather than tests Mara's role. Setup present, middle facilitation weak, closure participation as guide—two gates with low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears twice: description in paragraph two (forged from wedding bands and chains, intentionally silent) and the girl's touch in paragraph four ("touched the ring"). Its silence and composition carry thematic charge but it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it vanishes after the girl enters. Setup strong, middle touch functional, no closure reprise—two gates but swappable with any threshold marker.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fading threshold is introduced early (paragraph three: "boundary... wavered like heat shimmer"), governs the girl's crossing (paragraph five: "threshold had dissolved... only exists for those still holding on"), and reappears at closure (final paragraph: "fading threshold sealed behind them"). It shapes the story's central stakes (readiness to let go) and alters the girl's state on the page. All three gates present with causal and closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability (could be replaced by another metaphor-barrier with edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is established in paragraph one (Mara "burned every bridge... carefully, methodically") and dramatized in paragraph seven where Mara explains the method: "I studied each connection... lit matches... The ones worth keeping survived." This attribute constrains her past tactics and enables her present teaching role with visible cost (isolation, three months of no contact). Setup, middle explanation with cost, closure echo ("bridges burned like offerings")—all three gates with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears once as Mara's diagnosis (paragraph six: "They encroach... push past boundaries... make camp in your chest cavity") to name the girl's problem. It frames the central conflict but does not trigger a turn or redefine options on the page—Mara completes the girl's sentence rather than the girl discovering it through action. One thematic beat, no tactical consequence, no closure participation—setup weak, middle label-only, no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is described in paragraph four ("method of linking... each mark a connection to someone who had taken too much") and returns at closure ("their scars meeting like a new kind of language"). It signals the girl's past entanglements and charges the final handclasp, but the mechanics never shape an on-page attempt or constrain a middle choice—it remains metaphor. Setup, no middle development, closure cameo—two gates with low causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight anchors every beat: blackened pillars, charcoal pews, ash underfoot, stars without warmth. It provides texture and tone throughout and charges the final witness image ("stars watched... pillars stood witness"). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or supply a tactical resource—it remains atmospheric. Setup strong, middle presence consistent, closure participation as witness frame—high descriptive integration but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after cutting off all contact three months ago" is mentioned in paragraph one to establish Mara's backstory but never tightens a decision or creates urgency within the present scene. The night unfolds at contemplative pace with no clock pressure; the girl's arrival is awaited rather than time-constrained. Setup label-only, no middle or closure tactical use—one weak gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" is named in paragraph one ("waiting for those who needed to learn what she had learned") and dramatized through her dialogue and final teaching offer. It drives her facilitative role but encounters no friction—no competing desire, no cost to this specific teaching moment. The girl's acceptance is frictionless. Setup, middle enactment, closure fulfillment—all three gates present but desire is uncontested, lowering the felt pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" (final paragraph: "the loaded silence") and "loaded emptiness" pervade the tone: the sanctuary's beautiful devastation, the silent doorknocker, the vast emptiness that feels full, stars offering no warmth. The tone modulates subtly (from Mara's vigil to the girl's arrival to the tender teaching) and charges the final image ("loaded silence... was enough"). Coherent throughout with purposeful restraint and a cadence shift at closure that reweights the stake—strong tonal control under accumulative pressure.</comment>
