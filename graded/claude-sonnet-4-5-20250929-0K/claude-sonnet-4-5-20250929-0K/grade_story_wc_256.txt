<comment>Maren's interior life shows embodied texture—the crystalline chimes and her evolving relationship to them anchor her transformation. The volunteer's arrival and his visible shift (shoulders drop, face softens) provide a modest secondary pressure point, though his interiority remains thin. The final realization ("she'd been seeking connection's texture not to study it, but to share it") feels slightly over-articulated and diagnosed rather than discovered through concrete micro-choices. Maren's motivations cohere and the ending choice (sharing versus studying) is earned, but the epiphany statement edges toward label-speak at a pivotal moment.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when) within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through layered backstory (surgery, two years of fragment collection, tonight's ambitious iteration) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maren's realization reweights her entire project from study to sharing, with the volunteer's visible response charging the final image. Cost is legible—two years of isolation and the renunciation of pure research—but the cost statement is slightly told rather than dramatized in the closing beat. The lens holds without contradiction, and the single meaningful deepening (realization → sharing) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The carbide lamp lens, crystalline vertebrae, and acoustic archaeologist setting provide vivid, purpose-driven detail. The lamp's dual function (illumination and emotional safety via golden glow) constrains Maren's choice to use it tonight, and the laboratory's sonic environment charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (workstation, wall of recordings, laboratory door, standing together). Minor penalty: the mining museum salvage and the "vast warehouse" scale are sketched but not leveraged in later action; the volunteer's movement from door to standing-position lacks micro-geography.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled early: isolating and replicating the sonic fingerprint of intimacy. The piece accumulates pressure through Maren's two-year project and tonight's "most ambitious iteration," then tightens when the volunteer arrives—his hunger for community forces Maren's realization that sharing is the goal, not study. This single meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient. Cost is visible (renunciation of pure research, two years of solitary work reweighted), though the final paragraph tells more than it shows. No antagonist required; coincidence (volunteer's arrival) complicates but does not resolve—Maren's stance shift does.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—connection as acoustic space, pilgrimage as internal rather than geographic—emerges from Maren's project and the crystalline spine metaphor. The closing image (two strangers on an artificial pilgrimage toward something achingly real) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph over-explains the thematic stakes ("she'd been seeking connection's texture not to study it, but to share it") and the last sentence's summary ("The laboratory of lost sounds had found something precious after all") tips toward thematic echo. The dual meanings of "lost sounds" (civilization's and Maren's isolation) provide modest depth, but the conceptual payoff is somewhat told.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices sonic texture, frequencies, and the "catches in breath before confession." Voice is controlled and purposeful, modulating from reflective backstory to present action without head-hopping. The volunteer remains exterior—his fear and softening are visible but not narrated from within, maintaining focalization. Minor slips: "powerfully gentle in her conviction" feels slightly authorial rather than filtered through Maren's self-perception, and the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("she finally understood") leans expository. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven ("Just stand here with me").</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with vivid concrete detail (prism-song bell ringer, carbide lamp lens, crystalline bone replacements). Information density is high in the opening and middle sections. However, the piece shows moderate overwriting and scaffold: "powerfully gentle" appears twice in near-identical phrasing; "the texture of connection" and "sonic fingerprint of intimacy" are paraphrased across adjacent lines; the final paragraph stacks explanatory clauses ("she'd been seeking… not to study it, but to share it, to propel others toward…") that loop the thematic point. Template cadence in the closure beat ("two strangers on an artificial pilgrimage toward something achingly real. The miner's lamp glowed… and Maren finally understood…") slightly dulls propulsion. No severe artifacts, but accumulation in the final third lowers the band.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—acoustic archaeology + surgical modification as living instrument + artificial pilgrimage as frequency rather than geography—feels specific and non-obvious. The crystalline vertebrae and their dual burden/gift provide fresh physical grounding for the theme of connection through sound. The piece avoids template plotting and commits fully to its premise. Minor derivative notes: the post-collapse recovery setting and the "lost sounds" laboratory evoke familiar dystopian tropes without deep transformation, and the final realization (study → sharing) is a well-worn arc. The carbide lamp and prism-song details elevate freshness, and the concept of "acoustic space" as sacred place offers a non-obvious angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren drives every key beat: she adjusts the lamp, positions recordings, presses play, and invites the volunteer to stand with her. Her realization ("she'd been seeking connection's texture not to study it, but to share it") reweights her entire project and shapes the closure. The volunteer's visible transformation (shoulders drop, face softens) is a direct result of her choices. Present throughout; early signal strong; causal pressure and closure linkage both evident. The character's agency is central and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The carbide lamp lens appears in three beats: adjusting it at the workstation (opening), its dual-purpose function (filtering harsh LED into golden glow), and glowing "like a small sun" in the final image. The dual-purpose explanation (safety via warm glow) constrains Maren's choice to use it tonight and charges the closure tone. However, the lens itself is not handled or manipulated in the middle or ending beats—it remains static after the opening adjustment. The golden glow recurs with reweighted meaning (companionship to revelation), but the object's causal role is modest. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band; lacks the tactile involvement or evolving use for higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named and explained midway, frames Maren's entire two-year project, and shapes the ending image directly ("two strangers on an artificial pilgrimage toward something achingly real"). The concept alters tactics: Maren creates sound environments rather than traditional travel-based pilgrimages, and the volunteer's participation validates the method. Early signal (implicit in opening, explicit by mid-story), beat involvement (sound environment creation, volunteer arrival, shared standing), and closure linkage are all strong. The concept is indispensable to the story's stakes and final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears twice: as label ("she was powerfully gentle in her conviction, never arguing") and enacted in dialogue/action ("Just stand here with me," her voice powerfully gentle, the bells chiming welcome). The trait constrains one on-page action—her non-confrontational persistence and invitational approach enable the volunteer's participation. However, the cost is unclear; the trait functions more as tonal marker than structural pressure. Mid-band for presence and modest enactment, but lacks the visible tradeoff or friction that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"Propel" appears in two key beats: Maren's realization that hardware "propelled her current project" (the artificial pilgrimage), and the final understanding that she sought connection's texture "to propel others toward the rediscovery." The action is both motivation and method—it drives her two-year project and reweights the closure. Early signal (paragraph five), beat involvement (project genesis, final realization), and closure linkage are strong. The word's dual meanings (drive forward + share/launch others) are specific to this story's logic. Minor swappability concern: "drive" or "push" could substitute with modest edits, preventing top-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>"Questioning assumptions" is explicitly named ("She had begun by questioning assumptions about what pilgrimage meant") and demonstrated: Maren redefines pilgrimage from geography to frequency, and her volunteers' responses validate the method. The method shapes her two-year research approach and the tonight's experiment. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in action—we see the result (sound environments) but not the questioning process itself. Present by mid-story, shapes one major beat (artificial pilgrimage concept), and appears in thematic resolution, but lacks the on-page iterative work that would demonstrate the method under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" anchors the story from the title and first line, provides the wall of analog recordings Maren uses, and supplies the harsh LED lighting the carbide lamp filters. The setting's dual purpose (government acoustic archaeology + Maren's private connection research) creates the conditions for her work and the volunteer's arrival. The final image ("The laboratory of lost sounds had found something precious after all") charges the closure with thematic resonance. Early signal, beat involvement (workstation, recordings, sound playback, volunteer entry), causal pressure (enables the experiment), and closure linkage are all strong. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"After the power grid stabilized three months ago" provides backstory context but does not constrain on-page choices or create urgency. The timeframe is mentioned once and never revisited; Maren's two-year project predates or overlaps this window, and tonight's experiment proceeds without reference to grid stability. The element is present and logically consistent but functionally ornamental—removing it would not alter tactics, stakes, or closure. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is Maren's stated pursuit (paragraph two), dramatized through two years of fragment collection and sound-environment creation, and tested when the volunteer arrives. The motivation is conflicted—Maren initially seeks to isolate and study the texture, then realizes she must share it. This friction drives the closure realization and reweights her entire project. Early signal, beat involvement (collection, layering, volunteer experiment, final insight), causal pressure (the desire shapes every action), and closure linkage (the realization that sharing is the goal) are all strong. Visible cost: renunciation of pure research in favor of connection itself. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>"Golden shadows" appears three times: the lamp's "golden shadows" early (making volunteers feel safer), the volunteer's face softening "in the golden shadows" at closure, and the implicit warm glow throughout. Tone is coherent, modulates from reflective backstory to present action, and charges the final image by linking safety, revelation, and the ancient companion of candlelight. The tone constrains Maren's choice to use the carbide lamp and shapes the volunteer's receptiveness. Strong closure participation and thematic resonance. Minor swappability: "warm light" could substitute with modest effect, preventing top-band.</comment>
