<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's professional identity as a "logical page indexer" is established early and her meticulous approach drives her investigation, but her interior life remains somewhat generic—"pulse quickened with dappled resolve" uses stock phrasing rather than character-particular embodiment. The decision to catalog the underground press is earned by prior setup (two years tracing origins, the manifesto discovery), though the final commitment feels more declarative than conflicted. Micro-choices (pressing the stamp, navigating to Section K, cross-referencing volumes) advance the investigation, but no genuine internal contradiction or mistake complicates her path; she moves efficiently from clue to conclusion without blind spots or cost-bearing friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (indexer, forgotten library, blackout three hours ago). The piece follows a causal lens: discovery of stamp → impression reveals phrase → journal retrieval → cross-reference → pattern recognition → renewed purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when the four anomalous volumes converge into evidence of a suppressed underground press, narrowing Mira's understanding and reweighting her cataloging mission. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose via conceptual repricing of the library's contents), with felt cost implicit in the commitment to "tracing honest origins of suppressed truths"—though the cost remains more thematic assertion than on-page forfeiture of a specific option or resource.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly realized: "five stories of learning now compressed by ocean weight into three floors," marble table listing from tidal pressure, mineral deposits on floors, water dripping as metronome. Spatial choreography is clear (catalog drawer → marble table → Section K → back to table) and the blackout constraint forces analog methodology, shaping Mira's investigative approach. The antique stamp functions as micro-setting object, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Environment detail (waterlogged spines, brass stamp, wax-preserved ink pad) reflects professional priorities and subtly mirrors the theme of preservation versus erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring proper attribution and discovering suppressed truths—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: the stamp's phrase matches the journal, which leads to cross-referencing four volumes, converging into evidence of an underground press. Agency is present in Mira's methodical choices (pressing stamp, retrieving journal, cross-referencing), though coincidence aids discovery (finding the stamp in a drawer during the blackout). The blackout eliminates digital tools, forcing analog methods that "sharpened her thinking"—a constraint that enables rather than complicates, reducing friction. No visible loss or trade-off (time, stamina, social cost) alters her tactics; the investigation proceeds smoothly without setbacks or competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus suppression emerges organically from the underground press discovery and Catherine Moreau's "drowned rebellion." The blackout/stillness motif recurs purposefully: "reclaimed stillness—this return to pre-electric methodology—sharpened her thinking" and "stillness enough to notice, darkness enough to see." However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement: "proof that some had fought to preserve truth before the waves erased everything" and "she had found her purpose renewed" feel more asserted than embodied. The stamp as key and Mira's own stamp-pressing at the end offer a resonant, non-literal closure, though the "marking her own beginning" line tilts toward explicating rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and character-appropriate for an indexer: "meticulous system," "pre-electric methodology," "archaeology of meaning." Perceptual signature shows professional filter (noticing publisher insignias, paper stock, authentication sheets). However, certain phrases feel authorial rather than Mira-specific: "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "swimming shadows." The phrase "electricity of a different sort" in a key moment reads as writerly metaphor rather than the character's natural idiom. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though several lines edge toward overwriting: "archaeology of meaning," "swimming shadows across spines bloated with absorbed seawater," "electricity of a different sort." The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as a set descriptor rather than embodied perception. Minor scaffold: "She'd seen this phrase before, months ago" followed immediately by navigation to retrieve it—efficient but slightly mechanical sequencing. "Thunder rolled through water and stone above—the storm that had knocked out power still raging" restates information already established. Figurative density in descriptive passages ("pulse quickened with dappled resolve," "lamplight bubble") accumulates without always advancing pressure, applying −0.4 for moderate density without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken-library setting offers atmospheric specificity, and the blackout-as-enabler twist (analog methods sharpen perception) provides a fresh angle. However, the core arc—archivist discovers hidden meaning in overlooked artifact—follows a familiar template. Catherine Moreau's underground press and suppressed histories remain abstract; no concrete detail of what truths were suppressed or why they mattered beyond generic "alternative hypothesis to mainstream historical narratives." The stamp-as-key and pressing-her-own-stamp closure are apt but predictable. Emotional specificity is moderate; Mira's professional satisfaction reads more as type than individual. The piece executes competently within its premise but does not transform the detective-scholar archetype through unexpected moral calculus or lived-in particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her professional skills (methodical cataloging, cross-referencing, attention to publisher marks) drive the investigation. Setup: established as indexer in opening. Development: her choice to press the stamp, navigate to Section K, and cross-reference anomalous volumes creates the pattern revelation. Payoff: she commits to "tracing honest origins" and stamps her own beginning. However, her decisions are efficient and unopposed; no wrong turn or mistake complicates the path. Observation dominates over fraught choice—she assembles evidence smoothly without a moment where competing options force a visible trade-off. Subtract for smooth execution without cost-bearing friction (−0.6), and minor swappability (another detail-oriented profession could serve similarly with modest edits, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stamp appears in three distinct beats: discovery in catalog drawer, pressing to reveal hidden lettering ("Verum Ante Omnia"), and final reprise when Mira presses it to mark her own beginning. Setup: paragraph two. Development: the impression reveals the phrase, enabling journal match and cross-reference. Payoff: the stamp becomes symbolic key and Mira uses it to mark her commitment. Causal pressure: the stamp's unique insignia is the engine of the plot turn, enabling the underground-press discovery. Specificity: its serpent-coiled-anchor design and hidden micro-lettering are irreplaceable details. Closure linkage: the final stamp-press charges the ending image. Minor friction: the stamp's mechanics (wax-preserved ink pad, brass construction) are plausible but feel slightly convenient as the lone surviving artifact. Strong integration overall: +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.4 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity; −0.3 minor convenience.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The phrase "reclaimed stillness" appears explicitly twice and implicitly threads the blackout frame: without digital systems, Mira works in candlelit quiet that "sharpened her thinking." Setup: second paragraph establishes the paradox. Development: the stillness enables noticing details missed in two years of systematic work. Payoff: "stillness enough to notice, darkness enough to see" and the final paragraph's "reclaimed stillness" bookend the concept. However, the concept functions more as thematic overlay than tactical constraint—Mira's choices (stamp, retrieve, cross-reference) would proceed similarly in electric light; the stillness enhances perception atmospherically but does not force a trade-off or narrow options. It reweights meaning (the blackout as gift rather than obstacle) but does not alter tactics with visible cost. Score in lyric-resonance range: +0.5 early seed, +0.4 one thematic beat, +1.0 closure echo that reweights; −0.5 ornamental rather than causal, −0.4 swappable (another constraint could serve).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as label twice (opening and midpoint) but is not dramatized as a trait with cost. The text shows Mira working calmly and noticing micro-details (tiny lettering, paper stock, pattern across volumes), which aligns with the label. However, no on-page moment demonstrates tranquility as a constraint or enabler under pressure—no choice where staying calm costs her speed, or where perceptiveness causes her to miss a larger pattern, or where another character challenges her measured approach. The attribute describes her style but does not force a visible trade-off. Setup: present by paragraph two. Development: her detailed examination fits the trait. Payoff: not directly invoked at closure. Score as functional description without causal teeth: +0.3 early signal, +0.4 fits one beat's tone; −0.6 label-only without cost, −0.5 swappable (other temperament descriptors would serve), −0.3 summary rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears once: "She readjusted her position at the marble table, now listing slightly after fifty years of tidal pressure." This micro-movement establishes setting detail (unstable table, tidal damage) but does not create a plot turn or choice-point. The action is replaceable—removing it would not alter causality, stakes, or closure. It functions as atmospheric business rather than a pressure point. Setup: present in paragraph three. Development: no causal role in middle beats; the cataloging work proceeds on the table but the readjustment itself is inert. Payoff: not echoed or reweighted at closure. Score as ornamental: +0.0 (not setup for a stake), +0.0 (no beat involvement), −0.7 (ornamental), −0.8 (highly swappable).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" appears in the journal's manifesto: Catherine Moreau "argued that Portsmouth's official records deliberately obscured certain truths" and sought to establish alternative narratives. Setup: discovered at midpoint when Mira retrieves the journal. Development: the method (underground press operating covertly, stamping books with hidden insignia) shapes the middle investigation—Mira cross-references anomalous volumes lacking official marks. Payoff: the ending commits Mira to continue "tracing honest origins of suppressed truths," extending Moreau's method. The method is signaled and its mechanics (separate stamps, unmarked paper stock) matter to the plot. However, it arrives at the midpoint rather than early, and Mira discovers rather than enacts it; the protagonist is receiver, not practitioner, of the method during the story window. Score for mid-entry with solid development: +0.0 (late setup), +0.9 (two beats: journal + cross-reference), +0.8 (causal pressure), +0.9 (closure linkage via commitment); −0.4 (late first appearance), −0.5 (Mira observes rather than wields the method herself).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city is irreplaceable. Setup: paragraph one. Development: the library's physical constraints shape every beat—waterlogged volumes, mineral-deposit floors, compressed stories, section organization (Section K for personal papers), and the blackout that disables digital systems and forces analog work. The setting supplies the core mystery (drowned books stripped of context) and the resources (surviving stamp, wax-preserved ink, intact journal). Payoff: the final image of Mira surrounded by "water-pressed wisdom" and committing to catalog the drowned archive charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment's history (fifty years underwater, tidal pressure, pre-flooding 1970s press) is causally woven. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage: +0.7 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.4 causal pressure, +1.5 closure linkage, +0.7 irreplaceability. No meaningful frictions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blackout frames the entire story: "three hours ago" in the opening, "knocked out power" referenced at midpoint, storm "still raging" near the end. Setup: paragraph one. Development: the blackout disables Mira's digital catalog, forcing handwritten notes and candlelit examination, which "sharpened her thinking" and enabled the discovery. Payoff: the ending reflects on the blackout as gift ("darkness enough to see") and anticipates power's return ("Tomorrow, when power returned"). The timeframe tightens method (analog versus digital) and atmosphere, though it does not impose a literal deadline or escalating urgency—Mira works methodically without racing the clock. The blackout alters tactics with conceptual cost (loss of digital access) but the cost feels enabling rather than limiting. Score for solid setup-to-payoff with moderate pressure: +0.7 early signal, +0.9 two beats (forces analog work, thematic reflection), +0.8 causal pressure (changes method), +1.0 closure linkage; −0.4 (no escalating urgency or literal countdown), −0.3 (cost is enabling rather than friction-bearing).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "trace honest origins" is her professional mission, established early: "dedicated two years to tracing honest origins of the collection, determined to restore proper attribution." Setup: paragraph two. Development: the stamp discovery and journal match intensify this goal—she finds evidence of deliberate suppression, raising the stakes from attribution to uncovering hidden truths. Payoff: the ending commits her to "tracing honest origins of suppressed truths, giving voice to Catherine Moreau's drowned rebellion." The motivation drives all on-page choices (pressing stamp, retrieving journal, cross-referencing, planning future work). However, the desire is not conflicted—no competing want (rest, safety, career risk) pulls against it; Mira pursues the mystery smoothly without friction between professional duty and personal cost. Score for clear dramatization without friction: +0.7 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.4 closure linkage; −0.6 (no visible friction or trade-off between wants and costs), −0.5 (motivation is stable rather than tested under competing pressures).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once as a phrase ("pulse quickened with dappled resolve, hope and uncertainty mingling") and the tone of measured determination amid uncertainty threads the piece. Setup: paragraph two. Development: Mira works methodically despite excitement, the narrative balancing discovery with calm professionalism. Payoff: "Mira smiled, tranquilly perceptive enough to recognize irony" and the final commitment carry forward the mix of certainty and openness. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (excitement at discovery, satisfaction at pattern recognition, quiet resolve at closure). However, "dappled" as descriptor feels more authorial than arising from scene pressure, and the tone does not shift decisively under stress—Mira remains steady throughout without a moment where resolve fractures or uncertainty dominates tactically. Score for coherent but static tone: +0.5 early signal, +0.4 one thematic beat, +0.8 closure presence; −0.4 (single static mood without modulation under peak pressure), −0.3 (label-like phrasing rather than embodied tonal shift).</comment>
