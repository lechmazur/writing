<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magnus's interiority is filtered through his profession ("observed the world by noting what wasn't there") and embodied choices like pinning the Edelweiss to his coat. However, his contradiction—a man who tends light but investigates darkness—never creates genuine friction or error; he moves through the mystery with unearned certainty. The reflective mode dominates (past about the old woman, backstory of the stranger) and although anchored to present stimuli, it flattens present-moment pressure. The final gesture (pinning the flower, promising to investigate coordinates) feels more thematic statement than choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: clues, gaps, and the borrowed-memories motif layer toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is prompt (keeper, dock, three days post-death) and the closure image—pinning the Edelweiss, accepting the coordinates—reconfigures Magnus from observer to carrier with felt cost (he inherits a stranger's burden). The cost is slightly oblique: the final paragraph asserts continuation rather than showing a tactical fork or sacrifice. One causal soft spot: how Magnus knows the key shaft is hollow and contains coordinates isn't dramatized, weakening the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist supply vivid, purposeful texture ("mist pressed against him with softly persistent damp fingers") and the nautical-twilight frame constrains Magnus's investigation window. The Edelweiss and the key function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (dock, bollards, planks). Minor: the Alpine bloom surviving in salt air is noted but never exploited as a constraint or clue beyond symbol, and the lighthouse beam—central to the dead man's reach—remains metaphor rather than functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the stranger's final gesture and honor the old woman's unfinished story. The key discovery and coordinates provide one meaningful tightening, narrowing Magnus's next move. However, Magnus faces no opposition or competing pressure; the police dismiss it, and he encounters no cost in pursuing the investigation. The closure choice—to continue the search tomorrow—defers consequence rather than landing it on the page. The story accumulates clues without a turn that forces Magnus to trade or forfeit something live.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The borrowed-memories concept emerges cleanly from particulars (the old woman's story, the Edelweiss, the stranger's reach toward light) without thesis statement. The final image—Magnus pinning the flower and carrying forward another's task—offers a resonant answer to inheritance and witnessing without moralizing. The nautical-twilight metaphor (liminal truth) is repeated but earns its charge at closure. Minor slip: "that's what keepers do—they tend the light, they mark the gaps, they remember what others have forgotten" edges toward direct thematic articulation in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("observed the world by noting what wasn't there"). Diction matches Magnus's profession and temperament. However, several constructions drift into elevated literary register that sits above a working keeper's lexicon: "witnessed isolation," "opal dock," "borrowed memories" as abstract frame. The phrase "nautical twilight when the sun drowned beneath the horizon but still cast its ghostly glow upward" reads more like authorial mood-setting than Magnus's thought under pressure. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly controlled ("question mark," "mist pressed…with damp fingers"). However, several artifacts cluster: "the police had overlooked" / "he'd found" / "the woman had rented" stack filter verbs; "that's what keepers do" is a stock closer; "borrowed memories" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment in peak beats. The phrase "witnessed isolation" in the final third reads generic rather than specific. One paraphrase loop: "the man hadn't come here to die. He'd come to deliver something" restates in adjacent sentences. Information density is high elsewhere, but these patterns prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper decoding a stranger's death through borrowed memories and a WWII resistance cipher—synthesizes genre elements (mystery, historical echo, liminal setting) with specificity. The Edelweiss as message-carrier and the hollow key are fresh touches. However, the frame leans on familiar lighthouse-keeper-as-witness and the old-woman-with-wartime-secret template without transforming them through surprising choice or moral calculus; Magnus's arc is predictable from setup. The closure—he will investigate tomorrow—defers risk rather than landing it, reducing bold stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Magnus (eccentric keeper) appears throughout and his observation method ("noting what wasn't there") drives the investigation. He makes one key choice—pinning the Edelweiss and committing to the underwater search—that alters his stance from observer to participant. His eccentricity (thirty-seven years isolated, remembering the old woman's story) is integral but the final choice is more continuation than turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Edelweiss boutonnière is present in three beats: on the stranger's lapel, recalled via the old woman's story (WWII resistance cipher), and pinned to Magnus's coat at closure. Its meaning reweights from clue to inheritance with visible cost (Magnus assumes the burden). Removing it would collapse the WWII link and the final image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" is named mid-story and frames Magnus's relationship to the old woman's tale and the stranger's gesture. It shapes the thematic premise and charges the ending when Magnus accepts the role of carrier. However, it remains more metaphor than mechanic; it doesn't constrain a tactical choice or impose a price on the page beyond conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the mist's sensory texture ("mist pressed against him with softly persistent damp fingers") and arguably Magnus's investigative temperament, but it never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The attribute colors tone without altering outcome; easily replaceable with synonyms like "patient" or "steady."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Investigate" is the dominant action: Magnus searches the dock, finds the key, reconstructs the scene, and commits to tomorrow's dive. Multiple beats trace to this verb. Removing it would gut the narrative engine. However, the investigation itself is more accumulation than turning-point struggle; Magnus encounters no resistance or cost in the act of investigating on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("observed the world by noting what wasn't there"), demonstrated through no footprints, no boat, no wallet, and used to find the key wedged in planks. The method matters and is specific to Magnus. It appears in at least two beats (initial scene reconstruction, key discovery) and is named at closure ("mark the gaps"). Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The opal dock is the sole location, anchors spatial choreography (bollards, planks, distance to water), and supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, slick surface). The stranger's body position and the key lodged in the planks are dock-specific details. The dock will matter tomorrow (coordinates "seventeen meters off the dock"). It pressures choices via proximity and weather but doesn't alter tactics on the page in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named, defined ("sun drowned beneath the horizon but still cast its ghostly glow upward"), and used metaphorically for in-between truths. It constrains Magnus's investigation window (darkness approaching) and charges the liminal mood at closure. However, the clock itself doesn't tighten decisions; Magnus has the night and tomorrow. The timeframe enriches atmosphere more than it narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Magnus's drive—to decode the stranger's final gesture and complete the old woman's unfinished story—is clear, consistent, and shapes all his on-page actions (kneeling where the man fell, opening the key, planning the dive). The motivation is inherited rather than personal-stakes, which reduces friction; Magnus faces no competing want or fear. Cost is felt conceptually (he accepts a burden) but not dramatized as sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout: Magnus alone on the dock, keeper for thirty-seven years, "the only soul to understand." Diction and pacing support the tone (measured, reflective, elegiac). The tone modulates slightly with the epiphany ("understood suddenly with the clarity") and charges the final image (standing alone, carrying memories forward). The tone is integral to the closure effect and irreplaceable.</comment>
