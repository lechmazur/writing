<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her perceptive trait is established through concrete action (feeling vibrations, hearing acoustic signatures). Internal conflict is present but largely told rather than dramatized—the burden of legacy is asserted repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift feels more like acceptance of a predetermined path than a choice with visible cost; she doesn't forfeit anything concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when within opening lines). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers evidence through discovery beats (ivy, diaries, film negative) toward a thematic reconfiguration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Maya reframes her work from proving walls dream to dreaming with them—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized; no tactical option is foreclosed on the page, only an internal stance shifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: ivy with "roots that cracked stone like paper," "half-burned diaries," marble fireplace. The ivy-veiled passage returns at the end with reweighted meaning ("already dreaming of her return"), charging the final image. However, the environment doesn't constrain a choice during the story; it functions primarily as atmosphere and symbol rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understanding what walls dream about. The film negative discovery is a meaningful turn that deepens her knowledge, but no option is narrowed—Maya simply gains confirmation and continues the work. No visible cost: she doesn't sacrifice safety, resources, or a competing path. The accumulative lens tolerates this, but escalation reads as information gain without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the walls-as-memory premise and the legacy motif. The final image offers a resonant answer—she becomes part of the conversation rather than an observer—without stating a moral. "She wasn't trying to prove walls could dream. She was learning to dream with them" risks explicit statement but is grounded in the prior discovery beats and reweights her obsession with felt purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "conversations in the way sound bent around corners, read emotions in acoustic reflections." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spatial memory," "ghost-pressure") that feels more authorial than character-grounded, especially under emotional pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong images ("thick as leather," "sodden ash"). Minor scaffold appears: "The legacy's burden pressed harder now" repeats the burden motif without advancing it, and "sensitively perceptive" is used twice as a descriptor rather than shown through fresh detail. One paraphrase loop in the grandfather's legacy introduction (satchel mentioned, then immediately re-described). No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—walls dreaming and anticipating future events—is fresh and the corridor echo cartographer adds specificity. The film negative showing Maya in the future is a well-executed turn. However, the resolution trends familiar: a lone specialist continues an ancestor's obsessive work after finding validating evidence. Emotional arc follows a predictable template (burden → doubt → confirmation → acceptance) without a non-obvious inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya as corridor echo cartographer is signaled early and shapes her perception throughout (microphones, acoustic signatures, mapping). Her professional lens enables the discovery beats. However, her choices don't create key turns—she follows a linear path of discovery without tactical decisions that alter options. Present in all three gates but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Film negative strip appears in the middle beat, delivers the key visual revelation (Maya seeing herself), and is packed into the satchel at the end with reweighted meaning as proof and archive. Two distinct beats with evolving use. Not present in setup; introduced at ~50% mark but transforms prior material and shapes the closure understanding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is signaled early (grandfather's satchel, forty-year pursuit) and returns at closure ("The legacy's burden felt lighter"). It frames her motivation throughout. However, it operates more as theme than as a constraint that narrows tactical options; no on-page moment shows her choosing between legacy and an alternative path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is labeled twice and demonstrated through her acoustic work, but the trait doesn't constrain action with cost. It enables discovery without tradeoff—she hears what others miss, but no scene shows her perception causing a problem or forcing a difficult choice. Functional but one-directional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" drives the major turn: holding the film negative to light and seeing herself is the discovery that validates her grandfather's theory and reframes her purpose. Present in middle beat and referenced at closure. The action is irreplaceable—no other verb would carry the same perceptual and revelatory weight for this specific moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries found in a fireplace are signaled early (marble fireplace in the reading room) and deliver the grandfather's notes about anticipatory echoes. The method matters: fire preserved fragments while water damaged the rest, creating selective access. Used in one extended beat and packed at closure. Mechanics shape what Maya learns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage bookends the story (opening and final line) and is described with charged detail ("roots that cracked stone," "ivy rustled though no wind reached"). It functions as symbolic anchor and returns with reweighted meaning ("already dreaming of her return"). However, it doesn't pressure a choice or provide tactical resources; primarily atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Climate shifts are mentioned (ivy changed, waters rose, institution relocated) and establish the altered world, but timeframe doesn't tighten decisions. The story unfolds in a single exploration with no clock pressure. Post-climate setting enables the ivy's transformation into "nervous system," but the temporal frame is backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The question "what do walls dream about?" is signaled immediately and drives every beat: her mapping work, the diary search, the film negative revelation, and the final reframing. Motivation is consistent and charged at closure. However, no friction dramatizes competing wants or costs—she pursues this desire without sacrifice or obstacle that tests commitment.</comment>
