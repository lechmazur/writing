<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter's motivation is clear and her observation-focused interiority fits the zen-minded brief, but her agency remains largely passive—she watches, understands, and carries forward without an on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The beekeeper materializes as a guide-figure whose flickering existence is evocative but whose function is primarily expository. Interior contradictions are absent; the potter moves smoothly from seeking to understanding without struggle or competing impulse, which flattens the arc into a spiritual confirmation rather than a hard-won realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (potter, oasis, dusk) established early. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights "kindness" from abstraction to temporal anchor, and the cost is conceptual—the potter accepts a patient, gentle path in a burning world. However, the cost is asserted more than dramatized; we're told she will return to her wheel, but no on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The thrum and lantern-glass motif accumulate density, but the ending relies on thematic resonance rather than a legible, felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is vividly anchored with hives, crumbling cottage, and dust motes suspended mid-fall; the faded lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that refracts timelines and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—steaming kettle on cold stove, burnt orange sky—filtered through the potter's observational bias. The scorched wasteland supplies contrast and the oasis constrains perception (she sees through the glass), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and frames the journey. The lantern glass provides one meaningful tightening when the potter perceives fractured timelines aligning through acts of kindness, but this deepening is observational rather than forcing a choice with visible cost. The beekeeper's explanation and the potter's departure carry thematic resonance but no on-page reversal that narrows her options or exacts a price; she walks away with the glass and her understanding intact, which reads as arrival rather than escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: kindness as temporal anchor, phototropism across fractured timelines, patience in a burning world. The lantern glass and thrum recur with shifting meaning, and the final image—"accumulated light of gentle acts, phototropic across time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The beekeeper's line "Form requires patience. Beauty requires vulnerability" teeters on the edge of thematic echo but is contextualized by his role as witness, avoiding a −0.6 penalty. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy binaries, though the emotional arc leans toward confirmation rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single tight third-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the potter filters experience through her wheel-craft metaphors ("moment between collapse and form," "cracks in twice-fired clay"). Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits her observational stance. The beekeeper's dialogue—"You already know. You feel it in your clay"—carries subtext and advances understanding, though his voice lacks sharp differentiation from the narration's register. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and controlled with vivid imagery ("chimney smoke... flattened against the burnt orange sky," "dust motes hung suspended mid-fall"), but several lines loop conceptually: the thrum is described three times in near-identical terms, and "kindness" is asserted repeatedly without escalating embodiment. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Through it, she could see... Through it, she could also see..." The final paragraph over-explains the thematic payload ("Everyone who understands carries it forward") where the image alone would suffice. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Baseline deduction −0.6 for loops and conceptual redundancy across adjacent beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of pottery craft, beekeeping, fractured timelines, and kindness-as-temporal-anchor is specific and non-obvious, though the spiritual-seeker-finds-wisdom frame is familiar. The lantern glass refracting timelines and the thrum as frequency offer fresh inflections, and the phototropic metaphor integrates well. However, the emotional arc follows a template: journey → encounter with guide → epiphany → return transformed. The wasteland and oasis dichotomy risks abstraction ("everywhere or nowhere"), and the potter's understanding arrives without the friction of doubt or cost, which limits ingenuity in character stakes. Within-band +0.2 for risk in the temporal layering and sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The zen-minded potter frames the story and her meditative posture appears twice, but her choices remain observational—she picks up the glass, listens, understands, and departs. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost; her role is witness rather than agent. Present across setup, middle (meditation posture), and ending (return to wheel), but agency is low. Mid-band for presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The faded lantern glass is handled in three distinct beats: initial discovery on the windowsill, viewing fractured timelines through it, and holding it up to catch sunlight as timelines harmonize. It appears in the ending ("wrapped carefully in her traveling cloth") and its honeycomb-etched surface carries specificity. The glass enables the core revelation (timelines aligning through kindness) and charges the closure image, though the potter's act of taking it is granted rather than earned through conflict. Strong integration; essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape the middle beat when the potter views the oasis as it was, is, and will be through the lantern glass, and the alignment of timelines via kindness drives the thematic turn. The concept appears early (dust motes suspended, kettle steaming perpetually) and is present at closure ("existing in all its timelines at once"). However, timelines function more as metaphor than mechanical constraint; they do not narrow the potter's options or force a trade-off. Two gates met with thematic resonance, but swappable for "layered realities" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phototropism appears in two beats: the potter follows sun patterns for three days (setup) and the final image describes "accumulated light of gentle acts, phototropic across time." The trait shapes her method of finding the oasis and charges the thematic conclusion, but it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—she simply arrives. Present in setup and closure with clear lyric reprise, but lacks middle causal pressure. Mid-band for purposeful framing without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thrum is introduced early ("everything thrummed with a frequency she recognized"), recurs when the beekeeper speaks ("the room thrummed louder"), intensifies as she holds the lantern glass ("the thrumming intensified until she felt it in her bones"), and persists at closure ("the oasis thrummed and shimmered"). It signals the oasis's temporal instability and marks the moment timelines harmonize, though the potter does not manipulate or resist it—she observes. Present across all three beats and essential to the sensory signature, but does not drive a reversible choice. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Following sun patterns is mentioned in the opening ("followed the sun patterns for three days... noting how shadows pooled differently") and echoed in the final image ("following sun patterns toward something that refuses to burn"). The method enables her arrival but its mechanics are vague—no on-page moment shows her reading shadows or adjusting course. Setup and closure present with lyric reprise, but middle development is absent and the means could be replaced with "following instinct" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is established early with weathered hives, crumbling cottage, and its impossible existence in the scorched wasteland. The setting supplies the lantern glass (windowsill discovery), frames the beekeeper's explanation (acts of gentleness anchor the place), and persists at closure ("thrummed and shimmered, existing in all its timelines"). The oasis is indispensable to the story's logic—kindness-as-preservation cannot be abstracted from this specific place. Essential across setup, middle, and ending with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "as chimney smoke flattens" anchors the opening at dusk and the story ends "as full darkness fell," but elapsed time within the oasis is indeterminate and exerts no pressure on the potter's choices. No clock tightens decisions; the conversation with the beekeeper could last minutes or hours without consequence. Present in setup and closure but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes. Functional framing, replaceable with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to understand why some places resist change is declared early ("I came to understand") and the beekeeper's explanation delivers the answer (kindness accumulates and preserves). The potter's quest frames the journey and the thematic closure, but her desire is never dramatized as conflicted—she seeks, listens, and accepts without friction between want and cost. Present across setup, middle (stated to beekeeper), and ending (she returns to her wheel "understanding now"), but lacks on-page friction. Two gates met with thematic resonance but low dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness is embodied in the beekeeper's voice ("with sharp gentleness, the tone of someone who has witnessed collapse without succumbing to bitterness") and the potter's patient, observational stance. The tone modulates from meditative opening to charged final image ("something that refuses to burn") and remains coherent across beats. However, "sharp gentleness" as an explicit phrase is labeled once rather than demonstrated through varied syntax or conflicting impulses under pressure. Present and coherent but not fully integrated into narrative rhythm; the sharpness is asserted more than enacted.</comment>
