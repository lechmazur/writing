<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marianne's arc from skeptic to forgiving believer is traced through embodied choices: picking up the tooth with shaking hands, cataloguing reasons this can't be real, then choosing "Teach me." Her medical training colors perception throughout ("examining fingers," "bone setting"). Internal contradiction appears when "the skeptic in her catalogued every reason this couldn't be real" while "the forgiver in her recognized that certainty had only ever been a comfortable prison"—both impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice forecloses her previous certainty with visible cost, though Iris remains somewhat thin as a secondary presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation quickly (Dr. Marianne Clare, Blackwood estate maze, post-millpond discovery) and operates under a Causal lens: substitute body discovery → maze walk → tooth recognition → Iris's appearance → teaching offer. The closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise: Marianne's "Teach me" commits her to bridge-world bone setting, foreclosing her prior rational certainty. The garden brightening signals acceptance of the new reality. Cost is felt in her abandonment of the "comfortable prison" of certainty, though the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("how to make light from fractures") slightly softens the immediacy of that cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze create purposeful constraint: only those "who had learned to doubt their doubts" can enter, directly pressuring Marianne's skeptic-to-believer arc. The November/impossible-bloom contrast and "copper and honey" air establish wrongness efficiently. The stone table and tooth anchor the key choice moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (maze → garden center → stone table). The tooth as micro-object charges the closure when it "pulsed once against Marianne's palm, warm as a star being born," providing tactile proof that reconfigures her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Marianne can accept the impossible truth about her daughter—is signaled in the opening and tightens through the tooth recognition ("she'd missed the biggest deception of all"). The reversal when Iris appears forces Marianne to choose between comfortable false certainty and destabilizing truth. Her "Why now?" skepticism and final "Teach me" constitute protagonist agency that forecloses her old epistemology. The cost is visible: she abandons ten years of self-protective rationalization. Secondary stake (other taken children needing rescue) adds urgency without diluting focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of certainty versus productive doubt emerges through concrete particulars: the straw substitute, Marianne's examining fingers that "felt wrong," grandmother's journals, bone-setting metaphor. "Turn your mistakes into constellations" recurs with earned weight—first as dismissed comfort, then as literal task. However, the final paragraph drifts toward abstract statement ("how to make light from fractures, how to transform every mistake into something that could guide others home") where a charged image would serve better. The piece invites reflection on epistemological humility but occasionally tells rather than showing the transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marianne's medical-rational filter: "her skeptic's training held," "catalogued every reason," "examining fingers." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at pressure points. Iris's dialogue carries distinct otherworldly diction ("eyes held too many seasons," "the cleft," "both worlds") that contrasts with Marianne's grounded precision. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—short declaratives at the tooth recognition, longer reflective periods during Iris's explanation. Minor filter-verb presence ("wanted to yearn") doesn't dull immediacy significantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mostly clean and propulsive, with strong specificity in key images: "construction of straw and river clay," "root still pink with blood," "violet-silver" rose. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the tooth discovery. However, the final paragraph accumulates abstract phrasing and near-loops: "bone setting for the between-places" echoes "bridge the gap"; "how to make light from fractures, how to transform every mistake" creates a template-cadence run. The metaphor "warm as a star being born" is vivid but slightly strained. Information density is high through most beats, though the closing becomes more diffuse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The changeling-substitute premise is familiar but gains freshness through the medical examiner angle and bone-setting-as-magic synthesis. "Shrewdly innocent" and "forgiving skeptic" offer character specificity. The millpond straw-body inciting incident provides a concrete, non-obvious entry to fairy-tale material. However, the "secret garden only visible to those who learned to doubt" reads as convenient symbolism, and the ending's abstract "making light from fractures" rhetoric retreats toward therapeutic platitude. The piece transforms its tropes through Marianne's professional lens but doesn't fully commit to the darker implications of a mother who buried a fake child.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marianne's forgiving-skeptic duality drives the key turn: she forgives herself for missing the deception while her skeptic training makes her question Iris ("Why now?"). The trait enables her final choice—only someone who can hold contradictions could say "Teach me" to an impossible daughter. Present early, shapes middle questioning, essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tooth appears at ~25% on the stone table, is handled with "shaking hands" (embodied recognition beat), remembered as evidence Marianne ignored ("this exact tooth the week before she vanished"), and pulses "warm as a star being born" in the closure image. The object's warmth and aliveness force Marianne past rational denial. Three distinct beats, charges the ending, irreplaceable proof-object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "cleft between knowing and not-knowing" frames Marianne's arc explicitly ("you've learned to live in the cleft now") and shapes tactics: her choice to walk the maze requires doubt of her doubts, and closure depends on accepting paradox. However, it's more thematic echo than tactical constraint—the concept doesn't narrow physical options on the page. Present early via "certainty cracked open," returns at closure, but functions primarily as verbal motif.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears once as backstory ("Her late husband had called her shrewdly innocent once, amused by how she could see through everyone's lies while still choosing to believe"), anchoring her ability to forgive while questioning. The trait enables her to interrogate Iris yet ultimately choose trust. However, it's told rather than dramatized in a key beat, and the husband's label feels like exposition. Functional but underplayed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears in one suppressed moment: "Marianne wanted to yearn, to grab this possible-daughter and never let go, but her skeptic's training held." The restraint signals character and raises stakes by showing discipline, but the action itself (wanting then resisting) is brief and could be replaced by another emotional verb with similar effect. One beat, shapes a micro-choice, but not indispensable to the arc's structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Bone setting is seeded via "better at bone setting than knowing" and grandmother's trade, then returns as the literal task: "bone setting for the between-places." The metaphor of reknitting broken things underpins the mistakes-into-constellations theme. However, the mechanics never appear—Marianne doesn't perform or learn a technique on the page. Present early and at closure as concept, but not dramatized as method, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the maze controls access (only those "who had learned to doubt their doubts" can enter), directly pressuring Marianne's epistemological shift. The impossible November blooms and copper-honey air provide wrongness cues that validate her doubt. The stone table stages the tooth discovery. The garden "brightened, as if it had been waiting centuries" when Marianne commits, charging the closure. Setup, middle pressure, and closure participation all clear; essential to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors the story at the inciting moment: the millpond substitute "pulled...three days" before the walk, grounding Marianne's crisis in fresh revelation. The ten-year gap since Iris's disappearance frames the cost of Marianne's denial. However, the present-scene timeline is loose—dusk walk, conversation, and commitment occur without time pressure or clock awareness. Setup strong, but doesn't tighten decisions in scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Turn your mistakes into constellations" moves from dismissed comfort (mother-in-law's "strange phrase") to literal mission when Iris explains reknitting and Marianne accepts the teaching role. The motivation shapes closure—Marianne commits to transforming loss into guidance. However, the desire is told and thematic rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Present early and at end, but friction between desire and cost is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Nostalgic tone pervades through "half-remembered instructions from her grandmother's journals," the old fairy-tale frame, and bittersweet lost-daughter grief. Innovation appears in the bone-setting metaphor, the straw-substitute twist, and "eyes held too many seasons" otherworldliness. The blend modulates with pressure—wonder increases as Marianne accepts magic. However, the final paragraph's abstract language ("luminous," "guide others home") tilts sentimental, softening the sharper medical-rational voice that opened. Coherent but doesn't charge the final image as strongly as earlier beats.</comment>
