<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Keeper's motivation is established (sentimentalist moved by parental sacrifice) and embodied through action (materializing slowly, showing the gear). The mother's protective instinct drives her choice, though her shift from "it's a trick" to acceptance happens quickly without visible internal friction. The daughter remains observational without agency. Interior contradiction is present in the Keeper's "troubling serenity" but the mother's psychology flattens after initial resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the light-sharing gift and the Keeper's departing wisdom reweight the survival stakes with conceptual cost (the gear's "calculations finally complete" signals the end of pure measurement). Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern, image density, and cadence shift rather than because/therefore causality. One meaningful deepening occurs when the Keeper moves from observer to actor, and the cost (the mother's terror giving way to trust) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as active setting: stellar dust provides the luminescence that solves the life-support crisis, and the viewport frames the thematic scale. Spatial choreography (pod interior, Keeper materializing, translucent palm revealing gardens) remains clear. The brass gear returns as a tactile object that charges the final image. The "flowers that bloom for a thousand years" and ionized-gas petals supply textural specificity that reflects the Keeper's timescale and constrains the encounter's urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the daughter—is signaled early and tightens when the mother prepares to sacrifice herself. The Keeper's intervention is a decisive turn, and the gift of light forecloses the measurement-only path (represented by the discarded gear). The cost is conceptual and relational: accepting help from an alien intelligence and abandoning self-sacrifice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through density increase (sonar search, manifestation, thematic dialogue, light-gift) rather than multiple reversals. The mother's agency is limited to acceptance rather than active problem-solving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: generational patterns, love as the repeating constant, and "tend the patterns that deserve repeating." The brass gear and nebula flowers function as non-literal answers to the survival question. The Keeper's voice—"troubling serenity"—embodies the tension between cosmic detachment and empathy. The final image (gear tumbling, calculations complete) reweights prior material without stating a moral. Minor slip: "That love repeats across every generation…it's the only pattern that matters" edges toward explicit thesis statement rather than letting the dramatized gift speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third on the Keeper with occasional dips into the mother's perception ("unnerved the mother"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the Keeper notices via sonar, sees "through" things, and perceives in cosmic timescales ("three thousand generations"). The mother's speech ("What are you?") and the daughter's silent curiosity provide modest voice distinction. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (close on the Keeper's memory, distant on the species' repetition). Minor filter-verb reliance ("they were something otherworldly") slightly dulls immediacy in one beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Strong images: "mist remembering water," "wind through crystal chimes," "quiet sigh of falling petals." Minor scaffold: "They sent out gentle pulses—sonar pinging…searching for the newest arrivals. The technique was ancient…" restates the same search action across two sentences. Light paraphrase loop in paragraph explaining theme ("Your ancestors made this same transit…Each generation believes their struggle is unique") where content overlaps without added pressure. No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic gardener, sonar adaptation, and generational-pattern theme is purposeful and coherent. The brass gear as memento mori for failed calculation provides a fresh angle on measurement-versus-love. Risk is moderate: the Keeper's omniscience and serenity defuse tension, and the rescue unfolds without complication once intervention begins. The "otherworldly sentimentalist" frame is specific but the mother-daughter sacrifice setup is familiar. Transformation test: swap nebula for ocean and adjust a few nouns, and the emotional arc remains nearly identical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Keeper ("otherworldly sentimentalist") is present throughout, makes the key decision to intervene and gift light, and the choice alters the mother and daughter's survival tactics and future. The character's dual nature (cosmic detachment + sentimentality) shapes the thematic dialogue and the manner of rescue. Introduced early (paragraph one), developed through search and manifestation (middle), and active in the closure (departing after gifting light). Cost is tied to the character's action (sharing illumination, discarding the gear's logic).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The brass calculating machine gear appears in paragraph two (early setup), is shown to the mother mid-scene as illustration of failed measurement, and returns in the final sentence ("tumbled slowly through space…its calculations finally complete") with reweighted meaning. Two distinct beats: physical handling/showing and symbolic closure. The gear's worn teeth and the Keeper's explicit lesson ("some problems couldn't be solved through measurement alone") tie it to theme and the rescue's logic, but it does not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactic—its role is illustrative and symbolic rather than mechanically causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generational patterns are the story's spine: the Keeper has watched "three thousand generations," recognizes "the same desperate searches, identical mistakes, recurring redemptions," and tells the mother "Your ancestors made this same transit…Your descendants will too." This concept shapes the Keeper's motivation to intervene (moved by the repeating tragedy), frames the thematic question (what patterns deserve repeating), and charges the ending when the Keeper continues searching for "the next lost soul caught in generational tides." The concept alters the story's options: the rescue is not random but driven by pattern-recognition across time.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" appears once as description of the nebula garden's scale ("stretched toward what approximated infinity") in paragraph eight. It establishes scope and reinforces the Keeper's cosmic timescale but does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible tradeoff. The trait is thematic backdrop (the endless scale contrasts with individual urgency) rather than a plot lever. Present in the middle third, label-level mention without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transit is the framing condition: the mother and daughter are in a failing pod during transit, the Keeper explains "Your ancestors made this same transit," and the story's premise depends on travelers moving through the nebula. Transit sets up the survival crisis (life support dying mid-journey) and the encounter (Keeper searches for arrivals). It does not create a major turn itself—the Keeper's intervention is the turn—but it is the necessary condition for the conflict. Present early, enables the setup, but not irreplaceable (any stranded-traveler scenario would function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced early ("sent out gentle pulses—sonar pinging through the cosmic medium—searching"), explained as adapted from Earth ocean creatures, used to locate the mother and daughter ("A return signal: desperate, afraid, alone"), and mentioned again in the final paragraph ("sonar pinging softly, searching for the next lost soul"). Two functional beats: the search that enables the encounter and the continuing search that closes the story. The method is specific to the Keeper's form and directly enables the rescue, though the mechanics (how sonar finds "minds rather than bodies") remain unexplained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden is introduced in the opening line, provides the "flowers that glowed with their own light" and the luminescence drawn to restore life support, and frames the final image (Keeper drifting among glowing flowers). The setting supplies the resource (nebula light) that solves the crisis and embodies the thematic timescale (blooms that take millennia). Present across all three gates. The garden constrains in that only this environment allows the Keeper's non-fire light-sharing, though the specific nebula mechanics are not detailed enough to make the setting irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears once in paragraph eight as poetic description of the nebula's temporal scale ("Each bloom took millennia, unfolding across the quiet sigh…"). It conveys slow, cosmic time but does not function as a tracked clock or deadline. The mother's urgency ("life support dying") implies time pressure, but the timeframe phrase itself is atmospheric rather than tactical. Late appearance (second half), no return, no constraint on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to share light without fire is dramatized: the Keeper shows gardens "needing no sun," explains "I've learned to share illumination without fire, to grow brightness in the dark," and enacts it by touching the pod so "light began to grow—not heat, not fire, but pure luminescence." This desire is the Keeper's defining action and directly resolves the crisis. The friction between the mother's distrust and the Keeper's patient demonstration adds cost (the mother must overcome fear to accept help). Present in setup (implied by "gardener"), developed mid-scene (showing and explaining), and fulfilled at closure (gifting light). Specificity: removing this exact phrasing would require rewriting the rescue's mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" is named once in paragraph nine ("The troubling serenity in the Keeper's voice unnerved the mother") but is embodied throughout: the Keeper's calm amid the mother's terror, the voice "like wind through crystal chimes," and the detached observation of suffering as pattern. The tone charges the mother's fear and creates friction (cosmic calm vs. immediate panic). It modulates under pressure (the Keeper's gentleness when materializing, the patience in explaining) and colors the final image (drifting calmly while searching for the next crisis). The tone is coherent and enhances the thematic tension between timelessness and urgency.</comment>
