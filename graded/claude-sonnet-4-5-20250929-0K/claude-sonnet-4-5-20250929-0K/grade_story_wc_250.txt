<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to protect the canal community while preserving her guild position creates clear internal conflict, and her micro-choices with the mirror signal embodied decision-making. However, the guardian remains purely observational—his "spiralingly calm" precision is label-only, and he makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or outcomes. The final walk home delivers reflection rather than a dramatized renunciation or acceptance of specific cost (she keeps her job, the message spreads without her exposure), so the claimed "half-spoken secret" burden feels asserted rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern (shutters, mirrors, silence) and culminates in a charged image of the completed constellation-map. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. The closure is Charged Poise—Marina crystallizes her stance and the community will see the message—but the cost remains oblique: she walks home with "possibility of light" rather than facing a forfeited path or visible price on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails; no sentence at closure shows what Marina sacrificed or risked beyond anxiety.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-washed planks, arched bridge, and canal shutters anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The dental mirror constrains Marina's method (light-signaling) and the shutters become the communication medium, so objects pressure choice. Spatial choreography (dock, bridge, warehouse cluster) tracks cleanly. Enters 7-band because environment and tool directly enable the climactic pattern-weaving, though the final image is more thematic resonance than physical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the canals vs. protect job) signals early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina and the guardian collaborate, narrowing her options from solo testimony to silent co-conspiracy. However, the escalation is cooperative rather than against rising resistance, and the resolution unfolds without visible cost: no guild discovery, no sibling jeopardy dramatized on the page. The final "possibility of light" reads as hopeful assertion rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shutters as constellations, silence as testimony, small mirrors revealing hidden truths. The final image of shadows forming a map reweights "silent empathy" without overt moralizing. However, "teach darkness the value of stars" arrives as a near-thesis statement in the penultimate beat, and the walk home pivots to reflection ("possibility of light") rather than a resonant, non-literal image that holds ambiguity. Theme is present and purposeful but tilts explanatory at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV narration holds cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (dental mirror, weaver lineage, close observation) creates distinct texture. Diction occasionally overreaches—"spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "teach darkness the value of stars"—into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound under stress. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. The guardian's silence is maintained without exposition leakage. Voice is purposeful and mostly controlled, with minor lapses into thematic phrasing at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no major loops or scaffold. However, elevated figurative density appears in nearly every paragraph ("bruised light," "spiralingly calm precision," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret," "teach darkness the value of stars") without a taught lyric pattern that pays off. Mixed metaphor in "stillwater tension" (stillwater implies calm; tension implies agitation). Stock emotional shorthand: "throat tightened," "meaning crystallized." Overwriting in high-pressure beats (the hour-long collaboration) reduces immediacy. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under figurative stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The silent communication via shutters and mirror offers a fresh tactical angle, and the grandmother's "weaver of truths" legacy adds specificity. However, the core setup—underprivileged community threatened by development, lone whistleblower with family obligations—is a template premise. The guardian's decades-long silent messaging and Marina's inherited mirror feel seeded for the plot rather than organically necessary. The shutter-constellation transformation is inventive but arrives fully formed without prior groundwork, lowering inevitability. Solid synthesis with ornamental edges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian appears early, handles shutters across multiple beats, and is present at closure. However, he makes no on-page choice; he observes Marina's signals and responds by arranging shutters, but the initiative and decision-making remain Marina's. He is functionally a conduit—his actions are reactive collaboration rather than agency that alters stakes or tactics. Missing middle development (no choice constrained by his trait) and no independent closure participation caps the score. His silence is thematic decoration rather than a driver of turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror is introduced early as inheritance, used in two distinct beats (revealing the guardian's Witness pattern, signaling to him in flashes), and present implicitly at closure (slipped into pocket). Its "reveal what direct sight obscures" property enables Marina's tactic. However, the mirror could be replaced with any small reflective tool (phone screen, compact) with minor edits; its dental specificity and grandmother's weaver lineage add flavor but do not create unique mechanical pressure. Scores in 6-band for causal involvement across beats without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" frames the guardian's method and Marina's choice to communicate without testimony. It shapes the dominant tactic (wordless collaboration) and is named explicitly at closure ("silent empathy would speak louder than any testimony"). However, the concept functions more as thematic label than lived constraint—Marina could speak, but social cost (job loss) rather than the value of silence itself drives her choice. Present across beats but not irreplaceable; the story's stakes would hold if reframed as "covert solidarity."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is applied twice to the guardian's movements and manner. It reads as ornamental descriptor without enabling or constraining on-page action—he adjusts shutters and moves with precision regardless of whether we call it spiraling or methodical. No visible tradeoff (e.g., his calm under threat vs. urgency cost) dramatized. Label-only trait mention; no causal pressure or cost tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Weave" is seeded early (grandmother as "weaver of truths"), applied to the guardian's shutter adjustments in the middle beat, and powers the climactic hour-long collaboration where shutters are "woven" into constellation patterns. The verb choice is purposeful and recurs with escalating meaning. The metaphor charges the final image (pattern spreading across buildings). However, the action itself—arranging objects in patterns—could be described as "arrange," "configure," or "compose" with modest edits; the weaving metaphor is strong but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shutter manipulation is signaled early (guardian "adjusting wooden shutters"), developed in the middle beat (angled to cast symbols in morning light), and drives the climactic collaboration (hour-long weaving into constellation map). The method's mechanics—open/close/angle configurations casting shadows—directly shape the tactic and enable the silent message. Specificity matters: shutters (not curtains, not signs) allow the shadow-play. The method is essential to closure participation and irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain anchors the scene early, provides spatial staging (water's edge, bridge, warehouse cluster), and the rain-washed surface reflects patterns. The setting enables the tactic (canal architecture with shutters) and the final image places Marina on the dock watching shadows. However, "cobalt" and "after rain" are atmospheric rather than constraining—the scene would function in any canal district. The dock participates in closure but is not irreplaceable; scores in 6-band for purposeful setup and closure linkage without unique mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is invoked twice as thematic frame but never tracks as a live clock. The story spans "three days ago" (discovery) to "by nightfall" (completion), yet no ticking urgency or deadline pressure alters Marina's choices. The phrase functions as lyric atmosphere rather than temporal constraint. Missing middle development (no beat where time pressure forces a trade-off) and no closure-beat time reference. Functional setup, ornamental payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated explicitly near closure and shapes Marina's understanding of shared purpose with the guardian. The motivation is present across beats (she seeks to reveal hidden families, he arranges constellations) and drives the collaboration. However, the phrasing is abstract and thesis-like rather than embodied in conflicted choice—Marina never hesitates or struggles between competing desires on the page. The motivation is told and aligned rather than dramatized through friction. Scores for setup and closure presence without visible cost or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named once but enacted through pacing: the hour-long silent collaboration, charged wordless exchange, and restrained final walk. Tone modulates from evening stillness to collaborative intensity to quiet closure without breaking coherence. However, "stillwater" (calm) contradicts "tension" (agitation) in a mixed metaphor, and the tone remains uniformly controlled rather than escalating or breaking under pressure. Purposeful and present, but lacks the tonal shift or peak modulation that charges the final image. Solid execution with minor conceptual muddle.</comment>
