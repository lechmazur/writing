<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interior life is legible—her hollow faith, her recognition of completion in her grandmother's work—but the protagonist spends most of the text in observational wandering without contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to stay at the end feels declared rather than earned through visible cost or a foreclosed alternative on the page. Emotional states lean toward summary and label ("hollow weight," "tentative, more honest") rather than embodied perception. The passivity and lack of on-page friction cap the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Miriam moves through discovery beats (sundial, catacomb, tomb clearing, placement) without tight because/therefore linkage. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she decides to stay and continue restoration work), but the cost remains abstract—no visible path foreclosed or relational price paid on the page. The orientation is clean. The accumulative pressure never tightens into a decisive turn; the final paragraph states thematic resolution without a charged image or micro-turn that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard-catacomb fusion is vivid and specific: roots coiling around skulls, bronze inscription, apple trees above graves. Spatial choreography is clear across surface and underground. The sundial pedestal and the intertwined roots constrain Miriam's clearing work and charge the final image of light filtering through "roots and bones above." The setting participates in closure and enables the central metaphor, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring connection between past and present—is signaled early but remains abstract. Miriam's weeks of wandering and clearing generate no on-page resistance, reversal, or competing pressure. The ending declares completion without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the work progresses in summary without a turn that narrows her choices or imposes felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of restoration and faith rebuilt through purposeful acts emerges clearly from the orchard metaphor and Miriam's labor. The sundial inscription ("Time breaks all journeys, but the wanderer finds the way home") and the apple-blossom offering provide concrete anchors. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("the patient work of restoration, the faithful tending of roots") rather than letting the image speak, and the resolution into "trust" and "rebuilding" reads tidy. The theme is legible but overstated at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose has purposeful compression and a lyric cadence ("white petals drifting down like snow," "fractured shadows across the walls"). Perceptual signature is present in Miriam's filtering of ritual and memory. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cautious reverence," "tentative, more honest") that feels external rather than interior, and the final paragraph's syntax flattens into expository summary. The voice is controlled but not under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, with varied sentence openings and spatial anchoring. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops ("restore what was broken, to restore the connection"; "the patient work of restoration, the faithful tending") and synonym churn around "rebuild," "restore," "heal." The closing paragraphs stack filter verbs and summary constructions ("She thought of," "She would stay, she decided") that dull immediacy. Template cadence in the final third ("She picked... she pressed") and the expository tone of "the journey that had brought her here was over" lower momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—diaspora returnee restoring a cemetery across interrupted generations—is specific but echoes familiar exile-and-return templates. The orchard-catacomb fusion and the sundial inscription offer fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc (abandonment → tentative faith → commitment to restoration) follows a predictable trajectory without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The ending's thematic summary and lack of a charged turn limit originality. The transformation test suggests the arc could transfer to other settings with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam is present throughout, introduced in paragraph one, and her choice to stay drives the ending. She appears in discovery, clearing, and placement beats. However, most turns are observational or summarized across weeks; the final decision lacks visible cost or a foreclosed alternative on the page. Causal pressure is moderate; the element is essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sundial base is discovered early, carried into the catacomb, matched to the pedestal, and placed at closure with light effects. It appears in at least three distinct beats and the inscription recharges meaning at the end. The object constrains Miriam's search and shapes the final image. High integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys are signaled in the opening (grandmother's letters "stopped abruptly, mid-sentence") and echoed at the end ("The journey that had brought her here was over"). The concept shapes Miriam's motivation and frames the closure rhetorically, but it does not narrow on-page options or alter tactics during the excavation. Present thematically, less so causally.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Villagers are described as having "warmly curious eyes" and bringing tea, but the trait is ornamental. It does not constrain Miriam's choices or create friction. The warmth is mentioned once in summary and does not reappear or alter the plot. Label-only mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rebuilding is Miriam's central activity: clearing the tomb, placing the sundial, and committing to continue restoration. The action is introduced early, spans weeks, and culminates in the placement scene. However, much of the work is summarized rather than dramatized, and the rebuild could be replaced with similar restorative verbs (repair, restore) without structural loss. Functional but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Purposeful wandering is described early ("letting her feet choose directions") and mentioned again in Miriam's recognition that the work "changed her." The method shapes her discovery of the sundial and is thematically consistent, but it does not constrain choices or create friction. The mechanics remain vague; the element is present but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced in paragraph one, shapes discovery and clearing across multiple beats, and charges the final image (light through roots and bones). The setting supplies resources (the sundial's location, the pedestal), pressures Miriam's labor (stone-moving, root preservation), and anchors the closure image. The fusion of life/death is irreplaceable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early (six weeks, then "weeks clearing") and structures the excavation arc. However, time remains elastic and unthreatening; no deadline or tightening clock alters Miriam's tactics. The duration provides scope but does not create escalation. Present across beats but does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Restoring lost faith is introduced in paragraph two ("the hollow weight of a faith abandoned") and echoed at closure ("something more tentative, more honest"). The motivation drives Miriam's return and her decision to stay. However, the internal conflict is told rather than dramatized; no on-page friction or competing desire tests her commitment. The element shapes the arc but lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cautious enchantment is maintained through diction ("nestled," "blessed ground," "careful fingers") and the reverent pacing of discovery. The tone modulates subtly as Miriam descends and labors, and the final image of light and shadow carries the enchantment forward. The tone is coherent and charges the ending, though it remains static rather than escalating under pressure.</comment>
