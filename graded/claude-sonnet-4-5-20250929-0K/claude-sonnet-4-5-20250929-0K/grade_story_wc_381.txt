<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is consistent and her solitary nature integral to the work, but she operates alone throughout with no on-page friction from relationships or secondary characters to test her stance under pressure. Interiority leans heavily into abstract craft terminology ("smoothed hush," "mapped silence") that risks becoming label-speak rather than embodied perception. The final choice to fold another wing suggests Earned Stasis, but the protagonist's competence is so complete—no genuine struggle, no mistake that compounds—that the cost feels more asserted than dramatized. Internal contradiction is minimal; she executes her plan without visible doubt or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the summoner gathers elements (starflower paper, mapped silence, tranquil blaze) toward a ritual climax that hushed the prophecy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she returns to her cottage to fold another wing, accepting perpetual solitary labor with the cost of ongoing vigilance. The cost is conceptual (unending isolation, unseen labor) and legible in "silence, like any garden, required constant tending," though one might wish for a sharper on-page price paid in the climax beat itself. The narrative teaches its pattern early and holds the lens to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting is vividly anchored—"moonlight silvered the brook's surface," night-blooming jasmine—and functions as a ritual ground that frames the climactic whisper. The origami wing and brook function as micro-setting elements that constrain the summoner's action: she must kneel beside water to map silence. Sensory detail is purposeful (starflowers, candle stillness, jasmine scent) and filtered through the protagonist's craft vocabulary. The setting charges the final image when she returns to her cottage to tend silence like a garden, closing the threshold motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hush the prophecy to prevent chaos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through craft preparation (three lunar cycles, decoding riddles, folding the wing) toward the brook ritual, providing one meaningful deepening when the prophecy stirs and she counters it with mapped silence. However, the protagonist faces no genuine reversal or escalating complication; her plan proceeds smoothly without friction, unexpected cost, or tactical adaptation. The resolution is her own ritual action, but the lack of on-page resistance or price paid in the climax beat (the wing "dissolved into light" and the name settled) makes the cost feel more told than shown. One tightening is present but agency could be tested more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of solitary labor, silence as cultivation, and unseen guardianship emerges organically from the summoner's actions and final return to folding. The closing line—"silence, like any garden, required constant tending"—reweights the entire ritual as perpetual rather than one-time, answering the thematic question without moralizing. The wing-as-trapped-potential and the valley's buried name provide concrete particulars that resist abstraction. Subtext operates in the summoner's acceptance of thankless work and the elegiac tone of "no one would thank her." The piece invites reflection on hidden caretakers and the cost of peace without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The summoner's perceptual signature is distinctive: she thinks in craft metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") and perceives the world through ritualist filters (mapping silence, reading pauses between ripples). Psychic distance is close and consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—meditative in preparation, slightly tighter during the brook ritual, then easing back at closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The invented terms are taught through context and remain voice-coherent rather than arbitrary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, but suffers from decorative compound coinage that accumulates without always serving pressure: "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "nocturnal haven" cluster densely in the opening third, creating a quasi-ornamental register. Some paraphrase loops appear: "the prophecy hushed at last" echoes "to hush a prophecy" without added pressure. Template cadence in the craft-action beats ("she had spent," "she had learned," "she had decoded") flattens propulsion slightly. No major grammar or continuity errors. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work (the starflower paper detail roots cosmic in soil) but others linger on atmosphere without advancing stakes. The closure line is clean and image-driven, lifting the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—folding origami to trap prophecy via silence-mapping—offers a fresh synthesis of ritual craft and conceptual magic. The summoner's solitary, unseen labor and the use of negative space (silence, pauses, absence) as active tool provide non-obvious angles. However, the emotional arc and plot structure follow a familiar template: wise hermit performs ritual to avert disaster, succeeds, returns to her work. The "no one will thank her" beat and perpetual-tending closure are earnest but not surprising. Transformation test: swapping the wing for another ritual object or the prophecy for another hidden threat would leave the emotional and thematic trajectory largely intact. Some specificity (starflower paper, meteor dust, broker whispers) anchors freshness, but the lack of complication or cost in the climax limits ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The solitary summoner frames the entire story and makes all key choices: crafting the wing, decoding the prophecy, performing the ritual, and returning to fold another. Her isolation is thematic and her decisions (teaching the wing stillness, whispering the spaces between words) drive the plot's single major turn. She is present in every beat and shapes the closure by accepting perpetual labor. The character is essential to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in at least four beats: folding the last crease (opening), describing its starflower paper construction, carrying it to the brook, and dissolving it into light during the ritual. It is handled on the page and its transformation (from paper to light to map to silence) enacts the climax. The wing's reweighted meaning—from potential flight to trapped stillness to counter-prophecy—drives the narrative turn and charges the closure when she begins folding another. Removing the wing would break the story's ritual logic and thematic center.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is introduced early as the summoner's life's work and frames her goal. It shapes tactics (creating tranquil blaze, mapping silence) and reappears in the climax when she uses mapped quiet to trap the buried name. The concept is more than ornament; it defines the protagonist's craft and the method of resolution. However, its function is largely thematic and technical rather than creating on-page friction or visible cost. It enables rather than constrains, and could be replaced with another silence-metaphor without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is applied to the wing's paper (starflowers grown where meteor dust settled) in one descriptive beat. The trait adds texture and signals the wing's dual nature but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It is label-only: removing the phrase and its explanation would not alter the summoner's choices or the ritual's outcome. The starflower paper matters; the "terrestrially cosmic" descriptor is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Flow" appears in the climactic beat: the summoner teaches the wing "to flow backward through its own possibility" and later feels "the prophecy stirring... trying to flow toward its inevitable conclusion." The action shapes the ritual's logic and the turn when she counters the prophecy's forward momentum with backward-flowing stillness. However, "flow" is somewhat abstract and could be replaced with another reversal metaphor (e.g., unravel, retreat, invert) with minor edits. It is present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early ("mapping silence the way cartographers mapped terrain") and demonstrated in the climax: she whispers "the spaces between words" and creates "a counter-pattern, a maze of quiet" that traps the buried name. The method is signaled, shapes the ritual's execution, and is causally active in the resolution. It recurs in the closing image ("silence, like any garden, required constant tending"), linking method to theme. The story teaches the mechanics and uses them to achieve closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is introduced as "her true home, this threshold between water and earth, darkness and light" and becomes the ritual ground. The brook's whispers provide ongoing guidance, and she kneels beside the water to perform the climax action, using the setting's liminality to map silence. The location constrains her ritual (she must go outside to the brook) and charges the closure when she returns to her cottage. The setting is present in setup, middle action, and ending, and its threshold quality matters to the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" is gestured at through the brook's eternal secrets and the oracle's riddle, but the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions. The summoner has already spent three lunar cycles preparing; no live clock pressures her in the on-page action. The ritual proceeds at her chosen moment without deadline or escalating threat. Time is vague and untracked during the climax. The element is thematically consistent (secrets, riddles) but does not constrain tactics or alter the plot's pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to hush the prophecy is established early, decoded through months of work, and drives the summoner's preparation and ritual. It is dramatized in her craft choices (folding the wing, mapping silence) and tested in the climax when the prophecy stirs and she counters it. The cost—perpetual isolation and unseen labor—emerges at closure when she accepts the need to tend silence endlessly. The desire is not deeply conflicted (she never wavers or doubts), but it shapes every beat and the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced early (candlelight that illuminates without consuming) and recurs when the wing glows "with that same tranquil blaze" during the ritual. The tone is coherent—meditative, elegiac, calm even under threat—and modulates slightly when the prophecy stirs, then returns to stillness at closure. The oxymoron charges the story's paradox (fire that soothes, power that quiets) and the final image of tending silence like a garden. Tone supports theme and ending without breaking into discord or flattening into monotone.</comment>
