<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's motivation to map her grief is clearly established and her blindness shapes her perceptual signature throughout. However, the "recognition burned through her chest" epiphany at the stillpoint feels somewhat declarative rather than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. The sister's melody arrives as convenient emotional trigger rather than emerging from established internal conflict. Micro-choices under pressure are present (following the trail, kneeling) but the final understanding resolves too neatly without visible cost to a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding grief as home rather than void). Orientation anchors WHO and WHERE by ~120 words. The closure unit—"grief wasn't an unmapped void to navigate around, but a territory to inhabit"—lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting rather than solving loss). One meaningful deepening occurs when the melody reveals itself as familiar. The piece holds its lens through to closure, though the final realization leans slightly toward told epiphany rather than image-charged reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is rendered through specific sensory vocabulary (chiropteran frequencies, moth-wing percussion) filtered consistently through Sera's skin-absorption ability. The dowsing rods and platinum ring function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices (following their pull) and charge the final beat (ring pulsing hot, rods falling still). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-scene progression. The forest's "unmappable" grove directly shapes the climactic discovery and the final gesture of pressing palms to earth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating uncharted grief—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the foreign melody reveals itself as the sister's tune, narrowing the emotional terrain. The protagonist's agency drives the search (following rods, recognizing the melody), and the final understanding forecloses the option of mapping around grief. However, the escalation relies more on revelatory accumulation than forced trade-offs; the platinum ring and melody guide Sera without visible cost paid in the approach, only conceptual acceptance at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the unmappable grove, the familiar melody hidden in ultrasonic frequencies, the stillpoint existing "between heartbeats." The final insight—grief as home refracted through loss—arises from scene work rather than assertion. However, "she'd been trying to chart it as foreign territory when it was actually home" edges toward expository clarity that slightly undercuts subtextual power. The recurring map/language/translation motif charges the ending without becoming mechanical, and the piece resists moralizing while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance remains stable in close third throughout, with Sera's perceptual signature (absorbing languages through skin, ultrasonic sensitivity) consistent and specific. Diction occasionally elevates beyond probable character lexicon: "conjugation of moonlight through leaves," "quiet blaze of recognition burned," "lexicon of bat-song" feels somewhat literary-precious for crisis perception. The prose modulates well with pressure (shorter phrases as she nears the stillpoint), and no head-hopping occurs. Free indirect style is clean, though peak moments lean toward lyric register that slightly tensions immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym patterns appear: "absorbed them through her skin as she did all languages" restates the premise unnecessarily; "unmappable terrain" / "unmapped void" / "uncharted depths" cycle through the same concept. Template cadence in "She pulled out... She walked... She knelt..." across structural beats. Figurative density—"vowels and consonants in a language older than stone," "translucent," "quiet blaze"—occasionally stacks without clear propulsion. The closure beat remains legible despite these patterns, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker navigating grief through ultrasonic frequencies offers a fresh synthesis, and the sensory inversion (absorbing sound through skin) is well-executed. However, the core emotional arc—accepting grief as home rather than void—follows a familiar therapeutic template without transformation through unexpected particulars. The stillpoint as metaphor for healing operates predictably once established. The sister's melody as breadcrumb trail reads as convenient rather than inevitable. Specificity in the forest and tools elevates execution, but the premise does not resist its own predictability in hindsight.</comment>
