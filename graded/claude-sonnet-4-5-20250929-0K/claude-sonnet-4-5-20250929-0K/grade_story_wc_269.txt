<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and observational—her tapping habit and data-driven thinking feel earned. The realization about Morse code arrives via direct epiphany rather than pressure-driven contradiction; her grandfather's habit is told rather than shown acting on her present choices. Internal conflict is minimal: she moves smoothly from observation to insight without competing impulses or visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion appears mainly in "racing heart," leaning on stock phrases rather than character-particular sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story layers data, memory, and perception toward a reweighting of ocean agency. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mara typing her report reconfigures the ocean from passive record to active witness. Orientation anchors early (station, reef, three years). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost current manifests early and Mara decodes the tapping, narrowing her interpretive frame. Cost is conceptual and felt in the phrase "the ocean remembered," though the ending leans explanatory rather than dramatizing a foreclosed tactical path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station, atlas page, and bleached reef are vivid and purposeful. The station's tethered-but-drifting state constrains Mara's existence and charges the final image of being "moored but drifting." Sensory detail is selective: salt air yellowing paper, groaning cables, bone-white coral. The radio exchange and console tapping ground the technical milieu. Minor slip: "thirty meters down, heading northwest" reads plausible but the story does not show Mara using instruments in tactile ways that shape a choice; the reef is seen through a window but does not alter her present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover why ghost currents exist. The anomaly manifesting seventeen years early tightens pressure and forces Mara to cross-reference archival data, a tactical shift. Agency is present in her instruction to Mendel and decision to document, though these feel more confirmatory than a trade-off with visible cost. The choice to write the report crystallizes her stance but does not foreclose a competing desire on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs; no persistent constraint (time, tool, stamina) visibly alters her tactics within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ocean as archive and witness to human impact—emerges from concrete images: bleached coral, vanished shipping lanes, thermal memory. The atlas page and tapping rhythm are specific anchors that shift meaning at the end. Subtext operates in the phrase "moored but drifting," which mirrors Mara and her grandfather. The final image of typing the report offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Water remembers" risks arriving as a declared thesis, but it is earned by prior particulars and the Morse-code turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature: Mara notices data patterns, instrument precision, and the reef through a scientist's lens. Diction is clear and mostly character-specific; "racing heart" is a brief cliché. The radio exchange feels natural and advances plot. Purposeful compression in the archival cross-reference paragraph is legible. Slip: "the rhythmic pattern she'd never understood" tells rather than shows her grandfather's habit acting on her memory; internal voice is consistent but leans slightly expository in the explanation of thermal memory rather than rendering discovery as friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings differ. Information density is high: most lines do plot, character, or thematic work. The phrase "periodically eternal" is evocative but borders on oxymoron without grounding—it appears once and is not dramatized as a constraint. Minor scaffold: "She began to type her report, documenting the delayed revelation" summarizes rather than showing her fingers on keys or a first sentence. No loops or filter-verb stacks. The closure paragraph maintains momentum and anchors the final image cleanly. Figurative language is controlled and does not muddle peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ocean-as-memory premise is fresh and executed with specific detail: shipping-route currents, salinity-temperature alignment, coral-skeleton archive. The Morse-code twist transforms the tapping motif in hindsight. Emotional truth in Mara's isolation and inherited witness feels particular. The connection between fossil-fuel ban and thermal patterns is non-obvious. Minor derivative echo: ocean-memory and witness themes appear in recent climate fiction; here they are given a fresh mechanism (propeller-carved currents) that lifts the piece above template. Risk-taking in the lyric final image ("moored but drifting") heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara witnesses bleaching and records temperatures; this observation frames her stance. Her decisions—cross-referencing data, instructing Mendel, typing the report—trace to her role as bleaching witness. The role shapes two beats (opening frame, closure image) but does not force a trade-off on the page. Swappable with "climate researcher" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atlas page appears in three beats: pinned above workstation, tapped while studying data, pressed at closure. It seeds expectation, enables the Morse-code realization (the vanished routes match ghost currents), and charges the final image. Removing it would hollow the closure. The page's yellowed edges and her grandfather's tapping are irreplaceable specifics. Minor cap: the page is handled but not used instrumentally to alter a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Delayed revelation (Morse code decoding, thermal memory mechanism) structures the entire arc. The concept is signaled early via Mara's tapping habit and sharpens when she cross-references data. The ending dramatizes the revelation's payoff: "the ocean remembered." Removing this concept would collapse causality. Minor friction: the revelation arrives via epiphany rather than through a choice that forecloses an option, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" describes the ghost currents' seventy-three-year cycle. It appears twice (once as phrase, once as "returning every seventy-three years") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is evocative and thematically apt but could be replaced with "cyclical" or "recurring" without structural loss. Lyric resonance is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Assemble drives the plot: Mara assembles logbooks, fishermen's reports, satellite imagery, and archival data. This action enables the ghost-current insight and cross-reference turn. Two beats depend on it (middle assembly paragraph, archival cross-reference). The closure—typing her report—continues the assembly motif. Removing "assemble" would require a different verb but the gathering logic is integral. Cost: the assembly reweights her understanding, but no visible price (time, tool) alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms appear in four beats: inherited habit, repeated while studying data, decoded as Morse ("W-A-T-E-R R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R-S"), and implicit in the closure. The method shapes the revelation's mechanics and is irreplaceable. The tapping is both inherited memory and the key to understanding ocean memory, creating thematic recursion. Removing it would break the causal chain to the Morse-code turn. Cost: conceptual (delayed understanding) rather than tactical, but the specificity and payoff are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sea level monitoring station anchors all action, supplies instruments (console, radio, sensors), and embodies the "moored but drifting" metaphor. It appears in three beats (opening, radio exchange, closure image). The station's tethered state charges the ending. Micro-setting (console, window to reef) is purposeful. Minor limit: the station does not pressure a choice—Mara could conduct the same research from a land facility with minor edits. Specificity and thematic fit are strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the fossil fuel ban") is signaled early and enables the premise: ships stopped, but currents persist. It appears in two beats (opening context, thematic payoff). The ban's timing (too late for the reef) adds cost. The frame does not tighten a present decision or impose a deadline. Swappable with "after shipping declined" without breaking logic. Thematic resonance is clear but structural pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire to discover why paths disappear drives every beat: studying data, cross-referencing archives, instructing Mendel, typing the report. The motivation is dramatized in her tapping and data analysis, not merely told. Friction appears when the current manifests early, forcing her to reconcile anomaly with model. The motivation shapes the closure (documentation as testimony). Cost is conceptual (accepting the ocean's agency) rather than relational or tactical, but the desire is sustained and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone—drifting moored—is coherent from the opening image (tethered station, groaning cables) through the closure ("moored but drifting in its small circle"). It modulates with pressure: calm data study, urgency when the current manifests, reflective when she understands. The tone charges the final image (Mara typing, neither anchored nor free) and mirrors her grandfather's witness. Removing this tonal frame would flatten the thematic recursion. The tone is essential to the ending's resonance.</comment>
