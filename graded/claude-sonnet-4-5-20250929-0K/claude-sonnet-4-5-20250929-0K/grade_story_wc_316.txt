<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira's emotional numbness is dramatized through concrete choices (reaching for the jar, proposing joint custody) rather than mere declaration, and her internal contradiction—needing the child not for love but to "vivify" herself—creates authentic tension. Clone-Kira's mirroring physicality and emotional excess provide clear contrast without caricature. The characterization satisfies most bullets, but the philosophical self-diagnosis ("I came back wrong," "You feel everything too intensely") edges into therapy-speak during peak beats, pulling slightly away from embodied discovery. The final handclasp and mutual acknowledgment feel earned by prior causality, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (floating dojo, two Kiras, brain in jar, custody question) and holds a coherent Causal lens: Kira's admission of numbness → Clone-Kira's offer to take the child → Kira's counter-proposal of joint custody, each move narrowing options. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the handclasp across the jar crystallizes their complementary-opposites solution with undeniable pressure, and the cost—neither can parent alone, both must endure the other's presence—is legible in "If you fail her" and "Then your fire melts me." One meaningful tightening (Kira's "No" and pivot to balance) is sufficient at this length. Minor orientation debt: the "meditation accident" and "ego death" backstory arrives via summary rather than anchored flashback, but it does not obscure present causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo, obsidian platform, transparent floor over quantum foam, and labeled jar are vivid and purposeful; the setting's untethered physics mirrors Kira's fragmented identity. The jar recurs as a spatial anchor across three beats (opening, Kira's lifting it, final flanking). However, the dojo does not constrain a choice—Kira could deliver the same argument anywhere—and the quantum-foam timestream rewrites remain scenery rather than pressing tactics. Sensory hierarchy is clean (obsidian, glass, child's laughter), but the space functions more as thematic mirror than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (who raises the daughter) is signaled in the second line and tightens when Kira refuses Clone-Kira's offer and proposes balance instead. One meaningful reversal—"No" followed by the complementary-opposites argument—narrows options and forecloses the clean-split path the court wanted. The cost is visible in the mutual grip and threat ("If you fail her"), though it remains more relational promise than immediate forfeiture. Escalation is clean under the Causal lens, and agency is protagonist-driven (Kira's choice to share rather than yield). No coincidence solves; pressure coheres through the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (wholeness through fragmentation, numbness needing passion to define itself) emerges organically from the brain-in-jar literalization and the complementary-opposites framing. The final image—two mothers flanking preserved tissue, hands gripped across it—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "can a shattered self parent?" without stating a moral. Minor deduction: "Vivified. Whole." in the closing triplet reads as a thematic echo that nudges into statement rather than letting the handclasp stand alone. The piece resists false equivalence (Kira's numbness and Clone-Kira's excess are both disasters, not morally balanced), and the child's laughter provides concrete emotional undertow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV remains stable on Kira; psychic distance is controlled, with interior access ("the words ash in her mouth") consistent and character-specific. Diction is purposeful—"vivify," "neural tissue," "quantum foam"—and matches a post-ego-death philosophical mindset without register breaks. Dialogue carries subtext ("We can't both raise her" is also "I want her"; "Then your fire melts me" is both threat and plea) and distinguishes the two voices through stance rather than heavy dialect. One minor slip: "Master Chen taught us" arrives as expository aside rather than dramatized memory, briefly flatting the voice. No head-hopping; elision (details of the meditation accident) is purposeful and paid off through present-tense cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short "No" followed by longer exposition, then clipped dialogue exchanges); information density is high (most lines do two jobs: world-build and advance conflict). Minor deductions: "pristine and wrinkled" is near-contradictory without payoff; "vivify" recurs as lexical anchor but edges into thesaurus-itis when the simpler "make whole" would serve. The opening "tethered to nothing, anchored by meditation alone" is a strong hook. One paraphrase loop: "I need her. Not for love. For the opposite" is re-explained two beats later with "my emptiness can hold space." No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; momentum is clean through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The literalized brain-in-jar backup and the ego-death fragmentation into clone plus preserved tissue offer a fresh angle on custody disputes and identity anxiety. The complementary-opposites resolution (numbness + passion = balance) transforms the stock "who gets the kid?" setup into a philosophical problem with high-concept rigor. Minor deduction: the floating-dojo-over-rewriting-timelines frame, while vivid, does not press the custody choice in a way a courtroom or home could not, reading as ornamental high-concept rather than indispensable particularity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, and the final image (two mothers, one brain, handclasp) is specific and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira (ego death survivor) drives the key turn: her refusal ("No") and counter-proposal of joint custody. Her numbness shapes her argument ("I see clearly now") and the offered solution. Present in setup (meditation accident backstory), middle choice (lifting the jar, proposing balance), and closure (handclasp). Two distinct beats with causal pressure; the element is essential to the plot and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The brain-in-jar appears in setup (labeled "DUPLICATE"), is lifted and discussed in the middle ("Maybe that part stayed in the jar"), and physically flanked at closure. It anchors the complementary-opposites argument (Kira gestures at it when explaining balance) and charges the final image. Three beats, but its role is more symbolic anchor than active constraint; Kira could propose balance without it on the table. Present in closure but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is the dominant stake from line two ("We can't both raise her") and drives all escalation: Clone-Kira's offer, Kira's refusal, the complementary-opposites proposal. The "court needs a decision" frames urgency, and the ending rejects the binary the court wanted. Setup, middle conflict, and closure all hinge on this element; removing it collapses the plot. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is signaled early ("slicing through the pretense of civility") and demonstrated in Kira's blunt admission ("I don't love her") and her rejection of Clone-Kira's emotional plea. One clear beat (the "No" and counter-proposal) relies on this trait. Present in setup and middle; less visible in closure, where cooperation softens the edge. Functional and purposeful but not indispensable—Kira could reach the same solution through reflection rather than confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vivify" is named explicitly in the middle turn ("Not experiment—vivify") and serves as the conceptual pivot: Kira reframes her numbness as a tool rather than a deficit. The term recurs in the closing triplet ("vivified") and encapsulates the thematic resolution. Two beats (middle argument, closing image) with high thematic charge. The exact word matters less than the concept, but its specificity (life-giving rather than "fix" or "heal") sharpens the philosophical stakes and is difficult to swap without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is seeded early (Master Chen's teaching), explicitly invoked in the middle turn ("Form needs void," "separately disasters, together balance"), and enacted in the closure (two mothers flanking the jar, "your fire melts me"). The method structures the entire argument and final image; removing it leaves no resolution mechanism. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. The piece commits fully to this logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is anchored in the opening line and recurs twice (rotation noted mid-story, "completed its rotation" near the end). It provides vivid atmosphere and thematic echo (untethered space for fragmented identity), but does not constrain a choice—the custody argument could occur in any neutral space. Present in setup and closure image but not causally active; micro-setting (the jar, the platform) does more tactical work. Lyric resonance (first line → penultimate paragraph) without middle pressure caps this near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"While history rewrites itself" appears twice (quantum foam observation mid-story, final rotation) as metaphor for Kira's fragmented perception of causality. It enriches atmosphere and theme but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the custody discussion proceeds at conversational pace. Present in setup (implied by "dissolution") and closure callback, but no middle beat where timeline pressure alters tactics. Ornamental rather than urgent; swappable with any other metaphor for instability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kira's drive to defeat emotional numbness is explicit ("I need to defeat this numbness") and dramatized in her refusal to yield the child and her proposal to use numbness instrumentally ("my emptiness can hold space"). The motivation is present in setup (backstory of coming back wrong), middle choice (lifting the jar, arguing for balance), and closure (handclasp as commitment to the method). Two beats with visible friction (wanting connection without feeling it) and a cost (enduring Clone-Kira's intensity). High integration, though the word "defeat" is slightly at odds with the final acceptance of numbness as tool.</comment>
