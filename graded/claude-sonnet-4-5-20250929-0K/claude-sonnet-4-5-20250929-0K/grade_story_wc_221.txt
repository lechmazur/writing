<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's immunity to time dilation is established and motivates her remaining on the station, but her interior life leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment shows her drawing "not the stars as they appeared, but the paths they traced through time itself," which gestures at transformation, but the choice itself is announced rather than tested under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—most beats describe her actions (tracing fingers, positioning herself) without visceral contradiction or cost. The ending's "blessed pariah" reframe feels more like thematic summary than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of temporal imagery accumulates toward a final reconfiguration). Orientation anchors who and where early, though "after the shutdown" remains vague. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya positions herself at the deck's center and begins to draw, reframing "true north" as self-acceptance rather than direction—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("she could never truly leave") rather than felt on the page. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and holds coherence, yet no on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off; the final act is continuation, not reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observation deck's temporal zones are vivid and specific: titanium beams warped by gravitational flux, sound bouncing through temporal gradients, the compass rose's distorted geometry. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's professional astronomer lens (tracking supernovae, galaxy drift). The compass rose returns at the center and charges the final image by anchoring her stance. Spatial choreography is clear across zones, and the setting constrains her existence (adaptation to flux would prove fatal in normal spacetime), meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya's isolation and her project of mapping temporal currents. However, no on-page tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off—she moves through zones, observes phenomena, and prepares to sketch as she has done before. The approaching anniversary is a ritual repetition, not a pressure point. Agency is present (she chooses to remain, to draw) but does not foreclose a path with visible cost; the claim "she could never truly leave" is told rather than tested. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is expected; the piece offers thematic restatement instead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Maya's navigation of temporal flux: transformation, isolation as exploration, the relativity of perspective. The compass rose motif recurs purposefully, shifting from navigational tool to metaphor for self-location. Subtext operates in the "echoed silence" and her smile at the end. The final image—drawing "the paths [stars] traced through time itself"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the closing line's thematic summary ("True north was wherever you stood…") tilts toward articulation rather than letting the image speak, and "blessed pariah" risks label convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization through Maya. Perceptual signature is consistent: astronomer's lens, attention to temporal phenomena, measured tone. Psychic distance is stable. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("temporal topology," "probabilistic ghost"), though some phrases approach stock lyricism ("monument to abandoned ambition"). No dialogue. The final paragraph's "True north was wherever you stood when you stopped running from yourself" edges into thematic ventriloquism—Maya's articulation feels more like authorial thesis than her interior idiom under pressure. Otherwise, voice remains clean and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several beats loop thematically without advancing pressure: "blessed pariah" appears twice as framing device; "true north" is restated in the compass-rose beats and again in the final paragraph. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "From one corner… From another… In the third…" The closing paragraph's "alone but never lonely, charting the infinite permutations" stacks near-synonyms. Figurative language is dense ("geological strata," "patient unfolding," "plasticity," "malleability") but mostly coherent. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd been," "she understood," "she could watch") slightly dulls immediacy in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temporal-flux observation deck premise is fresh, and the detail of Maya's cellular adaptation (fatal in normal spacetime) is a non-obvious constraint. The family custom of anniversary sketching anchors emotional specificity. However, the isolated-astronomer-on-abandoned-station frame and the blessed-outcast archetype are familiar SF templates. The piece transforms these through Maya's active cartography and the compass-rose motif, but the emotional arc—acceptance of exile as transformation—follows a well-worn path. The synthesis is competent and the final image (drawing star-paths through time) is evocative, yet the story could function with different names and setting without fundamental change to its arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya (blessed pariah) is present throughout and her immunity frames the premise. She makes micro-choices (positioning herself, preparing materials, drawing), but these are ritual continuations rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. She refused to leave in backstory, but that key turn is off-page. Her on-page agency is observational and reflective; no choice in the present window creates a reversal or tightening.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose appliqué appears in three beats: opening (Maya traces fingers along it), middle (described as distorted, pointing "nowhere and everywhere"), and ending (beneath her feet at deck's center). Its distorted geometry serves as metaphor for her existence and anchors the final image. However, its function is symbolic rather than causal—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The reprise reweights meaning but does not drive plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"True north" is introduced early via the compass rose ("True north meant nothing here"), recurs in the middle as personal cartography, and is articulated in the final paragraph ("True north was wherever you stood…"). It shapes Maya's stake (finding orientation in confusion) and charges the closure image. However, it operates as theme and metaphor rather than altering on-page options or tactics. Its presence is purposeful but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Temporal stretching creates the observation deck's zones, enables Maya to witness phenomena at different rates (supernova in a week, galaxy drift accelerated), and constrains her existence (adaptation would prove fatal outside). It is present early, drives multiple beats (her navigation of zones, her sketching project), and directly shapes the final image (drawing from the stabilized center). The cost is visible: she cannot leave. The trait is essential to both world logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears as Maya's method for observing the universe from temporal zones (glimpsing supernova, galaxies, Andromeda's future state via quantum fluctuations). It is present across beats and integral to her exploration. However, the action itself is passive observation rather than a decision that redefines options. It supports the premise but could be substituted with "observe" or "witness" without structural change. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced early (discovery of her gift, alone after evacuation), shapes the middle (she has continued the ritual, creating temporal maps), and drives the ending (she prepares materials and begins to draw on another approaching anniversary). The method matters: her sketches track temporal currents and are her means of transformation. It creates the frame for closure and is causally active. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is established immediately, its titanium beams and temporal zones detailed throughout. It constrains Maya (she cannot leave), supplies resources (zones for observation, the center for stability), and charges the final image (she positions herself "at the deck's exact center, where temporal flow stabilized momentarily"). The setting is inseparable from conflict and closure. Without it, the story's premise and ending fail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors backstory and explains Maya's isolation (corporation pulled out, station sealed). The approaching anniversary creates a ritual frame for the present action. However, the timeframe is vague—no ticking clock tightens decisions, and the "after" is a static condition rather than a pressure that alters tactics. It orients the reader but does not escalate or constrain present choices. Functional setup; minimal development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Maya's desire to turn confusion into exploration is stated explicitly ("she'd turned the confusion of her condition into endless exploration") and frames her stance (isolation as transformation). It is present in her mapping project and anniversary ritual. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between competing wants is visible on the page, and no cost tests her commitment in the present window. The motivation supports theme but lacks on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced early ("echoed silence was her constant companion"), detailed in the middle (sound bouncing through temporal gradients, arriving at different moments), and returns in the ending ("In the echoed silence, her pencil scratched against paper, the sound arriving before, during, and after…"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly with the final moment's quiet affirmation. It charges the closure image by emphasizing temporal distortion. However, the mood remains static across beats; no tonal shift reflects escalation or deepening pressure.</comment>
