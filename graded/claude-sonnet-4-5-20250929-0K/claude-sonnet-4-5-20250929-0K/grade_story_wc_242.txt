<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarah's interiority is concrete and specific ("touching the glass harmonica disc, its cold surface grounding her"), with embodied contradictions driving the protocol-break choice. The elderly caller's motivation is economically sketched yet sufficient to create pressure. Minor deduction: the supervisor's termination threat is asserted rather than dramatized through prior consequence, and Sarah's final shift to "invitation" feels slightly under-earned given three years of adherence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (operator, booth, Tunnel 47, six levels down). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sarah invites connection after violating protocol, reweighting "wrong number" from estrangement tool to invitation with visible professional cost on the page ("Her supervisor would terminate her"). The causal lens holds: the callback creates the loop, forcing Sarah's choice, which alters her stance and the booth's function. One meaningful tightening (protocol break → cost acknowledgment → deliberate repetition as invitation) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is specific and constrains action: condensation on pipes wets Sarah's fingers for the disc performance, and the "hum of streetlamps filtering down through ventilation shafts" charges the timeframe. Spatial choreography is clean (booth wedged between pipes and conduits). The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, constraining the pivotal performance choice and charging the final image when it "sang differently—less haunted, more hopeful." Minor: the Department of Disconnected Services feels more whimsical than grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintain cultivated estrangement vs. offer connection) is signaled early and tested in the callback. Sarah's protocol break is a protagonist-driven reversal with visible professional cost ("Her supervisor would terminate her"), and the man's choice to "call your son" narrows his options with emotional cost. The final phone ring adds a second tightening: Sarah converts policy into invitation, foreclosing her prior stance. One friction: the man's offscreen son-call is a resolution Sarah suggests but does not witness, slightly softening the on-page escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (endings as beginnings,ループ versus estrangement) emerges through the glass harmonica's shifting resonance and Sarah's protocol violation without overt moralizing. The final "Wrong number" invitation offers a non-literal answer to the premise, reweighting "cultivated estrangement" as a choice rather than duty. The disc's melodic haunting and the man's daughter-to-son loop provide concrete thematic particulars. Minor: "teaching endings how to begin" is nearly stated as thesis ("An ending that sounds like it could begin something"), skating close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable with clear psychic distance. Voice is distinct ("cultivated estrangement," "melodically haunted") and modulates under pressure (protocol narration → wet-finger performance → quiet invitation). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("This is a wrong number. I meant to call my daughter"). Minor deduction: some diction ("DNA of a new hello," "psychic infrastructure") tilts slightly elevated for the operator's register under stress, and the phrase "melodically haunted by every conversation" in the performance paragraph feels more authorial than Sarah's direct perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the glass harmonica description integrates action and atmosphere without stalling. Opening and closing lines frame the shift cleanly. Deductions: "melodically haunted" appears three times in close proximity (disc description, performance beat, tone discussion), creating mild synonym churn. "Between the hum of streetlamps" as timeframe is poetic but functionally vague—does it recur nightly or mark a unique window? The phrase "loops, repetition, attachment" is a list that could compress to "attachment through repetition."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (wrong-number operator maintaining urban loneliness) is fresh and commits fully to its logic. The glass harmonica as Benjamin Franklin's madness-inducing instrument adds specificity without quirk-for-quirk's-sake. The callback reversal (wrong number becomes right through persistence) feels earned in hindsight. Minor: the Department of Disconnected Services and "psychic infrastructure" veer toward whimsy that slightly tensions the otherwise grounded tunnel realism, and the concept risks allegory (loneliness infrastructure) without enough lived detail to fully anchor it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarah signals early (paragraph 1), drives two key beats (protocol break for disc performance, final invitation answer), and her choice forecloses her prior professional stance with stated termination cost. Closure hinges on her shift from enforcer to inviter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in paragraph 2 setup, enables the middle performance beat (wetting fingers, producing sound), and returns in the penultimate paragraph with reweighted meaning ("less haunted, more hopeful"), charging the closure. Its specific properties (crystalline edges, wet-finger mechanism, purity-to-madness history) make it irreplaceable. Slight swappability: another resonant instrument could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement frames Sarah's job and the protocol she violates, shaping the dominant stake. It is named early and tested in the callback. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—Sarah's choice to violate it is motivated by empathy, not by mechanics of estrangement itself altering her options. Lyric reprise in closure (invitation instead of estrangement) reweights it with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" describes the disc's sound in paragraph 2, recurs in the performance paragraph ("melodically haunted by every conversation"), and shifts to "less haunted, more hopeful" near closure. The trait enables the performance action (haunting sound as comfort) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it colors the moment rather than forcing a trade-off. Swappable with "resonant" or "mournful" in most beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The loop (man calling back, creating circuit) is the inciting incident that forces Sarah's protocol break and redefines "wrong number" as potentially right. It appears early (paragraph 4) and drives the major turn. The closure invitation implies future loops. Removal would eliminate the central pressure. Minor: the loop is declared more than shown—we do not see Sarah's reaction viscerally tested across multiple callbacks.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Wrong-number friendships anchor the premise and Sarah's job description (paragraph 2). The method shapes Sarah's protocol adherence and her violation (offering connection through the callback). The man's persistence and Sarah's final invitation both enact the method. It is present in closure (invitation to call back). However, "friendship" is not dramatized on the page—the single callback reads more as brief pastoral care than sustained relationship.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is anchored early (paragraph 1: Tunnel 47, six levels beneath operational lines, wedged between pipes and conduits) and supplies a key resource (condensation on pipes wets Sarah's fingers for the disc performance in the middle beat). The tunnel's mechanical breathing and streetlamp hum recur in the penultimate paragraph. Micro-setting qualifies when it constrains choice; here it enables one action. Postcard danger: some description (eternal hum, distant rumble) adds atmosphere without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" is named as timeframe in paragraph 3 but remains poetically vague—it signals a recurring nightly window without specifying duration or urgency. It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters Sarah's tactics. Present but ornamental; could be replaced with "tonight" or "late shift" with minimal edit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To teach endings how to begin" is stated as Sarah's personal philosophy (paragraph 5), tested in her advice to the man ("call your son… let him answer the wrong number. That's how it starts again"), and enacted in her final invitation. The motivation drives her protocol break with professional cost. Slight tell-heaviness: the philosophy is declared in exposition before being dramatized, and Sarah's internal conflict between adherence and empathy could deepen with more visceral hesitation.</comment>
