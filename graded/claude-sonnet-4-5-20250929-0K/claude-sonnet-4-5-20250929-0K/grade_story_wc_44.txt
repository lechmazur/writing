<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her scholarly focus remains consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("understanding flooded through her") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The key moment of inserting the clockwork key and adjusting the orrery shows agency, but the path from discovery to solution feels more like puzzle-solving than character struggle with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test her choices, and the ending grants success without meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path—she simply completes the mechanism and "begins taking notes."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors orientation cleanly (observatory, Mira, post-spoon-bending world) and follows a causal lens: discovery of key → decipherment → insight about loops → mechanical adjustment → restoration of shadow-cycle. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes the observatory itself is trapped and must relearn its path. However, the closure—shadows becoming "luminous threads"—arrives without on-page cost or foreclosed option; Mira achieves her goal cleanly, leaving the key in place with no visible sacrifice, which weakens the Decisive Change requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are vividly established with the brass telescope, orrery mechanism, and perpetual darkness. The clockwork key's keyhole discovery and the orrery's frozen state create spatial constraints that directly enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (key's warmth, hum of potential, dawn bleeding into darkness), and the micro-setting—the orrery at the observatory's base—charges the final image when the isle drifts into restored daylight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding where shadows vanish at noon—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira connects the journal patterns to the orrery's incomplete loops, narrowing her approach. However, escalation is gentle: no reversal tests her commitment, and the orrery simply works once she inserts the key and adjusts the arms. The resolution lacks visible trade-off; Mira achieves her scholarly goal without paying a felt price or foreclosing another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "sealed awakening" premise: shadows don't vanish but transform into connection when all loops close. The final image—shadows as "luminous threads that connected every object"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The metaphor of relearning and closing circuits braids character action (Mira's decipherment) with world logic (the observatory's fractured cycle). Minor slip: "so many more awakenings waiting to be unsealed" in the closing line edges toward thematic echo, though it remains understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct scholarly register ("budding rune scholar," "painstakingly deciphering"). Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature reflects Mira's analytical lens (tracking "absence where shadows should have pooled," tracing "connections between entries"). However, some constructions flatten immediacy with filter verbs ("she sensed," "she believed") and the prose occasionally lifts into expository register ("The ancient texts spoke of sealed awakenings") that distances the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear. Opening stem repetition: "She'd found it," "She picked up," "She turned to," "She moved to," "She examined it" clusters template cadence across the middle section. The phrase "quietly deliberate" in the opening is recycled as "smiled quietly, deliberately" at the close without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "the shadows weren't disappearing—they were trying to wake" restates the "sealed awakenings" concept without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled, but these line-level slips accumulate to −0.8 per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—spoons bending reality and trapping an observatory in perpetual night—offers a fresh fantastical angle, and the "shadows as luminous connection threads at noon" is a non-obvious synthesis. The clockwork key as literal mechanism to close metaphorical loops integrates concept and action. However, the emotional arc feels familiar: lone scholar discovers artifact, deciphers runes, completes ancient mechanism, restores lost function. The final image's originality lifts the score, but the journey follows a recognizable template without bold risk or transformation that reshapes the arc itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira (budding rune scholar) is present throughout and her decipherment work drives the key turn—realizing the observatory must relearn its cycle. She makes the decisive choice to insert the key and adjust the orrery, altering the outcome. However, her scholarly role is more label than lived texture; we see her examine and deduce but not struggle with competing professional or personal pressures. Early signal present, two beats involved (decipherment, mechanical adjustment), and closure linkage when she leaves the key in place. Swappability moderate; another scholar-type could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in beat one (found three weeks ago, on worktable), beat two (studying runes, feeling warmth), and beat three (inserting into orrery, turning it, leaving it permanently). Its runic inscriptions shape Mira's understanding of "closing loops," and its fit into the orrery's keyhole is the causal hinge that restores the observatory's cycle. Strong closure linkage: "left it there, a permanent part of the mechanism." High irreplaceability—its specific teeth and runes matter. Cost connection is visible: Mira relinquishes possession, embedding it in the mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" frames Mira's interpretive lens early ("moments when dormant forces stirred but couldn't quite breach") and shapes her belief that shadows are "trapped between existence and transcendence." The concept drives her tactic of closing loops to enable the awakening. Closure participation: the observatory's "consciousness, trapped in perpetual night" is unsealed when the cycle restores. However, the concept functions more as thematic language than on-page constraint that narrows options with cost. Mid-band: present across beats, supports stakes, but does not alter tactics under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears twice: opening ("movements quietly deliberate") and close ("smiled quietly, deliberately"). The trait colors her behavior but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. No moment where quiet deliberateness forecloses a faster, riskier path or where impatience would have changed the outcome. Lyric reprise is present, but the recurrence does not reweight prior material or charge the closure with new pressure. Functional but replaceable; another temperament descriptor could serve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Relearn" structures the central turn: Mira must "relearn the observatory itself, to remember its original purpose." The action is signaled early in rune inscriptions ("one could relearn what reality had forgotten") and drives the climax—adjusting the orrery so the isle "was remembering...relearning its path through time." Strong causal role, but the action itself is abstract (understanding, remembering) rather than physical with immediate cost. Closure linkage clear: "a reality relearned" in final paragraph. Swappability moderate; "restore" or "rediscover" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is signaled in the key's runes ("by closing loops, by completing circuits") and becomes Mira's method. She identifies gaps as "incomplete loops" in her journal, then physically closes them by adjusting the orrery's arms ("Each adjustment closed a loop, reconnected a broken circuit"). The method shapes her tactic and appears in three beats (runic study, journal insight, mechanical action). However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—what constitutes a "loop" physically is vague—and the method does not impose a constraint or cost that alters her approach under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is established immediately and supplies the central problem (trapped in perpetual night) and the key resource (the orrery mechanism). The setting directly pressures Mira's goal—she cannot observe noon shadows without restoring the isle's cycle—and the observatory's foundation yields the clockwork key. Closure linkage strong: "The observatory drifted onward, no longer confined to night." Specificity high: floating, nocturnal, housing an orrery that maps forces. Irreplaceability solid; a ground-based or always-mobile observatory would not carry the same stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" anchors the inciting condition (six months prior, curved metal surfaces warped, shadows stopped behaving). The timeframe establishes the problem's duration and Mira's sustained investigation. However, time does not tighten tactics or create urgency; Mira works at her own pace without deadline or escalating cost. The spoon-bending is a vivid past event but functions as backstory rather than an active constraint. Mid-band: sets context and frames the mystery, but does not alter present choices or pressure the closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is Mira's stated motivation and drives her journal work, telescope tracking, and rune decipherment. The desire is present across all beats and shapes the climax when she finally observes noon and sees shadows transform. However, the motivation is enacted through scholarly observation rather than conflicted choice with friction between want and cost. No moment where pursuing this knowledge forces her to sacrifice another goal or face a moral trade-off. Functional across structure, but not dramatized as a pressure that tests her values.</comment>
