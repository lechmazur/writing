<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to "complete the work" drives the piece, and her mass-change trait embodies emotion concretely. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("emotion too complex to name") and her epiphany about humanity's shadow lacks contradiction or genuine struggle—she simply believes and acts. Akio's pivot from "persistent critic" to hand-holding ally feels unmotivated; his disapproval dampens her spirits but doesn't create sustained friction or force a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shimmer-patterns, photographs, and Tear build density toward a final charged image. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dimension begins to open, reweighting the entire shadow-work premise with felt consequence. Orientation anchors promptly (Mei, observation deck, post-last-human). The tightening is clear: Mei activates the apparatus, the Tear blazes, and both characters cross the threshold. Cost is legible in "both of them understanding finally" and the ship's impending transformation, though the price remains conceptual rather than deeply personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship's seventeen rebuilds and four-century history supply atmosphere and reflect the story's theme of accumulated pain. The observation deck, workshop, and magnetic field ground key beats. Mei's floating centimeter above deck and her fingertips grazing walls integrate body-as-micro-setting. The Tear's "impossible colors" and the shimmer on photographs constrain her research method and charge the final image when light refracts through the resonance chamber. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei's scholarly focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to integrate humanity's shadow before extinction—is signaled early and sustained. Mei's apparatus activation is a clear tightening that narrows options: the lights dim, photographs glow, the Tear blazes. Akio's hand-holding choice at closure represents a meaningful reversal from critic to partner, though it arrives without on-page struggle. The cost is conceptual and relational: "final threshold, this last necessary reckoning" charges the moment with undeniable pressure, even if the personal price isn't fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shadow-work conceit: unprocessed collective grief as a locked dimension. The piece resists easy morals, letting Mei's dangerous quest and Akio's pacifism coexist without forced balance. The final image—shimmer spreading to the walls, ship preparing for transformation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether humanity should face its shadow. The Tear and photographs function as charged motifs that accumulate meaning rather than ornament. Minor slip: "terrible beauty of completion" leans slightly abstract at the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mei's perceptual signature—reading salt-crystal patterns, noticing light refraction—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Akio's lines advancing the thematic tension. The prose modulates appropriately (lightness when content, grounded when challenged). However, Mei's diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bodhisattva," "spectroscopic equipment," "fractal pattern") that reads more authorial than character-specific under peak stress, and Akio's voice lacks strong differentiation from Mei's narrative idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (ship history, shadow work, shimmer-patterns all compress efficiently). The apparatus activation beat propels cleanly: "lights dimmed...photographs began to glow...The Tear blazed." No loops or scaffold. Minor deductions: "emotion too complex to name" is an evasion rather than embodied interiority; "ghostly resolve" appears twice as unvaried stock phrasing; "the terrible beauty of completion" at closure leans toward purple without sharp sensory anchor. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadow-work archaeology concept synthesized with spectroscopic grief-reading and a locked dimension offers a fresh angle on species-twilight narratives. The gravitational-lightness trait and crystallized tear are specific and memorable. However, the core frame—last humans seeking transcendence through accumulated pain—echoes familiar SFF templates without full transformation; the final threshold feels more conceptual than viscerally lived. Mei's research breakthrough (shimmer-patterns reveal a frequency) arrives without prior struggle or false leads, reducing earned surprise. The piece commits fully to its premise but plays safely within established genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Akio is introduced as "most persistent critic" and "steadfast pacifist" who believes "some dimensions should remain closed." His presence dampens Mei's spirits (literally grounding her), creating one functional beat. At closure he reaches out and takes her hand, reversing from opposition to alliance—a second beat that enables the threshold crossing. However, his reversal is summarized ("both of them understanding finally") rather than dramatized through a visible choice under pressure, and he disappears from the page between early opposition and final hand-holding. The element is functional but the character's arc is told more than shown. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but summary-only reversal −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear is introduced early (paragraph 4), described with specificity ("crystallized droplet," "impossible colors"), kept suspended in a magnetic field, positioned at the fractal pattern's center, and "blazed suddenly brilliant" to open the dimension at closure. It appears in at least three distinct beats (introduction/obsession, apparatus setup, climax blaze) and its unique refractive properties enable the resonance mechanism. The glimpse "through it" of the locked dimension makes it causally indispensable to the ending. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6, minus minor swappability risk (another sacred artifact could theoretically serve) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shadow work—the archaeology of collective pain" is defined early and frames Mei's entire research project. It shapes her tactics: she examines what humanity refused to see, arranges photographs, reads shimmer-patterns, and builds the resonance apparatus specifically to integrate accumulated grief. The concept drives the middle beat (explaining her method to Akio) and the closure image (facing the shadow before disappearance). It is not merely thematic but operational—the locked dimension *is* the pooled unacknowledged pain. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mei's gravitational lightness when happy appears in paragraph 1 ("floated a full centimeter above the deck") and again when Akio's disapproval "dampened her spirits" and "her feet now touched the ground"—two beats that embody her emotional state concretely and enable spatial choreography. At closure she feels herself "rising again, lifted by an emotion too complex to name," grounded only by Akio's hand. The trait constrains movement and visualizes interiority, though it doesn't directly alter a tactical choice with hard cost. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, embodiment/specificity +0.5, but no decision cost tied directly to the attribute −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Stitch together what we've torn apart" is Mei's stated goal and metaphor for her shadow work. The verb recurs: she wants to "stitch together" humanity's fragmented pain. However, the actual closure action is "opening" and "pushing through" rather than stitching—the dimension opens, the shimmer spreads, the ship transforms. The stitching language remains metaphorical and does not describe the apparatus's physical mechanism. It frames the thematic intent but the climax pivots to unlocking/opening imagery. Present by first third +0.5, thematic framing +0.4, but swappable with "integrate" or "unite" −0.7, and the climax uses different action verbs −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shimmer of long-dried tears on photographs is introduced early (paragraph 3), explained as salt crystals that "spoke of specific griefs," analyzed through spectroscopic equipment to reveal extra-dimensional resonance, arranged in fractal pattern, and amplified at closure when "the photographs began to glow softly, their ancient tears shimmering in concert." The shimmer is the literal mechanism: Mei reads the patterns, builds the resonance chamber to amplify them, and the "shimmer spread from the photographs to the walls" at the ending. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity/irreplaceability +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship *Metamorphosis* is named and historicized (seventeen rebuilds, four centuries) in the opening line, and the observation deck and workshop provide spatial anchors. At closure "the recycled spaceship prepared to be transformed one final time," echoing the opening and charging the ending image. However, the ship functions primarily as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than constraint—it doesn't pressure Mei's choices through resource scarcity, access limits, or environmental hazard. The "seventeen layers of history" enrich atmosphere but don't alter tactics. Early signal +0.7, closure reprise +0.9, thematic resonance +0.5, but no tactical constraint −0.9, ornamental use −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"The last human had been born thirty-two years ago" anchors the timeframe early and establishes extinction urgency: "When the last human dies, all this unprocessed grief dies with us." This frames Mei's motivation and the species' "ghostly resolve." However, no live clock tightens decisions—the piece unfolds in one continuous scene without deadline pressure or time-tracking that alters Mei's tactics. The timeframe is a premise rather than an active constraint. Early signal +0.6, motivational framing +0.7, closure thematic link +0.5, but no tactical tightening from elapsed or remaining time −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"I'm trying to push open this locked dimension" is Mei's articulated goal (paragraph 6), introduced after her shadow-work obsession is established. Her years building the apparatus, positioning ten thousand photographs, and activating the resonance chamber are all in service of this desire. At closure the dimension begins to open, directly fulfilling the motivation. The friction between Mei's drive and Akio's pacifist objection creates one beat of conflict, though Akio's reversal softens the cost. Setup by second paragraph +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, visible cost (threshold crossing with unknown consequence) +0.5, but late first mention (paragraph 6, ~40%) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is used twice as an explicit descriptor (paragraphs 2 and final), framing the species' inward turn and their willingness to cross the final threshold. Tone coheres throughout: solemn, elegiac, purposeful without melodrama. The mood modulates subtly—Mei's initial lightness, the weight when challenged by Akio, the intensification at apparatus activation—but remains within the established register. At closure "ghostly resolve" directly charges the final image as both characters accept the reckoning. Early signal +0.6, coherence across beats +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, modulation under pressure +0.6, but the repeated phrase reads slightly stock −0.2.</comment>
