<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amira's interiority is embodied through the bell's "dull chime" and her mastery of "amplified quiet," and her pairing of elders with runners demonstrates character-particular problem-solving under sanctions pressure. The volunteer Sami functions primarily as a foil for exposition rather than applying independent pressure; his question about donors feels like a prompt for Amira to articulate theme. The officer confrontation and midnight-route pivot show agency under threat, but Amira's competence is nearly frictionless—she solves problems without visible internal cost or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor penalty for Sami's utility-player role and the absence of dramatized internal conflict at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening (ridge, arbor, sanctions, Amira) and operates in accumulative mode: repeated touches of bell, donations, midnight runs, and letters build pressure toward the daylight bell-ring as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The officer visit and route-change constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces tactical adaptation. Cost is visible in the risk of inspection and the need for decoy carts, and the final image reconfigures anonymity from fear into collective resilience. The lens holds; closure lands with conceptual cost (ongoing exposure, endurance under threat). One deduction: the route-change beat summarizes key action ("guided her through alleys") rather than dramatizing the turn, slightly softening closure stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor recurs as the site of meetings, the tin box, posted letters, and the daylight bell-ring, anchoring spatial continuity and charging the final image. Sensory detail—warm clay smell, wind pocket, chalk stars on doorways—is selective and filtered through urgency (midnight runs prioritize stealth, the officer's gaze weighs the bell). The arbor's elevation and visibility meaningfully constrain tactics: it invites inspection, forcing Amira to shift routes. Micro-setting (satchel, carts, doorways) supports goal-directed action across beats. No penalty for scope; occupational systems (food distribution, guard shifts) are sketched efficiently without breaking credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sustaining anonymous aid under threat of exposure and extortion—is signaled early and tightens through the rumor and officer visit, forcing Amira to change routes and articulate the fund's purpose without revealing donors. The midnight decoy/elder-guided delivery is a causal escalation driven by protagonist agency, and the satchel returning heavier than it left demonstrates visible accumulation of support. The final daylight bell-ring crystallizes the stance (public defiance, collective endurance) with felt cost (ongoing sanctions, future inspections). One deduction: the officer's departure after weighing the bell's "authority of older faiths" reads slightly convenient, lowering the immediacy of threat at that pivot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—fear transmuting into collective care, anonymity as protective chorus—emerges through concrete particulars: the seamstress's note, the dock clerk's coin, Sami's question, the elder-guided alleys, and the satchel filling at doorways. The bell's shift from argument-ender to daylight declaration reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (slipping coins, chalk stars, hands adding to the satchel) and in the amplified quiet that "words small but impossible to ignore" captures. Minor deduction: "fear turning into care" and "anonymity was not absence but a chorus" are close to thematic summary, though they remain anchored in Amira's reflection rather than authorial intrusion. The final image—ringing in daylight, declaring together without names—offers a resonant answer to the survival question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Amira's focalization with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature shaped by vigilance (listening to sirens, counting by touch, meeting the officer with "hands empty, bell visible"). Diction stays within her lexicon; "amplified quiet she had mastered" and "dignity another rationed item" carry voice-specific compression. The single line of brief dialogue—Amira's declaration to the officer—is purposeful and advances plot. Two deductions: Sami's question ("why the donors could not be thanked openly") carries "the sharpness of youth, loud even when whispered," a filter that tells affect rather than showing vocal register, and the phrase "authority of older faiths" briefly elevates diction beyond Amira's established voice at a key pivot. Otherwise, filter verbs are sparse and voice remains stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or pressure (bell's dual function, midnight pipeline, elder-runner pairing, decoy carts). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Three deductions: "she was gently persistent" is a label adjacent to showing; "the magic was fear turning into care" edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image; and the phrase "remembered songs" at the end of the elder-pairing beat is generic rather than sensorially specific. The loop check is clean—no paraphrase cycles or template cadence—and the final image (ringing in daylight, declaring together) is propulsive. Grammar and pronoun references are clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of anonymous mutual aid, elder-youth pairing, and a bell as both signal and symbol under sanctions is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template refugee-narrative beats. The arbor and midnight-run tactics feel particular to this setting and character rather than generic. Two deductions: the officer's retreat after perceiving the bell's "authority" leans on symbolic convenience rather than tactical consequence, and the "Quiet Fund" nickname plus posted thank-you letters echo familiar grassroots-organizing tropes without sharp transformation. The daylight bell-ring and satchel-filling-at-doorways offer fresh inflections that grow from prior particulars, lifting the piece above median but not into high-originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira's choices—building the midnight pipeline, pairing runners with elders, refusing to name donors, changing routes after the officer's warning, ringing the bell in daylight—drive every major turn. Her agency is legible in at least four distinct beats (food runs setup, pairing decision, officer confrontation, route-change/decoy tactic, daylight declaration) and shapes the closure image. The final bell-ring is a decision with visible cost (exposure risk) that crystallizes the collective stance. No penalty for Sami's presence; he functions as a trigger for Amira's choice to post letters, not as a parallel decision-maker. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bell appears in five distinct beats: opening (carried in satchel, ending arguments), Sami's question (rung "soft as a spoon on glass"), officer visit (visible, weighed in his gaze), and twice in the closure sequence (first daylight ring, collective declaration). Its function evolves from private signal to public declaration, reweighting meaning at the ending. The bell constrains tactics (must be used carefully to avoid attracting eyes) and charges the final image (daylight ring as defiant collective act). Early signal, multi-beat use, causal role (ending Sami's question, signaling the officer), and closure participation all present. Minor cap: the bell's "authority of older faiths" in the officer beat is described rather than dramatized through his reaction, slightly softening irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape stakes (extortion threat), tactics (tin box placement, no names recorded, thank-you letters to "Whoever Helped"), and the closure effect (anonymity as chorus, not absence). The concept is signaled early (tin box, folded bills counted by touch) and drives the officer confrontation and Sami's question. The satchel filling at doorways and the final "without names" declaration tie the concept directly to the ending. The middle beats—letters, rumor, officer inspection—all hinge on the anonymity mechanism. Early signal, multi-beat pressure, causal role, and closure linkage present. Minor deduction: the conceptual cost (ongoing exposure risk) is felt but not as sharply irreplaceable as elements with visible physical consequences.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is labeled early ("she was gently persistent") and demonstrated in two beats: the bell used to end Sami's argument without harshness, and the officer confrontation where she speaks in "amplified quiet...words small but impossible to ignore." The trait enables her to navigate conflict without escalation, altering tactics (soft bell-ring, quiet declaration). Cost is oblique—persistence under threat carries risk—but not foregrounded as a trade-off in a single pivotal beat. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is thematic (collective declaration echoes her persistence) rather than causally decisive. Two-gate eligibility (~6.0 neighborhood); additive for modest causal role and beat involvement, but swappable with "diplomatically firm" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Declare" drives three major turns: Amira declares the fund belongs to the hungry (officer confrontation), she declares gratitude can be public while identities stay hidden (Sami's question), and the elders and young declare together at closure. Each use redefines options—first deflects inspection, second creates the letter tactic, third crystallizes collective stance with felt cost. The action is irreplaceable: "announce" or "state" would lack the public, staked quality that charges these beats. Early involvement, multi-beat causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present. Minor cap: the third "declare" in the final sentence is the only one with full dramatized physical presence (daylight bell-ring); the first two are reported speech, slightly lowering embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled early ("built a different pipeline through midnight food runs"), shape tactics across multiple beats (young volunteers, elder guides, sleepier guards), and drive the climactic route-change when the officer threatens midnight inspection. The method supplies the dramatic question (can they evade exposure?) and the closure image builds on its success (satchel returns heavier, daylight declaration follows). Mechanics matter: truck timing, guard shifts, cart choreography, and decoy/elder-guided split all hinge on the midnight constraint. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Minor deduction: the actual mechanics of one run (alley navigation, chalk stars, doorway handoffs) are compressed into summary rather than fully dramatized in real time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors spatial continuity across all major beats: opening frame, tin box location, letter posting, officer confrontation, and daylight bell-ring closure. Its elevation and visibility create exposure risk (officer climbs the ridge; daylight ring is a public act) that shapes tactics (midnight runs shift away from it; decoys protect it). The arbor's "pocket of wind and warm clay smell" seeds sensory signature; its recurrence charges the final image. Early signal, multi-beat presence, constraint role (visibility forces route changes), and closure linkage all present. Minor deduction: the arbor's specific material (terra-cotta) and topography (ridge above port) are described but not leveraged for unique tactical affordances—wood or stone structure on any hill would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sanctions tighten decisions throughout: food lines empty by noon, dignity is rationed, generosity invites extortion, authorities punish aid. The timeframe shapes stakes (ongoing scarcity, indefinite threat) and tactics (midnight runs exploit timing, decoys respond to inspection schedule). The officer's warning of a future midnight inspection and the final "until sanctions ended" frame the endurance cost. Present in setup, middle escalation (rumor, inspection), and closure (collective declaration of persistence). Two deductions: the sanctions period is a condition rather than a live countdown, so urgency is steady rather than accelerating, and the ending's "until sanctions ended" gestures toward off-page resolution rather than crystallizing time-pressure in the final image. Strong thematic cost, modest causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Intergenerational support is Amira's stated desire ("she wanted intergenerational support") and drives the key tactic of pairing every midnight runner with an elder storyteller. This motivation is dramatized in action (pairing decision, carts rolling home with bread and songs, elder-guided alleys, thank-you letters from elders) and tested under pressure (officer threat forces reliance on elders' local knowledge). The closure—elders and young declaring together—directly fulfills the motivation with visible cost (ongoing exposure, collective risk). Friction between want and cost is present but modest: Amira's competence means the pairing succeeds without major setback. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal role, and closure linkage present. Minor deduction: the motivation is told ("she wanted") before being fully shown in choice under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named early ("the amplified quiet she had mastered") and sustained across tonal beats: the bell's "dull chime" versus sirens, lowered voices at meetings, the officer met with "words small but impossible to ignore," midnight deliveries "in silence," and the daylight bell-ring that breaks the quiet as collective declaration. Tone modulates with pressure—opening stillness, rising threat at the officer visit, tactical silence during the route-change, and final amplification—without losing coherence. The final image (daylight bell, voices declaring together) reweights quiet as charged collective power rather than fearful suppression. Early signal, multi-beat modulation, causal role (quiet enables anonymity and stealth), and closure charge all present. High integration; tone is indispensable to the story's central dynamic.</comment>
