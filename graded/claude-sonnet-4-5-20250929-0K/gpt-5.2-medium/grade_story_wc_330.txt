<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's interior life is richly embodied through his relationship with silence and his craft, with micro-choices (taking the wrong turn, touching the fragment to the wound) that reveal hierarchy of values. The trait "quietly persistent" manifests through his hands and breath rather than exposition. Minor weakness: the final epiphany about silence as craft material edges toward articulated wisdom rather than pure dramatization, though it remains anchored in the physical act of repair and singing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the journey into darkness, discovery of the oasis, repair of the horse, and culminates in the singing that transforms silence into a craft medium. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rowan leading the mended horse toward the junction with the train stirring carries visible cost—his voice returns not as speech but as shaped breath, and the train's readiness to "carry new possibilities" reconfigures the abandoned space. The wrong-turn choice meaningfully narrows options and the halo fragment's use at the wound creates causal pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (carpenter, train, marsh).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the repair choice by casting "a faint ring of light that showed every grain of wood as if it were a map." The oasis hidden within the train's ribcage provides water that loosens the misting hush, directly altering Rowan's capacity. Wind bells sewn from bottle caps and the marsh-train environment are filtered through Rowan's silent carpenter perspective. Spatial choreography (corridor, junction, unlit car, oasis, crate) tracks cleanly across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence as possibility after it ruined his life) signals early and tightens when Rowan chooses the wrong turn over the exit, a decision with immediate risk. The repair work deepens pressure: using the fragment transforms the task from routine carpentry into a threshold moment. Singing—shaped breath rather than words—becomes the protagonist's agency that forecloses the old relationship with silence. The cost is visible: his voice returns not as speech but as a constrained medium, and the train stirs in response, reweighting what "possibility" means.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (silence as craft material rather than absence) emerges through the halo fragment's whispering gleam, the repair work, and the final singing without words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Rowan's note threads through chimes and the misting hush carries it rather than smothering it, proving silence can be shaped. No moralizing; the insight is earned through shaving and fitting slats by that pale light. The fragment "waited for someone who would listen with his hands" avoids abstraction by anchoring metaphor in the concrete repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: silence registered as "pressure on the tongue," bells as "commas in a sentence he might finish," and the hush as tangible material. Diction remains within Rowan's lexical range (carpenter terms, physical perception). The phrase "inside that chime" and "whispering gleam" sustain a distinct rhythmic texture. Minor slip: "a secret route" and "ribcage" metaphors occasionally drift toward elevated figuration, but the effect remains voice-motivated and legible under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: nearly every sentence advances the journey, discovery, or repair. Rhythm modulates well from the opening's lyric cadence to the tighter repair sequence. Two frictions: "quietly persistent about interpreting it as possibility" in the opening edges toward abstract summary, and the phrase "every rivet and rope suggest a secret route" stacks metaphor without adding clarity. The final beat ("the abandoned circus train stirred as if ready to carry new possibilities") recycles "possibilities" from the opening, creating a purposeful echo but risking redundancy. No loops or scaffold elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent carpenter, halo fragment as tool, and carousel repair within an abandoned train offers a fresh angle on restoration narratives. The wrong-turn logic (seeking water through deliberate error) and singing without words transform familiar silence-as-disability tropes. Risk-taking: the misting hush as physical craft material and the oasis hidden in the train's frame commits fully to a surreal premise without retreat. The specific detail of wind bells sewn from bottle caps and the fragment showing wood grain as a map elevates above generic quirk by directly enabling the repair.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan (silent carousel carpenter) is present from the opening, makes the pivotal wrong-turn choice at the junction, performs the repair work using the fragment, and sings to complete the transformation. His silence constrains tactics (he interprets via hands and tools) and his choices create all major turns. The final act of leading the mended horse out closes the arc. Present in setup, middle development (repair), and payoff (singing); causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (wedged behind the cracked panel), is handled when Rowan lifts it and the bells ring brighter, then used at the repair to cast light that shows wood grain as a map, and implicitly powers the singing that produces the full halo above the horse. Three distinct beats (discovery, repair, singing) with escalating function. Its unique property (showing grain as map) is irreplaceable. Closure linkage strong: the fragment enables the transformation and the halo's appearance crowns the repair.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The misting hush (core concept) is present throughout: Rowan senses it as "pressure on the tongue" in the engine room, the air thickens in the unlit car, drinking loosens it, and at the end it carries his note rather than smothering it. It constrains his tactics (he cannot speak; he interprets via sensation) and the oasis water's effect on the hush enables the singing. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how drinking water loosens a hush is implied rather than causally specified. Present in setup, middle (oasis), and payoff (singing); shapes stakes but one step short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" (attribute) is demonstrated rather than merely labeled: Rowan walks the corridor following faint tremor, takes the wrong turn despite knowing the safer exit, works by the fragment's gleam with "quietly persistent patience," and threads his note through the chimes. The trait constrains his approach (no loud declarations, steady craft work) and enables the repair and singing. Present in the opening character frame, visible in the wrong-turn choice and repair work, and implicit in the final singing beat. Cost: his persistence after the old circus burned and his voice went with it is framed as endurance that now yields possibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Singing (action) is the climax: Rowan "began to sing, not with words, but with a low note shaped by breath." The note threads through chimes, the hush carries it, and the water becomes a trembling mirror where a full halo appears. This act is causally essential—the repair alone does not complete the transformation; the singing activates the fragment's power and proves silence as craft material. Present in payoff and directly shapes closure; the train stirs "still singing" as he leads the horse out. Not swappable; humming or speaking would not carry the same stakes given his silence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wrong turn leading to hidden oasis (method) is signaled early via the scratched warning "Take the wrong turn, if you want water," chosen at the junction when Rowan steps into the unlit car instead of following EXIT, and pays off with the oasis where he drinks and finds the wounded horse. The method matters: taking the safe turn would not yield the oasis, water, or repair opportunity. Causal pressure across setup (warning), middle (choice at junction), and payoff (oasis discovery). The mechanics are legible and the dare "offered by silence itself" ties method to theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train (setting) is present throughout, provides the corridor and junction that force the wrong-turn choice, houses the crates with carousel horses, and its broken frame roofs the hidden oasis "like a ribcage." The engine room holds the brass pipes and misting hush. At closure, "the abandoned circus train stirred as if ready to carry new possibilities," reweighting its abandonment. The setting constrains Rowan's path (narrow corridor, split junction) and supplies the resources (fragment behind panel, horse in crate, oasis within structure). Indispensable to logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" (timeframe) frames the story: bells hang from the awning, Rowan walks "inside that chime," smaller bells sewn from bottle caps mark the unlit car, and "wind bells marked each step inside their chime" at the end. The chime functions as temporal envelope and auditory atmosphere. However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Rowan moves at his own pace. The bells' chiming brightens when he lifts the fragment and at the end they "mark" his steps, but the timeframe itself does not constrain tactics. Lyric reprise (first paragraph to final beat) reweights meaning but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To interpret silence as possibility" (motivation) is stated early ("silence had ruined his life once, and now he was quietly persistent about interpreting it as possibility") and dramatized through all major choices: following the faint tremor, taking the wrong turn, using the fragment to repair, and singing without words. The oasis beat makes the friction visible: "he understood why he had been drawn here"—the wounded horse represents the work silence demands. At closure, "silence was not an absence but a craft material" completes the arc. Desire is conflicted (silence ruined him; he seeks possibility within it) and every choice tests that interpretation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" (tone) is established in the opening ("a whispering gleam on metal"), sustained through "the pale shard cast a faint ring of light," "working by that whispering gleam," and recurs implicitly in the singing ("a low note shaped by breath") and the trembling mirror. The tone modulates under pressure: quiet and patient during the repair, then charged when the halo appears and the train stirs. Coherent across all turns and the final image of Rowan "still singing" leading the horse out maintains the hushed, luminous register. The tone directly charges the closure.</comment>
