<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is embodied through breath-counting and palm-to-wall grounding, creating genuine internal friction. Her motivation to honor Ken is concrete and drives her through measurable cost (terror in the gap). The brother remains off-page, so relational pressure is indirect but the grief-versus-duty calculus shapes every choice. Minor slip: "tried to turn into a shout" reads slightly abstract where a more visceral rendering would sharpen the contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tide window forces entry, claustrophobia resists, codex page guides navigation, reactor coil enables passage, cable repair completes Ken's work. Closure lands on-page with Mara routing Ken's log along the repaired cable—a Decisive Change that restores the link and memorializes him. Cost is visible: she endured terror, risked drowning in vapor, and physically clamped the joint. Orientation anchors promptly (sea cliff, Mara, tidal window). One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor forces phase transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The facility's salt-crusted consoles, wet copper smell, and pressure-lock chamber constrain every move. The reactor coil becomes micro-setting: its warming hum and fog-without-bubbles enable the impossible passage, and Mara's body (shoulders in the gap, condensation on lashes) is the terrain she navigates. The codex page's gold fleck physically tracks the cable's field, guiding her to the terminal. The crashing-hush surf marks time and frames the final return to ordinary sound, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the cable to honor Ken and prevent the coast's erasure—is clear from paragraph four. Tidal clock and claustrophobia apply persistent pressure. One major tightening: the collapsed corridor forces the phase-transition gambit, narrowing options to vapor-passage or retreat. Agency is pure: Mara chooses to enter the gap, power the coil, clamp the joint, and route the log. Cost is visible (terror, physical exertion, foreclosed safety) and scales appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of standing by the unremembered emerges through Mara's concrete choices rather than assertion. The "phase mouth" concept—matter and signal changing state—resonates in her brother's vanishing, the cable's invisible traffic, and her own passage through solid-to-vapor space. The looping shadow and Ken's stranded log become particulars that charge the ending: she restores the link and his name without moralizing. The final line's shift from "crashing hush" to "ordinary surf" reweights the opening image with earned quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored in Mara's sensory bias (wet copper = Ken's voicemail; gold fleck crawl = invisible tug she cannot feel). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "slick rocks," "throat of stone," "tired animals," "white fog that made the passage feel less solid." Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue, so subtext lives in action and image. The phrase "measuring the distance to daylight like a debt" and "terror crowded her ribs" demonstrate distinct perceptual signature and embodied interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high: nearly every line advances situation, character texture, or world logic. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the gap passage ("Terror crowded her ribs" / "the world itself had loosened"). Figurative language is sparse and functional: "throat of stone," "tired animals," "stranded fish." The codex-page mechanism and phase-transition process are clear without scaffold. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the title phrase with cost. Minor note: "as if it wanted to keep its own secrets" leans slightly decorative but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of undersea-cable infrastructure, claustrophobia, phase-state physics, and grief over an unremembered sibling feels specific and non-obvious. The codex-page tracker and reactor-coil vapor passage avoid stock genre moves. Emotional logic—standing by the forgotten even when they stood by nobody—is particular to Mara and resists tidy moral. Risk: the piece commits fully to its premise and follows the phase-transition metaphor through to closure. Slight pull toward template in the "monitoring undersea cables" setup, but the lived detail (salt crystals, gold-fleck crawl, boiling-without-bubbles) transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia creates the story's central friction and her decisions—entering the throat, counting breaths, forcing herself into the gap, powering the coil, clamping the joint—drive every major turn. Removing her trait or agency would collapse the plot. She appears early, shapes the middle passage, and completes the cable repair at closure. High specificity: the breath-counting and palm-press are enacted on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The codex page with gold fleck appears in paragraph eleven, guides Mara through two beats (first chamber wall, then terminal slot), and enables the closure by translating the cable field into the looping-shadow map. It is handled physically (unfolded, watched, inserted) and its unique property—tracking invisible charge—cannot be swapped. Cost: without it she could not locate the break or route Ken's log. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Undersea cables frame the facility's purpose, drive Ken's research and vanishing, create the story's dominant stake (repair the trunk to restore the coast's link), supply the tactical problem (collapsed pressure lock at the cable entry), and deliver the closure action (Mara routes Ken's log along the repaired line). The concept shapes every major choice and the final image. Removing cables would erase plot, setting logic, and thematic resonance. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gold fleck's ability to track invisible charge enables two key beats: it pulls toward the southern wall, revealing the cable entry behind rubble, and later maps the looping shadow at the break. This attribute is signaled early and constrains navigation choices. Cost: without the tracking property Mara could not locate the fault or understand Ken's discovery. Solid causal work and closure participation, though slightly less indispensable than the cables themselves.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Return structures the entire narrative: Mara returns to the cave where Ken vanished, returns his codex page to its function, and returns Ken's log to the world by routing it along the cables. The action defines her motivation, drives the tidal-window urgency, and provides the closure beat (restoring the link completes the return). The story's logic and emotional arc hinge on this exact action. Removing "return" would require a fundamental rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear early in Ken's term "phase mouth" (paragraph ten), govern the central problem (shifting water to vapor to pass the collapsed corridor), and are enacted on-page when Mara powers the reactor coil to boil water "without bubbles" into white fog, then later dries and cools the cable joint. The method is signaled, taught mechanically, and delivers the climactic passage and repair. Removing phase transitions breaks the plot's solution path. Indispensable with visible cost and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility supplies the spatial structure (rusted consoles, pressure lock, collapsed corridor), the tidal access constraint, the reactor coil Mara uses, and the terminal where she completes the repair. Setting pressures every choice: narrow throat triggers claustrophobia, flooded rubble forces phase transition, the CABLE HEART terminal enables closure. The facility's abandonment ties directly to Mara's motivation. Removing this exact setting would collapse tactics and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal window is announced in paragraph two, creates urgency for entry, and implicitly clocks the repair sequence ("between the next set of tides"). The timeframe forces Mara's choices and adds a persistent constraint. It does not appear at closure to tighten the final beat, and the piece does not dramatize the rising water as immediate threat during the repair. Solid causal pressure in setup and middle, but closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Standing by the unremembered drives Mara's entry despite claustrophobia, shapes her refusal to let Ken become "just another unremembered name," and provides the emotional charge for routing his log at closure. The motivation is announced in paragraph five and tested in every beat where terror could force retreat. Friction between the desire to honor Ken and the bodily cost of confined space creates authentic tension. Removing this exact motive would hollow the stakes and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crashing hush opens the story ("as if it wanted to keep its own secrets"), recurs as "softer drum" during Mara's breath-counting, and resolves in the final line when the "crashing hush outside soften[s] into ordinary surf." The tone is coherent—quiet, restrained, textured by salt and copper—and modulates under pressure (white fog, looped shadow) without breaking voice. The tonal shift at closure reweights the opening image with cost and accomplishment, charging the ending.</comment>
