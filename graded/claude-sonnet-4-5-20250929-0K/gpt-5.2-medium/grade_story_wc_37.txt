<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's core motivation (save the realm through weaving) is clear and her gift/wound mechanic (trading memories) creates authentic internal friction. The swaddling choice at the climax demonstrates agency under pressure with visible cost—memories return as payment. However, interiority often operates at high abstraction ("scattered memory keeper," "bound release") without embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Marrow and the infants remain functional props rather than pressure sources, and the grandmother's teaching arrives as pure backstory rather than complicating present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure—the woven dawn transforms from private craft to communal infrastructure, reweighting the premise with visible social cost (Lysa leaves borrowed yesterdays as promises to return). One meaningful deepening occurs when the night "fights back" and Lysa feels "bound release," tightening pressure before the mica-window breakthrough. Cost is legible in the final image: she remains scattered but chooses her losses with open eyes. Minor causality slip: the infants' arrival and the specific mechanism by which wrapping them returns Lysa's memories are under-motivated, reading slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vividly rendered ("mercury apples and salt pears under lamps that mimicked noon") and the mica window constrains the final breakthrough, charging the closure image when dawn "spills into streets and orchards." Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, spatial choreography remains impressionistic—distances, door mechanics, and the relationship between greenhouse interior and exterior hamlets are vague, and the "endless night above" fighting back is metaphorically resonant but physically unclear. The mirror world timeframe is declared but never pressures choices or supplies concrete constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm through communal dawn) is signaled early and agency is present—Lysa chooses to weave for villages rather than princes, and her singing pulls the necessary thread. One meaningful tightening occurs when the night "tightens like a collar" during weaving, and the swaddling choice narrows options by binding fragile light to infants. Cost is visible: she trades her own memories and leaves some borrowed yesterdays behind. Weakness: the escalation reads more as accumulation than true pressure—no live resistance, failed attempt, or tactical shift tests Lysa's commitment; the night's opposition is atmospheric rather than forcing adaptive choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the particulars of communal versus private remedy and the trade between personal wholeness and collective need. The final image—woven dawns as communal banners, light that "made room to speak" sorrows together—offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The mica window's return at closure reweights its earlier introduction as mere observation point into active threshold. Minor slip: "bound release" is asserted as craft logic but remains conceptually abstract rather than dramatized through a specific micro-choice that shows binding and releasing in simultaneous tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping; focalization through Lysa is consistent and her perceptual signature (memory keeper carrying "lost yesterdays in pockets of paper bark") is distinct. Narrative distance modulates purposefully during the weaving sequence. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("bound release," "realms thinning like smoke," "mirrors of light caught each other") that flattens immediacy during peak beats. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing images frame effectively. Information density is high in many beats (mica window introduction, loom description, swaddling sequence). Critical weakness: pervasive template cadence and figurative density in peak beats. The weaving sequence stacks abstract metaphors ("glimmers from the mica window and from the chemists tired eyes, turning those glimmers into thread that warmed her fingers like breath held too long") without clear physical grounding, and the climax deploys mixed registers ("opening a seam where dawn could spill") that blur tactile logic. Minor paraphrase loop: "bound release" and "binding the darkness...promising to release the light" restate without adding pressure. Filter-verb stacks and elevated diction in high-pressure beats dull immediacy and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-keeping, weaving, and communal dawn as antidote to endless night is conceptually fresh and the choice to prioritize villages over princes adds moral specificity. The mica window as layered threshold and the swaddling-as-teaching mechanism show imaginative detail. However, the mirror-world frame and "memory keeper" archetype trend familiar, and the core plot (craft-hero saves dying realm through artifact creation) follows a recognizable template without sharp transformation. The ending's communal emphasis and Lysa's chosen incompleteness provide a non-obvious moral calculus that partially offsets derivative scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa as scattered memory keeper is present throughout, frames her wound/gift mechanic early, and drives the key weaving choice (communal cloth vs. private scarf). Her decisions—stepping to the loom, swaddling infants, carrying the bolt to the mica window—create tactical turns and the closure hinges on her choosing losses with open eyes. The memory-trade mechanism enables the swaddling payoff and the final reconfiguration. Strong causal role across beats and closure; cost is tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mica window appears early (Lysa presses her eye there, sees her older self), returns at the climax (she holds the bolt up to align threads with its veins), and the "two mirrors of light caught each other" mechanism opens the seam for dawn. The object constrains the final breakthrough and is handled in two distinct beats. Cost and specificity: its layered veins are unique properties that matter. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the weaving itself could theoretically succeed without the window, but close.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Woven dawns are the story's engine: Marrow begs Lysa to knit communities together via dawn cloth, the weaving scene dramatizes the craft pulling glimmers into thread, strips of cloth swaddle infants to teach them sunrise, and the finished bolt at the mica window rekindled the realm. The concept shapes stakes, tactics, and the final image. Removing it would collapse the plot. Present across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is dramatized when Marrow asks Lysa to make "a single dawn cloth for every village, not a private scarf for princes," and the ending shows neighbors bound "into one sheltering cloth." The attribute constrains Lysa's choice and the resolution turns on communal versus private remedy. Cost is conceptual but legible: she leaves borrowed yesterdays as promises to return. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implicit rather than tested by a friction or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Swaddling appears explicitly when "Marrow brought infants...and Lysa swaddled them in strips of the woven dawn" and each wrapping triggers a memory return. The action enables the middle payoff (her mother's voice restored) and grounds the communal-teaching mechanism. It shapes two beats and contributes to thematic closure. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the dawn could spread without infant swaddling, but the action is causally active and carries symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are seeded early ("learned the pattern as a child...through forgotten songs the elders hummed") and become the active method at the loom: "Lysa stepped to the loom and began to sing, and the forgotten song did what alchemy could not, pulling glimmers...into thread." The method is signaled, matters in the weaving beat, and the grandmother's melody returns at closure when Lysa remembers her mother singing "the same melody over a cradle." Present across all three gates with causal work; specificity is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse is established early with vivid detail (mercury apples, salt pears, lamps that mimicked noon, endless night on the roof), houses the loom, and supplies the mica window and the spatial frame for the weaving. The chemists and infants arrive there, and the dawn races outward "through the grafted roots into every village canal." The setting enables multiple beats and the final spread. Not quite indispensable—story logic could survive a different location—but it pressures atmosphere, supplies the micro-setting, and charges tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" is declared in the opening line and establishes tone and rule-set (rivers run backward, promises echo twice). The mirror logic resurfaces when Lysa sees her older self in the mica window and when "the two mirrors of light caught each other." The timeframe shapes conceptual atmosphere and the mica-window mechanism, but it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but minimal tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation to rekindle the dying realm is explicit ("the realm was dying from a dawn that had never arrived") and dramatized through Lysa's journey to the greenhouse, her weaving under pressure, and the final dawn spreading. The desire is tested by the memory-trade cost and the night's resistance. Friction between want (save the realm) and cost (scatter her own memories, remain incomplete) is visible. Strong causal role across beats and closure; felt cost ties directly to the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bound release is asserted as Lysa's craft logic ("each new strand bound the darkness in place while promising to release the light it had stolen") and tonally coheres through the tension between constraint (swaddling, binding neighbors) and freedom (dawn spilling, walking unafraid). The tone modulates with pressure during the weaving and charges the final image when Lysa "chose her losses with open eyes...releasing each of them to walk unafraid." Present and purposeful, though the concept remains more abstract than embodied in micro-choices that show simultaneous binding and releasing.</comment>
