<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nara's agency is clear: she rejects implanted destiny and seeks evolution through understanding. The micro-choice network is strong—her instruction to gather reeds, the decoding collaboration, the intentional imprinting story at the unsealing. Interior state is embodied (tight braids as coded orders, the single surprised laugh) but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under peak pressure; her calm throughout is consistent but never shows competing desires wrestling in scene. The protagonist's final witness-and-counterweight role grows from dramatized events but remains somewhat passive at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 5. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the embryo's transformation into a salamander that "lived in the hot spring channels and kept the water clean" reweights the premise of implanted destiny with conceptual cost—the oracle-program is undone. Felt cost is present: tradition's weapon becomes repair's servant, and the aftermath shows systematic change (teaching children to decode together). One meaningful deepening occurs through the kite-tail decode sequence. Minor slip: the lens wobbles slightly between causal logic and lyric accumulation, but holds at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs are anchored early and recur with purpose: sulfur heat enables the unsealing steps, the "ground hummed like a drum," workers use the garden beds where the salamander moves. Micro-setting (amber, pool lip that burns palms, tamarisk tree) constrains the unsealing action. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("steam rose in curtains," "soot colored thread"). One slip: spatial choreography occasionally drifts—the exact positions of Nara and the narrator during the pool scene lack precise tracking. The salamander's final movement toward garden beds charges the ending image with the springs as ongoing site of repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent weaponized destiny from recurring. Pressure builds through the plant-communication discovery, then tightens when the decode reveals imprinting risk ("the embryo would imprint on the first will it sensed"). Agency is clear: Nara chooses the narrator as "witness and counterweight" and speaks her story to rewrite the script. The unsealing sequence is a visible, on-page turn that forecloses the oracle path with felt cost (the priests' relic is destroyed/transformed). One brief micro-turn when the salamander crawls toward the garden. No explicit antagonist but the weight of tradition and the relic's latent program supply coherent opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—tradition as tool, destiny must be chosen, repair over command—emerges from concrete action: Nara's rebellion history, the decode collaboration with plants, the salamander outcome, kite-teaching afterward. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: implanted destiny is rewritten into voluntary repair. Subtext operates in images (tight braids, broken temple on ridge, new road) and the salamander's choice to move toward food gardens rather than pronouncements. Minor slip: "tradition was a tool, that destiny must be chosen" is spoken aloud by Nara at the unsealing, edging toward articulated thesis. The surrounding action and plant-echo pulse ("approval") earn the insight, but the line itself hovers near a thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with tight focus on the narrator (grandchild). Voice is distinct: lyric compression, purposeful sentence fragments ("Stone roads over ash and called it peace"), controlled rhythm. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during plant-communication moments, wider during Nara's history. Nara's dialogue ("that was why the priests used newborns, because newborns have no will yet") carries subtext but reads slightly expository at the peak beat. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. The prose compresses time smoothly ("For weeks the springs were crowded…") and the final paragraph's shift to summary fits the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance world, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer lyric sentences at setup, tighter syntax at the unsealing. Minor loop: "The crystal did not guide her; it commanded her" and later "a life with a future written inside it" restate the implanted-control premise without added pressure—one paraphrase instance, −0.2. Template cadence appears in the opening third: repeated "Nara [past action]" stems across three lines, −0.4. Figurative language (steam as curtains, ground hums like drum, moss remembers) is consistent and voice-motivated. No major clarity breaks. Propulsion is strong through the decode and unsealing; the final two paragraphs summarize months but fit the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core synthesis—psychic plant communication enabling anti-authoritarian tradition revision via cryptic script and embryonic oracle transformation—is specific and non-obvious. The volcanic setting, grandmother insurgent, and the embryo-to-salamander outcome feel purposefully integrated rather than assembled from tropes. Transformation test passes: swapping hot springs for another locale or plants for another communication method would require structural rewrites. The kite-tail as cipher and moss-as-memory are fresh inflections. Minor predictability: the "destiny must be chosen" theme and the grandmother-teaches-community epilogue follow familiar arcs. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the quiet salamander ending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nara (insurgent grandmother) appears in beat one (watching from scaffold), drives the decode and unsealing choices, speaks her counter-story to rewrite the embryo, and teaches kite-decoding in the epilogue. Her past rebellion frames the stakes and her present choices create both key turns. Causal pressure: she selects the narrator as counterweight, follows the decoded steps, and voices the repair ethos that transforms the outcome. Setup early, involved in three distinct beats (assignment, decode, unsealing), shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embryo in amber: introduced at ~25% ("The relic was an embryo in amber"), handled during the unsealing sequence with heat/steam/shade steps, unseals on-page, and its transformation into the salamander is the closure pivot. Appears in four beats: reveal under rock, the decode warning about imprinting, the unsealing action, and the salamander outcome. Irreplaceable: the amber's sealing/unsealing mechanics and the embryo's program are the story's hinge. Visible cost: the priests' oracle path is foreclosed. High closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Implanted destiny: introduced early (crystal pressed into Nara's skin, "commanded her"), drives the dominant stake (prevent recurrence), supplies the decode's central warning (imprinting), and the unsealing tests whether destiny can be rewritten. Shapes tactics: Nara chooses witness-and-counterweight strategy, speaks her counter-narrative, and the salamander's voluntary repair role embodies the revised concept. Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure transformation. Strong causal pressure and specificity; the concept is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accidentally telepathic with plants: appears at ~20% (reeds answer), enables the decode collaboration (moss remembers patterns, reeds supply beats, plants lean in at unsealing), and the plant-echo pulse signals approval of Nara's story. Constrains method: only the narrator can access plant knowledge needed for the script. Cost is light but present: the trait binds the narrator into the counterweight role. Involved in two key beats (discovery, decode) and present at closure. Setup slightly late but functional; causal work is clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unseal" is the major turn: the unsealing at the hottest pool is the story's climax, dramatized with the heat/steam/shade steps, the amber opening "like a mouth," and the embryo's transformation. The action redefines all prior options: the oracle program is rewritten into repair. Shapes the ending directly: salamander emerges and moves toward gardens. Present in the decode warning, executed on-page as the peak beat, and consequences land in the epilogue. Irreplaceable; swapping for another action (destroy, hide, study) would break the story's logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Decoding cryptic script on abandoned kite tail: kite appears at ~40% (storm, tamarisk snag), the tail carries the script in soot thread, and moss/reeds decode it into heat/silence steps and the imprinting warning. Method shapes the middle beat and makes the unsealing possible. Two-gate: middle development (decode) and setup of closure steps, but the kite itself does not reappear or reweight at the ending—only its decoded result matters. Functional and specific, but the kite-as-vessel is somewhat replaceable (message could arrive via another medium). Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs: present from line 4 ("village clung to the volcanic hot springs"), supply the sacred/sealed tradition context, provide the hottest pool used for unsealing ("sulfur bubbled and the stone lip burned our palms"), and house the salamander afterward ("lived in the hot spring channels and kept the water clean"). Setting constrains the unsealing method (requires heat) and charges the ending (repair occurs in the same sacred site). Setup early, middle tactics depend on it, closure outcome is spatially anchored there. Micro-setting (pool, channels, garden beds) alters the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>During the reconstruction: timeframe is established in line 1 ("During the reconstruction, the new council laid stone roads"), frames Nara's lived victory and the peace she wants to evolve, and the masons/healers crowding the springs signal ongoing rebuilding. The epilogue's "months that followed" shows continuity. Time does not create urgency or tighten a countdown, but it supplies thematic weight: the story occurs in a post-war repair window where tradition can be rethought. Setup and thematic integration present; no direct causal pressure on tactics. Mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To evolve tradition with intent": Nara's motivation is stated at ~15% ("she wanted to evolve tradition with intent, not let it evolve people by accident"), dramatized through her choice to decode the relic's script rather than destroy or blindly unseal, and enacted in her counter-story at the unsealing and kite-teaching afterward. Friction is present: the risk that the embryo will imprint on emptiness or conquest creates tension, and the choice to use the narrator as counterweight shows the cost of the method. Shapes two beats (decode decision, unsealing) and the thematic closure. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>
