<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motives (rescuing trapped readers, honoring her grandmother's quest) are clear and her "carefully resourceful" trait shows in selective tool use and negotiation tactics. Her choice to renegotiate rather than pay in memories demonstrates character-driven agency. However, interiority remains thin—emotional stakes are declared ("the diary...hummed like a missing note") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final act of "offering a correction" resolves smoothly without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a credible alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (mountain bookstore, Lysa, Orren's warning) and the narrative follows a clear causal thread: warning → descent → trapped readers → negotiation → vault → escape. The closure—freed readers departing with unfinished stories and Orren gaining "future-tense grammar"—qualifies as Decisive Change with a conceptual cost (the mountain rearranges, lessons now learnable). Yet the escalation is primarily spatial (deeper into the store) rather than driven by protagonist agency narrowing options; Lysa's renegotiations succeed without meaningful friction, and the curator's transformation ("the dust-cloak thinned as if remembering breath") arrives through recitation rather than a hard-won trade-off. Lens: Causal with Accumulative overtones (the "unheard symphony" motif); closure holds under Causal but the path lacks a tightening that genuinely forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly realized through specific, purposeful detail: shelves breathing "in chords of paper and ink," a staircase of alphabets, books sprouting as seedlings in the BOTANY wing. Sensory selection (wet and green air, dust-cloak, pressed fern) grounds each beat and reflects Lysa's linguist lens. The botanical diary—a recurring object—constrains her path (matching the fern unlocks the corridor) and charges the final image (grammar copied beside pressed leaves). Spatial choreography remains coherent across descent and vault discovery, and the mountain's body as setting directly enables plot moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the library of unlearned lessons to enable future rescues—is signaled early and sustained. Lysa's twin renegotiations (clerk, curator) create local reversals that advance the goal. However, pressure does not meaningfully tighten: both negotiations succeed on first attempt without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The curator's demand to return captives is resolved by recitation of its origin story, not a choice with visible cost. The piece operates under a Causal lens but escalation is lateral (deeper exploration) rather than intensifying through protagonist sacrifice or error.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—lessons unlearned become traps; correction requires honoring omissions—emerges organically from the diary's skipped pages, the clerk's blank ledger lines, and the curator's forgotten identity. The "unheard symphony" motif recurs purposefully, shifting from atmospheric descriptor to diagnostic tool ("every silence aligned with a missing index entry") to resolution ("the unheard symphony finally resolved"). Lysa's act of inserting blank paper "where the story-lines broke" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material (rescue missions now arrive "before loss became law") through earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Lysa's linguist perspective ("the store's own syntax," "future-tense grammar"). Narrative distance is consistent and voice carries a distinct lyric register ("shelves breathing in chords," "Find what I could not"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Orren's lines ("in his timeline these readers died quietly") advance exposition without strain. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("the act of naming loosened a spell") in ways that flatten urgency, and perceptual signature—while present—does not degrade or sharpen under peak stress. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "By researching gaps in the clerk's ledgers, she pointed out blank lines where fees were waived" combines method, discovery, and negotiation tactic). However, template cadence appears in mid-section runs: "Lysa listened... Lysa opened... Lysa gathered... Lysa did not fight; she renegotiated" creates a repetitive subject–verb pattern across six consecutive beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("dust-cloak thinned as if remembering breath") and minor filter stacks ("listened to," "realized," "noticed") dull immediacy in pressure moments. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but density and propulsion sag mid-sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-travel rescue missions, sentient archive, and linguist-as-hero offers a fresh angle on library-quest tropes. Lysa's twin toolkit—grammar negotiation and botanical diary—feels specific to this story, and the conceit that unfinished books trap readers by withholding closure is clever and thematically integrated. The curator's arc (jailer remembering it was once a teacher) and the "library of unlearned lessons" hidden by omission rather than walls show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric "unheard symphony" frame elevates tone without obscuring clarity. Some elements (receipt-man clerk, "future-tense grammar") skirt whimsy but remain anchored in the story's internal logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa (arcane linguist) drives every major turn: she renegotiates with the clerk, matches the fern to unlock the passage, ties unfinished books with twine, renegotiates with the curator, and copies the future-tense grammar. Her skill set shapes tactics at each beat and her final action directly enables the rescue-mission correction. Present from the opening and causally active in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary is handled in three distinct beats: Lysa carries it (setup), matches its pressed fern to a living frond (unlocks corridor, middle turn), and copies future-tense grammar beside its leaves (closure image). Its skipped pages ("Find what I could not") frame her quest and its final use reweights the grandmother's legacy. Irreplaceable; the story's logic hinges on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rescue missions are the stated stake (Orren warns they "would soon fail unless someone found the library") and the vault discovery yields "future-tense grammar that could guide Orren's rescue missions to arrive before loss became law." The concept shapes motive and closure payoff. However, no on-page rescue attempt is dramatized; the piece operates one step removed, gathering tools for future missions rather than enacting one under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is demonstrated through selective packing (lamp, twine, diary) and tactical choices (renegotiation over memory payment, using twine to mark directions and bind books). The trait constrains her approach—she does not brute-force or pay recklessly—but no visible cost is tied to this carefulness. The attribute is functional but not charged with trade-off pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Renegotiate defines two pivotal turns: Lysa stops Orren from offering a childhood and rewrites the clerk's contract by citing blank ledger lines; later she offers the curator "a correction" by reciting its origin story. Both acts hinge on this exact verb—persuasion through syntax and gap-finding—and would collapse if swapped for combat or payment. The action shapes the story's spine and reflects Lysa's vocational identity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" is signaled early (diary's skipped pages) and executed twice on-page: Lysa points out blank lines in the clerk's ledger and recites the missing line in the curator's origin. The method is specific and irreplaceable; the story's logic—omissions hold power—depends on this exact investigative lens. Present in setup, middle choice, and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is indispensable: it opens a door in response to the time traveler, its shelves breathe and turn into planters, the BOTANY staircase (each step a different alphabet) structures descent, and the maze "kept changing...to avoid being corrected." Setting supplies both obstacle (changing corridors) and resource (botanical seedlings, blank spines). Spatial progression drives escalation and the mountain's final chord rearranges passages for escape. The entire narrative arc is inseparable from this location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrived" frames the opening and closing, bookending the narrative. Orren's warning establishes urgency (missions "would soon fail"), but no live clock tightens decisions on the page. The timeframe is present as a before/after marker (world of wrong notes → symphony resolved) but does not constrain tactics or force tempo during the descent and negotiations.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the library of unlearned lessons—is established by Orren's warning, dramatized through Lysa's descent and negotiations, and fulfilled at the vault discovery. Her grandmother's diary adds personal weight ("Find what I could not"). The desire drives every choice and the ending confirms its achievement (future-tense grammar copied, rescue missions corrected). Friction arises from the store's resistance (clerk, curator) rather than internal conflict over the goal itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" tone—lyric, layered, attentive to pattern and silence—is coherent throughout: "shelves breathing in chords," silences aligned with missing index entries, readers' voices "like instruments tuning," and the final resolution ("the unheard symphony finally resolved"). Tone modulates with pressure (urgent negotiation, quiet vault discovery) and charges the closure image by fulfilling the metaphor's promise. The frame holds without static repetition or jarring breaks.</comment>
