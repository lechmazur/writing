<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's guilt and profession shape her arc, and the final choice to speak truth rather than deliver false memories shows earned transformation. Internal conflict between practiced erasure and confession drives the climax. However, the interiority often operates at high register ("sieved hush," "tempered regret") rather than embodied contradiction, and Jonah remains more recipient than pressure source—his dream of "faint ticking" and his choice to reject the capsule feel convenient rather than dramatically tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Mara confesses the withheld truth, Jonah rejects the false memory, and they walk toward shared acknowledgment with felt cost (her fear named, his grief chosen over polish). The piece teaches a causal lens early—guilt → black market work → discovery of her own surname → confession—and holds it through the ending. Orientation anchors (cobalt terrace, dusk, Mara waiting, Jonah arriving) arrive clearly within the first third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the driftwood dolphin reveals Mara's connection, narrowing her options and forcing the confession that forecloses her evasion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, dusk palette, and driftwood shore anchor mood and provide the archive mechanism. The watch hand as tactile object recurs and charges the rail moment. Spatial choreography is clean (terrace, balustrade, rail, walking down). However, the "forgotten shore" and "driftwood carvings" remain abstract—no texture of sand, salt, effort, or proximity that would constrain Mara's search or choice. The terrace does not pressure the confession; it is backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mara must decide whether to deliver the false memory or confess. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her surname on the dolphin carving, which narrows options and raises cost. The confession forces a visible trade-off—her practiced scripts crumble, fear of blame is named, professional complicity acknowledged—and Jonah's choice to reject the capsule adds a micro turn. Pressure coheres under the causal lens. However, Jonah's arrival and his question about hurt feel convenient rather than dramatized resistance; his agency is minimal until the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of complicity, erasure, and the weight of withheld truth emerges through concrete action: Mara's trade in false memories, the driftwood archive, the watch hand as talisman of silence, and the final plain-sentence confession. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant image—shared quiet replacing sieved quiet—that reweights the premise without stating a lesson. "Sieved hush" as metaphor recurs purposefully. Minor slip: "the weight of the withheld truth lifting because it had been spoken" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited on Mara throughout. Perceptual signature is present (genealogist's tracing lens, guilt-colored observations) and diction elevates consistently ("bruised ink," "sieved hush," "tempered regret"). Jonah's brief dialogue ("if she could promise it would not hurt," "faint ticking in his dreams") carries goal and subtext. However, the elevated register persists even under peak pressure—Mara "felt her practiced scripts crumble" rather than showing the crumble through stammering or silence—and the prose remains at one lyric distance throughout, which flattens urgency at the confession beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("guilt-ridden," "sieved hush," "shake truth through a mesh"). Information density is high; sentences layer backstory, motive, and world. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "the weight of a withheld truth" / "the weight of unspoken words" / "the weight of the withheld truth lifting"; "promised herself she would quell" echoes the prompt's "Action: quell" too closely. Template stems recur: "She realized…" / "She explained…" / "Mara watched…" The final paragraph summarizes the shift ("quiet that was no longer sieved but shared") rather than dramatizing it through gesture or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of black market genealogist, driftwood archive, false-memory capsules, and personal complicity offers a fresh frame. The watch hand as inherited silence and the driftwood dolphin discovery provide specific, non-obvious turns. Emotional honesty in Mara's fear and Jonah's choice to keep pain grounds the premise. However, the "guilt-ridden specialist discovers personal connection to client's tragedy" follows a recognizable template, and the driftwood-carving method (whittled names as archive) remains conceptually clever but underdeveloped in tactile detail that would make it feel lived-in rather than invented for the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as guilt-ridden black market genealogist drives setup (her trade explained), middle discovery (surname on dolphin), and closure (confession instead of capsule delivery). Her profession enables the false-memory service and the driftwood search; her guilt motivates the final truth-telling. The character is essential across all three beats and causally active at closure. Specificity is high: "selling clients a story they could live with," "tidy inconvenient branches."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in the first paragraph ("taken from her father's cracked timepiece the night she chose silence"), recurs in Mara's pocket as tactile reminder, and is drawn out at the terrace rail where "the wind threaten[s] to take it" before she confesses. It anchors her silence and the shared drowning. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its presence is symbolic rather than mechanically decisive. The final beat (returning it to the carvings at dawn) is promised, not enacted on-page, so closure linkage is partial.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is introduced early ("the kind of quiet that comes after you shake truth through a mesh until only safe dust remains") and reprised at closure ("quiet that was no longer sieved but shared"). It names the thematic stakes and charges the final image. However, the concept does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; it remains metaphorical frame rather than on-page mechanism. The lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not drive causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Manufactures false memories" is present in setup (the capsule Mara prepared, the service she helps run) and drives the central conflict: will she deliver the lie or tell the truth? The capsule is handed to Jonah and rejected, which shapes the ending. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"fabricated scenes slid into minds with the ease of moonlight on water"—and no on-page action demonstrates the manufacture process or its cost. The trait enables stakes but is not mechanically constrained or tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Quell" appears once in Mara's intention: "promising herself she would quell the noise in one last family." The action is invoked to frame her goal but does not recur or drive a turn. At closure, she does not quell but instead amplifies truth. The word feels prompt-imported rather than integrated; the ending's actual action—confess and walk together—supersedes the stated intention. Swappable with "resolve," "silence," or "end."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore") and drives the middle discovery: Mara finds the dolphin with her surname, which tightens the stakes and forces the confession. The carvings are described as "coastal clans that distrusted paper," charcoal-rubbed to "map kinship like constellations," and identified as the archive of the drowning night. The method enables both her profession and the personal revelation. The promised dawn return to the shore closes the arc. Mechanics matter and shape two beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk is introduced in the opening line and anchors the confession scene. Dusk coloring ("bruised ink") and the terrace rail (where the watch hand is set) provide atmospheric detail. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources—Mara could confess anywhere. The terrace is postcard frame rather than tactical crucible. The "forgotten shore" is promised for dawn but not enacted on-page, so it does not participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" is invoked as tone and frame but does not function as a ticking clock or deadline. Time remains vague: dusk, "the last band of sun," "at dawn" (promised, not shown). No temporal pressure tightens Mara's choice—Jonah's arrival feels arranged rather than urgent. The phrase "faint ticking in his dreams" gestures toward time but remains metaphorical. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is dramatized through her search, the dolphin discovery, and the confession. It conflicts with her fear of blame and her practiced erasure, creating friction that drives the climax. The motivation is named early, tested at the terrace, and fulfilled when she speaks "in plain sentences." However, "discover the weight" reads slightly abstract; the dramatized beat is the choice to speak rather than the discovery itself. Cost is visible: scripts crumble, complicity acknowledged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" coheres through diction ("guilt-ridden," "the night she chose silence," "fear had made her good at erasing lineages") and modulates at closure when regret shifts to shared acknowledgment. The tone avoids sentimentality and supports the lyric register. However, it remains static through peak pressure—Mara's interiority at the confession is described rather than voiced with rawness or break. The final image ("quiet that was no longer sieved but shared") charges the tone but does so through summary rather than embodied shift.</comment>
