<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied—"ash that settled on my tongue like vows," "astonishment finally made sound in my chest"—with embodied emotion under pressure. The choice to read the slips aloud is motivated by sustained observation of the ghosts and Mara's gestural cues, earning the final release. Minor deduction: the shift from hoarding to release, while motivated, compresses quickly without visible internal friction or cost articulated on the page before the act itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the oasis "could be tended again") with felt cost: the narrator relinquishes hoarded words and Mara's presence, forecloses the covenant's tangled form, and enables the ghosts' departure. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through contextual clues, the box's meanings layer, and the final act reweights the premise. Escalation proceeds through one meaningful deepening (understanding Mara's gesture, opening the box, releasing each slip) that narrows the narrator's stance from preservation to release. One persistent constraint (the ghosts' silence, the tangled covenant) shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis setting is vivid, particular, and purposeful: cracked hives, dry spring, smokers, and water trough anchor spatial choreography and ghost positions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air still smelled faintly of wax," "wind carried ash"—and supports the final act when the narrator carries the box "outside to the dry spring, set it on the cracked stone." The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (its sealed contents) and charging the closure image when moonlight spills through its panes during the reading.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: untangle the covenant and honor Mara's memory versus preserve unspoken words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara's gesture and the ghosts' clustering force the narrator to choose release over hoarding, narrowing options with visible cost (the ghosts depart, Mara nods and goes, the oasis shifts from grief-locked to tendable). Agency is clear—decision to read aloud—and the final line reweights the stakes under the Accumulative lens. The price is legible: solitude deepens as companions vanish, but the path forward opens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: unspoken words as weight, hoarding versus release, covenant as both bond and burden. The stained glass box and slips of paper recur with shifting meaning—first preservation, then liberation tool—and the final image ("oasis felt...like a place that could be tended again") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Mara's slip, "I forgive you for surviving," lands as earned wisdom through prior causal layering. Subtext operates in every ghost's gesture and the narrator's silence-reading method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the narrator reads weather "by the restless pitch of a hive," interprets ghosts through "contextual clues," and employs precise, tactile diction ("ash that settled on my tongue like vows"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during Mara's arrival ("astonishment finally made sound"), wider when cataloging other ghosts—and voice texture (syntax mixing lyric compression with longer, accretive rhythms) supports emotional intensity. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; elision of direct speech is voice-motivated and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally—"Then the fires came, Mara died without a goodbye, and the covenant knotted itself" accelerates, while the final reading sequence breathes. Minor deduction: a few near-adjacent phrasings echo without adding pressure ("kept the bees and kept the stories," "keep the bees and keep the stories" in quick succession; "tended the bees and tend each other" / "tended again"). These loops are brief and do not obscure causality or dull the closure beat, so the penalty remains modest within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—ghosts appear visibly after an event, silent but readable—transforms familiar haunting tropes through the specificity of beekeeping covenant, contextual-clue method, and stained glass box as both reliquary and tool. The narrator's occupation and perceptual mode cohere organically with theme. The final turn (reading aloud releases the dead) feels earned in hindsight, arising from established covenant logic and the narrator's observational skill rather than late invention. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric-textural mode and ghost-reading method are fresh but safely executed within genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "astonished recluse" frames the narrator throughout: reclusion is embodied in solitary tending of the abandoned oasis, astonishment surfaces explicitly at Mara's arrival ("my astonishment finally made sound"). The trait enables the choice to observe ghosts tranquilly and drives the final decision to read the slips aloud, altering the oasis's state. Present in setup (opening lines), development (ghost observations), and closure (reading act). Causal pressure is clear; cost is visible in the loss of companions and shift from preservation to release.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early ("kept a stained glass box on the table"), is handled and opened mid-story ("I opened the box"), and its colored panes charge the closure scene ("caught the moon and spilled it across the room...mute eloquence"). It constrains the narrator's choice (words sealed away) and enables the resolution (opening it to read the slips releases the ghosts). Three distinct beats: description, opening/ghost response, and moonlight-spill during reading. Irreplaceable: amber/green panes and "holding sunlight in pieces" tie to beekeeper past and covenant theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is named and explained early ("a covenant with the valley...knotted itself to other promises"), shapes the dominant stake (untangle versus preserve), and drives the protagonist's final choice to release the slips rather than hoard them. Mara's gesture and the narrator's understanding ("she wanted the covenant untied, not stored") pivot the climax. The concept appears in setup, development (narrator reflects on covenant's transformation), and closure (untying enacted). Cost is visible: the covenant's simplicity is restored by forfeiting its tangled, grief-bound form.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is signaled early ("I was tranquilly perceptive by habit, watching for the smallest tilt of a head") and enables the narrator's method of reading ghosts without speech. It constrains choice—rather than demand answers, the narrator observes—and shapes two beats: cataloging the courier and child, then interpreting Mara's gesture. The trait appears in setup and development; its payoff is implicit in the closure (reading contextual clues leads to the choice to read aloud). Visible tradeoff: patience and observation over direct action. Minor cap: the attribute is named once and then demonstrated, but no on-page moment shows a cost for being tranquil (e.g., missing urgency or acting too late).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs across beats: the narrator gazes at apparitions to read them, gazes at Mara's ghost to interpret her want, and gazes at Mara "until she nodded" in the final line, which triggers her departure and the oasis's shift. The action is irreplaceable—swapping "looked" would lose the sustained, interpretive quality—and drives two major turns (understanding Mara's desire, achieving mutual closure). Present in setup (ghost-reading), development (Mara's gesture), and closure (final mutual gaze). Cost is legible: prolonged observation rather than speech, and the gaze's reciprocation enacts the covenant's release.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is named early, taught through two examples (courier with pouch, child at trough), and applied at the climax when the narrator reads Mara's "steady hands and the way she faced the hives" to understand her want. The method shapes tactics (observation over dialogue) and enables the resolution (correct interpretation leads to the choice to read aloud). Present in setup (method named and demonstrated), development (applied to Mara), and closure (the reading act is the method's fruit). Minor deduction: the mechanics are told more than dramatized in fine detail, but the causal link is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" anchors every scene: cracked hives, dry spring, smokers, water trough, and ash-carrying wind supply spatial detail and constrain the narrator's choices (no bees to tend, water gone, covenant broken). The setting enables the closure—carrying the box "outside to the dry spring, set it on the cracked stone"—and its transformation charges the final image ("the oasis felt...tendable again"). Irreplaceable: beekeeper past and covenant logic depend on this exact locale. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" establishes the premise and timeline anchor early ("In the years before the Seeing...When the dead began to show"). The timeframe enables all ghost interactions and shapes the stakes (now that the dead are visible, what to do with their presence). Mara arrives "on the first full moon after the Seeing," marking a progression. Present in setup and development; the ending does not explicitly reference the timeframe but depends on it. Moderate causal pressure: the Seeing permits the plot but does not tighten decisions within the window shown. Cost is indirect (living with visible grief) rather than a live clock narrowing options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" is named early ("I wanted to preserve the weight of unspoken words"), dramatized through the narrator's collection of slips and sealing them in the box, and tested at the climax when Mara's gesture and the ghosts' clustering force the choice between preservation and release. The motivation creates friction: preserving feels dutiful, but the valley "needed release." Visible cost in the final act: the narrator relinquishes the hoard, and companions depart. Present in setup (motivation stated, box filled), development (conflict between hoarding and Mara's want), and closure (release enacted). Strong causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is embodied throughout: ghosts do not speak but their silence "had weight"; the stained glass box's "colors moved over their faces like slow speech"; the climax features "a mute eloquence that made even my breath careful." Tone modulates with pressure—tranquil observation shifts to held-breath care during the box opening, then quiet release at the end—and charges the final image (Mara's nod, the oasis tendable). Coherent across all beats, integral to the method (reading contextual clues in silence), and irreplaceable. The tone is the story's signature aesthetic and thematic carrier.</comment>
