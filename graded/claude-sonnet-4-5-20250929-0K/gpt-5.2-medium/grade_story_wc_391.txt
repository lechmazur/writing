<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Irena's internal arc from impatience to patience is embodied through concrete choices: her initial urge to sabotage versus her vow to watch and wait, her nightly returns to chart shadows rather than act impulsively. The motivation is grounded in "a fault in her blood" and made visible through micro-choices like teaching rebels silent labor and drilling them without snapping. Minor weakness: the rebels' "restrained wildness" and Irena's promise feel slightly asserted rather than fully dramatized in individual faces, and the final return to draw a new horizon risks tidy satisfaction. The embodied tension between wolf-behind-door hunger and patient sculpting carries the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal backbone. The piece escalates through density increase—nightly charting, moon-path observation, teaching silent labor—that reweights the dominant stake (freeing the lowlands without battle). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the viaduct remains intact but rendered "useless...by a simple absence of obedience," and Irena returns to the sanctuary "patient at last," reweighting her internal vow with felt cost (the long discipline, the restrained wildness held back). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Irena, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, dawn climbs). One meaningful tightening occurs when she resists sabotage and instead charts shadows, narrowing tactics toward the third full moon window. The cost is legible: patience as endurance, the rebels' hunger restrained, the empire's control undermined not destroyed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain movement (caravans follow lunar cadence to cross safely) and supply resources (iron filings in rock, cold basalt dulling coils). The magnetic viaduct's copper seams and humming tides are tracked across multiple nights, shaping Irena's tactical choice of the third full moon. Spatial choreography is clean: boots on ice, climbs up stepped walls, sleds rolled into reeds. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "angry twitch" of the compass, lake groaning under ice, humming dropping to a purr. The body and recurring objects (compass, sleds, moon paths) charge the final image when the viaduct is unyoked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teach rebels to move like the moon and slip past the empire without losing gentleness, signaled early through Irena's belief that maps are her "lever against the empire." One meaningful tightening: Irena's impatience surges at the viaduct, but she resists sabotage and instead watches nightly, charting shadows until she hears "a seam for freedom" in the softening hum. The third full moon becomes the window, narrowing options and forcing disciplined waiting. Agency is visible: Irena's signal initiates the unyoking, and the rebels' silent labor and refusal to snap forge the tactic. Cost is legible on the page: "restrained wildness...held back like a wolf behind a half opened door," the long nights of charting, the discipline that shapes patience from impatience. The resolution is earned by protagonist choice under the selected lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—patience as tactical power, sculpted from impatience through discipline and lunar rhythm—emerges from concrete actions: nightly charting, teaching silent labor, waiting for the seam in the viaduct's hum. The patient revolution in the lowlands ("slow as ice thickening, yet impossible to stop") is dramatized on the page when rebels unyoke the bridge "by a simple absence of obedience," leaving it intact but useless. The final image—Irena returning to draw a new horizon, "patient at last"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the rebels' "restrained wildness" and the empire's magnetic yoke contrasted with lunar gentleness. No overt thematic statements; the cost of patience (hunger held back, nights of waiting) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization stays with Irena throughout. Perceptual signature is clear: she reads horizons, tracks moon arcs, hears softening in machinery, and filters the viaduct through compass needles and lunar cadence. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "softly purposeful," "ancient impatience," "maps were her lever," "simple absence of obedience." The prose has distinct texture in syntax and rhythm, modulating with urgency (the surge of impatience, the nights of charting). Psychic distance tightens at key moments ("for a moment her impatience surged") and widens for tactical reflection. Minor slip: a few phrases ("restrained wildness...like a wolf behind a half opened door") approach metaphor-heavy in adjacent lines, but they remain voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer accumulative sentences ("The monastery kept charts...by the black marks they left on the snowbound horizon") alternating with shorter tactical beats ("At dawn the empire found the viaduct intact but useless"). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the horizon motif. Minor weaknesses: a few phrases approach template cadence ("not by battle but by refusing to hurry, refusing to break") and the sentence "she promised them that patience was not surrender but a shape they could carve together" edges toward thematic statement within a high-pressure beat. "Restrained wildness...like a wolf behind a half opened door" is vivid but slightly strained. No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding; clarity and propulsion are intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar observation, magnetic interference, and patient revolution is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms the "teach the rebels" trope through the viaduct's tides and Irena's discipline. The ending—unyoking by absence of obedience—feels earned in hindsight from the nightly charting and the rebels' silent labor. Emotional specificity (impatience sculpted into patience, restrained wildness) avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its premise: maps as lever, moon paths as guide, patience as weapon. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet, tactical ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the patient revolution in the lowlands remains somewhat abstract; more on-page friction among the rebels or a moment of near-break would sharpen the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Irena is present throughout and her choices create key turns: resisting the urge to sabotage (middle beat), charting nightly to find the seam (development), giving the signal to unyoke (closure). Setup is immediate (vigilant horizon mapper who climbs walls each dawn). Her observation is paired with decision: she teaches rebels, drills them in silent labor, and judges the third full moon as the window. The final turn—returning to draw a new horizon, "patient at last"—ties her arc to the closure. Cost is visible: the vow, the nights of waiting, the disciplined restraint. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct after rain is introduced early (second third: "after rain on the southern inlet") and appears in multiple beats: Irena's first study visit when her compass twitches angrily, her nightly returns to chart its shadows and hear the humming soften, and the climactic unyoking when the rebels roll cargo off and strip the clamps. Its mechanics (copper coils reacting to basalt's iron filings, humming that ebbs with lunar alignment) shape Irena's tactic and narrow the window to the third full moon. The viaduct's presence in the closure beat—found "intact but useless"—charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met; causal pressure and specificity are high. Minor cap: introduced slightly late (past the first third) but its evolving use and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patient revolution is signaled early (caravans bring rumors of rebels "refusing to hurry, refusing to break") and shapes Irena's stake: teach rebels to move like the moon without losing gentleness. It drives her tactical choice—wait, chart, drill silent labor—and the climactic unyoking is the revolution enacted on the page ("simple absence of obedience"). The concept is dramatized in the rebels' restrained wildness and the final image of the viaduct rendered useless. Setup and payoff gates are met; development is present in Irena's teaching and the rebels' discipline. Cost is visible (hunger held back, nights of waiting). Causal pressure and closure linkage are solid, pushing the score into the 7-range despite slightly abstract framing in the lowlands rumors.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" is introduced early ("She is softly purposeful") and grounds Irena's deliberate, patient approach versus her impatient history. It constrains her choice when impatience surges at the viaduct: instead of sabotage, she watches and charts, embodying the soft purpose. The trait is visible in her teaching style (drilling rebels without snapping) and the final return to draw a new horizon. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is implicit in "patient at last." The attribute shapes one key choice (resisting sabotage) but does not reappear with charged specificity at closure. Cost is tied to the larger patience arc rather than this exact phrase. Solid integration, mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is signaled early (lowland rebels unyoking themselves from quotas and lashes) and drives the climactic beat: rebels unyoke the viaduct's hauling clamps and roll cargo into reeds, leaving the bridge intact but stripped of leverage. The action is Irena's tactical goal throughout (maps to help rebels slip past the empire) and the final image hinges on it: "useless...by a simple absence of obedience." Setup, development (Irena studies the viaduct to find how to unyoke it), and payoff are all met. The verb is irreplaceable; swapping it would break the thematic and tactical coherence. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity are all high. Cost is visible: the long discipline, the restrained wildness, the risk of moving at the exact lunar window.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is introduced early (Irena's training: "measure change...by tracking moon paths across the ribs of cloud") and its mechanics shape multiple beats: she learns when caravans arrive, judges when the moon's pull makes the lake groan, and charts "when moon paths lined with the copper seams and when the humming softened." The method narrows the tactical window to the third full moon and enables the final unyoking. Setup, development (nightly charting), and payoff (the chosen night when the moon reaches the marked angle) are all met. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The method is irreplaceable; without it, Irena has no leverage over the viaduct's tides. Cost is visible in the nights of patient observation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake is present throughout: Irena climbs its stepped walls each dawn, the monastery keeps charts, the sanctuary's iron filings interact with the viaduct's coils, and the basalt must be "cold enough to dull the coils" at the third full moon. The setting supplies resources (charts, a vantage for reading horizons, the iron that creates magnetic interference) and constrains movement (caravans cross the frozen lake by lunar cadence). Setup, development (the sanctuary as base for nightly study), and payoff (Irena returns to the sanctuary to draw a new horizon) are all met. The setting charges the final image and shapes the tactic. Specificity is high: the basalt's interaction with the viaduct is unique and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake freezes over" anchors the opening and creates the condition for safe caravan crossings and the patient revolution's timing. The freeze enables the magnetic viaduct's threat (no drift or fog to hide behind) and sets the clock for the third full moon of winter, when the basalt will be cold enough. Setup is immediate; development is clear in the progression from the first thawless morning to "night after night" of charting to the chosen night. Payoff occurs when the rebels act at the exact lunar angle and "at dawn the empire found the viaduct intact but useless." The timeframe tightens decisions and tactics, though the exact duration and urgency of the window are somewhat soft. Cost is tied to waiting through the freeze.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to sculpt patience from impatience—is introduced immediately ("the purpose is born from a fault in her blood, the old impatience") and drives every major beat: Irena's vow to measure change by moonlight, her choice to resist sabotage and watch instead, her drilling of rebels in silent labor, and the final return "patient at last." Friction between wants (the surge to sabotage) and costs (the vow, the nightly discipline) is dramatized on the page. Setup, development (the nightly charting, teaching rebels to wait), and payoff (Irena achieving patience through the unyoking) are all met. The motivation is irreplaceable; without it, the tactics and closure lose coherence. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Restrained wildness is signaled early in Irena's history ("the old impatience that once made her sprint from project to project") and embodied in the rebels' faces: "restrained wildness, the same fierce hunger she had carried up these walls, now held back like a wolf behind a half opened door." The tone modulates with pressure: urgency when impatience surges at the viaduct, disciplined calm during nightly charting, charged restraint at the unyoking. The final image—Irena patient at last—resolves the tension between wildness and restraint. Setup and development are clear; payoff charges the ending. The tone is coherent through turns and specific to this voice. Minor limitation: the "wolf behind a half opened door" metaphor does heavy lifting but risks slight over-statement.</comment>
