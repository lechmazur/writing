<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Riven's voice is distinct and embodied—"I said it like an editor, tasting the implication"—with subtly confident micro-choices throughout (packing before dawn, aligning the atlas beneath the pane). Lysa functions cleanly as a calm counterpoint without clutter. The final choice to simply listen rather than immediately report feels earned by the accumulation of prior caution and the weight of what discovery means, though the cost remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Riven, outpost, frozen lake, after the falcon's return. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vellum message deepens mystery, the condensation pattern reweights method, the spring discovery crystallizes convergence. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Riven kneels at the source, speaks the phrasebook question aloud, and chooses to listen before mapping; the cost (delivering lines to "people who think maps are weapons") is felt and the final image reconfigures prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The outpost's rust, frozen lake, fogged window, and black-stone field with steaming hollow are vivid and purposeful. The crack in the window glass becomes a ridge line that guides the atlas tracing—micro-setting as constraint that charges the closure. Spatial choreography stays clear across indoor and tundra beats, and sensory details (mist rising, ice sighing, frost on beak) reflect Riven's cartographic lens without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the river origin to solve the blank-space error—is signaled early and deepens when the vellum says "Converge." Pressure tightens through the window-tracing epiphany and culminates at the spring where three rivers split from one source. The cost is legible (Ministry will "kill to own" this knowledge; Riven must "deliver them to people who think maps are weapons") but remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally tested in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as burden, the politics of cartography, the mother's belief that "language was a kind of shelter"—emerges organically through the phrasebook, the dog-ear as warning, and the final spoken question. The spring "beginning again and again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material (blank space, smudge, political stakes) through a single image charged with both discovery and dread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Riven's voice is controlled and perceptually signature: "dry wit for armor," "tasting the implication," "water always tells on itself." Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping. The phrase "subtly confident" and "tranquil worry" are embedded in action rather than asserted. Diction remains stable under pressure—"quiet verdict," "singular convergence settle into certainty"—and the phrasebook question spoken aloud lands as a decisive act rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high. Minor template cadence in early beats ("I am Riven Hale…sent north, to a rusted outpost…to correct a blank space") and one paraphrase loop ("the only table not eaten through by rust, waiting for someone to answer the question it held" echoes earlier phrasebook description) lower slightly. The closure beat is clean, propulsive, and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cartographer-as-protagonist angle is fresh; the condensation-as-map method is ingenious and grounds the climax in concrete observation. The Ministry threat and political stakes avoid familiar template outcomes by stopping at discovery rather than escape or confrontation. The phrasebook as inherited shelter and the tri-river convergence synthesize into a non-obvious whole, though the outpost-mystery frame echoes genre conventions without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Riven's choices—unrolling the vellum, tracing the condensation, packing before dawn, speaking the phrasebook question aloud—drive every key turn. The final decision to "simply listen" rather than immediately draw the lines forecloses a path and charges the ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in beat one (beside the mug), is handled when Riven traces the word for "source," and returns at closure when Riven speaks the question aloud to the spring. The dog-ear shifts from "wear" to "warning" mid-story, reweighting its meaning. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Singular convergence shapes the entire plot: the vellum message ("Converge") redefines the blank-space mystery, the condensation droplet models it, and the spring discovery proves it on the page. The concept alters Riven's tactics (the tracing, the walk north) and charges the closure image where three rivers split from one source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears early ("I came subtly confident") and is embodied in Riven's methodical tracing and the decision to pack before dawn without external confirmation. The trait enables risk-taking (the northern walk) but the cost tied specifically to confidence versus caution remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heralding appears when Riven gives Slate the red cloth "to herald our departure to anyone watching from the tundra." The act signals intent and transitions to the walk, but it does not drive a major reversal or redefine options; it functions as transition punctuation rather than a choice with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is signaled early ("pattern of condensation on glass began to form delicate branching lines"), its mechanics matter (Lysa breathes near the corner, rivulets meet at the crack), and Riven uses it to generate coordinates by aligning the droplet with the lake's southern notch. The method shapes the middle attempt and enables the walk to the spring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The outpost pressures choices throughout: broken radio isolates them, the fogged window supplies the tracing method, rust and cold underscore hazard. The frozen lake's "worrying" silence primes mood. At closure the setting shifts to the black-stone field and steaming hollow, which dramatizes the discovery rather than merely framing it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" anchors the opening and Slate's dusk arrival provides a rough clock. "We packed before dawn" and "near noon we reached" track progression, but the intervals do not tighten decisions or add urgency; time flows without pressing choices in a way that would alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation—find where the rivers begin—drives every beat: decoding the vellum, tracing the window, walking north, speaking the question aloud. Friction between discovery and political consequence ("Ministry would kill to own") charges the final choice to listen rather than report immediately, making the cost of knowledge visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is established early ("the tranquility of that sound worried me more than gunfire would") and recurs in Lysa's "tranquil worry" and the "eerily peaceful" walk. The tone modulates under pressure—dread beneath calm—and charges the closure image where peace "was only the surface tension of something deeper."</comment>
