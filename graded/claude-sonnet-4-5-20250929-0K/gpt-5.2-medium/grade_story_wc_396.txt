<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core trait—calmly intuitive—drives her choice to hold silence, use mirrors, and reconstitute the ball, but her interior experience remains thin; we observe her sensing arguments and witnessing fears without contradiction or embodied cost in her own stance. The fisherman's dread and glaciologist's shame are shown via mirror-glimpses rather than dramatized internal conflict. The final assignment of duties feels engineered rather than emergent from Mara's struggle, and no path is visibly foreclosed for her with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by ~60 words (Mara, lighthouse orchard, tonight) and holds a Situational lens: pressure accumulates as she witnesses two opposing demands, then crystallizes their shared courage into a workable channel. The closure—showing both men safe passage and shared duties, apples picked for all—reads as Charged Poise: options are reconfigured and the cost (mutual vulnerability, ongoing interdependence) is felt even if not yet paid. One micro turn (shard brightens, anomaly recognized) deepens the stake without fragmenting causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice, vintage store mirrors, and the fragment itself are vividly rendered and integral: the mirrors function as a narrative tool that unlocks hidden fears, the ice groans under the moon to charge the ending, and the orchard's apples anchor the resolution. Spatial choreography is clean (storehouse upstairs, vintage store below, rows outside) and sensory detail—rope-braced trees, salt-clouded crystal, wind-gnawed postcards—grounds every beat without tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to use the fragment without repeating the Bureau's failure—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes the anomaly as communal courage, not the shard. Her agency (silence, mirror-work, map-making, assignment of duties) narrows options for both men and forecloses unilateral disposal or hoarding. The cost is conceptual (mutual exposure, ongoing shared risk) rather than visceral loss, and no explicit trade-off or renunciation by Mara herself is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy mapped onto action, care balanced with prediction—emerges through the mirror-glimpses, the reconstituted ball's dual projection (ice channels and human nodes), and the final apple harvest that includes "even those who had shouted." The courageous anomaly reweights the premise: the Bureau failed by predicting without care; Mara succeeds by recognizing unused courage and turning private fears into shared duties. The ending image (Mara trusting the map and the anomaly) offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Mara's perceptual signature—she "felt an argument before any voice rose," "watched them in the weighted breath before reply"—and the prose texture (long, layered sentences; archaic "via glimpses") is consistent and purpose-driven. The phrase "courageous anomaly" and "reconstitute the old crystal ball by aligning the shard with the mirror-glimpses it awakened" edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds Mara's embodied register under pressure, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. However, several lines loop conceptually: "watched them in the weighted breath before reply" recurs identically, "the fragment" and "the shard" are used interchangeably without added nuance, and "courageous anomaly" appears twice in close succession. The phrase "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "reconstitute the old crystal ball by aligning the shard with the mirror-glimpses it awakened" carry slight overwriting that slows momentum in peak beats (−0.6 for loops and register drift).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination—lighthouse orchard on ice, broken Bureau artifact, mirror-as-empathy-tool, peacekeeper who stitches light to shadow—is specific and non-obvious. The emotional calculus (prediction vs. care, fear vs. courage) avoids stock binaries, and the resolution (shared channel, co-documented needs) grows organically from the mirror work. The "courageous anomaly" framing and the widow's spontaneous supply of buttons and prism glass feel slightly convenient, nudging the premise toward template wish-fulfillment, but the synthesis remains fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices—asking for silence, holding the shard to light, carrying it to the vintage store, reconstituting the ball, assigning duties—drive all major beats and the closure. Her role is essential; removing her would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fragment is handled or referenced in ~five beats: found in the pressure crack, examined at the table, held to lantern light (pulse of warmth), carried downstairs, and reconstituted into a working map. It shapes both the middle investigation and the final resolution; its "clouded with salt and faint bruise of shadow" and later brightening reweight its meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named twice and directly drives Mara's realization: the anomaly is the community's unused courage, not the shard itself. This insight enables the reconstitution and the final plan. It shapes stakes and tactics on the page, though the phrase itself leans abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is introduced early ("the sort who felt an argument in the orchard before any voice rose") and enables her silence, mirror-reading, and synthesis. The trait constrains her method—she observes rather than interrogates—but no visible cost or trade-off (e.g., missed urgency, delayed intervention) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reconstituting the crystal ball is the story's pivot: Mara "began to reconstitute the old crystal ball by aligning the shard with the mirror-glimpses it awakened," producing the moving map that shows both ice channels and human nodes. This action unlocks the final resolution and could not be swapped without breaking the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced midway, then used to show the fisherman's dread and the glaciologist's shame. The method is signaled ("she had learned that their silvered scars held glimpses of what people would not say aloud") and its mechanics matter: the mirror-glimpses are what Mara aligns with the shard. Late first use (second half) caps the score, but causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard appears in the opening line, recurs as the site where apples are picked in the ending, and the ice floes supply the fragment and groan under the moon at closure. The setting frames expectation and charges the final image, but it does not constrain a middle choice or alter Mara's tactics within the storehouse scenes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" bookends two scenes (men at table, Mara's return upstairs) and creates a patterned pause that tightens Mara's decision rhythm. The timeframe is more lyric motif than live clock; it does not visibly narrow options or force a tempo shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to map empathy onto action"—is stated explicitly and drives her method: she uses mirrors to see fears, reconstitutes the ball to project both ice and human nodes, and assigns duties that turn private fears into shared action. The desire is dramatized in her choices, though internal friction (doubt, cost to herself) is absent.</comment>
