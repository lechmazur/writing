<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theo's internal contradiction between shame and the impulse toward repair is dramatized through embodied choices—polishing the compass, speaking to gulls, choosing inland water over open sea. The mentor's voice and the crewman's ghost drive micro-decisions with visible cost. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("backlash of regrets," "thin strand of faith") that slightly softens peak pressure. The final museum action earns the shift from hiding to steering through accumulated micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Theo writes the apology in the logbook, converting years of evasion into documentation that might prevent another death—a visible, irreversible cost. The causal chain from canceled ferry → inland paddle → utility-pole navigation → museum pier holds cleanly under a Causal lens with Accumulative texturing. Orientation anchors promptly (coastal kayak launch, morning, Theo). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lita's parallel run and the squall converge to test his resolve, narrowing options to reach or retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The utility poles function as micro-setting constraint, replacing stars and shaping navigation choices across multiple beats. Eelgrass, storm drain outlet, and pier are tactilely present. The astronomical compass charges the final image by remaining in his palm during the logbook moment. Sensory detail is purposeful (wet pencil gleam of poles post-squall) but leans visual; other senses appear sparingly. The coastal kayak launch anchors the frame, though its pressure is mostly tonal rather than logistical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting the unanswered call sign—is signaled early and tightens when Theo aims for the museum despite the squall. The utility poles create a stepwise escalation ("the next one, then the next") that narrows retreat options. Lita's shout and the squall's arrival force the final choice to keep paddling. Agency is clear: he chooses transparency over evasion, foreclosing the hiding path. The cost (public apology, documented failure) is legible on the page and scales appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—accountability versus avoidance—emerges through the compass (polished promises), utility poles (substitute navigation), and logbook (literal record). The final act of writing the apology answers the central question without moralizing. However, phrases like "align heart and action" and "people were more than their worst day" skirt prompt-speak. The merrily melancholic tone modulates pressure but occasionally telegraphs theme ("he did not need the sea to absolve him"). The ending image (poles gleaming, gravitating toward tomorrow) reweights prior material with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during compass handling, wider during paddle). Theo's perceptual signature—nautical idiom, guilt-filtered detail—is consistent. Lita's dialogue is functional but brief; her voice lacks distinct idiom. Two instances of filter stacking ("he felt," "he realized") slightly dull immediacy in mid-beats. The phrase "merrily melancholic" recurs as direct narration rather than emerging from Theo's lexicon, creating minor register drift. Rhythm varies purposefully; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or stake. However, a paraphrase loop appears: "backlash of regrets" is restated across paragraphs four and fourteen without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems recur in four consecutive sentences mid-story (−0.4). Stock metaphor "salt in a cut" and "thin strand of faith" slightly soften precision (−0.3 cumulative). The opening and closing images (cracked smile / wet pencils gleaming) are vivid and propulsive. Syntax varies; no major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles instead of stars is a fresh, grounded choice that transforms the navigator archetype. The inland kayak route and logbook amendment avoid familiar redemption templates. However, the core arc—guilt-ridden professional returns to scene of failure—is widely used; transformation arises more from setting specificity (poles, eelgrass, storm drain) than conceptual surprise. The merrily melancholic register and the compass as confession token feel purposeful but not bold. Risk-taking is moderate; no structural or perspectival gambles that heighten stakes beyond solid execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theo's choices—paddle inland, follow poles, aim for museum, write apology—drive all major turns. His agency is continuous from launch to logbook. The "broken navigator" status constrains his route (avoids open water) and motivates the utility-pole method. Present in setup, middle navigation, and closure action. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: pocket mention (early), taken out at pole seventy-two to settle his mind (middle), held in palm during logbook writing (closure). It anchors his mentor's lesson ("useless without a steady mind") and charges the final image. However, its function is mostly symbolic; he does not use it to navigate, and removing it would not break causality—only weaken resonance. Functional reprise with thematic weight but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is named in paragraph four and paragraph fourteen, shaping his decision to paddle close to shore and his mid-journey breathing exercise at pole seventy-two. It constrains his route choice (inland vs. seaward) and drives the museum aim. The concept is stated more than dramatized in discrete beats, and some mentions feel like theme claims rather than pressure. Present across setup, middle choice, and closure motivation; causal role in route and destination but could be more tightly embodied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" appears as direct narration in two beats: speaking to gulls (paragraph seven) and laughing during the squall (paragraph twenty). It colors tone but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—it describes his manner rather than enabling or preventing a choice. The trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Present in setup and near closure but ornamental; swappable with another mood label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gravitate" appears twice: Theo gravitates toward the idea that people are more than their worst day (middle) and gravitates toward tomorrow (closure). The first instance influences his acceptance of the thermos and shifts his stance slightly; the second charges the final image. However, the action is metaphorical rather than plot-driving—he paddles and writes; "gravitate" describes his internal tilt. Functional reprise with thematic weight but easily swappable with "move toward" or "choose." Lyric resonance without hard causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Utility-pole navigation is introduced in paragraph ten, used continuously during the paddle (poles seventy-two mentioned, "the next one, then the next"), and appears in the closure image ("utility poles gleamed like wet pencils"). The method shapes his route, provides stepwise escalation, and charges the ending. Without it, the navigation and atonement structure would collapse. Signaled early, drives middle beats, and essential to closure image. Indispensable to both mechanics and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch anchors the opening and provides the departure point. Lita waves from pilings, pressing the thermos into Theo's hands—a small pressure moment. However, the launch itself does not constrain later choices; once he departs, the eelgrass edge, storm drain, and museum pier carry more tactical weight. Present in setup with one interaction beat but replaceable with any shoreline departure site. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" is dramatized in the opening (ferry canceled, weather app admits defeat) and threads through his decision to stop hiding. The timeframe creates urgency by eliminating the planned route, forcing improvisation. The squall arrival tightens the clock during the final paddle. However, the passage of time during the paddle is vague—no live countdown pressure. Present in setup, implied in middle escalation, and implicit at closure. Shapes the initiating condition and complicates the final beat but does not track minute-by-minute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Align heart and action" is named in paragraph six and drives the museum aim: writing the truth in the logbook is the literal alignment. The thermos moment and Lita's shout test his resolve. The motivation is dramatized through his choice to paddle toward transparency rather than retreat. Present in setup as stated goal, tested in middle beats, and fulfilled in closure action. Essential to the arc; removing it would break the why of the museum trip.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" appears once by name (paragraph nineteen: "thin strand of faith flicker in his chest") and is embodied in his stepwise paddle ("each time he glanced at the utility poles...he chose the next one") and Lita's shout brightening his resolve. The tone modulates from cracked smile to merrily melancholic laughter to the final gravitational pull toward tomorrow. Coherent through turns and charges the ending without becoming static. Present across setup, middle, and closure with tonal continuity; elevates but is not mechanically indispensable.</comment>
