<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is rooted in her father's legacy and expressed through concrete observational choices—hearing Lyle's tremor, watching Sato's hands, testing contradictions via logbook. The "orbit of regret" metaphor recurs but occasionally slides toward label-speak ("he felt an orbit of regret begin to pull at her"). Sato's confession arrives with embodied guilt (the flickered expression, the colleague's death), and Celeste's final bargain feels earned by prior causal pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "orbit of regret" framing in the middle third, but the closure choice—forcing honesty through documented contradictions—lands with visible cost and alters Sato's path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Celeste, penthouse, after the call) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads Causal: Lyle's tremor → Celeste investigates → she finds plate/log overlap → confronts Sato → bargain with documented proof. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the dust-fresh plates and Sato confesses; the resolution (bargain enforced by logbook scratch) closes with cost (Sato must file damage report, observatory's miracle collapses). The closure is a Decisive Change with visible professional and emotional cost on the page. Minor deduction: the "orbit of regret" metaphor occasionally drifts toward thematic echo rather than pure causal linkage, and the bargain's exact mechanics ("rosewood nib scratching directly into his logbook") feel slightly convenient—but the cost is undeniable and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is anchored early (cable car, domed halls, red-lamp darkroom) and the acoustics ("every footstep returned in echoes") mirror Celeste's doubt. The rosewood nib and glass plates are handled tactilely across beats. Spatial choreography is clear (penthouse → cable car → observatory corridor → darkroom). The dust on the mislabeled plates constrains Celeste's final confrontation, charging the closure. Minor gap: the "white sea" and "ship" simile at the cable-car beat feel slightly decorative rather than tied to a present micro-choice, and occupational verisimilitude (astronomy logistics, grant mechanics) is sketched rather than deeply tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: uncover the truth without collapsing honest work. Celeste's agency drives escalation: she hears the tremor, requests the darkroom tour, spots the dust, then forces the bargain with documented contradictions. One clear tightening when the plates' fresh dust and Sato's confession narrow options to "expose and destroy" or "intervene with proof." The final bargain forecloses spectacle with visible cost (no planet story, Sato must admit damage). Minor deduction: the "orbit of regret" framing occasionally summarizes emotional stakes rather than showing contradictory impulses in action, and Sato's colleague's death is told rather than dramatized as a pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (integrity vs. spectacle, truth's survivability without scandal) emerges from Celeste's father's mistake, the rosewood nib's "cut clean" promise, and the final bargain that saves the observatory by enforcing honesty. The "orbit of regret" motif recurs with shifting valence: first Celeste's inheritance, then Sato's guilt-driven cover-up, finally broken by proof. The closure offers a non-literal answer—truth as sustained work rather than headline miracle—without moralizing. Minor slip: "plenty of truth, and it will keep us busy for years" edges toward thematic summary, but the prior image of the nib scratching the logbook carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Celeste; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (she hears tremors, watches hands, tests contradictions). Dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (Sato's "memorized" jokes, Celeste's pretended charm). Minor deductions: "solemn playfulness" appears twice as a stated label rather than enacted rhythm, and several beats lean on filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") where immediacy could sharpen. The rosewood-nib image and "echoes...like applause" charge the final moment, but the phrase "as if she were teasing a headline into behaving" drifts toward explaining tone rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (each beat advances character and plot). Clarity holds throughout. Two line-level debts lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop: "His new planet was an orbit of regret: he kept it spinning so he would not have to face the still center of that death" restates the metaphor without added pressure. (2) Template cadence: several sentences open with "She [verb]" or "He [verb]" in rapid succession mid-story ("She laughed softly...she grew quiet...She traced...She asked...He obliged"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or register drift; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The newsprint-heiress investigator frame is familiar, but the "proof by contradiction" method and the father's carved nib (as moral constraint rather than tool) offer specific inflection. The "orbit of regret" conceit risks abstraction but is grounded in Sato's lens damage and Celeste's inherited caution. The bargain—forcing honesty via logbook proof rather than exposé—subverts the detective-wins-by-exposure template. Minor deduction: the overall arc (journalist suspects fraud, heiress investigates, discovers noble motive, brokers quiet resolution) follows a recognizable template, and the "echoing observatory" + "orbit" metaphor cluster feels slightly coordinated rather than inevitable. Still, the rosewood nib's tactile recurrence and the contradiction-proof mechanics add memorable particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste (newsprint heiress) drives all key turns: she chooses to investigate after hearing Lyle's tremor, requests the darkroom tour, spots the dust, confronts Sato, and brokers the bargain. Her inheritance (father's mistake, the nib) constrains her tactics (no spectacle, force honesty). Present across setup, middle, and closure with visible cost. Her professional identity shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: Celeste packs it as a "promise that writing should cut clean," sets it beside equations during her night analysis, and scratches it directly into Sato's logbook to seal the bargain. Its properties (carved by father, no longer fits pens, sharp) matter tactically at closure. Missing stronger mid-beat constraint; the nib's presence during equation analysis is described but does not alter her method. The logbook-scratch image charges the ending, but the overall integration trends functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" shapes the premise: Celeste's inherited caution, Sato's guilt-driven cover-up ("his new planet was an orbit of regret"), and the final bargain that breaks the cycle. The metaphor recurs across setup, middle analysis, and Sato's confession, reweighting from abstraction to motive. It enables Celeste's diagnosis (Sato's lies keep him from facing the colleague's death) and her intervention tactic (honest report to stop the spin). Minor cap: the phrase occasionally functions as thematic label rather than constraint on tactics; Celeste's proof-by-contradiction method is more directly causal than the orbit metaphor itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" (attribute) manifests on-page: Celeste hears Lyle's tremor, watches Sato's hands avoid the plate edge, spots fresh dust on mislabeled boxes. Each observation narrows options and drives a tactical choice (request darkroom, confront with evidence). The trait constrains her final move—she documents contradictions rather than relying on confession alone. Present in setup (inherited habit), middle (darkroom observations), and closure (logbook proof). Cost is visible: her father's observational failure haunts her, and her method forecloses the headline Lyle wanted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Intervene" (action) is the story's hinge: Celeste rejects both exposé and silence, instead brokering a bargain that forces Sato's damage report while protecting the program. The action is signaled early ("editors once intervened in her father's mistakes"), attempted at closure (she "offered Sato a bargain"), and enacted via the logbook-scratch proof. It redefines options (truth without spectacle) and carries cost (no planet story, Sato's professional admission). Swapping "intervene" for "negotiate" or "mediate" would lose the inherited editorial duty that charges the choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" (method) is signaled at the midpoint ("she began to test Sato's claim through proof by contradiction") and its mechanics matter: if the smear is planetary, exposure timing cannot overlap maintenance logs—but it does, so the smear is false. She shows Sato "her contradictions like courtroom exhibits," making honesty his only consistent orbit. The method shapes her night analysis and the final bargain's airtightness. Minor cap: the phrase appears once as a label and the logical steps are compressed; a reader unfamiliar with the term can still follow the tactic, but the method's specificity is more told than enacted across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" (setting) provides atmosphere and one tactical resource: the echoes externalize Celeste's doubt, and the red-lamp darkroom enables her discovery of the mislabeled plates. Spatial details (cable car, domed halls, shelf with dust) guide action. The "above clouds" isolation underscores Sato's guilt and the program's fragility. Present in setup, middle confrontation, and closure ("the echoes...sounded almost like applause"). Minor gap: the echoing quality is more mood than constraint—Celeste's proof would work in any darkroom—and "above clouds" functions primarily as metaphor rather than pressure on logistics or choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the journalist called" (timeframe) anchors the inciting incident and sets urgency (Lyle's story is ready to print). Celeste acts quickly: "two hours later" she arrives, analyzes overnight, confronts at dawn. The clock is tracked and tightens decisions (she must intervene before publication). Missing stronger closure linkage: the final call to Lyle happens after resolution, so the timeframe pressure has dissipated. Present in setup and middle escalation but does not charge the ending image. Functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" (motivation) drives Celeste's investigation and is dramatized through contradictory friction: she wants truth but fears her father's mistake (exposure that destroys). This tension forces the bargain—truth must survive without spectacle. The motive is present in setup ("she had come...to discover hidden truths"), tested in the middle (she could expose or bury the fraud), and resolved at closure (she chooses documented honesty over headline). Cost is visible: she forgoes the planet story and must enforce Sato's painful admission. Minor deduction: the phrase "hidden truths" appears as a summary label rather than always being embodied in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" (tone) is signaled early (Celeste's "gently" listening, Sato's "practiced wonder," his "jokes about cosmic traffic sounded memorized") and modulates with pressure: her "laughed softly...then she grew quiet" captures the tone's duality. At closure, "her tone was solemn playfulness, as if she were teasing a headline into behaving" and the echoes "sounded almost like applause" reprise the balance. The tone charges the final image but is occasionally stated rather than enacted. Present across setup, middle irony (she "smiled as if charmed" while watching Sato's evasion), and ending. Functional integration; minor cap for label-reliance in the final paragraph.</comment>
