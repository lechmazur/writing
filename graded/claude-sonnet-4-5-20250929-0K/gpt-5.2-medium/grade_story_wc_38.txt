<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra is defined through occupation and metaphor ("lyrical code breaker," "explained through dance") but these remain mostly decorative labels rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her motives are clear—liberate detainees, encrypt vulnerability—and she makes choices under pressure, but internal conflict is thin; she moves with consistent calm defiance rather than wrestling competing desires. Oren's presence as partner adds relational stakes, yet his role is passive (eyes open but unseeing) until the very end when he mouths the poem. The final choice to leave the journal is purposeful, but the cost feels implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered codes (journal entries, dice, dance) and the spider-web motif that recurs and charges the final image. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost): Lyra leaves the journal, trusting the guardian will read only verse while the freed carry the real meaning—a renunciation that forecloses direct confrontation and encrypts her method. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; one meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian tightens surveillance and Lyra reroutes alarms. Cost is legible but oblique: she abandons the lab again, this time entrusting her cipher to others, which satisfies the lens but does not deliver a sharp physical price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab is vividly rendered—"saltwater pressed against cracked glass like a slow drum," "door scabbed with coral," "waist deep water"—and the setting constrains choices: Lyra cannot simply cut power because pods broadcast tampering, and water pressure shapes her tactical dance. The spider and its web function as micro-setting and recurring object that charges the final image (she takes its falling as her cue). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact layout of consoles, pods, and exit hatch could be tighter. The environment genuinely pressures the protagonist and participates in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: liberate detainees without triggering alarms. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian cuts lights and demands an access key, forcing Lyra to dance the answer and reroute alarms—a reversal that narrows options and raises cost. Agency is present (she spins the wheel, scribbles final entries, leads researchers out), and the resolution is earned by her layered encryption. However, the escalation feels more procedural than visceral; each obstacle is met with a pre-planned cipher layer rather than a desperate improvisation that forecloses a live alternative. Cost is visible (she leaves the journal, exits into night tide) but the trade-off lacks the sharp sting of a forced sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—encrypting vulnerability as strength, turning shared weakness into language—emerges from concrete events: Lyra's coded journal, the dance that fools microphones, Oren recognizing the beats. The spider-web motif recurs and shifts meaning at the end, functioning as both timetable and symbol without heavy-handedness. The final image (journal left under the console, freed researchers carrying the real meaning) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction for one near-thematic statement: "what you admitted plainly became their leash" reads slightly didactic, though it is interwoven with action rather than declared in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyrical texture—"counted time as a spider spins its web," "alarms slept under silt"—that fits the "lyrical code breaker" character. However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("encrypt vulnerability as strength," "calm defiance was the only dry thing she could breathe") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with the guardian) and functional. Perceptual signature is present (she hears meter in machine noise, sees rhythm in body movements) but could be more selective and biased in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and often striking ("door scabbed with coral," "water surged in a thin sheet, cold as diagnosis"), but several lines overreach into mixed metaphor or opacity: "calm defiance was the only dry thing she could breathe" conflates tactile and respiratory metaphors awkwardly. Template cadence appears in adjacent sentences: "she opened her waterproof journal and began writing entries... Each entry looked like a poem... but the true instructions were in the rhythm..." (paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, and some constructions blur rather than sharpen: "time as a spider spins its web" is poetic but functionally vague as a timeframe anchor. Information density is strong in the middle beats, but the opening paragraph front-loads metaphor that could be tightened. No grave artifacts touch the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—code-breaking via dance, hangman's dice as cipher key, spider web as timetable—is specific and non-obvious. The premise of encrypting vulnerability and using body rhythm to fool audio surveillance offers a fresh angle on the familiar "infiltrate and rescue" plot. Lyra's calm defiance and the guardian's lingering warmth add emotional texture. However, the core arc (return to sealed lab, outwit surveillance, free prisoners) follows a recognizable template, and the transformation hinges more on clever method than on character cost or moral calculus. The ending image (journal as decoy, meaning carried by the freed) is purposeful but not deeply surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra's choices drive key turns: she writes coded entries, dances the access key, reroutes alarms, and spins the manual release wheel. She is active throughout and her decisions alter tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure). However, her occupation as "lyrical code breaker" remains more decorative label than constraint; the story would function with minor edits if she were simply a code-breaker. The "lyrical" aspect is invoked but not irreplaceably woven into on-page causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in two distinct beats: Lyra carries them in her pocket (setup) and rolls them across the workbench to answer the guardian (middle). They are described as "etched with letters and tiny nooses for separators" and function as a cipher key. However, their unique properties (letters, nooses) are not causally essential; she could use any randomized letter source. They do not constrain a choice or charge the final image. Present in setup and middle, but not in closure; cap at ~6.0 per gate model, then reduce for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" shapes Lyra's stance throughout: it is "the only dry thing she could breathe," and she answers the guardian "in the same tone she used in lullabies." It influences her tactics (refusing to panic, maintaining steady composure) and is thematically present in the ending: "calm defiance encoded as strength, out into the night tide." However, it functions more as consistent characterization than as a constraint that forecloses an alternative path with visible cost. Present across all three gates and causally relevant, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra "explained through dance" by "tapping heel, wrist, and shoulder to punctuate which letters were real" and later "danced the answer" to fool microphones into hearing static. The trait enables a key middle choice (deceiving the guardian) and is seeded early. However, the on-page choreography is summary-level ("a sequence of steps that matched the dice letters") rather than dramatized with visible micro-choices and tradeoffs. Present in setup, middle, and closure mentions, but the cost and constraint are not viscerally legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the dominant action and stakes anchor: Lyra's goal is to free the detainees, and every beat serves that aim (writing codes, dancing the key, spinning the release wheel, leading them out). The action drives at least two major turns (guardian confrontation, manual release) and defines the ending (groggy researchers exit into night tide). Removing it would fundamentally break the story's logic. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coded journal entries are signaled early ("she opened her waterproof journal and began writing entries in a cipher keyed to the hangman's dice"), constrain middle choices (entries meant for Oren, "Entry Seven backward" spins the wheel), and shape the ending (journal left under console as decoy). Mechanics matter: the cipher's rhythm and the backward reading are causally active. Present in all three gates with demonstrated necessity. However, the method feels procedurally smooth rather than hard-won; no visible struggle or improvisation attaches cost to its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory pressures every choice: saltwater against cracked glass, pods wired to broadcast tampering, flooded acoustic sensors, waist-deep water at the exit. The setting supplies resources (manual release wheel, sensors to reroute) and obstacles (coral-scabbed door, guardian surveillance). It constrains tactics (cannot cut power) and is integral to the closure image (exit into night tide). Removing the specific sunken-lab properties would break the story's causal logic. Present across all three gates with high irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" is invoked in the opening line and the spider reappears ("adding spoke after spoke," "finished its web and dropped to the floor"), with Lyra taking the drop as her cue. The metaphor seeds a timeframe and recurs with shifted meaning at closure. However, the actual passage of time is not tracked or tightened; no live clock narrows options. The spider functions more as motif than as temporal constraint. Present in setup and closure, but missing meaningful middle development as a time pressure; cap per gate model at ~4.6, slight lift for lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated early ("she had come back... to encrypt vulnerability as strength, because the council fed on confessions") and thematically present at closure ("calm defiance encoded as strength"). It shapes her approach (coded entries, trusting the freed to carry meaning) but remains more thematic claim than dramatized friction. The desire is clear, yet we do not see her vulnerability tested or her strength questioned in a conflicted choice that incurs visible cost. Present across all three gates but told more than shown in crisis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is coherent: "every corridor felt strangely familiar in the dark," the guardian "once greeted her with the warmth of an old colleague," Oren is "her old partner." Tone modulates with pressure (guardian whispers, lights cut, sensors sing) and charges the final image (night tide exit with hidden meaning). However, the mystery is not deeply puzzling nor the familiarity deeply conflicted; the tone is consistent but does not undergo a decisive shift that reweights the stake. Present across all three gates with moderate integration.</comment>
