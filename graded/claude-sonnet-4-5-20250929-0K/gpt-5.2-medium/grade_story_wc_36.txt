<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's internal contradiction is well-embodied: her fear of the flute versus her drive to understand the pilgrim's loss creates genuine pressure. Her final realization—"guardianship was not the wall, it was the wayfinding, and she had guarded the wrong thing"—feels earned by the threshold-crossing and the encounter. The pilgrim's brief characterization is functional but his role as moral mirror rather than independent actor keeps this from higher bands. Micro-choices (placing markers, steadying breath with the pilgrim) demonstrate hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The Causal lens holds: Liora's choice to play the flute opens the corridor, the encounter teaches her what she guarded wrongly, and her second playing brings her back with new understanding. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): "the avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry" reweights her relationship to silence and guardianship, with the conceptual cost of accepting she feared herself. One meaningful tightening (threshold crossing) narrows options and the cost is legible in the acknowledgment of deafness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range constrains action: sound "sink[s], avalanchingly quiet and heavy," the split boulder functions as a threshold, and the driftwood markers are tactile wayfinding tools that matter. The altered canyon on the other side—"clouds frozen like ash," "taste of iron rain"—signals changed rules and pressures Liora's final understanding. The lacquered case, pale driftwood, and throat-shaped boulder anchor spatial choreography across the crossing. Setting detail is filtered through Liora's relic-keeper priorities and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding her failure and the pilgrim's loss) is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening: playing the flute opens the corridor and forces confrontation with the lost pilgrim. The pilgrim's question and the spiral driftwood deepen her understanding, narrowing her options to accept she "had feared the flute, and feared herself with it." Agency is clear—her choice to play, to listen, to accept help—and the cost is legible: she must acknowledge her deafness and shift from guarding rules to wayfinding. No multi-reversal needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (guardianship as wayfinding rather than wall) emerges from the driftwood geometry, the pilgrim's failed markers pointing "outward, away from help," and Liora's shift from rule-bound refusal to listening. The final image—"the avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry"—reweights silence from threat to resource without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the flute's duality (feared relic/answer), the mirrored failures, and the hand steadying breath. No prompt-label intrusions; the particulars (driftwood, canyon throat, frozen clouds) charge the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; psychic access remains bound to Liora throughout. Diction matches her relic-keeper idiom: "lacquered case," "directional markers," "old tremor lines." The prose modulates under pressure: brief fragments at the crossing ("barely sound, a thread of air"), longer meditative phrases during reflection. No head-hopping, no filter-stack issues. The pilgrim's single line of indirect speech ("asked why she had trusted rules more than a living voice") carries clear subtext. Voice is distinct and purposeful without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance situation, image, or choice. Rhythm varies purposefully (long meditative beats at setup, compressed action during the crossing). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "avalanchingly quiet," "surfaces of listening," "corridor made of echo and cold light" are vivid without muddle. Minor proximity concern: "the canyon had swallowed him as neatly as fog" and "water into sand" within close range, but both serve clarity and momentum. Sentence openings vary; no scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The wayfinding/guardianship reversal and the mirrored driftwood failures (Liora's inward markers vs. the pilgrim's outward ones) offer a fresh angle on mentor-failure narratives. The world-between design (canyon unchanged in shape but "emptied of weather") is specific rather than generic portal fantasy. Risk-taking in quiet closure and the avalanche-quiet motif add texture. The story commits fully to its premise without hedging. Not wholly original in frame (threshold-crossing, relic keeper) but the particular synthesis—driftwood geometry, flute as listening rather than command—feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's choices drive all major turns: arranging markers (setup), uncasing and playing the flute (inciting beat and threshold), accepting the pilgrim's help to steady breath (climax), playing again to return (resolution). Her realization that she "had guarded the wrong thing" is earned by these actions. Present across all three gates and causally active in at least three beats with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in setup (carried in lacquered case, backstory about council witness and refusal), is uncased and played to open the corridor (middle escalation), and played again with the pilgrim's hand steadying breath to return (closure). Its dual nature—feared versus answer, command versus listening—charges the final understanding. Essential across multiple beats and shapes the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds structures stakes: the flute "could stitch a path between what was and what might have been," Liora crosses into the altered canyon where the pilgrim waits, and the crossing enables the confrontation that reweights her guardianship. The concept constrains choices (playing the flute is the mechanism) and alters tactics (she must listen rather than command). Present in setup, drives middle action, and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" is established early ("sound did not travel so much as sink, avalanchingly quiet and heavy"), shapes atmosphere throughout (the canyon as "surfaces of listening"), and reappears in the ending ("the avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry"). The trait enables her final shift but does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost beyond tonal resonance. Strong lyric reprise but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uncasing the flute is the pivotal action: it follows the decision to confront failure, it precedes the playing that opens the corridor, and the moment is dramatized with care ("sliding the lid back as if the motion might wake something between notes"). The action redefines options—without it, no crossing, no encounter, no closure. Major turn traces directly to this beat. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood markers is signaled early ("began arranging driftwood as directional markers, each branch angled toward a notch"), used as a method to navigate ("a trail the lost pilgrim never had," "following her own driftwood geometry in her mind"), and mirrored in the pilgrim's failed attempt ("broken driftwood lay in a spiral...his markers had pointed outward, away from help"). The method shapes wayfinding tactics and charges the thematic lesson. Present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range pressures all choices: the canyon's sound-sink quality ("avalanchingly quiet"), the split boulder as threshold, the altered canyon on the other side, and the physical markers constrain wayfinding. Liora's movements are grounded in ravine floor, boulder throat, ledge. The setting supplies the constraint (navigating by markers) and charges the final image (the hush as answer). Essential across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the guardianship ended" frames the story's present and motivates Liora's return; the temporal marker signals stakes (dismissed, no longer council-bound). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no countdown, no urgency tied to elapsed time. The "after" functions as setup context rather than a live clock. Functional but does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To harvest insights from failure" is dramatized in Liora's return to the canyon, her choice to play despite council prohibition, and her acceptance of the pilgrim's teaching. The motivation is conflicted: she fears the flute and herself, yet chooses to uncage it. The friction between wanting understanding and fearing transformation drives the central choice. Present in setup, tested in the crossing, and paid off in the realization. Visible cost in acknowledgment of deafness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Canyon hush is established early ("sound did not travel so much as sink, avalanchingly quiet and heavy"), sustained through the crossing ("the hush deepened until it felt engineered"), and charges the final image ("the avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry"). Tone modulates under pressure (the hush as threat, then as listening surface, finally as answer) and supports the shift from fear to acceptance. Coherent through turns and resonant at closure.</comment>
