<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"felt vibrations thin under her boots, like breath held too long"—and her micro-choices (picking up the needle, reversing the phonograph, scoring the record) accumulate under pressure. Her deafness functions as a perceptual filter rather than a label, shaping how she reads rhythm and silence. The Listener and Kerrin remain functional but underdeveloped; Kerrin's confession of numbness arrives without prior dramatized resistance. Mara's final insight—"play the song backward if you must, but keep it moving until hearts remember forward"—feels slightly over-articulated for the moment, edging toward theme statement rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of silence-as-parasite through layered images (filament of hush, mirrored echo, wrapped drums) and tightens via the backward-phonograph reversal, culminating in the filament's snap and the Listener's retreat. Orientation anchors (Mara, quarry path, cavern) land cleanly by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the filament snaps, the drum "thrum[s] cleanly," and Mara pockets the needle with a new lesson, reweighting prior numbness with tactile forward motion. Cost is felt in the sustained effort and the Listener's "shuddering sigh," though the victory image could carry sharper consequence. One meaningful tightening (the backward-crank sequence) drives the reconfiguration without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern functions as micro-setting: its "mirrored hush," thinning vibrations, and "deeper chambers" shape Mara's tactics (pressing palm to wall, conducting with hands) and house the Listener. The antique phonograph and needle are tactile anchors that constrain the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, wall, darker chambers). The "faint rustle of turning seasons" and the shift "from dry to wet in a single scented breeze" charge the ending image, linking interior reconfiguration to environmental change. Sensory detail (drip, echo, heat in ribs, gray pollen) is purposeful and filtered through Mara's deafness, though the "scented breeze" at the turn risks soft coincidence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: defeating the filament of hush that feeds on unattended sorrow and causes emotional numbness. The stake is signaled early (Mara's "blank stare," Kerrin's muted drums) and tightens when Mara realizes the filament is "a parasite of feeling." The backward-phonograph sequence is protagonist-driven and narrows options—"she could not simply break the phonograph, because the cavern would spin new silence from the shards"—forcing the scored-record tactic. The Listener's appearance and the filament's snap constitute one meaningful reversal that forecloses the parasitic cycle. Cost is legible (Kerrin's fierce hope, the Listener's retreat, Mara's pocketed needle as a material remnant), though the victory could land with sharper relational or occupational consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: silence as weight, numbness as parasite, backward motion as forward progress. The broken needle shifts from tool to weapon to keepsake, reweighting prior stillness. Mara's final insight—"play the song backward if you must, but keep it moving until hearts remember forward"—is near-thesis but grounded in the scored record and returning drum-thrum. The piece resists easy moral; the Listener is "freed" rather than destroyed, complicating the victory. Subtext operates in gesture (Mara's signing, the Listener's glassy eyes) and the mirrored hush as metaphor. The "gray pollen" and "scented breeze" risk soft symbolic convenience, yet the needle-as-blade and the classroom reprise anchor resonance in lived stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with clean focalization through Mara's deafness: she "read[s] music in faces and floors," feels "thread of stillness," and perceives "heat in her ribs" rather than sound. Perceptual signature is character-specific and controlled under pressure. Diction ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "startled mice") is purposeful and voice-consistent. No head-hopping. The final line's meta-commentary ("carrying with her a new lesson") edges toward summary but remains anchored in the pocketed needle and imagined classroom. Free indirect thought is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the needle-scoring, wider at the twilight exit). Sentence rhythm varies naturally without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: "every movement seemed to repeat without sound, and even Mara felt the vibrations thin under her boots, like breath held too long." Figurative language (filament, cobweb, startled mice, gray pollen) is consistent and legible, though "wrapped in wool" and "mirrored hush" risk mild repetition of the muffling concept. No paraphrase loops or template stems. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports accumulation. Minor filter-verb density in the middle third ("felt its jagged tip," "felt vibrations skitter") is voice-appropriate for a tactile POV. The phrase "conductor with her hands, shaping the backward melody into something the body could understand" works hard but remains clear. Final image ("twilight gathered, carrying with her a new lesson") risks slight overwriting but closes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, phonograph reversal, and silence-as-parasite is specific and non-obvious. The backward-song tactic transforms the trope of "broken tool" into active weapon. The Listener as "careful gardener" of numbness adds fresh dimension to the parasite metaphor. The piece commits to its premise (silence with weight) and follows through without retreat. Risk: the lyric register and conceptual density (filament, mirrored hush, Listener) demand reader trust but remain legible. The classroom frame and seasonal turn risk generic uplift, yet the scored record and pocketed needle ground the arc in tactile particulars. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and drives all key turns: picking up the needle (setup), reversing the phonograph and conducting (middle), scoring the record (climax). Her deafness constrains and enables tactics (tactile perception, signing to Kerrin). Classroom framing primes and closes the arc. Choices alter tactics and foreclose the parasitic cycle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The needle appears early (workbench), Mara "felt its jagged tip" and senses the "thread of stillness" (setup), sets it against the record to reverse (middle), uses it "as a blade" to score the record (climax), and pockets it "now only metal" at closure. Three distinct beats, causal pressure, and charged reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The filament is introduced via the needle's "thread of stillness" early, reappears as the explanation for numbness ("parasite of feeling"), resists being unwound during the reversal, and snaps at climax, "unraveling into harmless dust." It shapes stakes (defeating numbness) and tactics (cannot break phonograph, must score record). Causal pressure across three beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" is embodied early in Kerrin's drums that "rang strangely, audibly muted as if a hand cupped the air" and the cavern "learning to swallow" rhythm. It constrains diagnosis (Mara feels thin vibrations) and tactics (must restore echo). The climax reverses the muting when "the cavern answered with returning echoes." Setup, middle constraint, and closure reversal with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once at climax when the backward song enthralls the Listener "against its will," forcing its retreat. The action drives the resolution but lacks earlier setup or middle involvement. Strong causal role in one beat, but swappable language (e.g., "compel," "bind") would not alter structure. Late first appearance and single-beat use limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled via Mara's memory of using them "in class to make children feel rhythm in surprise" (setup), enacted when she "guide[s] Kerrin to crank the handle backward" (middle), and constitute the central tactic that tightens the filament and enthralls the Listener (climax). Mechanics matter: reversing, not restoring. Causal pressure across two beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cavern is present throughout as active pressure: it "magnified rhythm" before "learning to swallow it," its wall transmits "vibrations [that] skitter," and its "deeper chambers" house the Listener. The space constrains tactics (Mara presses palm to wall, Kerrin beats drum in counter-time) and supplies the phonograph. The cavern "answer[s] with returning echoes" at climax, participating in closure. Setup, middle resource, and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening line and at climax when "the seasons outside turning from dry to wet in a single scented breeze." It frames the arc but does not tighten decisions or tactics; no on-page clock pressures choices. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but lacks middle development. Swappable with other seasonal or atmospheric markers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation to defeat emotional numbness is dramatized early (Mara's "blank stare," Kerrin's fear, students' faded laughter), drives the diagnosis ("parasite of feeling, feeding on unattended sorrow"), shapes the backward-phonograph tactic (must unwind the filament, not break it), and resolves when the drum "thrum[s] cleanly" and Mara imagines her classroom "as a place where even silence could be shaped into feeling." Causal pressure across all beats, visible cost (effort, risk), and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is established early ("drip and echo became a mirrored hush," "every movement seemed to repeat without sound"), intensifies when Mara feels "the filament of hush" resist unwinding, and modulates at climax when the scratches let "a thin sting of sound escape the mirrored hush." The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final snapping image. Strong setup, middle intensification, and closure modulation.</comment>
