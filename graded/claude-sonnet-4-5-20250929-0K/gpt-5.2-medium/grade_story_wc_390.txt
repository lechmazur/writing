<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's "logically emotional" nature is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory action—he calculates tide tables while his throat tightens, but this duality never creates genuine on-page tension or forces a difficult choice. The thieves' motivations shift abruptly: they begin as mercenary traders, then one confesses a buried trauma (brother under ice) without prior seeding, reading as convenient absolution rather than earned pressure. The sonic-absolution moment bypasses real conflict; the thieves simply stop wanting the relic after hearing a tuning fork, and Lio's final act of handing the key back feels like symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with light Situational shading (the thieves arrive, Lio uses sound to defuse them). Orientation is clear early. The closure—Lio hands the key to the trader, the thieves leave "empty-handed" but "carrying only a new quiet inside"—aims for Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is unclear: Lio retains the key ("key tucked safe"), so no actual forfeiture occurs, and the thieves' transformation feels imposed by the fork's magic rather than earned through on-page pressure. The "sonic absolution" resolves the conflict conveniently rather than through protagonist struggle, weakening causality at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered (floes nudging pilings, copper water, creaking planks) and the setting constrains the confrontation spatially—Lio presses his palm to a piling to feel vibrations, using the environment's resonance. The lighthouse chapel and crypt anchor the stakes materially. Micro-setting (the dock's vibration, the maintenance fork) charges the climax, lifting the score into the 7s despite some ornamental flourishes ("water shone copper," "sky against sunset") that don't alter choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the relic to keep drowned sailors' souls anchored—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when the thieves lunge, but Lio's response (striking a tuning fork to align vibrations and "loosen their craving") bypasses genuine conflict; the traders fold immediately without testing his commitment or forcing a trade-off. The hand-back of the key in the final beat gestures at reconciliation but carries no visible price: Lio still controls the crypt, the relic remains safe, and the thieves depart voluntarily. One tightening is present but the cost is abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief, forgiveness, and resonance as cleansing—emerges through the sonic-absolution conceit and the trader's confession. The tuning fork and aligned vibrations function as extended metaphor, but the final paragraph risks moralizing: "the thieves returned...carrying only a new quiet inside" tells rather than images the transformation. The story resists a tidy moral by leaving the trader's guilt unresolved beyond the moment, yet the "fleshly ethereal" tone and "sonic absolution" language veer toward concept label rather than earned particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lio; perceptual signature is clear (he listens to vibrations, measures grief, calculates while feeling). Diction is elevated and poetic ("ribcage," "slice of sky," "blood into bandage") but remains consistent and voice-motivated, fitting a reflective engineer. The trader's glassy eye and whispered confession add texture. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("museum piece"). Distance control is clean, no head-hopping, and the final image ("one shared hum, fleshly ethereal") sustains the lyric register without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense ("old ribcage," "teeth caught the last gold light like a tiny crown," "blood into bandage") but mostly coherent. Two issues lower the score: **paraphrase loops** ("he wanted their craving to loosen, the way salt loosens a knot" restates the sonic-absolution effect already shown) and **overwriting in the climax**—"adjusted his strike, nudging the pitch until the dock's groan and the fork's ring aligned. The aligned tone made the planks shiver" recycles the alignment concept across adjacent sentences. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fleshly ethereal," "vibrational matching") that feels imported rather than embodied. No major artifacts touch closure directly, so the penalty remains moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "sonic absolution" conceit is fresh on first encounter, blending lighthouse-keeper duty with sound-healing metaphysics. The drift-ice marina and crypt-keeper role add specificity. However, the emotional arc—hardened thieves transformed by a tuning fork—echoes familiar redemption templates, and the resolution (hand the key back as forgiveness-weight) feels conceptually tidy rather than surprising. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or irreversible cost, landing mid-band for originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lio (azure-coat lighthouse engineer) is present throughout and makes the key decisions: confronting the thieves, using the tuning fork, and handing the key back. His occupation informs his method (maintenance fork, vibration sensitivity) and ties to the relic's guardianship. He appears early, drives two beats (confrontation, absolution), and participates in closure. However, his choices feel enabled by the sonic-absolution mechanism rather than personal cost or internal conflict, limiting irreplaceability—a different guardian with a different tool could execute a similar arc. Beat involvement and closure linkage lift the score into the 5s; lack of visible personal cost and modest causal pressure keep it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in multiple beats (Lio feels its chill, lifts it at the chapel door, turns it in the trader's palm), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (from lock to "forgiveness as weight"). It signals the stakes (artifact protection) and participates in the final image. However, it does not constrain Lio's choices under pressure—he never risks losing it, and the hand-back is symbolic rather than a forfeiture that alters his options. Two gates (setup, payoff) are strong; middle development is thin. Score reflects solid recurrence and thematic charge but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named early and explained via the old keeper's teaching; it defines the climax (tuning fork aligns vibrations to "loosen craving"). However, the concept is more method than stake—Lio's goal is to protect the relic, and sonic absolution is the tool he uses to defuse the thieves. The concept does not constrain his tactics (he could have used persuasion or force), and its mechanics feel convenient rather than costly. It shapes one beat but does not drive the ending's charge independently of the character's choice. Functional but largely replaceable with another de-escalation method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is asserted in exposition ("a man who could calculate tide tables while his throat tightened at the cry of gulls") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Lio's behavior—calm confrontation, methodical sound-matching—reads as uniformly rational; no moment shows emotion pulling against logic or logic failing under emotional pressure. The trait is label-only, ornamental, and does not alter tactics or cost. Present but without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" appears twice: once when Lio "adapted, not with fists, but by stepping into the rhythm of the dock," and implicitly in the closing line ("ready to adapt again"). The first instance drives the confrontation beat, enabling his sonic response rather than physical combat, and the word signals his tactical flexibility. However, the action is somewhat generic—many protagonists adapt under pressure—and the specific form (listening to vibrations, matching pitch) is more "through vibrational matching" than "adapt" per se. One key turn is shaped, and the word recurs at closure, but it could be replaced with "respond" or "adjust" without major structural loss. Solid single-beat driver, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is signaled in the first third (Lio presses palm to piling, feels vibrations, strikes the maintenance fork, "adjusted his strike, nudging the pitch until the dock's groan and the fork's ring aligned"). The method shapes the middle beat (aligned tone makes the planks shiver, thieves falter) and ties to the ending's "shared hum." It is specific, demonstrated on the page, and enables the resolution. However, the mechanics are somewhat opaque—how alignment "loosens craving" is asserted rather than shown—and the method does not impose visible cost on Lio. Two gates (setup, development) are strong; closure linkage is thematic rather than active. Score reflects solid mechanical presence and beat involvement but limited irreplaceability and cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors the entire scene: floes nudge pilings, the dock creaks, Lio uses the planks' vibrations as his tool, and the spatial layout (dock, skiff, lighthouse, chapel) choreographs the confrontation. The setting provides the resource (dock vibrations) that enables Lio's tactic and supplies the "copper water" and "blue-white ice" that color the tone. It is present early, shapes the climax, and recurs in the final image ("the dock, the ice, and the human breath all settled into one shared hum"). Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure participation. Modest causal pressure (the dock could be any resonant structure) and lack of visible constraint (the setting enables rather than limits) keep it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" is introduced in the opening and mentioned twice more ("the sunset was slipping fast," "last gold light," "falling light," "night finally took the marina"). It suggests urgency—Lio knows "the chapel crypt would open to anyone with the key once darkness fell"—but this deadline is not tested; Lio resolves the conflict well before nightfall, and darkness arrives only after the thieves have left. The timeframe colors the atmosphere but does not tighten tactics or force a trade-off. Functional mood-setter, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's desire to protect the sacred artifact (relic that anchors drowned sailors' souls) is established early, dramatized when he refuses the coin pouch and defends against the lunge, and sustained through the ending (he locks the chamber, keeps the key safe). The motivation drives his confrontation choice and shapes the absolution tactic (he wants to let the thieves "step away from theft without shame" rather than hurt them). However, the motivation is never conflicted—Lio faces no temptation, doubt, or cost in defending the relic—so friction between want and price is absent. Strong setup and beat involvement; limited internal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" tone is sustained throughout: sensory groundedness (ice crunching, beeswax warmth, "throat tightened at the cry of gulls") braided with lyric abstraction ("slice of sky," "bone remembered bone," "confession seemed to drain into the sound like blood into bandage," final "fleshly ethereal" tag). The tone modulates subtly—urgent physicality during the lunge, meditative register during the absolution, quiet resonance at closure—and charges the final image ("one shared hum, fleshly ethereal in the falling light"). Coherent across turns, anchored in concrete detail, and integral to the story's atmosphere. The explicit naming of the tone in the closing beat risks meta-commentary but lands as intentional cadence rather than label.</comment>
