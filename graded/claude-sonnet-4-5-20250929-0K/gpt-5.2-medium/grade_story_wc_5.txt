<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation (translating heartbeats into maps) drives her actions through the orchard, and the physical demonstration of patience is embodied consistently. The arrival of the cartographer offers a moment of shared purpose, but the stranger remains largely passive—no interior contradiction or competing impulse surfaces. The final choice to copy the intervals feels inevitable rather than costly, and the piece leans on abstract interiority ("she understood") without dramatizing a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through ritual arrangement, flash-paper ignition, sealing, and the aurora's response. Orientation anchors (subarctic crater, withered orchard, post-meteor world) arrive early. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—when the copied intervals cause the aurora to loosen, crystallizing the map's purpose without a decisive physical change. Cost is conceptual (starlight passed on "without breaking the seal"), visible in the final image but not viscerally felt as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crater-orchard setting pressures Eira's movements (careful steps, kneeling until joints ache) and supplies the ice-capped well as the sealing site. The arrangement of spoons, lenses, and wire on snow integrates micro-setting into ritual action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Eira's priorities (sap trying to move, heartbeat thud), and the frozen soil's "remembered starlight" constrains her approach. The aurora's loosening at closure charges the spatial frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving starlight for guidance—is signaled early and tightens when Eira seals the plate to the well, foreclosing panic or theft. The cartographer's arrival introduces a micro-turn (invitation to read the map), and the aurora's response deepens meaning without a reversible conflict. One meaningful escalation occurs (sealing the plate), and cost is legible in the binding act, though the piece avoids a sharp trade-off or visible price paid in tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (stillness as shared refuge, patience as resistance to panic) emerges through ritual, the heartbeat-map translation, and the final aurora movement. The storybook plate's sleeping child and star ladder seed the ending's resonance when starlight "remembered its purpose." Subtext operates in Eira's kneeling posture and the cartographer's reluctant breath clouds. The final image—aurora loosening—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to endure breath-holding) without moralizing, though the concept occasionally tilts abstract ("safekept starlight waking").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature (sap thud, wrist rhythm) filtering the crater world. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("flash-paper alchemist," "the intervals between her heartbeats") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under pressure. The cartographer's arrival introduces a second presence without voice distinction (no dialogue), so the convergence test does not apply. Free indirect access to Eira's understanding ("she understood that her map would guide") leans tell-heavy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (orchard as metronome, stars biting like teeth) is vivid. However, scaffold phrases recur: "she came here because," "she meant to," "she understood that" cluster in exposition. The opening sentence runs long with nested clauses, and a paraphrase loop appears ("safekept starlight" recurs four times without variation). Template cadence in the sealing sequence ("she knelt until," "she traced," "she pressed") flattens momentum. Clarity remains high, but density suffers from these loops, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for pattern artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—translating heartbeats into maps via flash-paper and discarded camp items—feels specific and non-obvious, and the withered orchard as observatory hollow offers a fresh post-catastrophe frame. The ritual of arranging refuse into constellations transforms the alchemist trope. Risk-taking (the aurora as responsive rather than inert) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise, though the "world holds its breath" frame and the stranger's arrival lean familiar; transformation arises from the heartbeat-map mechanic and the sealing act.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira (flash-paper alchemist) drives all major beats: gathering items, arranging patterns, igniting the plate, sealing it to the well. Her choices shape the map's creation and the aurora's response at closure. The attribute (patience demonstrated physically) is present but functions more as character color than a constraint that narrows options; swapping "alchemist" for another craft role would require only minor edits to the flash-paper mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate appears in beat one (Eira carries it), is handled in beat two (pressed against flash paper, stars etching), and is sealed to the well in beat three, shaping closure when the cartographer sees it glowing. Its etched star ladder is causally necessary for the starlight to "recognize" and inhabit the map. Removing it would break the story's central image and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Safekept starlight is the story's core premise: Eira seeks it, the crater's soil "remembered" it, and it wakes in the plate's lines, enabling the map. It shapes her tactics (sealing to prevent theft) and drives the ending when starlight "remembered its purpose." However, the mechanics remain abstract—how starlight was stored or why it responds to heartbeat intervals is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eira demonstrates patience physically in two on-page actions: walking with slow, careful steps and kneeling until joints ache. These gestures embody her approach and contrast the world's panic, but they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—she could perform the same ritual without this attribute. The trait enriches tone but remains ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sealing action (tracing glowing map with wax, binding plate to ice cap) is the story's climax, preventing theft and enabling shared guidance. It appears in beat three and defines closure when the aurora loosens in response. Removing the seal would collapse the ending's logic and the map's function. The action is irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Creating patterns with discarded items (spoons, lenses, wire, ledger pages) is signaled early and executed in beat two, generating shadows that fix constellations onto the plate. The method shapes the map's form and is necessary for the starlight to inhabit the intervals. Its mechanics matter: the spiral and radiating arrangement translate heartbeat rhythm. Without it, the map could not exist.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The withered orchard in the subarctic crater provides the frozen soil (remembered starlight), the ice-capped well (sealing site), and the quiet that lets Eira hear sap and heartbeat. The setting is signaled in sentence one and constrains her actions throughout (careful steps, kneeling on snow). The aurora's response at closure ties the crater's spatial frame to the story's resolution, making the location causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the world holds its breath" is established early and creates atmospheric pressure (birds nest without singing, people count instead of naming). However, it functions as backdrop rather than a ticking clock—no on-page deadline tightens Eira's choices or alters her tactics. The breath-holding recurs in the cartographer's "reluctant clouds," but elapsed time remains vague and does not escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eira's motivation (to translate heartbeats into maps for navigation by living pulses) drives all her actions: arranging patterns, pressing flash paper, sealing the plate. It is stated explicitly and dramatized through ritual. Friction arises in the kneeling-until-joints-ache beat, showing patience's cost, and the ending fulfills the desire when the cartographer copies the intervals. The motivation is clear and structurally essential, though it is told more than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Moving stillness is coherent throughout: the orchard "stands as if sketched," the aurora is "unmoving" until the end, and Eira's slow ritual embodies stasis with purpose. The tone modulates subtly (quiet concentration to the cartographer's arrival to the aurora's loosening) without breaking the meditative frame. The final image—aurora moving "a fraction"—charges stillness with reawakening, making tone indispensable to closure.</comment>
