<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is grounded in concrete backstory (interrupted journeys, dead mother) and embodied through purposeful wandering that becomes method. Internal contradiction appears in "faith had been depending on arrival, not on direction"—a genuine realization that shifts her stance. The final choice to stay and "keep rebuilding" feels earned by her underground work and the notebook's lesson. Minor issue: Father Sava and the buried pilgrim remain functional props rather than sources of dynamic pressure, though this doesn't compromise Liora's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Liora, orchard catacomb, excavation window) appear within the first 150 words. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through wandering → tremor interruption → alcove inscription → tomb opening → notebook discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora sets the sundial and chooses to stay, reweighting "interrupted journeys" from curse to method. Cost is legible: she abandons further wandering to commit locally, and "faith that was now wide enough to include detours" reconfigures her earlier dependence on arrival. One tightening occurs when the tremor forces her to admit faith's flaw, deepening the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and selective: "tree roots snaked between bones," "ribs made pale trellises," "drafts that sounded like pages turning." The setting constrains choice (tremor caves the trench, forcing side-gallery exit; root corridors guide wandering) and charges the final image (sundial set "between two apple trunks," shadow sliding forward). Micro-setting detail (clay lamps, pocket watch stopped at noon, carved inscription) anchors the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across underground and surface moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring faith through work—is signaled early and tightens when the tremor interrupts, forcing Liora's admission that "faith had been depending on arrival." The notebook discovery deepens the stake by reframing interrupted journeys as legitimate paths. Agency is decision and endurance: she rebuilds after collapse, reads aloud to Sava, carves the new gnomon, and chooses to stay. Cost is visible: she forecloses departure and accepts local, incremental restoration over distant pilgrimage. One meaningful tightening (tremor/admission) plus a deepening (notebook) satisfy the length requirement under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—faith persisting through interruption—emerges from concrete events (tremor, alcove inscription, notebook of travelers who turned back) without direct thesis. The final image (shadow sliding forward, "time could resume without erasing the pauses") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The notebook's prayers ("where they turned back, whom they forgave") ground the theme in particular testimony rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in Liora's "warmly curious habit" and the orchard "listening," roots tightening. Minor slip: "restoration was not a return to the past but a decision to keep moving through it" edges toward summary, though it remains tied to Liora's realization rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora's "warmly curious habit," her treatment of bones with "gentle apologies," her filtering of detail through excavation method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the tremor, slightly distant during setup). Diction remains stable and apt ("cautious enchantment," "purposeful wandering"). Minor issues: a few filter verbs ("seemed to listen," "felt too familiar") dull immediacy, and one phrase—"cautious enchantment in the simple proof"—reads slightly elevated for the moment's pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("digging toward the dead might lead her back to something living"). Sentence openings vary, and figurative language (roots as corridors, drafts as pages) serves pressure without stacking. Two deductions: paraphrase loop in "interruption felt too familiar, like the ship that once turned back when her mother died, so she sat…and admitted…her faith had been depending on arrival"—the causal link is restated across two beats without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence stem "When the…" and "At the…" appear in adjacent structural beats, creating mild rhythmic monotony (−0.3). No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of catacomb excavation and interrupted-journey faith is specific and non-obvious; the notebook of travelers who "recorded where they turned back" transforms a familiar arc through concrete particulars. The alcove inscription ("Keep walking even when the hour breaks") and pocket watch stopped at noon feel earned in hindsight. The choice to stay and "keep rebuilding…through purposeful wandering" avoids the tidy pilgrimage-complete ending. Minor limitation: the broader frame (diaspora returnee restoring abbey pilgrimage) leans on familiar restoration-quest structure, though the execution is elevated by the orchard's embodied details and the redefinition of faith as process rather than arrival.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's diaspora-returnee status is signaled immediately ("twelve years in far ports") and causally shapes the dominant stake: her interrupted journeys and lost faith drive the excavation project. It enables middle choices (she approaches the orchard as a "map," treats bones with "gentle apologies" born of displacement) and directly shapes closure (her decision to stay rather than leave again, reversing the diaspora pattern). The trait is irreplaceable: remove it and the thematic weight of "interrupted journeys" and the final choice to "not leave again" collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in setup (trustees hire her to recover it), development (she sits against it post-tremor, admitting faith's flaw), and closure (she sets it on a plinth, carves a new gnomon, aligns it by stars, watches the shadow slide forward). It constrains tactics (buried under collapse, requires excavation stages) and charges the final image: "time could resume without erasing the pauses." The object's mechanics (marking prayer hours, now rebuilt to show continuity through interruption) are specific and irreplaceable. Scored high for three-gate presence, causal pressure, and closure linkage with visible cost (effort to rebuild, stars instead of sun).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is signaled in the first paragraph ("journeys had always been interrupted, by strikes, by storms, by letters"), shapes middle tactics (tremor interruption "felt too familiar," forces admission that "faith had been depending on arrival"), and is reweighted at closure via the notebook (travelers who turned back yet kept faith) and Liora's choice to stay. It narrows options: she can no longer depend on arrival as proof. Cost is visible: she accepts that detours are the method, not the obstacle. Removing this concept would break the thematic and causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears in setup ("warmly curious habit of asking names for every stone"), enables middle beats (she searches the tomb walls, reads the notebook aloud "warmly curious even in reverence"), and subtly charges closure (pilgrims read copied pages, she continues "purposeful wandering"). It constrains one on-page action with visible cost: her choice to search rather than seal the tomb opposes Sava's fear and leads to the notebook discovery. The trait is plausible but somewhat swappable with "persistent" or "open." Scored mid-band for two-gate presence, one causal beat, and closure participation, but lacks the irreplaceability seen in higher-scored elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early (trustees want her to "rebuild the dial and reopen the tomb"), drives multiple beats (she rebuilds after the tremor "shoring the passage," fits the sundial base with new mortar, carves a new gnomon), and is essential to closure (the rebuilt dial's shadow sliding forward proves "time could resume"). It narrows options: after the collapse, she must choose to rebuild or abandon the project; her choice to rebuild rather than flee answers the doubt. Cost is visible: physical labor, cataloging bones with apologies, mixing mortar from orchard clay. Removing "rebuild" would collapse the structural and thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled in setup ("walking it each morning in purposeful wandering until she learned which roots led to voids"), enables middle beats (she wanders "not to escape the work but to reframe it," finding the alcove inscription), and closes the story ("keep rebuilding…through the same purposeful wandering"). It shapes tactics: wandering teaches her the orchard's structure, allowing her to exit via side gallery and later locate the chapel alcove. The method's mechanics matter—contrast with aimless searching would fail. Cost: time and patience, acceptance of indirection. Irreplaceable: the method literalizes the theme of faith through interrupted paths.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced immediately ("orchard grew in a hollow of carved limestone, where tree roots snaked between bones"), constrains multiple beats (roots guide wandering, tremor caves the trench forcing side-gallery exit, child-sized niches, roots "tightening as though to brace the roof"), and charges closure (sundial set "between two apple trunks," pilgrims wander the orchard paths). It supplies resources (clay for mortar, fallen limestone for gnomon) and pressures choices (collapse forces detour). The setting's unique properties (roots interleaving bones, drafts like pages turning) are irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" establishes the timeframe ("began the excavation in small, deliberate stages," "Midweek…located the keystone," "days that followed," "when the doorway finally opened"). It tightens decisions moderately: the multi-day span allows for the tremor interruption and the choice to rebuild rather than abandon. Cost is visible in累积 labor (stages, ropes and wedges). However, the clock is loose—no urgent deadline pressures tactics, and the excavation could compress or extend without breaking causality. Scored mid-band for setup and development presence, modest causal pressure, and closure participation (excavation completes, sundial installed), but lacks the live-clock urgency that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To restore lost faith" is signaled in setup ("breaks had chipped away at the faith she once carried," abbey "lost its way after the war"), drives middle beats (tremor forces admission "her faith had been depending on arrival," notebook reframes faith as motion), and is reweighted at closure ("restored a lost faith that was now wide enough to include detours"). It constrains choices: she digs hoping work will lead back "to something living," reads the notebook aloud, chooses to stay. Cost is visible: she foregoes further travel, accepts incremental local restoration. Friction between want (arrival-dependent faith) and cost (enduring interruptions) is dramatized. The motivation is irreplaceable and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" modulates across the arc: cautious in Father Sava's wariness and Liora's "did not trust miracles," enchantment in "drafts that sounded like pages turning," "orchard above seemed to listen," and closure's "cautious enchantment in the simple proof that time could resume." Tone supports pressure (caution tempers wonder during the collapse, enchantment grows as the notebook reframes faith) and charges the final image (shadow sliding forward under storm-cleared sky). The tone is coherent and voice-specific, avoiding both cynicism and sentimentality. Minor limitation: the phrase "cautious enchantment" appears explicitly only at closure, risking a label rather than sustained tonal texture, though the emotional register supports it throughout.</comment>
