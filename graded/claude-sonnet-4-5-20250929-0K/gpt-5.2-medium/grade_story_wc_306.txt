<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's character is constructed through embodied particulars—her paid conscience role, her method of "sincerely insincere" engagement, her learned decoding of wind chimes. Interiority is present and character-specific, with her internal voice filtering through metaphors ("stacked stones," "cool smoke"). However, the final decision feels more announced than wrestled with; the cloak's tightening serves as external prompt rather than dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously in the scene. The arc from hired justifier to honest truth-teller lands, but the pivot lacks visible cost that forecloses her prior stance with embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece is single-POV, continuous in time, with clear who/where/when anchors by the opening lines. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered motifs (mirror shard, chimes, cloak) and a cadence shift at closure when Mara wears the cloak and speaks truth rather than delivering Sile's requested permission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—she keeps the cloak as a promise, reconfiguring her paid role into genuine conscience with felt cost (she can no longer sell easy stories). The cost is legible in "her paid conscience felt briefly like her own" and the trade-off of keeping the cloak versus delivering it. One meaningful deepening is present; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lighthouse at dawn, wind chimes tuned in code, the spiral stairs, the lantern room. The chimes constrain Mara's entry ("do not trust your certainty" shapes her choice to enter without a knife), and the cloak itself functions as micro-setting, a tactile object that "drinks the dawn and breathes it back as questions." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional priorities. The breezy lighthouse environment charges the final image—the dawn, the extinguished fire ring, the ash between them—grounding the thematic resolution in concrete spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: will Mara deliver the easy permission Sile wants, or risk honesty? One meaningful tightening occurs when the chimes warn against certainty and the mirror shows her past clients, narrowing her options from "sell the story" to "wear the cloak and speak truth." The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn driven, aligning with the inferred lens. Agency is present—Mara's decision to wrap the cloak around herself and later to tell Sile the honest warning. Cost is legible: she forfeits the easy transaction and takes on the burden of the cloak ("a promise to keep questioning for both of them"). No coincidence resolves the conflict; the choice is hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: certainty versus nuance, the hollowing effect of fear, the work of welcoming doubt without surrendering light. The cloak, mirror shard, and chimes function as non-literal vessels rather than overt symbols. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Mara keeps the cloak as embodied commitment, and Sile's nod accepts nuance without touch. The mirror's image of past clients who hired her to "justify cruelty, silence grief, or erase guilt" anchors the thematic cost in specific prior actions. No thematic echo or sermon in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—she decodes chimes, weighs unspoken doubts, filters the dawn through her professional lens. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional phrases ("cool smoke," "drink the dawn and breathe it back as questions") edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds vernacular grounding. The narrative stance is consistent, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is brief and goal-driven ("Bring this to the lantern room..."). One filter-verb cluster in the middle section ("understood," "felt," "saw") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally clean. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "as if conscience could be packaged like lamp wicks" and "as though the empty glass carried an absence," where the simile/metaphor work is slightly over-explained. One paraphrase loop: "the cloak of doubt did not simply cover shoulders, it covered motives" restates the idea without new pressure. No template cadence or heavy loops; clarity is maintained under pressure. Final image is purposeful and concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" premise is fresh, and the wind-chime code, hollow mirror shard, and cloak of doubt combine into a coherent symbolic vocabulary that feels integrated rather than checklist. The transformation of Mara from hired justifier to honest truth-teller is earned through prior particulars (the chimes' warning, the mirror's revelation of past clients). The ending avoids tidy resolution—Sile does not take the cloak, Mara keeps it as ongoing burden. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as "conscience for hire" is seeded in the opening paragraph, drives the middle conflict (will she deliver permission or risk honesty?), and shapes the closure (she keeps the cloak as genuine conscience). Her professional role constrains her initial impulse to sell easy stories and enables her final choice to speak truth. The role is causally active in at least three beats and indispensable to the arc. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard appears in three beats: Sile's handoff, Mara's use at the lantern room (showing her eyeless face and later the lineup of past clients), and placement in the ash at the ending. It constrains one choice (the chimes shift when the shard nears them) and charges the middle by revealing past complicity. However, at closure it is placed between them but does not reweight the final image decisively; the cloak and Sile's nod carry the ending. Two gates plus middle pressure, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "cloak of doubt" is introduced by ~40%, becomes the object Mara is tasked to retrieve, and is central to the climactic choice: she wears it instead of delivering it. The cloak constrains her final decision (it "tightened, urging her to risk being honest") and charges the ending when she keeps it "as a promise to keep questioning for both of them." It drives the middle unhooking beat and the closure act. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" is seeded early ("offering agreement with a smile while secretly weighing every unspoken doubt") and colors Mara's professional stance, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is described rather than dramatized in a choice that tests it. Present and thematically relevant, but largely ornamental in execution—swappable with a near-synonym like "performatively accommodating." Missing clear middle beat and closure pressure tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unhook" appears at ~60%, drives the climactic choice (Mara unhooks the cloak slowly and wraps it around herself instead of carrying it like a parcel), and this act redefines her options from delivery to embodiment. The unhooking is causally active and shapes the closure. However, the verb itself is mechanical; the emotional weight lies in what she does after unhooking (wrapping it around herself). Two gates plus closure participation, but moderate specificity—"take" or "remove" would function nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Deciphering wind chime selections is taught early ("Mara had learned his method during last week's watch, deciphering wind chime selections the way other people read letters") and used in two beats: entry (interpreting the triad and dull clink as "do not trust your certainty") and again when the pattern shifts near the mirror shard. The method constrains her entry choice (she enters without drawing her knife) and she listens again before unhooking the cloak. Present in setup, middle, and referenced at closure context. However, the mechanics remain somewhat vague—no on-page decoding struggle or failure. Two beats plus early signal, but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "breezy lighthouse at dawn" is anchored in the opening line and returns throughout: the spiral stairs, the lantern room, the extinguished fire ring outside at the ending. The breeze drives the wind chimes, which constrain Mara's choices. The dawn light is used when Mara holds the shard up "to the first light bleeding over the sea." The setting shapes two key beats (entry and the ending conversation) and charges the final image ("guarded dawn"). All three gates; causal pressure present but setting is more atmospheric frame than active constraint at the peak choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the campfire's last spark died" anchors the opening and implies immediacy (Sile wants the cloak unhooked "before morning"), but the time pressure is not tracked or dramatized. Mara walks, climbs, retrieves the cloak, and returns to Sile without any ticking-clock urgency or tactics shaped by the deadline. The dawn arrives, but no on-page consequence follows if she is late. Present in setup, but does not constrain middle or closure choices. Ornamental time marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To welcome nuance into certainty" is seeded in Mara's initial stance ("whisper questions they were afraid to ask themselves") and crystallizes when the chimes repeat the warning. This motivation drives her peak choice to wear the cloak and tell Sile the honest warning instead of delivering easy permission. At closure, she explicitly tells Sile "that wearing the cloak of doubt would not break his tower of stones, only teach it to bend in wind"—dramatizing the motivation. The desire is tested against her professional habit of selling easy stories, creating visible friction and cost. All three gates; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is coherent throughout: Mara keeps boundaries ("close enough to share warmth yet far enough to keep her boundaries"), the phrase "protected vulnerability was the only way to obey" appears explicitly at the entry beat, and the tone modulates from guarded professionalism to the ending's "guarded dawn" where "her paid conscience felt briefly like her own." The tone charges the final image—she leaves with the cloak "as a promise," both exposed and committed. Consistent across pressure; charges closure. High integration, though the explicit naming of the tone mid-text slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
