<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Safi's synesthetic ability is embodied through concrete choices: wrapping his hands in linen, spitting out fear-laced rainwater, accepting the pavilion's contagion with bare fingertips. Internal contradiction appears when he unwraps his hands despite knowing the cost, driven by his childhood dream to prove pain can be craft. The final choice to hold the weeping soldier and cook the broth carries visible cost—he absorbs and distributes the pavilion's remorse through his body. Minor slip: the Commander's "unspoken dream of mercy" tells rather than shows his motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Safi teaches the squad that remorse can be shared without spreading panic by containing it in himself, then distributing it in "small sanded portions" through the broth. The causal lens holds throughout: tasting memories → accepting contagion → blending it with his own failures → sharing controlled doses. Orientation anchors immediately (garrison chef, courtyard, post-rain). One meaningful tightening occurs when Safi descends and accepts the raw remorse, narrowing his options to either contain it or abandon his craft. Cost is legible: he carries the mixture in his body and the first soldier who touches him weeps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desert-as-former-shore conceit operates throughout: rainwater pools analyzed as tidal formations, coral pavilion beneath dunes, brine smell rising from the sinkhole. Setting constrains the descent choice (storm reveals the sinkhole) and the pavilion's frost-glazed coral architecture charges the final image of preservation and release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from courtyard to map room to sinkhole to cavity to return. Micro-setting detail (salt crystals, resin jars, ice under sand) shapes Safi's choice to unwrap his hands and accept direct contact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving that tasting pain can be turned into craft) is signaled early and escalates when Safi chooses to descend without a guard, then unwraps his hands to accept raw contagion. The tightening is causal: touching the resin floods him with workers' and soldiers' stored shame, forcing him to blend it with his own failures to soften it. Agency drives the turn—he kneels, unwraps, accepts—with visible cost (the first soldier weeps when touched). The broth scene completes the transformation by distributing controlled doses, teaching containment rather than spread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: remorse as preserved spice, tasting until you can name every note, mixing jagged bitterness into one blended whole. The pavilion's stored regrets (workers sealing it while children cried, soldiers abandoning friends, lovers trading silence) accumulate to illustrate how communities bury guilt. The final image—soldiers eating thin broth infused with "old regrets folded into his own"—answers the thematic question (can collective pain be managed?) without stating a moral. "Sturdy yet brittle as coral" threads through as both descriptor and conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with tight sensory filter: "his tongue caught memories," "his palms itched with borrowed shame." Diction stays consistent ("sandpaper rough memories," "scrape you raw," "grind it down") with culinary vocabulary woven through emotional processing. Perceptual signature is character-specific: analyzing tidal pool formations, tasting air, treating memory like tough meat. One brief register wobble: "emotionally contagious through touch" reads slightly clinical for the established voice but recovers quickly. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most sentences doing double duty (e.g., "tasting the air the way other people listened" establishes both ability and habit). Minor template cadence in the pavilion sequence: three consecutive sentences beginning with "The pavilion had / At the center sat / The pavilion had" creates brief monotony. Figurative language is dense but coherent: rain "worrying" the desert, stone that "remembered how to sweat," remorse "sturdy yet brittle as coral." One paraphrase slip: "accepting the contagion" and "let it scrape you raw" restate the same concept across adjacent beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of culinary skill, synesthetic empathy, and architectural memory storage feels specific and earned rather than assembled from tropes. The conceit that remorse can be "preserved like spice" and must be "tasted until you can name every note, then mixed with your own quiet failures" transforms familiar pain-management metaphors through Safi's craft. The coral-icebound pavilion beneath desert dunes is freshly imagined, and the choice to distribute remorse through broth avoids easy catharsis. Risk-taking in the lyric-dense prose and the refusal to dramatize Safi's childhood dream both heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Safi's ability shapes three key beats: tasting fear in rainwater and spitting it out (establishing constraint), unwrapping his hands to accept pavilion contagion (middle turn), cooking broth to distribute controlled remorse (closure). His choices drive escalation and the final image depends on his capacity to blend and portion memories. Early signal in paragraph two, causal pressure throughout, closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pavilion appears at midpoint, structures the descent sequence, and supplies the jars of resin that Safi touches to accept stored remorse. Its coral-and-ice architecture reinforces the "sturdy brittle" tone and the seawater-beneath-desert motif. Present in final image via "the pavilion's old regrets folded into his own." Two beats (discovery, contact with jars) and closure contribution, but introduced after first third; apply modest late penalty within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the story's engine: it explains the pavilion's purpose, drives Safi's descent, defines the jars' contents, and structures the climactic choice to accept and blend the emotion. The concept shapes tactics (unwrapping hands, mixing with his own failures, portioning into broth) and the final image of soldiers eating shared grief. Signaled early ("the fortress's own guilt"), developed through the pavilion, and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Touch-contagion constrains Safi's behavior throughout: wrapping hands in linen when serving, descending alone, unwrapping to accept pavilion memories, holding the weeping soldier to teach containment. The trait enables the climax (bare contact with resin) and the resolution (distributing through food and then direct touch). Visible cost when the first soldier weeps and Safi must steady him. Early setup, middle and closure use, causal pressure clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Subsume" structures the core transformation: Safi must let the pavilion's remorse "be subsumed into a living mouth that could grind it down," then he subsumes it by "mixing the remorse with his own quiet failures so it softened." The action defines both the middle beat (accepting contagion) and the resolution (letting soldiers "borrow, in small sanded portions" the folded regrets). Removing this exact verb weakens the culinary-emotional metaphor and the stakes of absorption versus distribution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations appears once to guide Safi to the sinkhole spiral: "He found the sinkhole by following how the rain had pooled, analyzing tidal pool formations in the mud." The method is signaled, used on-page, and fits the desert-as-shore conceit. However, it does not constrain later choices or reappear at closure; it functions as a single-beat enabler rather than shaping multiple tactics. Solid functional integration but not indispensable beyond the search.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain frames the entire narrative: rain reveals the sinkhole, "dark and rinsed" walls establish mood, the courtyard is the opening and closing location, and the storm's pooled water guides Safi's search. The setting supplies the resource (revealed pavilion) and the atmospheric through-line (brine, frost, salt crystals juxtaposed with desert). Present in opening, middle (descent), and closing (courtyard return, cooking scene). Solid integration across beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" appears once as Safi's motivation for descending alone, then the phrase never recurs or shapes later choices. The timeframe is more thematic marker than tactical constraint—no clock tightens decisions and the dream's content remains abstract. Lyric resonance between "unspoken dream" and the soldiers' "dreams stayed unspoken but less sharp" in the final line provides modest reprise, but the element does not drive beats or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to "sandpaper rough memories out of the men" drives Safi's descent and unwrapping choice, and the final broth scene literalizes the metaphor by distributing "sanded portions" of remorse. The motivation is dramatized through action (accepting raw contagion, blending bitterness, portioning carefully) with visible cost (carrying the mixture in his body, teaching through the soldier's tears). Early signal via Commander's request, middle enactment, closure payoff. Friction between wanting to help and the pain of absorption is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sturdy yet brittle as coral" is applied explicitly to the stored emotions and implicitly governs the prose texture: sentences are compressed and imagistic (brittle) yet carry weight (sturdy). Tone modulates with pressure—lyric density in the pavilion, tighter syntax when Safi accepts contagion, quieter cadence in the broth scene—without breaking coherence. The final image of soldiers eating "thin broth" with "less sharp" dreams embodies the brittleness softened into something sturdy enough to hold. Tone charges the closure and remains consistent through turns.</comment>
