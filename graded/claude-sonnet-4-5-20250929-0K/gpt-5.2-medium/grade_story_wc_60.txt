<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation (childhood illness driving her mission to liberate trapped memories) is established and sustains the quest, but her "luminous skeptic" identity operates largely as a label with texture rather than generating meaningful internal contradiction under pressure. The climactic choice to "carry light back toward the fountains" despite recognizing her mother's protective intent feels enacted rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal competing values. Her "practiced doubt" and "realistically imaginative" traits are invoked frequently but seldom constrain a tactic or force a visible tradeoff in the underground hall.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (breadcrumb trail → underground hall → constellation match → box opening), and the ending image (Mara carrying freed light back to the city) delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the city will remember and ache. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (city, Mara, Archivists' commission), and the sidereal-patience motif recurs purposefully. However, the latch mechanism feels more like a puzzle solution than a tightening driven by protagonist agency; the final "listening to the room" beat leans on atmospheric patience rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is rendered with vivid, selective detail ("dry basins held only chalky moons," "air smelled of old copper," "fountainheads lay stacked like skulls"), and the underground engine room provides concrete spatial grounding that charges the closure image. The limescale breadcrumbs and constellation pedestal constrain Mara's approach, meeting the 9+ gate test. The faint slippage: "cold smell of wet stone that should not have existed in a dry city" is noted but does not resolve on the page, leaving a small credibility gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the box to free trapped memories—is signaled early and sustained. The quest structure delivers one meaningful tightening when Mara realizes "unstick was not only force but release," shifting her tactic to sidereal patience. Yet this shift reads more as thematic insight than a choice that forecloses a live option or imposes visible cost in the moment. The revelation about her mother raises stakes conceptually but does not alter Mara's immediate action at the closure beat, leaving escalation under the Accumulative lens coherent but thin on protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of forgetting, patience, and defiant remembrance; the constellation-pedestal match and the "rehearsing water" image avoid overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Mara's choice to let the city remember "even if remembering made it ache" reweights the premise without a stated moral. The mother's protective motive adds depth, though it arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, preventing full integration of the familial layer into prior beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience," "defiant hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices pipes, valves, hairline gaps—but diction occasionally drifts into lyric elevation ("eyelid," "rehearsing") that reads more authorial than character-bound under stress. The climactic beat's interiority ("stopped pushing and listened to the room") relies on atmospheric patience rather than embodied micro-choice, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and often dense ("where dry basins held only chalky moons"), but several beats exhibit template cadence and figurative stacking without earned payoff: "an illness that blurred everything," "water remembered, not flowing but rehearsing," and the extended opening sentence runs through multiple clauses in a single breath. The constellation-match beat ("her realistically imaginative mind saw how a mechanic might have used sky patterns") tells rather than shows the causal insight. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (latch scene, final light-carrying image) lowers information density and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—city of dry fountains, trapped memories in a stained glass box, breadcrumb quest—synthesizes several familiar motifs (lost archives, patient hero, parental secret) without a sharp non-obvious angle. The "sidereal patience" and "realistically imaginative" attributes offer textural freshness but function more as voice flourishes than as constraints that generate surprising turns. The mother revelation arrives late and is recounted rather than discovered through dramatized evidence, reducing its ingenuity and making the ending feel more received than earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's "luminous skeptic" identity is established early (setup gate met) and shapes her acceptance of the Archivists' commission and her methodical search for the hairline gap (development gate met). She appears in the ending, carrying freed light back to the city (payoff gate met). However, her skeptical trait does not visibly constrain a high-pressure choice or force a tradeoff; the shift to "stopped pushing and listened" reads as thematic patience rather than a decision that narrows options. Two distinct beats (accepting the box, finding the gap) and closure linkage lift the score, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (a similarly patient character could perform the same actions) prevent entry to the 7.0+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box is handled or referenced in multiple beats: Archivists present it, Mara carries it "close to her ribs," she sets it on the pedestal and turns it to match the constellation, it opens "like an eyelid" releasing trapped light, and she gathers the freed light at the end (setup, development, payoff gates all met). The box's constellation panels directly enable the key tactic (matching to the crumb map), meeting causal pressure. Strong beat involvement (≥3 distinct beats) and closure linkage (the opening releases the memories that Mara carries forward) support a high score. Slight friction: the latch mechanism ("waited...until the gears answered her breathing") leans atmospheric rather than showing how the box's specific properties constrain her choice, preventing full 8.5+ indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is introduced early ("she practiced sidereal patience, the kind of waiting that belongs to stars") and recurs at the climactic latch beat ("used sidereal patience again, waiting through her own impatience until the gears answered"), meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. It shapes the key tactic (stop pushing, listen) at the closure threshold, meeting causal pressure. However, the concept functions more as a thematic label than a constraint with visible cost; the text does not show what Mara sacrifices or forecloses by adopting this patience, and a simpler "she waited" would convey similar causality. Beat involvement (two distinct applications) and closure linkage lift the score into mid-6s, but lack of felt cost and partial swappability prevent entry to 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is introduced in the opening paragraph and invoked at the pedestal ("her realistically imaginative mind saw how a mechanic might have used sky patterns"), meeting setup and development gates but not clearly participating in the ending (payoff gate missed). The trait is told rather than shown through an on-page action with cost; the pedestal insight is recounted in summary rather than dramatized as a choice that alters tactics. Late first explicit use in a functional beat (pedestal scene, roughly midpoint or later) and ornamental framing elsewhere (opening label) trigger late-appearance and swappability frictions. One beat involvement and no closure linkage cap the score in the 4.0–5.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unstick" is the Archivists' commission, framing the entire quest (setup gate met). Mara's realization that "unstick was not only force but release" shifts her tactic to listening rather than pushing, directly enabling the latch to open (development gate met). The opened box releases the trapped memories that Mara carries at the end (payoff gate met). All three gates are satisfied, and the action drives two key beats (realization, box opening) with closure linkage. Causal pressure is moderate: the shift from force to release matters, but the mechanism (gears "answered her breathing") leans atmospheric, reducing specificity. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage support a 7.0+ score; slight swappability (a similar "unlock" or "open" could serve with minor edits) and the atmospheric resolution mechanism prevent entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Following breadcrumbs is signaled early (Archivists' clue, geese pause) and executed on the page: Mara waits for the geese, sees the limescale trail, follows it through alleys, and uses a chip as a key to open the maintenance door (setup, development, and payoff gates all met). The method constrains her path and enables a key tactic (chip-as-key), meeting causal pressure. Beat involvement is strong (≥3 distinct beats: waiting, following, using chip). However, the breadcrumbs do not reappear in the final image, and once the door is open, the method's role ends; closure linkage is indirect (it leads to the underground hall where the resolution occurs). Strong early and middle work with partial closure linkage and moderate irreplaceability (a similar "follow the trail" could function) place the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is established in the opening line, supplies the limescale breadcrumbs and underground engine room (setup and development gates met), and the ending image commits to returning freed memories "toward the fountains" (payoff gate met). The setting provides resources (breadcrumbs, sealed door, pedestal) that constrain and enable Mara's tactics, meeting causal pressure. Beat involvement is strong (≥3 distinct beats). The final image ("carried it back toward the fountains, determined...to let the city remember") charges the closure with the setting's thematic weight. Slight friction: the underground hall's "cold smell of wet stone that should not have existed in a dry city" is noted but not resolved, creating a minor credibility gap that prevents full 8.5+ indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "pause of migrating geese" is introduced as the Archivists' clue and frames Mara's waiting at Fountain Square (setup gate met). She uses the pause as "her first measure of time" and the text notes "with the geese still paused aboveground" at the ending (development and payoff gates met, albeit thinly). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics in a legible way; Mara's underground actions are not visibly time-constrained by the geese's pause, and the final mention reads more as continuity note than a live clock altering moves. Two gates (setup, payoff as framing) plus minimal beat involvement (one functional use: the waiting scene) place the score in mid-5s; lack of causal pressure and swappability (a similar "dawn" or "quiet moment" cue could serve) prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to liberate trapped memories" is established early through her personal history (childhood illness that "blurred everything") and her acceptance of the commission (setup gate met). The motivation drives the entire quest structure and is dramatized in the box-opening sequence (development gate met). At the ending, she chooses to "let the city remember, even if remembering made it ache," directly enacting the motivation (payoff gate met). All three gates are satisfied, and the motivation appears in ≥3 beats (acceptance, quest, ending choice). Friction: the motivation is framed more as backstory rationale than as an on-page conflict with visible cost—Mara never hesitates or sacrifices a competing want, and the final choice feels inevitable rather than contested. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage with moderate causal pressure (no dramatized friction between the want and a cost) place the score in upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is introduced early ("a defiant hush inside her") and recurs at the ending ("determined in that same defiant hush"), meeting setup and payoff gates via lyric reprise. The tone is coherent through turns (Mara's quiet determination persists from commission to resolution) and modulates subtly with pressure (the box-opening beat quiets to listening). However, the tone functions more as atmospheric consistency than as a force that charges a specific choice or the final image with undeniable pressure. Lyric early-to-final reprise with tonal coherence and moderate modulation under pressure allow entry to low-6s; lack of a beat where the tone itself constrains a tactic or the final image's charge remains implied rather than felt prevent higher bands.</comment>
