<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between belonging to the dock and answering the sea's call is embodied through specific actions—coiling hawsers, diving for chains, refusing to bind what wants freedom. The micro-choices (pressing the scrimshaw into Rusk's hand, using the knife as lever) reveal hierarchy of values. Rusk's arc from binding to releasing his daughter is earned through the scrimshaw's heart-opening and his memory of her whale-song. Minor slip: the protagonist's transformation feels slightly telescoped in the final beats, though the renunciation of the apron carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist steps into "truest shape," Rusk releases his daughter with visible cost). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—causal through the scrimshaw's unlocking effect and Rusk's chain-work, accumulative through the whale-call pattern and sublittoral-fringe motif. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (dock worker, sublittoral checks, Disappearing Island). One meaningful tightening: the protagonist moves from checking pilings to actively detaching chains, and the final step into the sea forecloses the dock life with felt cost (the apron left as flag).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—knee-deep green water, barnacle-bit pilings, coral roots lifting from sand. The scrimshaw (warm as skin, glowing pale) and chains (iron links running into dark, sighing when released) are tactile and plot-active. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night dive and skiff approach. The setting charges the final image: stepping into "sublittoral green" to claim "truest shape" reweights the opening patrol beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus binding—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's choice to detach rather than chain. The scrimshaw's unlocking of Rusk's guarded heart is a genuine reversal that changes his stance from command to invitation. Agency is clear: the protagonist uses the knife as lever, works the chains with Rusk, and finally detaches from the dock. Cost is visible: Rusk loses his worker, the daughter drifts seaward, the protagonist abandons planks. The whale call operates as situational pressure that forces crystallization rather than solving the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—embrace of true nature versus imposed bonds—emerges through concrete actions (detaching chains, stepping into water) and charged objects (scrimshaw that unlocks, chains that sigh). The scrimshaw's return with new meaning (from pirate curiosity to heart-key to protagonist's self-recognition) layers resonance. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "truest shape" claimed by stepping into the sea reweights the opening dock-worker identity without stating a moral. Rusk's paradox—"Go, and come home when home fits"—embraces complexity. The only minor abstraction: "embracing one's true nature" risks prompt-echo, but it's embedded in action (apron left as flag, sea claiming shape).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hawser like a dancer," "barnacles bit," "combative tenderness, sharp words wrapped around careful respect." Voice modulates under pressure—short syntax when diving ("I dove... found... waited"), lyric compression at closure ("let the sea claim my truest shape"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Rusk's "Do not do this" fights the plea in his face; the protagonist's response about truer language persuades without lecturing. Minor convergence: a few late beats ("spared," "ready to yield") edge toward elevated diction, though they remain voice-plausible for a lyric narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: most lines do double duty (e.g., "Nobody could blame a knife, because no blade could draw blood anymore, only shame" establishes Accord rules and tonal irony). Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at high pressure, longer cadences in reflective beats. Two minor loops: "guarded heart/guarded hearts" recurs without added pressure, and "detach" appears four times with slight synonym variation. The final image—"stepped into the sublittoral green and let the sea claim my truest shape"—propels without scaffold, though "truest shape" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accord premise (violence impossible, blades draw only shame) is transformed through the scrimshaw's "unlock guarded hearts" mechanic and the chains-as-love metaphor. The disappearing island as answering call rather than theft subverts capture-rescue tropes. Combative tenderness—arguing with open hands, sharp words wrapped in respect—unifies tone and theme with fresh specificity. The synthesis of post-violence maritime world, whale-song agency, and renunciation-as-freedom feels earned and non-obvious. Risk: lyric compression and the "truest shape" motif charge the ending without obscuring causality.</comment>
