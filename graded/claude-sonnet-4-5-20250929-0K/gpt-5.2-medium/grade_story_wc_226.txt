<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's journey from banished artist to truth-teller is motivated, but her characterization relies heavily on told backstory rather than dramatized contradiction. The witness-to-murder setup and her choice to hide it through art is reported rather than shown through embodied tension. Her final sacrifice reads as motivated by the premise, but the internal conflict between self-preservation and exposure never acts simultaneously in scene. Jalen and the crowd function primarily as mechanisms rather than sources of relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal lens with clear escalation: Mara plants the truth through poetry, the crowd amplifies it, the killer is exposed, and she pays a price. However, orientation arrives late—who Mara is and what she witnessed emerges gradually through backstory rather than anchored early. The closure (loss of color vision) lands on the page with cost, but the speed from killer's lunge to judgment to Mara's blinding compresses three major beats into summary, weakening the felt impact of each turn. The cost-proof test is satisfied ("unable to see colors"), but the moment lacks sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and pale spire create a vivid, specific micro-world, and the echoes function as both atmosphere and mechanism. The prisms constrain Mara's final choice—she must destroy them to pay the price—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the crowd's movements and the killer's exact position during the lunge remain vague. The setting does more than decorate; it enables the refraction tactic and enforces the forgiveness price.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expose the killer without being silenced—is signaled early and tightens once: Mara refracts the accusation across many voices, forcing a confrontation. The crowd's echo and Jalen's intervention provide one meaningful escalation under the causal lens. However, the killer's lunge and capture occur in summary, and the elders' judgment arrives without visible negotiation or resistance, reducing the felt cost of each turn. The final sacrifice (ink and prisms) forecloses her art with on-page cost, satisfying the requirement, but the speed from exposure to resolution compresses the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—truth refracted through many mouths outlives the artist—emerges organically from action and image. The final line ("truth, once refracted through many mouths, could outlive the artist") articulates rather than enacts the theme, bordering on a direct statement. The prisms and echoes function as motifs that charge the closure, and Mara's blindness carries thematic weight (vision traded for voice). Yet the piece leans toward allegorical transparency: the canyon as amplifier, the artist as martyr, forgiveness-as-transaction all signal their meanings overtly rather than through earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and image-driven, with strong perceptual signature ("forged hush," "listening metal," "pale ribs against a sky the color of ash"). Purposeful compression and poetic syntax are taught early and sustained. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jalen's exchange and the chief elder's demand carry subtext and goal pursuit. However, psychic distance wobbles: the opening reads close third, then pulls back to summarize crowd reactions and the killer's presence without anchoring whose knowledge frames those observations. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "innocently mischievous" reads as authorial commentary rather than self-perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("listening metal," "reeds," "bread") is vivid and mostly coherent. However, the piece carries moderate scaffold: "forged hush" and "pale spire in mist" recur as labels without evolving meaning, and the final third summarizes three major beats (lunge, capture, judgment, blinding) in rapid succession, reducing information density. The phrase "dragging the canyon into their shame" elevates diction beyond Mara's established voice. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "passed poems hand to hand like bread" near "the crowd took up the lines," both describing the same crowd action without added detail. No severe loops, but momentum softens in the closure rush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The refraction-as-distributed-accusation is a fresh tactical premise, and the sensory price (color blindness for truthtelling) offers a non-obvious cost tied to the artist's medium. The bone-tower canyon and echo mechanics create a specific, memorable world. However, the broader arc—artist returns from exile, sacrifices gift for justice—follows a recognizable martyr template. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and delivers one strong inflection (truth spoken through many voices cannot be silenced), lifting it above generic execution despite the familiar exile-return frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara drives setup (climbs the canyon), development (refracts the truth through poetry), and closure (sacrifices her art). Her choices create all major turns: the decision to use poetry, the strategic distribution of the killer's name, and the final offer to surrender her prisms and ink. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in setup ("beside the pale spire in mist"), reappears at the ritual moment ("the pale spire in mist caught the first weak light and threw it through Mara's prisms"), and anchors the final sacrifice ("At the spire's base she poured her ink"). It enables the prism's light-scattering function, but its unique properties (mist, paleness, stone vs. bone) do not constrain choices or shift meaning across beats. Functional reprise, but swappable with another landmark.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness shapes stakes from the first paragraph ("forgiveness had a price") and determines the entire arc: Mara seeks ritual forgiveness, the elders demand payment ("what payment she offered"), and she surrenders her art as the cost. The concept drives the climax choice and defines the closure sacrifice. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity (vision lost) make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" appears in setup as a label ("innocently mischievous, because the elders said"), recurs in the antler-doodle beat (trading a sketch to bypass the guard), and colors the "playful couplet" for Jalen. It enables one mid-beat tactic but does not constrain the climax or closure. The trait reads more as authorial characterization than a visible tradeoff under pressure. Present and functional in one beat, but swappable with "charming" or "defiant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Refraction structures the entire tactic: Mara refracts the killer's name across three stanzas, the canyon echoes refract the lines into multiple versions, and she refracts truth through many mouths so it cannot be bribed or silenced. The action appears in setup (carried prisms to refract light), development (refracts accusation through poetry), and closure (prisms cracked, light scattered back). Removing refraction would collapse the plot's logic. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions frame the method from the first mention ("impromptu poetry sessions by lantern light"), shape the middle tactic (distributing the killer's name across stanzas), and deliver the climax (the final poem that names the killer). The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (lines repeated into crevices, refracted by echoes), and it drives two major beats. The sessions are the vehicle for the refraction tactic, making them nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of echoes enable the refraction tactic (words split and return altered), supply the crowd of watchers and gatherers, and enforce the forgiveness price through the canyon's demand. The setting's acoustic property is causally active in the climax (echoes amplify the accusation from every side). It appears in setup, middle, and closure, and its unique physics constrain Mara's tactical choices. Removing the echo-canyon would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("before the ritual") signals urgency in setup, and the approaching dawn ritual creates a ticking clock that shapes Mara's choice to act overnight ("by midnight the canyon was humming"). The elders arrive "to prepare the dawn ritual," and first light triggers the climax. Time constrains tactics and charges the final beat, though exact elapsed hours remain vague. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to refract truth is stated early ("she wanted to refract that truth into many"), dramatized through the poetry-session tactic (breaking the name across three stanzas), and fulfilled at closure when "truth, once refracted through many mouths, could outlive the artist." The desire drives her choices under pressure (risk arrest, sacrifice art) and supplies visible cost. The friction between speaking truth and protecting herself is present but underdramatized. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Forged hush" opens the piece and recurs once ("the forged hush had become a listening metal"), establishing an initial stillness that modulates into collective charged attention. The tone supports the lyric register and charges the shift from silence to amplified accusation. However, after the halfway mark, the tone shifts to summary-driven urgency without sustaining the auditory texture. Moderate coherence and one purposeful modulation, but closure does not reprise the hush motif to complete the arc.</comment>
