<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior voice is consistently specific and embodied: "the guilt had followed me through death" carries concrete weight. Micro-choices accumulate pressure through the sundial sequence, translating vibration into script then into a plan with visible cost ("letting errors show"). The final stance—carrying the hum without needing forgiveness—is earned by the stone-circle encounter. Minor slip: the jump from "watched those pairs fail to coexist with our hunger" to actionable refuge instructions feels slightly telescoped, though the thematic through-line holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors reincarnation memory, library setting, and the curator handoff by the first quarter. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through tidal cycles, sundial mechanics, stone-circle vibration, then crystallizes in the light-script instructions and ink transcription. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"coexist with the living world without needing it to forgive me"—with visible cost (wrinkled pages, imperfect record). The cost is legible in the moment of transcription and the emotional reconfiguration of guilt into self-reliance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Tidal Library's vapor surges constrain the narrator's brittle awakenings and charge the wrinkled-page image at closure. The brass sundial's atomically reflective grooves enable the light-script reveal. The stone circle's hum and lichen-covered pillars ground the pivotal translation beat. Micro-setting (body + tool) drives two key choices: placing the sundial on the flat stone and transcribing the script into ordinary ink. Sensory detail is filtered through reincarnation perspective ("moa eyes catching dawn") and serves pressure without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens through the curator's request, the stone-circle encounter, and the transcription choice. The hum-to-script reversal narrows options: the narrator must stop resurrecting the extinct and learn coexistence. Agency is embodied in speaking aloud, copying with errors, and choosing imperfect permanence over brittle perfection. Cost is visible: wrinkled pages, acknowledged errors, and the emotional forfeit of redemption ("without needing it to forgive me"). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: tidal cycles as brittle awakenings, the sundial as translation key, the stone circle's hum as measured coexistence. The final image—carrying the hum in bones, pages wrinkled but meaning intact—offers a resonant answer to isolation-versus-independence without moralizing. The warning ("every awakening is brittle, and any plan that depends on perfect memory will crack") is earned by the vapor-surge pattern and embodied in the ink-copy choice. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement; the wrinkled pages do conceptual work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "moa eyes catching dawn, brief and unrepeatable" and "the silence gave my thoughts room to learn new shapes." Distance remains stable; the narrator's register—lyric but grounded—fits the reincarnated contemporary voice. Purposeful compression ("the hum grew clear, a low chord that vibrated in my teeth") accelerates without obscuring. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates cleanly under pressure (sundial warming, light-script lifting). Free indirect thought is controlled. Minor note: a few filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") are acceptable in this reflective mode but cluster slightly in the stone-circle beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance image, choice, or world logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines charge the frame. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language ("brittle awakenings," "cloud forests") is consistent and clear. Minor penalty: the phrase "atomically reflective, as if each groove held its own mirror" leans slightly explanatory in a peak beat, and two adjacent lines in the stone-circle sequence use "I realized" then "I understood" in close succession, creating mild template cadence. Overall propulsion remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes reincarnation memory, tidal library, and vibration-to-text translation in a non-obvious configuration. The stone-circle-as-instrument frame and the choice to transcribe with errors rather than resurrect perfection feel earned and specific. Emotional truth (guilt across lifetimes, self-reliance without forgiveness) anchors the conceptual elements. Risk: the multi-element accumulation and lyric compression could have obscured causality, but the piece commits fully and lands the closure. Transformation test passes: swap the brass sundial or stone circle and the story breaks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line and active in three beats: the moa memory frames guilt, the stone-circle encounter triggers the script revelation, and the final choice to coexist without forgiveness directly hinges on being a "contemporary of an extinct species." Drives the dominant stake and closure image. Irreplaceable: remove this trait and the guilt-to-independence arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced in the first third, handled twice (receiving it from the curator, placing it on the stone), and its properties (bird-beak gnomon, atomically reflective inscription) enable the light-script translation. Charges the closure by prompting the transcription choice. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the sundial's specific mechanics drive the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes throughout: the tidal cycles literalize brittle awakenings, the warning in the light-script articulates the rule, and the wrinkled-but-holding pages at closure dramatize the cost. Alters tactics: the narrator chooses imperfect transcription over resurrection. Not merely thematic echo; the vapor-surge pattern enforces the concept with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atomically reflective grooves enable the sundial's light-script reveal in the stone-circle beat. Mentioned twice (skylight tilt and stone placement), with visible consequence: the inscription lifts into readable script. Functional but slightly ornamental in closure; the transcript and wrinkled pages carry more weight. Mid-band for beat involvement and causal work without deep closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action frames the dominant stake, drives the stone-circle instructions ("how to build small refuges... where people and fragile species could meet without consuming each other"), and resolves in the final stance: carrying the hum to coexist without needing forgiveness. Appears in or shapes three beats. Irreplaceable: swap "coexist" for "protect" or "remember" and the thematic and tactical arc breaks.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hum is signaled in the curator's setup ("still humming when no wind moved"), shapes the stone-circle encounter (vibration-to-script translation), and its mechanics matter: the narrator must speak aloud to trigger the instruction rewrite. Returns in closure ("kept the hum in my bones"). Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Irreplaceable: the vibration-translation mechanism is unique and plot-critical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The library's tidal vapor surges pressure the brittle-awakening motif and supply the wrinkled-page consequence at closure. The roof bridges and spiral stair provide spatial progression to the stone circle. Micro-setting (sundial, flat stone, cloud rim) alters tactics in the translation beat. Constraints are visible and multi-beat. Integral to closure image and thematic cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Present from the opening sentence and frames the reincarnation guilt. The timeframe enables the contemporary-of-extinct-species trait but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; the tidal cycles do more tactical work. Signals setup and closure participation (carrying memory forward), but the urgency comes from the vapor surges and stone-circle encounter rather than elapsed time itself. One gate shy of higher band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desire is stated early ("translate isolation into independence") and dramatized through the curator's request, the choice to cross to the stone circle, the act of transcription with errors, and the final renunciation of needing forgiveness. Friction is visible: the narrator's guilt competes with the impulse to resurrect perfection. The wrinkled pages embody the cost of independence. Drives closure and shapes three beats.</comment>
