<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and task-driven; her choices to invert the fragment's placement and dismantle the mast are earned by her professional idiom and her habit of "discarding assumptions." The embodied detail—tool belt, wrenches, sore hands—grounds her agency. Minor slip: the insight "beginnings are built with sore hands" veers toward epigram without full dramatic cost in that moment, though the preceding action supports it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's decision to drop the tallest mast and tune the city as a receiver rather than broadcaster reconfigures the premise with visible cost (one arrogance surrendered, a page torn away). The causal chain—hush inverted, signal decoded, blueprint enacted—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. The orientation window extends slightly (towers/gorge/perigee delivered ~150 words in) but the effect serves world-building pressure and does not obscure the stake. One micro turn (hearing the gap, following it to a new pulse) deepens without fragmenting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The suspended city, gorge, copper clamp, vacuum tubes, and the physical act of loosening rusted plates all constrain Mara's tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail (ozone, old copper, humming bolts under moonlight) is selective and filtered through a signal interpreter's professional attention. The environment is a lived-in workspace, not a postcard. The hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting when wedged against the falling mast, and the spatial choreography (catwalks, stairwell, roof, workbench) remains coherent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage a pattern to map "what might start next"—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara hears the "door shutting" break and follows the gap past expected frequencies; this narrows her options and forces a trade-off: dismantle the tallest mast (agency-driven) to reconfigure the city. The cost is legible: one tower lost to the gorge, a page torn from the notebook, and the villages will "hear nothing for a while." No antagonist, but the council's prior lock-down and the city's scrapping deadline supply external friction. One meaningful escalation under Causal lens; no need for multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—finding beginnings in endings, listening versus commanding—emerges from concrete action: the inverted fragment, the tuned receivers, the torn page. The final image ("answer the sky instead of waiting to be told") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the shard of hush "swallowing interference" and the mast "like a surrendered spear." No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution while offering a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in Mara's on-page choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; diction is controlled and purposeful ("practical cadence of orbits," "blueprint for rebuilding"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices signal threads, tuning coils, and the difference between broadcasting and receiving. Minor register drift: "the sky lied unless you listened by discarding assumptions" reads slightly elevated for the established voice, and "arrogance" in "lighter by one arrogance" tilts abstract. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is appropriate; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with task pressure (short clauses during the mast drop, longer during the signal interpretation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot without padding. Rhythm varies naturally (compare the compressed mast-drop to the slower tuning sequence). Minor loop: "the towers were chained together like a dead instrument" and "the city...rang with a gentler signal" echo instrument/sound imagery without adding pressure. One instance of slight overwriting: "drove to find the beginning in every ending" and later "beginnings...are built with sore hands" repeat the motif without evolved meaning. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language (hush "like sand drinks water," mast "like a surrendered spear") is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inversion of the hush fragment (downward instead of upward) and the reconfiguration of the city from loudspeaker to listening post offer a non-obvious synthesis. The blend of practical radio-tower mechanics with speculative elements (hollywood star fragment, weather charms, bridge opening spells) feels organic and committed. The emotional core—agency through dismantling rather than building—avoids genre template while grounding the premise in tactile, sore-handed labor. Bold structural choice: no antagonist, yet pressure coheres. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession shapes every beat: she tunes, adjusts coils, interprets the signal gap, decodes the blueprint, and executes the dismantling. Her choices (inverting the fragment, turning the dial past expected frequencies, dropping the mast) create the key turns. Present in setup, development, and closure. Two distinct beats (tuning sequence, mast drop) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong irreplaceability; another occupation would require rewriting the premise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fragment is handled in three beats: placed in the copper clamp, its hush damps noise at the source, and finally wedged against the falling mast to "keep the fall true." Setup (pocket mention, old manuals reference), development (clamp placement alters tuning), and payoff (charges the mast drop and the city's new signal). Causal pressure: without it, Mara cannot isolate the new pulse. Closure linkage: its final use enables the reconfiguration. High specificity (pried from Walk of Fame, "shard of hush") and visible cost connection (surrenders it to the gorge).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is the mechanism that allows Mara to damp interference, isolate the new pulse, and guide the mast's fall. Setup (introduced second paragraph, explained as "quietness so dense it could swallow interference"), development (used to adjust tuning, makes "the silence articulate"), and payoff (enables the reconfiguration and charges the ending image). Shapes stakes and tactics: without it, the signal remains static. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the air around the towers (ozone, humming bolts, moonlight on cables) and establishes the atmospheric register. Present in setup and inflects the sensory filter throughout, but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The attribute shapes tone and world-texture but remains descriptive rather than causal. Functional but closer to replaceable; "serenely" could shift to another adverb without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tuning is the inciting action, the middle development (adjusting coils, following the gap), and the closure task ("when Mara finished tuning the new receivers"). Every major turn traces to this action: the signal break decoded, the blueprint heard, the mast dropped to anchor remaining towers as receivers. Setup, development, and payoff all hinge on tuning. Causal pressure is undeniable; swapping "tune" for "repair" or "activate" would break the story's premise. Strong irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("Old manuals insisted...but Mara had learned that the sky lied unless you listened by discarding assumptions") and drives the key turn: she inverts the fragment's placement and turns the dial "past the frequencies she expected." Setup and development are clear; the method shapes her middle choice. Payoff: the final reconfiguration (receivers instead of loudspeakers) enacts the method thematically. One distinct beat (inversion/dial turn) with causal pressure. Solid integration but slightly more abstract than the other elements; the mechanics are hinted rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting supplies every resource and constraint: the gorge as destination for the dropped mast, the suspended catwalks and stairwell Mara must navigate, the copper clamp and feed line at the antenna base, the workbench with vacuum tubes and bolts. Setup (first paragraph), development (climbing, adjusting, loosening rusted plates), and payoff (mast tipped into the gorge, remaining city reconfigured). Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting's verticality and precariousness pressure Mara's choices. Strong causal linkage and closure participation; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is mentioned in the opening line and recurs once ("The perigee pressed on her ears"). It sets atmospheric pressure but does not function as a live clock that alters tactics or tightens a deadline. Mara works "until dawn" (a generic marker), and the story does not track elapsed time or escalate urgency tied to the moon's position. Setup is present, but development and payoff are weak; the timeframe is more descriptive than causal. Functional but closer to replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "find the beginning in every ending" is introduced in the opening and dramatized in her choice to follow the signal gap, decode the blueprint, and tear out the first notebook page to avoid trapping the future. Setup and payoff are clear; the motivation shapes the final image (learning to answer the sky, not be told). One middle beat (following the gap instead of mourning the ending) shows the motivation under friction. Visible cost: the torn page, the tower dropped, the silence before the new signal. Solid integration; not quite indispensable but causal and thematically charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tone blends grounded technical detail (vacuum tubes, tuning coils, wrenches, hand winch) with speculative elements (weather charms, bridge opening spells, hollywood star fragment) in a consistent register. The prose avoids arch fantasy diction and maintains practical, task-driven syntax even when describing the shard of hush or the pulse of orbits. Tone modulates with pressure: compressed during the mast drop, slower during signal interpretation. The final image ("answer the sky instead of waiting to be told") charges the tone by reconfiguring the city's stance. Coherent through turns and integral to closure.</comment>
