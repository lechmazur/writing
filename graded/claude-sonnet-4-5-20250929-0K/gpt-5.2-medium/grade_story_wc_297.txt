<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's "purposefully curious even when fear tightened her throat" establishes motive, and her willingness to bleed for the covenant shows stakes-driven choice. The visionary's root-bound state is vivid and his scarred linking system creates textural specificity. However, the mother's reappearance feels under-motivated—she appears as "a sleeper standing at the same crossing" without prior contradiction or tension that her presence resolves, and the reunion lacks visible cost or complication. The piece gestures toward internal conflict (anxious elation, fear vs. curiosity) but doesn't sustain contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; emotions toggle rather than layer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through linked images (clipping, scars, maze corridors, cracked seal) and a final cadence shift when Lysa's blood stitches the covenant. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seal slides whole, the mother is found, and the covenant "carried them back to a present that could wait for its future"—a crystallized moment with felt cost (Lysa bled, linked dreamers' wounds align). One tightening is legible: Lysa's scar-touch to the seal narrows chaos into order. Minor causality slip: the visionary's roots and the chorus of dreamers enable the maze-walk, but their mechanics remain abstract; the line "his own scars flared in answer" implies coordination without showing prior constraint or rehearsal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's metallic leaves and "air tasted of rain" are vivid and sensory. The topiary clipping is handled twice (proof at entry, blood-touched at climax) and charges the final image as a shared compass. Spatial choreography is mostly clear: Lysa steps close, the visionary's palm holds the sprig, her scar presses it. The glade's blue light sharpens when the clipping is shown, suggesting setting responds to action. However, the "round clearing in the maze" and "black disk... eclipsed seal" lack spatial anchoring—are these physical or mental? The ambiguity doesn't obscure the closure image but prevents the environment from fully constraining choice in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the intersection of dreams... where my mother's sleep meets the place she vanished." One clear tightening: the visionary's demand "the covenant can open it only if you offer a wound" narrows Lysa's options to a blood-price, and she acts. The climax—tracing her scar until it bleeds, touching blood to seal—is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (pain, shared wound). The overlapping dreams "began to tear at one another like dogs" raises immediate jeopardy. Minor slip: the linked dreamers' chorus appears suddenly to "stitch the crack with a living thread" without prior establishment of their collective power; the mechanism feels convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: covenant as boundary between future and present, scars as links between the wounded, the maze as routes between worlds. The eclipsed covenant and "dead future... owning the living present" avoid didactic summary; the concept is dramatized when the seal cracks and Lysa's blood stitches it. The final image—mother and daughter holding the topiary clipping "like a compass"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy closure: the covenant is repaired but only provisionally ("carried them back to a present that could wait for its future"). One phrase nears thematic echo: "trust... whenever it pleased" is abstract, though not a prompt restatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lysa with consistent psychic distance and perceptual bias (e.g., "anxious elation," sensory anchors like "voice dry as bark"). Diction is purposeful: "root-bound visionary," "slow sap breaths," "stitched rivers" create a coherent metaphoric texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "Heed me" and "offer a wound" carry subtext of cost and warning. Two slips: "the rumor was true and she could not pretend anymore" tells rather than showing what she pretended; "behind glass" in the vision lacks prior setup, creating mild filter confusion. The phrase "harsh light spill through" shifts register slightly toward abstraction under peak pressure, though not enough to fracture voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language ("roots sunk deep," "linking through scars") serves world-building without overwhelming. Information density is high in the first two-thirds. However, several artifacts cluster in the final third: "the overlapping dreams began to tear at one another like dogs" uses a simile that feels generic under peak pressure; "stitching the crack with a living thread of shared pain" stacks metaphors (thread, stitching, shared pain) without clarifying mechanics; "when dusk lifted" is vague sequencing. Two minor loops: "the covenant carried them back to a present that could wait for its future" and earlier "the dead future from owning the living present" recycle the future/present frame without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-slip premise, scar-linked collective, and maze-as-dream-crossing is specific and non-obvious. The root-bound visionary and cobalt glade avoid stock settings. The piece commits to its speculative logic and follows implications (covenant cracks → dreams tear → blood stitches seal). The topiary clipping as both proof and compass is a fresh detail. However, the "future arrives early" frame and "eclipse as metaphor for barrier" lean on familiar SFF templates; transformation occurs through the scar-linking mechanic and the collective repair, but the mother's role at the intersection feels undercooked—she appears without prior dramatized conflict or cost, reducing the ending's inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Root-bound visionary appears early, delivers the wound-offer constraint that narrows Lysa's options, and his scars flare in the climax to enable collective stitching. Present in setup, middle constraint, and closure participation. His "roots" and "barky palm" are handled concretely. Swappability test: another oracle could deliver similar guidance, but the root-binding and scar-linking are specific to him. Two beats: initial encounter and climax flare. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maze topiary clipping handled in three beats: taken as proof, shown to visionary (blue light sharpens), pressed to Lysa's scar (pain flashes, leaves unfurl into corridors), held between mother and daughter "like a compass" at closure. Early signal, middle use, closure charge. Specificity high: "sprig shaped like a question mark," maze remembers routes. Causal work: enables corridor-walk and final reunion. Visible cost tied to blood-touch. Near-indispensable; the maze property is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eclipsed covenant frames the story: introduced in paragraph four as "a pact... to keep the dead future from owning the living present," drives the climax when the seal cracks and Lysa's blood stitches it. Setup present, middle mentioned (visionary warns covenant failing), closure active (seal repaired). Shapes stakes and tactics: the covenant's failure permits dream-leakage; repair requires blood-offering. Swappability moderate—another barrier concept could serve, but eclipse/seal imagery is specific. Two beats: warning and repair.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious even when fear tightened her throat" appears in opening, motivates her journey to the glade and her willingness to offer the wound. Setup clear. Middle: her showing the clipping and asking for the intersection demonstrate curiosity under pressure. Closure: she remembers the visionary's warning and acts rather than fleeing. One on-page cost: "pain flashed like a small private eclipse." Swappability moderate; trait is labeled early but visible in choices. One strong beat (blood-offering) and setup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Heed me" is the visionary's opening command, and the ending beat: "Lysa remembered the visionary's warning to heed, and instead of fleeing she traced her scar." Setup in dialogue, payoff when heeding redirects her choice from flight to repair. Causal: the heed-warning shapes her tactic at the crossing. Two beats: command and obedience. Specificity moderate—another injunction could serve—but the exact verb "heed" recurs and the choice turns on it. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Linking through scars introduced early: visionary's scars "linking... to anyone who had ever been cut by time's new edges." Lysa's wrist scar established as proof of shared experience. Middle: visionary presses her scar to the sprig, "guided by the visionary's roots and the chorus of scar-linked dreamers." Climax: "his own scars flared in answer, and the linked dreamers felt their wounds align, stitching the crack." Setup, development, closure all present. Mechanics shape the maze-walk and collective repair. Irreplaceable; the scar-network is the story's connective tissue.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt glade at dusk anchors the visionary encounter, supplies the metallic leaves and "air tasted of rain," and the blue light sharpens when the clipping is shown. Present in setup and middle description. Closure: "when dusk lifted from the cobalt glade, the covenant carried them back." The glade's return at the end charges the exit. Constraint moderate: the glade is where the visionary and covenant dwell, but it doesn't block or enable tactics beyond hosting the scene. Sensory vividness high; functional necessity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the future arrives early" frames the entire premise: clocks stuttered, night trains ran in daylight, mother vanished "when tomorrow came early," eclipse no longer waits its season. Setup strong. Middle: the timeframe pressure is implicit (future bleeding into present creates dream-leakage). Closure: "a present that could wait for its future" resolves the time disorder. Time doesn't tighten a live countdown but provides conceptual stakes. Two beats: inciting premise and thematic resolution. Swappability moderate; another temporal distortion could serve similar purpose.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation—"to find the intersection of dreams, where my mother's sleep meets the place she vanished"—is declared early and drives every choice: journey to glade, showing clipping, offering wound, walking corridors, stitching seal. Setup, development (wound-offer accepted), closure (mother found). Friction: "anxious elation" and fear layer the desire; the wound-price creates visible cost. Dramatized in action: she rolls up sleeve, bleeds, traces scar. Three beats: declaration, wound-offer, reunion. Irreplaceable; the mother-search is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" named explicitly when Lysa realizes the rumor is true and modulates through fear ("fear tightened her throat"), resolve ("anxious elation turned to steadier resolve"), and urgency at the crossing. Tone charges the closure image: the repair and reunion are earned through visible pain, sustaining elation-and-cost. Coherent across beats. One slip: tone is told ("elation fluttered") rather than shown through perception or gesture in the opening. Present in setup, middle modulation, and closure charge. Swappability low; the dual affect is specific to the piece's emotional arc.</comment>
