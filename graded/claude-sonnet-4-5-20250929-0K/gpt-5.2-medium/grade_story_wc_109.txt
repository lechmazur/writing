<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's obsession with mapping darkness is embodied through concrete choices—climbing the fort, consulting Lyr, describing the hush—and the progression from measuring stars to tracing silence shows internal shift. However, interiority trends abstract ("mildly obsessed hunger," "distances between terrors") rather than viscerally contradictory; the final act of drawing feels declared more than earned through prior micro-choices under immediate pressure. The transformation from light-based to silence-based navigation works causally but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (fort, storm, pebbles, booklet dissolution) toward a final cadence shift where the narrator begins the map "guided by what stayed unspoken." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator no longer panics when the last star vanishes, crystallizing a new orientation. Orientation anchors arrive early (ridge fort, garrison, chapel). Cost is oblique: the gilded booklet is ruined and the old star-navigation abandoned, but the emotional or tactical price of that loss is asserted rather than dramatized in a beat that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: "walls sweating salt and thunder," "ridge of shattered shells," wind-carved chapel with broken mosaics, and the pebble bowl all anchor the narrator's sensory filter. The storm and battlements constrain access and heighten urgency. The booklet's physical transformation under rain—gold leaf lifting, pages like "pale reefs beneath a tide"—charges the final image and the shift from star paths to spiral pattern. Micro-setting (body, bowl, ruined booklet) functions as environmental constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: map the failing constellations before memory loses its lights. Pressure tightens when Lyr commands the narrator to retell the journey "using only what the ruined gold did not say," forcing a shift from visual to auditory/silence-based navigation. The storm's arrival and the last star's winking out provide situational escalation. However, the narrator's final agency—beginning the map—is more an acceptance than a choice with visible trade-off; the cost (lost booklet, abandoned star-paths) is conceptual rather than a dramatized forfeiture that alters immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—navigation by absence rather than presence—emerges through concrete particulars: the flaking gold leaf, the pebble clatter, "summarizing silence," and the spiral drawn as first landmark. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing: nights have coasts mapped by what stays unspoken. "Ambered hush" and "marbled hush" recur purposefully, reweighting stillness as a guiding principle. The conceptual cost (relinquishing light-based certainty) charges the final image without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; distance modulates appropriately (close during booklet loss, wider during Lyr's instruction). Perceptual signature is distinct: "aftertaste of thunder," "marbled hush under every gust," "ambered hush she guarded." Diction is lyric and controlled, with purposeful compression ("pauses between waves," "resin seals a dead insect") that supports the accumulative design. However, some phrases trend ornamental ("flaking gold leaf booklet, stolen from the palace library and already shedding glitter into my pockets") without altering present choice, and the narrator's lexicon occasionally drifts elevated without dramatic tension to justify the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting: "walls sweating salt and thunder," "ambered hush," "marbled hush," and "pale reefs beneath a tide of inkless water" cluster in adjacent lines without clear propulsion. Some constructions loop conceptually—"distances between terrors" and "routes in the dark" restate navigation by absence. The final beat is clean and propulsive, but mid-story scaffold ("the ambered hush she guarded, a kind of stillness that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect") slows momentum. No major causality breaks, so deductions stay in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping darkness by silence rather than stars—offers a fresh inflection on navigation-under-crisis. The spiral of pebbles mirroring storm clouds and the dissolution of the gold-leaf booklet are specific, non-obvious moves. However, the oracle-guides-seeker frame and the "endless night as migration" conceit are familiar; transformation comes through the booklet's physical ruin and the method of retelling omissions, which feel earned rather than convenient. Risk is present in the lyric compression and refusal of a set-piece turn, but the stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally urgent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyr appears early (chapel), instructs the narrator in two distinct beats (pebble bowl on battlements, booklet dissolution under rain), and her final declaration ("nights also have coasts") directly enables the narrator's closure choice to draw the spiral. Removing Lyr would collapse the method-teaching and the pivot from visual to auditory navigation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The booklet is introduced early (stolen from palace library), handled in the chapel when shown to Lyr, held open to rain where gold leaf lifts and runs, and pressed flat as the narrator retells the journey. Its physical transformation—from gilded star-paths to "pale reefs beneath a tide"—directly enables the shift to silence-based mapping and charges the closure image. Cost is visible: the artifact is ruined to teach the new method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" is named twice and described as "a kind of stillness that sealed sound like resin seals a dead insect"; "marbled hush" recurs at chapel and under the wind. The concept shapes the narrator's realization that "the map I sought was not of stars at all, but of distances between terrors" and enables the closure pivot to drawing by omission. However, its mechanics remain abstract; the hush is invoked more as theme than as a constraint that narrows tactical options in a beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is labeled early ("mildly obsessed hunger to measure what could not be measured") and the narrator's climb and consultation with Lyr demonstrate pursuit. However, the obsession is described rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or mistake; the narrator's actions align smoothly with the plot without a scene where obsession forces a costly choice or error.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Retell" is signaled early (Lyr's stones "remember storms… storing them for anyone patient enough to retell") and enacted twice: the narrator describes what was heard without sound (pressure, aftertaste, fear) and later retells the journey "using only what the ruined gold did not say." The second retelling directly precipitates the closure pivot, making the spiral visible and enabling the map of endless night. The action is irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is introduced mid-story ("the only faithful method was by summarizing silence, as if you could note the shape of a pause") and enacted when the narrator speaks "in a slow cadence of omissions." The method shapes the final turn: the narrator traces the spiral and begins the map "guided by what stayed unspoken." It appears late but is paid off at closure with visible linkage to the retelling action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ridge fort is introduced in the opening line, provides spatial anchors (chapel, battlements, parapet), and the storm forces the garrison to "lash doors and drag cannons," creating situational pressure. The "ridge of shattered shells" and the fort's memory of storms are invoked thematically. However, the fort's physical constraints do not decisively narrow the narrator's tactical choices; it functions more as atmospheric container than as a resource or obstacle that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening ("when only one star remains in a dimming sky") and tracks through the storm's arrival and the star's final wink-out, which triggers the closure beat. The live clock tightens urgency: the narrator must learn before the star vanishes. However, intermediate time pressure is loose; the story does not specify how long the narrator has or dramatize a near-miss, so the constraint feels situational rather than a tactical vise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("I had climbed there to draw a map of an endless night") and drives every major beat: consulting Lyr, examining the booklet, listening to the pebbles, retelling the journey. The narrator's realization mid-story ("the map I sought was not of stars at all, but of distances between terrors") reweights the goal, and the closure act—beginning the map—fulfills the transformed desire. Friction between the original visual ambition and the forced pivot to silence creates visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" recurs (chapel, "under the wind") and coheres with "ambered hush"; tone is sustained through lyric diction, purposeful compression, and accumulative rhythm. The final image—tracing the spiral, listening for the hush, drawing the map—charges the tone with quiet resolve. However, tone modulation under peak pressure is minimal; the narrator's voice remains relatively uniform across calm instruction and storm crisis, missing a sharper cadence shift that would elevate the ending.</comment>
