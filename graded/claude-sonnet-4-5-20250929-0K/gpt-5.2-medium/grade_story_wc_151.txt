<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's profession as pseudonym creator is established with concrete detail (ebony clipboard, chalk codes), and the interior sensory register is specific and controlled. However, the decisive final action—creating "M. Return" and setting the trap—lacks visible internal conflict or cost; the choice feels more procedural than personally consequential. Emotional progression is understated to the point of flatness during the discovery of intercepted letters, where visceral fear or moral stakes would sharpen characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~120 words; the Drive Lens reads as Situational with strong Accumulative texture (golden arcade motifs, chalk codes, margin ghost-notes converge). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the trap set via M. Return) with conceptual cost—exposing the thief through the protagonist's craft—but the cost remains oblique; the emotional or social price to the protagonist is asserted rather than shown. The "futuristic nostalgia" payoff in the final line charges the image, though causality from chalk-to-discovery feels compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The golden arcade is rendered with layered detail (roof panels, postal membrane conduits, antique mail slots, chalk on walls) that anchor time and place vividly. The chalk codes constrain the protagonist's method and the maintenance hatch behind RETURNS provides a spatial turn that alters tactics. Micro-setting (clipboard sensors, tile projections) functions as tool-constrained setting at this length, charging the final discovery without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—providing a clean pseudonym under the threat of margin-surveillance—is signaled early and tightens when ghost-notes reveal "DO NOT TRUST THE ARCHIVE." The courier's trembling fingers and the stacked intercepted skins escalate pressure, but the resolution (setting a trap via chalk codes) narrows options more through ingenuity than through a forced trade-off with visible personal cost. One meaningful tightening is present; agency is clear but the price feels procedural rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: surface mail as vulnerable skin, margins as whispered truths, the juxtaposition of old faith (envelopes) and new surveillance (postal membranes). The final image—"old faith in envelopes reborn as a citywide skin, still whispering truths at the edges"—reweights prior material without moralizing. The ghost-notes and chalk-code trap dramatize the central question (privacy vs. transparency) with conceptual cost, though the protagonist's internal thematic reckoning remains understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (grandmother's tune, father's lunch pail, ebony clipboard as ceremonial object) and the register blends procedural precision with lyric compression. Non-standard syntax (long, accretive sentences) is taught early and serves the accumulative texture. The courier's brief presence is handled without head-hopping, and the final shift to commuters entering the arcade anchors the closing image cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language (golden tiles as envelope skin, drones as old pigeons) supports world-building without muddle. However, several beats stack filter constructions ("I wanted time to do what I always do, to discover meaning"; "when you know the calibration tables, you can hear") and the phrase "futuristic nostalgia" in the final line reads as a thematic label rather than an earned image. Minor paraphrase loops ("margins carried ghost-notes" / "ghost-notes: repeated impressions") and template cadence in the middle third apply −0.6 in this category only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of surface mail as tactile data-layer, pseudonym creation as forensic craft, and chalk codes as counter-surveillance is specific and non-obvious. The premise avoids stock dystopia by grounding surveillance in texture (pressure, temperature, residue) rather than digital omniscience. Transformation is evident in the repurposing of children's chalk and old mail slots, though the final trap mechanism arrives late and relies on off-page mechanics (the thief "when the margins were read") that slightly hedge the bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pseudonym creator shapes the arc: observes margins, decodes ghost-notes, guides the courier, and invents "M. Return" as trap. Present early, involved in discovery and resolution, and the profession's mechanics (calibration tables, sensor clipboard) constrain method. However, the final choice (inventing the name) is procedural rather than personally conflicted, capping emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in beat one as ceremonial object, houses embedded sensors used to scan margins in beat two, and the underside sensors enable the ghost-note discovery. Two functional beats plus symbolic weight (father's lunch pail parallel), but the object does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; it enables rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Surface mail shapes world rules (messages ride city skin, margins record emotion), stakes (strip metadata to protect sender), and tactics (chalk codes layer beneath tiles to trap thief). Present early, pressures every major choice, and the final image ("citywide skin, still whispering truths") charges closure. Removing it collapses causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Carefully inventive" is labeled in the opening and shown through juxtaposing pen names, testing projections on the floor, and coding in chalk. The trait enables the trap but lacks visible cost—no moment where caution conflicts with speed or precision. Mid-band for enabling action without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Juxtapose is enacted on-page (listing classic pen names beside encryption handles) and frames the method, but the decisive turn—matching chalk codes to ghost-note patterns—relies more on decoding than on the initial juxtaposition. One beat of causal setup; replaceable with "compare" or "map" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chalk codes appear in beat two (protagonist draws them to map micro-scratches), match ghost-note patterns in beat three (becoming a route to RETURNS slot), and layer beneath the final mailed letter as trap. Signaled early, mechanics shape discovery and resolution, and the method's dual function (mapping tool and trap vector) is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn anchors orientation (roof panels catch sunrise, delivery drones rest, kiosk speakers hum), supplies the tile floor as envelope/projection surface, hides postal membrane conduits, and the RETURNS slot/maintenance hatch becomes the discovery site. Early signal, spatial choreography alters tactics across three beats, and the closing image (drones lift, commuters fill arcade) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (before noon deadline, 06:10 courier arrival, dawn meeting) is signaled early and tightens the protagonist's window to scan and act. The narrow legal window ("before a letter is mailed, the law says it is only private speech") constrains method and justifies urgency. However, elapsed time within the discovery sequence is vague, softening pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to "discover meaning in the margins" drives the dawn arrival, the chalk-code mapping, and the scanning of ghost-notes. Motivation is enacted through repeated choices (kneeling to add marks, scanning with clipboard sensors) and conflicts with the Office's demand for a "clean" pseudonym. Friction is implicit rather than dramatized as internal struggle, capping felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is established early (drones as old pigeons, grandmother's tune, father's lunch pail, museum of old commerce housing new conduits) and modulates through discovery (old RETURNS slot, dried-leaf mail skins). The final line ("futuristic nostalgia: old faith in envelopes reborn") names the tone explicitly, which slightly undercuts earned resonance, but the juxtaposition charges prior images and supports the Conceptual Repricing closure form.</comment>
