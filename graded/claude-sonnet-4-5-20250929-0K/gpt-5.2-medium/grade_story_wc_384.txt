<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal contradiction—forger trapped in systemic manipulation yet seeking to complete her father's unfinished sentence—drives the final choice with specificity. The moment she turns the key and confronts the hidden ledger shows agency under pressure. However, the final paragraph's "wisely enduring" label and the formulaic "forgave her father's broken sentence by completing it with mercy" dilute embodied emotion into abstraction at the peak beat. Backstory is extensive but anchored to present stimuli (ledger, thorn, key) and tilts choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with lyric texture. Anchors (who/where/when) land by the opening lines; the sanctuary, Senn, and Liora's purpose are clear. The reversal—basin seam reveals her father's papers and Senn's complicity—narrows options causally: Liora can sign Senn's confession or rewrite the ending herself. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she writes in meltwater, hands Senn the thorn, and walks out with the papers, crystallizing a stance with visible cost (coming judgment). Cost is undeniable. One meaningful tightening fits the length. Causal linkage holds, though the sanctuary door opening "on its own" flirts with convenience; it reads metaphorically under the lyric register but introduces a micro-ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora reflections, and stalactite refrain anchor atmosphere. The basin's hidden seam becomes a micro-setting element that constrains the climactic choice: Liora's discovery and counter-move depend on that physical feature. Sensory detail (crushed petal scent, pearl twilight, green aurora veils) is vivid and filtered through crisis perception. Spatial choreography (altar, basin, hidden compartment) tracks cleanly. The sanctuary's symbolic weight (knots, chains carvings) charges the final image when the door opens, though "on its own" slightly softens concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Liora will sign the forced confession or rewrite her father's unfinished story with autonomous truth. Pressure escalates causally: Senn's ledger revelation → Liora's discovery of her father's papers and Senn's original treason → her choice to write in meltwater and walk out. The thorn trade and public tribunal threat foreclose easy resolution; visible cost (guards moving to stop her, "coming judgment") charges the exit. Agency is hers: she rejects the quill, uses the key to uncover truth, and chooses exposure over complicity. One meaningful tightening fits this length; no unnecessary reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—completing the unfinished with honest witness rather than erasure or complicity—emerges from concrete particulars: father's mid-sentence letter, Liora's dual forgeries, calibrated treason as systemic control, the thorn as contract. The meltwater inscription and thorn exchange offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (thorn beside ink breaks Senn's rhythm) and image (sanctuary door opening when the key turns history). The final image reweights prior material: forgiveness as active completion, not passive acceptance. Minor slip: "forgave...by completing it with mercy" edges toward thematic echo in diction, though the surrounding action saves it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds close to Liora throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: details filtered through her forger's eye (carvings, seam in basin) and grief (father's letter, thorn memory). Senn's dialogue ("Your penmanship...is our finest instrument") carries menace and subtext. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (studying carvings, noticing the seam). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediacy: "wisely enduring stillness," "unlink loyalty from conscience so cleanly," and "heritage rose thorn" read slightly formal for crisis perception. Dialogue mechanics are clean; voice is distinct but occasionally lapses into writerly register at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the stalactite refrain teaches a pattern that brackets the action. Opening and closing images (pearl twilight, aurora) bookend effectively. However, line-level artifacts cluster: "wisely enduring" appears twice as label-only descriptor without embodied cost in adjacent context; "calibrated treason" is defined in exposition rather than shown; minor synonym churn ("forger/forgery," "unfinished/unfinish"). Template cadence in backstory exposition ("Years ago...thinking she was saving lives, but Senn showed..."). Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("green veils reflected," "ink basin rotated without a click" is precise, but "as if the cave remembered summer" is decorative). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—calligraphy forger, calibrated treason as policy, meteoric key that "opens minds," sanctuary under aurora—synthesizes into a coherent allegorical frame. The reversal (Senn's own complicity hidden in the altar) feels earned in hindsight. Liora's choice to write in meltwater rather than ink is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars (forger's precision, rejection of false contracts). However, the core premise—oppressive state turns rebel into unwitting tool, protagonist discovers truth and chooses witness over complicity—maps closely to resistance-narrative templates. Transformation occurs through setting specificity (fjord, marble, aurora) and the thorn/key/meltwater particulars, lifting it above generic execution. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, heavy backstory interleaved with present beats) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's occupation (calligraphy forger) is seeded early, drives the core conflict (Senn wants her penmanship to complete the pattern), and shapes the climactic choice: she uses her precision to reject Senn's script and write a new statement in meltwater. Her forger's eye notices the basin seam. The skill constrains and enables across multiple beats (dual forgeries backstory, refusal of quill, final inscription). Causal pressure is high; irreplaceability is strong. Closure hinges on her authorial agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in beat one (Liora holds it, feels its sting as reminder of motive) and returns at the climax (she sets it beside the ink, scent breaks Senn's rhythm; she hands it to him as reminder that contracts can be endured). Two distinct beats with evolving meaning: memory anchor → active gesture. However, the thorn does not constrain a tactical choice or alter options; it charges atmosphere and carries symbolic weight but remains more lyric accent than causal lever. Early signal +0.5; two beats +0.9; closure linkage +0.8; but swappability (another heirloom could serve similarly) and ornamental function in the ending gesture limit the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Calibrated treason is introduced early (Senn's explanation), shapes the dominant stake (Liora realizes her forgeries were anticipated and priced), and provides the conceptual frame for her final choice (to stop participating in the system by offering unmanipulated truth). It alters her understanding and forecloses complicity as an option. However, the concept is largely expository (Senn's monologue) rather than dramatized through lived constraint on the page. It reweights Liora's past actions and informs her motive, but the mechanics do not pressure her tactics beat-to-beat in the present scene. Early signal +0.6; causal reframing +0.8; closure linkage (rejection of the pattern) +0.9; but summary-heavy delivery −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears twice as a label: opening paragraph ("wisely enduring stillness") and final paragraph ("wisely enduring the coming judgment"). It is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or visible tradeoff. The trait does not constrain an on-page action with cost; Liora's choices (studying carvings, taking the key, writing in meltwater) are driven by agency and discovery, not patient endurance under pressure. The phrase functions as tone marker rather than actionable attribute. Label-only use across two mentions; no embodied cost; late closure appearance does not transform it. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; further limit for ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unlink" is seeded early (Senn's key will "unlink loyalty from conscience"), repurposed by Liora ("let it open mine where my father left his sentence unfinished"), and dramatized when she discovers the hidden compartment and chooses to "unlink" history's chain by exposing truth rather than signing complicity. The action is metaphorical but drives the major turn: using the key in the basin seam unlocks the proof that reframes the conflict. However, the final "unlink" is conceptual rather than a distinct physical act; the word recurs but the unlinking itself (discovery + decision) could be described in other terms without altering structure. Early signal +0.6; two beats +0.9; causal pressure +1.0; closure linkage +1.0; but some swappability (the discovery/decision could be narrated without repeating "unlink") −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The key (meteoric iron, no apparent lock) is introduced early by Senn, tested by Liora in the climactic beat (she slides it into the basin seam), and its mechanics matter: the hidden compartment reveals her father's papers and Senn's original treason, reframing the conflict and enabling her final choice. The key's puzzle (no door takes metal; the lock is history) is paid off on the page. Early signal +0.7; causal pressure (unlocks proof) +1.2; closure linkage (the discovery it enables charges her exit) +1.2; specificity (meteoric iron, seam discovery) +0.6. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is established early, provides atmospheric charge (green veils, reflected light, ice-faced caves), and supplies the physical constraint that drives the climax: the altar's ink basin with its hidden seam. The setting's carvings (knots, chains) echo theme, and the door that opens "on its own" at the end suggests the space responds to Liora's act. However, the sanctuary does not pressure her choices throughout; it is backdrop until the basin discovery. Micro-setting (basin seam) earns credit for causal work. Early signal +0.6; one key beat (basin seam) +0.4; closure participation (door opens) +0.7; but postcard description in early paragraphs and limited tactical pressure until the climax −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" is a recurring phrase that brackets two key beats (when Liora holds the thorn; when she discovers the compartment). It suggests slow time and pressure accumulation, fitting the tone. However, the timeframe is poetic rather than a live clock that tightens decisions; no deadline or tracked urgency alters Liora's tactics. The phrase teaches a lyric pattern and reappears to mark rhythm, but does not constrain choice. Lyric resonance (early seed → reprise) +0.8; two beats +0.9; but ornamental function (atmosphere, not pressure) −0.6; no causal tightening −0.5. Cap at ~6.3 for lyric reprise without middle development that alters tactics; further limit for vague temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation—to forgive the unfinished by giving it an honest ending—is stated explicitly in backstory and dramatized through her climactic choice: she rejects Senn's script, uses the key to uncover truth, writes in meltwater, and walks out with her father's papers to face judgment. The motive is seeded (father's mid-sentence letter), tested (Senn's offer vs. her counter-move), and fulfilled at closure with visible cost (coming judgment). Friction between safety (sign Senn's confession) and integrity (complete the story honestly) is clear. Early signal +0.7; causal pressure +1.2; closure linkage +1.4; but some telling (explicit statement "she had come for a different reason: to forgive the unfinished") rather than pure dramatization −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" appears in the opening and closing lines, framing the story with consistent visual tone. The tone—contemplative, elegiac, faintly allegorical—holds through pressure without jarring shifts and modulates subtly (from stillness to Senn's menace to Liora's resolve). The aurora's green veils and marble reflections sustain the tone. However, the tone is relatively static; no decisive cadence shift reweights the dominant stake in the final image. Lyric coherence is strong, but the closure charge arises more from action (walking out with papers) than from a tonal reconfiguration. Early signal +0.6; coherence across beats +0.8; closure presence (pearl twilight returns) +0.7; but static mood without decisive modulation −0.5.</comment>
