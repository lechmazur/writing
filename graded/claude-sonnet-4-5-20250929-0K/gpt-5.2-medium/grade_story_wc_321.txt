<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to merge parallel timelines is grounded in her observed goodbyes on the gangway, and her final choice—to radio the harbor office in coded constellation-speak—emerges from her established habits (checking lines twice, whistling). Her resiliently positive attribute is embodied in action ("climbed back to her own ferry…with fear in her throat") rather than merely labeled. The older self functions as a clean mirror rather than a full secondary character, avoiding muddy choreography. Minor slip: the leap from "not to stop the mystery but to merge parallel timelines" reads slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority, edging toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causality is clean: Lina traces hourglass lines → matches knots/routes → aims ferry at grotto → older self explains seam → Lina radios code → ferries align. Orientation anchors (Alder Strait run, deckhand, commuter ferry) land within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the seam held because they kept working it" crystallizes the choice to maintain the parallel ferry routes as an ongoing practice, with the cost felt in "whatever now was" and the permanent transient ache accepted. One meaningful tightening occurs when the older self's radio transmission aligns with Lina's, narrowing the seam and unfreezing the commuters. The Causal lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto under starlight constrains the climactic choice: Lina must aim the ferry there, and the blue salt light and hovering ferry above the black pool provide the physical stage for the seam-stitching. The hourglass (empty vs. full) and the sideways harbor clocks function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the clocks "straightened with a reluctant click." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smelled of coffee," "water drew a single map between them"), filtered through Lina's professional perception. The spatial choreography of two ferries touching on a gangway remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping ferry vanishments by merging timelines—is signaled early and tightens when Lina realizes "the seam could be stitched, but only by matching patterns exactly." Her agency drives the escalation: she climbs back, radios the code, and waits as the transmission aligns. The reversal (ferries shudder, sand appears, clocks straighten, commuters blink) is earned by her action. Cost is legible: she accepts "whatever now was" and commits to "keep working it," foreclosing any return to a single, stable timeline. The older self's nod ("not like strangers, but a workman's nod") underscores the enduring labor required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the permanent transient motif (tides, wake rings, ferry crossings, "nobody had to disappear alone") and is earned through the hourglass/route-pattern lattice rather than stated. The final image—Lina staying aboard "ready for the next crossing in whatever now was"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: connection requires continuous work, not a one-time solution. The concept of parallel timelines walking sideways is integrated into the knot-tying, star charts, and radio echoes, all concrete particulars. Minor slip: "permanent transient" is named once in narrator voice, edging toward overt thematic labeling, though it remains embodied in tide and gangway imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lina; perceptual signature (checking lines, whistling, tracing patterns) is character-specific. The prose carries distinct texture: "resiliently positive habit," "time preferred to crab along the wharf," "engines sounded as if they were turning pages." Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at key turns but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The dialogue is minimal (older self speaks "through a radio handset that buzzed without batteries"), functional, and goal-driven. Under peak stress (climbing back, radioing), syntax compresses appropriately without losing coherence. The recurring "permanent transient" phrase and "spectral grotto under starlight" read slightly elevated but remain consistent with the lyric-maritime register established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies (short pulses: "She traced those lines with her thumb"; longer accretions: "Inside the grotto the air shimmered…"), and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two paraphrase loops appear: "vanishing midroute…leaving only wake rings" is restated as "the ferry was not sinking but sliding," and the hourglass engraving/route lattice is explained twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "she + verb" stems across three consecutive sentences. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats, but the phrase "permanent transient" recurs without functional pressure in one mid-beat. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loop, template cadence) → −1.5 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of parallel-timeline mechanics with ferry-route knots, hourglass sand, and sideways clocks is specific and non-obvious; removing any one element would collapse the logic. The emotional core—merging timelines "so nobody had to disappear alone"—grounds the speculative premise in human need. The code built from "departure times as constellations, docking berths as knot names" is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars (Lina's rope lattice, star chart). Risk-taking in the lyric-maritime register and dual-ferry staging heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Within-band adjustment: +0.3 for risk distinction. Minor slip: the "permanent transient" phrase, while apt, edges toward familiar metaphor without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's choices drive key turns: she stays aboard (rather than going home), aims the ferry at the grotto, climbs back to her own ferry, and radios the code. The final workman's nod and her decision to stay aboard "ready for the next crossing" crystallize her stance. Early signal (first paragraph), middle development (aiming at grotto), and closure participation (radioing, accepting "whatever now was") all present. Causal pressure: her actions narrow options and enable the seam-stitching. Closure linkage: her code transmission aligns the ferries. Cost: she accepts the labor of keeping the seam stitched indefinitely. The trait "ardent" is embodied in her whistling and double-checking lines, not merely labeled.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in three beats: wedged under the chart table (she traces its lines), tugs at the full hourglass in the grotto, and sand appears in it as the seam stitches. Its interconnected-line engraving matches knots, routes, and star chart, constraining Lina's understanding of the pattern she must match. Early signal (chart table), middle development (tug at full hourglass), and closure participation (sand gathers "as if listening"). Causal pressure: the hourglass's pattern guides her radio code. Closure linkage: sand appearing signals the seam holding. Specificity: its empty-vs.-full duality and engraved routes make it irreplaceable. Cost: the hourglass's weight "like a promise" ties to her final acceptance of ongoing labor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry frames the inciting mystery (ferry slips midroute, leaving wake rings), drives Lina's middle investigation (listening to radio echoes, finding the frozen ferry in the grotto), and provides the closure stakes (commuters blink, move, file off laughing). Early signal (first paragraph: "ferry itself had been slipping"), middle development (seeing the missing ferry hovering), and closure participation (frozen commuters inhale and remember). Causal pressure: the ferry's vanishing narrows Lina's options to merge timelines or accept ongoing disappearances. Closure linkage: the two ferries shudder and touch, completing the seam-stitch. Cost: Lina must stay aboard and work the seam perpetually. The concept shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is embodied in Lina's whistling, steadying nervous commuters in fog, and climbing back "with fear in her throat" to radio the code. It constrains her final choice: rather than flee or despair, she commits to the work. Early signal (second paragraph: "practiced, a resiliently positive habit"), middle development (staying aboard instead of going home), and closure participation (accepting "whatever now was"). Causal pressure: the trait enables her to act under fear. Closure linkage: her workman's nod and readiness for the next crossing stem from practiced resilience. Cost: her positivity requires ongoing labor, not resolution. Minor gap: the trait is named once in narrator voice, edging toward label-only use, though action supports it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Radio action drives three beats: Lina calls the harbor office every ten minutes and gets her own echo back, the older self speaks through a batteryless radio, and Lina radios the code that aligns the ferries. Early signal (calling harbor office), middle development (older self's radio handset), and closure participation (code transmission aligns the seam). Causal pressure: the radio is the sole means to stitch the seam; without it, the timelines remain split. Closure linkage: the echoed transmission in the grotto tightens the two ferries into one map. Specificity: the radio's dual function (echo detection, code transmission) makes it irreplaceable. Cost: Lina's code relies on the dispatcher repeating it, introducing dependency and risk.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" (hourglass lines, knots, routes, star chart, ripples) are signaled early (Lina traces hourglass lines that match knots) and shape her method: she builds the radio code from "departure times as constellations, docking berths as knot names, and tide heights as musical notes." Early signal (hourglass engraving), middle development (water arranges into interconnected ripples), and closure participation (echoed transmission aligns patterns, water draws a single map). Causal pressure: matching patterns exactly is the stated condition for stitching the seam. Closure linkage: the aligned patterns reweight the frozen commuters into motion. Specificity: the lattice of rope, routes, and stars is unique to this ferry and Lina's work. Cost: the method demands precision and cooperation (dispatcher must repeat).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under starlight is the single location where the climax occurs: Lina aims the ferry there, sees the missing ferry hovering above the black pool, meets her older self, and radios the code that aligns the two ferries. Early signal (mentioned as "abandoned sea cave…fishermen avoided"), middle development (Lina approaches, water arranges into patterns), and closure participation (grotto fades at dawn, becomes ordinary rock). Causal pressure: the grotto is the only site where both ferries can meet; without it, the seam cannot be stitched. Closure linkage: blue salt light and the black pool stage the alignment. Specificity: its spectral, avoided status and starlight make it irreplaceable. Cost: entering the grotto commits Lina to the merge, foreclosing escape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is signaled early (harbor clocks running sideways, old pilots' saying) and tightens Lina's understanding: sideways time allows meeting yourself coming back. The timeframe does not impose a live countdown but shapes the story's logic: the ferry vanishes when time walks sideways, and the clocks' straightening at closure signals the seam holding. Early signal (harbor clocks), middle development (hourglass sand falling upward), and closure participation (clocks straighten with a reluctant click). Causal pressure: sideways time opens the seam; its correction closes it. Closure linkage: the clocks' click confirms the merge. Specificity: sideways time is unique to this world rule. Cost: accepting "whatever now was" ties to the timeframe's instability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to merge parallel timelines is dramatized in her choice to stay aboard, aim at the grotto, and radio the code. It is conflicted: "her real motivation was not to stop the mystery but to merge parallel timelines so nobody had to disappear alone" reveals a personal stake (permanent transient ache from gangway goodbyes) competing with professional duty. Early signal (implicit in her steadying nervous commuters), middle development (she admits her real motivation), and closure participation (accepting the workman's nod and staying aboard). Causal pressure: the desire narrows her to one option—merge, don't flee. Closure linkage: the merge realizes her motivation with the cost of perpetual labor. Specificity: the motivation ties to her habit of watching goodbyes, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is signaled early ("feeling as permanent transient as the tide") and modulates through the story: Lina's transience (empty deck, footsteps not there) intensifies when she sees the frozen ferry, then resolves at closure into acceptance ("whatever now was"). The tone is coherent—elegiac, maritime, charged with impermanence—and supports the concept (vanishing ferry, sideways time). Early signal (fourth paragraph), middle development (ache of goodbyes), and closure participation (staying aboard, "next crossing in whatever now was"). Causal pressure: the tone frames Lina's choice as acceptance rather than victory. Closure linkage: the final image reweights the phrase into ongoing commitment. Specificity: the tide metaphor and gangway ache make it irreplaceable. Minor: the phrase is named once in narrator voice, slightly reducing integration.</comment>
