<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—the promise to memorialize with data, the categorization system that "sounded childish until it worked," the gamble with the telescope. Internal contradiction appears in "quietly explosive in the way she moved, every gesture contained until it had to break," though this reads more as assertion than dramatized simultaneity. The final choice to drop the telescope is earned by prior grief-logic and the established trust in atmospheric memory, with visible cost (risking the instrument Juno used). Minor deduction: the emotional cloud-naming system is told rather than shown constraining an earlier choice before the crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara reels in the telescope, whispers Juno's name, and seals the notebook—memorializing through proof that "empty space where the tether broke had guided them home." The cost is conceptual but legible: her private method, dismissed as childish, now holds undeniable weight. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the layered cloud-naming, the falling telescope carving a "temporary channel," and the final margin note. One meaningful deepening (the gamble with atmospheric memory) tightens options. Orientation is clean by the opening line. Small penalty: the radio crackle recovery feels slightly convenient; the mechanism "borrowed from the remembered corridor of signal" needs one more concrete anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gondola's rocking "like a loose tooth," the brass telescope "dented and warm," the anvil cloud "sparkled like crushed mica in moonlight," and the catenary line "trembled with old vortices" all constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image. The telescope's physical weight carves the channel; its return "swinging like a pendulum" seeds the tactical success. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: she reads wind shear, names storm edges, watches backscatter haze. The micro-setting (telescope as anchor-object) directly shapes the climactic move. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and retrieval.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival after the tether snaps) is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: Mara's gamble with the dropped telescope narrows options under the Accumulative lens—if the "remembered corridor" fails, the storm swallows them. Agency is decision and renunciation (risking Juno's telescope to prove atmospheric memory), with visible cost: the instrument could be lost. The supercell "Fury" and dead radios escalate pressure. The resolution is earned by Mara's prior pattern-building and her willingness to test Juno's axiom. Minor gap: the tower's sudden carrier-wave response feels slightly soft; one more sentence showing the haze's effect on signal propagation would tighten causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief as method, memory inscribed in empty space—emerges from Mara's cloud taxonomy, the dropped telescope carving a channel, and the final margin proof. "Spooled wholeness" and Juno's axiom that "empty spaces remember" drive the action without thesis statements. The ending's non-literal answer: memorialization succeeds not through flowers but through a private atmospheric proof that "could fly." Subtext operates in the frayed tether ("the universe refusing to be wound"), the whispered name, and the official report's margin note. The supercell named "Fury" and the haze named "Remembrance" layer meaning without moralizing. No thematic echo; the final image reweights prior material with cost (the method proven, the mentor honored).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is clear in her professional gaze ("ragged anvil cloud," "backscatter haze") and grief-logic. Diction stays within her lexicon: "catenary," "wake turbulence," "vortices" read plausible for an aviation meteorologist. Purposeful compression in "quietly explosive" and "soft hiss that became an absence" serves the accumulative design. The single line of pilot dialogue advances plot without excess. Psychic distance tightens under crisis (the telescope drop) and opens at closure (the whispered name, the margin note). Minor slip: "as if empty air keeps sound the way a shell keeps sea" in the opening paragraph edges toward authorial lyricism slightly beyond Mara's established register, though it remains legible and does not obscure voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; information density is high ("the envelope of the airship still floated, but without the ground line the gondola drifted sideways into uncharted airspace"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but controlled: "loose tooth in dusty starlight," "crushed mica in moonlight," "breath fills lungs." Mixed-metaphor check: "quiet explosion of a valve failing" juxtaposes quiet/explosion but reads as intentional oxymoron tied to Mara's "quietly explosive" trait. Small deduction: the phrase "spooled wholeness, a way to wind scattered sky into something you could hold" in the first third stacks three metaphoric vehicles (spool, wind, hold) in quick succession without clear disambiguation, briefly muddling the tenor. This does not touch closure but reduces clarity mid-scene. One filter-verb stack: "she named it Fury because its edges sparkled" could cut "because."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief-driven atmospheric taxonomy meets survival crisis—feels specific and non-obvious. The cloud-naming system (Longing, Appetite, Grief, Fury, Remembrance) transforms the meteorologist archetype through emotional particularity. The gamble that "the sky would remember" and the dropped telescope as atmospheric stylus are fresh inflections. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: swapping Mara's profession or the airship setting would break the logic. Minor note: the "quietly explosive" framing is asserted more than embodied in varied gestures; one more on-page micro-action showing containment-then-break would deepen the trait's originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's meteorologist training enables the cloud-reading that names the supercell and identifies the backscatter haze; her decision to drop the telescope and gamble on atmospheric memory drives the key turn and closure. Setup: present by "aviation meteorologist for the Coastal Runways." Development: reads wind shear, categorizes clouds, identifies the storm. Payoff: the margin note in the official report and the final proof. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Small gap: more of her professional knowledge shaping an earlier tactical choice (before the tether snaps) would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in beat one (lap, dented, warm, Juno's), is dropped as the weight to carve the atmospheric channel (beat two), is reeled back "swinging like a pendulum" (beat three), and is pressed to Mara's forehead in the whispered memorial (closure). Each use advances pressure: observation tool → atmospheric stylus → proof of memory → reliquary. Setup early, development central, payoff undeniable. Irreplaceable: its brass weight and Juno's history charge every touch. Visible cost: Mara risks losing it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is named once ("her idea of spooled wholeness, a way to wind scattered sky into something you could hold") and the spool metaphor bookends the tether snap ("the universe refusing to be wound") and the sealed notebook ("the last wrap of string"). Setup present, lyric reprise at closure reweights the dominant stake (memorializing Juno by winding grief into method). Does not directly constrain a middle choice but charges the final image. Swappability: another containment metaphor could function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is asserted in one sentence: "Mara stayed calm, quietly explosive in the way she moved, every gesture contained until it had to break." The telescope-drop could illustrate the trait (contained patience then decisive action), but the text does not explicitly link the two. Setup mid-scene, no clear development beat where the trait constrains or enables with visible cost, weak closure tie. Largely label-only; the final actions (reeling, whispering, sealing) read as methodical rather than explosive. Swappable with "deliberate under pressure" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Memorialize" frames the story: Mara "had promised to memorialize her with data, not flowers," builds the cloud taxonomy as memorial method, and at closure "sealed the notebook with the last wrap of string, a small memorial that could fly." Setup early, drives the taxonomy development and the gamble (proving Juno's axiom honors her), payoff in the margin note. The action redefines options: grief becomes proof. Cost: risking the telescope, making the private method public. Causal and closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cloud categorization by emotion (Longing, Appetite, Grief, Fury, Remembrance) is introduced early ("categorizing clouds by emotion"), practiced mid-scene (naming the supercell and haze), and implicit at closure (the margin proof relies on the method). Setup clear, development: she names two clouds under pressure, the haze fill enables the radio signal. Payoff: the method "that sounded childish until it worked" is validated. Mechanics matter: the emotional taxonomy seeds the atmospheric-memory gamble. Slightly swappable with another observational system but the emotion-layer adds thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gondola is the pressure vessel: after the tether snaps it "drifted sideways into uncharted airspace," Mara opens the hatch to drop the telescope, and the drift into the haze along the carved channel enables rescue. Setup immediate ("sky gondola stops being an instrument and becomes a life boat"), development (spatial constraint forces the telescope gamble), payoff (the gondola's drift becomes the proof that empty space guided them). Micro-setting that alters tactics and survival. Irreplaceable: no other locale would allow the atmospheric-memory test.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inciting incident ("After the string breaks") anchors time and urgency. The sequence—tether snaps, radios die, telescope dropped, line goes taut, carrier wave returns, dawn arrives—tracks a compressed nocturnal crisis. The storm's approach and the fading stars create a live clock that tightens the gamble. Setup immediate, development clear (night approaches constrain the attempt), payoff (dawn thins the stars, closure lands). Time pressure is felt but not explicitly counted down; one more sentence marking elapsed minutes during the telescope's fall would sharpen urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's desire to prove "that empty spaces remember" drives the telescope gamble and validates her grief-method at closure. Setup: Juno's axiom and the smoke-kite proof. Development: Mara's decision to drop the telescope tests the axiom under survival stakes. Payoff: "the empty space where the tether broke had guided them home." Friction between want (honoring Juno, proving the pattern) and cost (risking the instrument, the crew's safety) is visible. The motivation is dramatized in action (the drop) and result (the margin note), not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears in the opening image ("rocking under the airship like a loose tooth in dusty starlight") and recurs when "dawn thinned the stars to dust." Tone is elegiac and precise throughout: "soft hiss that became an absence," "crushed mica in moonlight," "breath fills lungs." Modulates under pressure (the telescope drop tightens diction, the whispered name softens it) and charges the final image (the margin proof, the memorial "that could fly"). Coherent across turns, no tonal breaks. Strong but not indispensable; another atmospheric descriptor could serve similarly.</comment>
