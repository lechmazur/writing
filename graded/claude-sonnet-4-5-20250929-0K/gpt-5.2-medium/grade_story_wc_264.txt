<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation to "cultivate sparks" is specific and drives micro-choices across ledgers and timelines. Interiority remains consistent through wave-function splitting without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to meet auditors "in many places at once" with a charm is coherent but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; the ending feels more like sustained vigilance than transformation. Embodied emotion is thin—pressure is atmospheric rather than somatically registered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early: dreamless guard, Farline train, mile marker Zero, glowing dune archive. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% through layered images (dune as depot/archive/choices, clock as midnight stasis). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the guard holds "midnight open by constant care," meeting auditors with a charm that lets "different towns breathing in the ledgers" persuade them to retreat. Cost is conceptual—nursing the bloom "until light could spread beyond my watch"—but the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material or make a before/after legible with felt price; the stance crystallizes without visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing dune constrains action: grains "lit from within," sparks "skittering along the bloom," the guard planting "glassy ember seeds between the grains." The chess clock's "cracked casing" opens the shack "like a paper fold," showing shelves that are "also dunes, also train cars." Spatial choreography across divergent timelines remains legible through purposeful compression. The archive's rule—"everything occasionally everywhere"—directly enables the guard's simultaneous presence and tactically shapes the climax when auditors' "boots dulled the dune's glow."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: guard the archive's bloom and prevent collapse into "a single profitable history." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the guard learns wave functions, walks shelves, reroutes a crate, plants seeds, all building toward the auditor confrontation. The peak choice—offering auditors "a pattern of choices sung through wave functions"—narrows options (they back away), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shack opens and the guard splits across timelines, but agency reads more as distributed attention than a decision with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: holding midnight open as care versus collapse into singular history; the orchard burned for warmth mirrors the last forests, locking in the cost of convergence. The chess clock's frozen hands and the guard's "fractured lullaby" charm recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in "the clock clicked though its hands never advanced," suggesting balance without progress. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—light spreading "beyond my watch"—without stating a moral, though the conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance) is implied more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the guard's perceptual signature—"sparks," "wave functions," "occasionally everywhere"—is consistent and voice-motivated. Syntax modulates purposefully: long, layered sentences during archive exploration compress into shorter beats at the auditor encounter. Diction remains within a lyric-industrial register without jarring shifts. However, psychic distance stays remote throughout; peak moments lack embodied immediacy, and the voice reads more as atmospheric narrator than a mind under pressure. No dialogue appears; focal control is clean but lacks rhythmic tightening at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"dawn trapped under skin," "bloom dune itself," "coal alive in a tin"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, approaching −0.5 for overwriting. Runs of "I [verb]" and "the [noun] [verb]" create template cadence: "I did not sleep… I had learned… I tried… I walked… I understood… I let… I offered…" across six beats triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "everything occasionally everywhere" / "archive made everything occasionally everywhere" is restated without pressure gain (−0.2). Cumulative artifact penalty −1.2 in Q7. Propulsion is steady but density occasionally obscures causality; the final third remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—divergent archive + wave-function guard + frozen chess clock—is specific and feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The orchard-burning echo and the crate-rerouting beat add fresh inflection to the "last forest burns" frame. However, the core premise (keeper of branching timelines fending off corporate collapse) echoes familiar SF templates without full transformation through lived detail; the auditors retreat without dramatized friction. Risk-taking in structure (simultaneous timelines, lyric compression) heightens atmosphere but doesn't fundamentally alter stakes or force harder moral calculus. Within-band adjustment for structural ambition: +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guard appears in the opening, learns the method in the first third, walks shelves and reroutes the crate mid-story, and meets auditors at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The guard's choices—tapping the clock, nudging a switch, planting seeds, offering the charm—drive at least three beats and shape the ending. Causal pressure is present: the guard's distributed attention enables the final stand. However, the choices read more as sustained vigilance than decisions that narrow options with visible cost; swapping "guard" for "keeper" or "warden" would not break logic. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus swappability −0.5, minus cost visibility −0.8, minus late cost-drama −0.2 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chess clock is nailed beside the manifest board in the first third, the guard taps it to open the shack mid-story, and it clicks near the ending to remind that "midnight could be held open only by constant care." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The clock appears in three beats and its frozen-midnight state directly enables the shack-opening turn and charges the final image. However, the clock's mechanics—why tapping opens the shack, why it clicks without advancing—are symbolic rather than causal; removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break plot logic. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.6, specificity +0.4, minus symbolic convenience −0.6, minus unclear mechanics −0.4 = 5.8, rounded to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The divergent archive is named and described (dune keeps "every version of every shipment") in the first third, it shapes the guard's method (walking shelves, rerouting crates) throughout, and it supplies the stakes at closure (auditors want to collapse it). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The concept changes options on the page: "occasionally everywhere" lets the guard split across timelines, the missing crate cry drives the orchard echo, and the auditors' device directly threatens the bloom. Removing the archive would eliminate the story's logic. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, irreplaceability +0.6 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The attribute "occasionally everywhere" is explained as an archive effect in the first third ("the archive made everything occasionally everywhere"), it enables the guard's simultaneous patrol across ledgers mid-story, and it underpins the final confrontation when the guard meets auditors "in many places at once." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The trait constrains on-page action with visible cost: splitting attention is effortful ("I let the wave functions split me, step by step"), and the guard's distributed presence is what persuades the auditors. However, the cost is atmospheric rather than dramatized as a trade-off; no moment shows what the guard sacrifices by being everywhere. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4, minus ornamental phrasing −0.3, minus cost visibility −0.6, minus label-only mention −0.3 = 6.4, rounded to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "charm" is introduced when the guard taps the clock's casing "in a rhythm that matched the rails" in the first third, opening the shack. Mid-story the guard "whispered a charm over each unlit corner, coaxing sparks into wicks." At closure the guard offers auditors "the only charm I trusted… a pattern of choices sung through wave functions," persuading them to retreat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The charm drives three beats and is causally active at the ending. However, its mechanics are vague—"rhythm," "whisper," "pattern of choices"—and could be replaced with "ritual," "song," or "spell" without structural change. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +0.9, minus swappability −0.7, minus vague mechanics −0.5 = 6.7, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method "through wave functions" is signaled when handlers teach the guard "the method through wave functions, a way of listening to the dune" in the first third. Mid-story the guard "let the wave functions split me, step by step," enabling simultaneous patrol. At closure the guard offers auditors "a pattern of choices sung through wave functions." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method appears in three beats and its mechanics matter: wave functions enable splitting and the sung pattern is what moves the auditors. However, the physics are metaphorical rather than specified; "quantum method" or "harmonic listening" could substitute. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.6, minus vague mechanics −0.5 = 5.1, rounded to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune is introduced at mile marker Zero in the opening, the guard stands on it to plant ember seeds mid-story, and the auditors' boots "dulled the dune's glow" at closure, prompting the guard's final stand. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The dune supplies resources (sparks, grains for planting) and pressures the ending when its glow dims. Spatial micro-setting alters tactics: the guard's planting is possible because grains are "lit from within." Removing the dune would eliminate the archive's physical anchor and the closure's visual cost. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, micro-setting credit +0.5 = 7.1, rounded to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last forest burns" is stated in the opening and echoed when the guard hears a divergence where "the people had burned the last orchard for warmth, repeating the end I lived after." Setup gate is met; the frame shapes backstory and thematic resonance. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the guard's choices are not time-bound, and the ending does not hinge on elapsed hours. Missing development and payoff gates cap at 3.4. The orchard echo adds thematic weight (+0.8 within band) but remains ornamental to plot. Score: early signal +0.5, thematic echo +0.8, cap 3.4, adjustment within cap +1.4 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated early ("my private motivation"), dramatized when the guard whispers charms "coaxing sparks into wicks, into mouths, into the soil," and drives the ending when the guard "nurse[s] the bloom until light could spread." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The desire shapes three beats and is causally active at closure. However, the friction between want and cost is thin: the guard's effort is described but not shown as forfeiting rest, safety, or another path. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, minus told-only cost −0.6, minus low dramatized friction −0.7 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "fractured lullaby" is introduced in the opening ("a lullaby sung in broken measures") and sustained through lyric compression, layered syntax, and the guard's whispered charms. At closure the guard's "voice a fractured lullaby" explicitly ties the tone to action, and the final image ("nurse the bloom until light could spread") modulates into quieter care. The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image with accumulative weight. However, it remains one stable mood—elegiac, layered—without sharp modulation under peak pressure; the auditor confrontation does not shift rhythm or diction. Score: early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.4, coherence +0.8, cadence charge +0.6, minus static mood −0.5, minus no pressure modulation −0.4 = 6.3, rounded to 6.3.</comment>
