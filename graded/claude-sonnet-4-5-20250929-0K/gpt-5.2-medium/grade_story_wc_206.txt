<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation is clear and his professional identity shapes his perception, but interiority leans toward declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The Midnight Thief's confession ("a hollow it could not name") provides a key turn, yet the resolution feels too cleanly calibrated—no messy hesitation or competing impulse complicates the mending choice. Micro-choices are present (raising the chip, using the wire as a bow) but lack visible cost or internal friction that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening sentences; no penalty applied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Thief is realigned, light returns, and Ivo honors the Covenant), and cost is legible: rust flecks the joints as approval, the chip is used, and the oathfern remains un-wilted, signaling honest work. Under an Accumulative lens (tinkering pressure + covenant constraints + final wonder-song), the ending reweights the opening premise with visible consequence. However, the causal chain from confrontation to resolution compresses quickly, and the Thief's capitulation arrives without a second complication, limiting the tightening effect and capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("cathedral of copper lungs") and constrains Ivo's descent via the tether and wire mechanics, shaping his tactical choice to draw a chord. The philosopher's stone chip and oathfern function as micro-setting objects that charge key beats and the final image. Sensory hierarchy is professional: Ivo reads metal tremors like faces, filtering detail through his craft. The setting drives at least two beats (descent, repair) and participates in closure (pipes answer, light pours up), meeting the 9+ quick test with a small margin; minor vocabulary choices ("headache of quiet") feel slightly strained, keeping the score just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Thief opens its chest and admits its hollow, narrowing options to repair rather than combat. The oathfern and Covenant constraints apply pressure, and Ivo's choice to mend "what isn't torn" with the chip and wire forecloses a path with visible cost (rust approval, borrowed dawn). However, the Thief's immediate cooperation after one honest offer undercuts escalation; no second reversal tests Ivo's commitment, and the resolution lands without a trade-off between competing goods, keeping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: honoring decay while keeping promises, mending the misaligned rather than the broken. The covenant of rust, oathfern, and final tinkersong recur with reweighted meaning, avoiding stated morals. The ending offers a resonant answer—honest repair returns stolen light—through image and action, satisfying the 9+ quick test. A small slip: "tinkersong wonder" in the final line leans slightly declarative, and the Thief's confession ("a hollow it could not name") flirts with abstraction, but the overall thematic arc is strong and the cost (rust as approval, borrowed dawn, binding to truth) is legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is distinct: Ivo reads tremors, polishes invisible scuffs, hears metal moods. Diction ("headache of quiet," "scraped brass") is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond immediate tactile need. The Thief's voice ("admitted, in a voice of scraped brass") is handled cleanly. However, runs of similar syntax ("He practiced," "He kept," "He climbed") and filter verbs ("understood," "making") cluster in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy and disqualifying 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary adequately, but template cadence appears in the opening third ("Ivo had been told," "The chip was not his," "In exchange for borrowing it") and again mid-story ("Ivo raised," "Ivo spoke," "Ivo used"), triggering a −0.5 deduction for pattern runs. Metaphors are occasionally mixed: "headache of quiet" strains coherence, and "silhouette made of stopped pendulums" + "cold chimes" blur the physical image. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the artifact cluster in high-pressure beats and the metaphor muddle at the inciting incident prevent entry above 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair craft, covenant of rust, and honest-work-as-key is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy tropes. The concept of "mending what isn't torn" transforms familiar repair-magic into a moral calculus tied to truth and decay. The oathfern and philosopher's stone are integrated with purpose, and the final tinkersong callback reweights the opening premise. However, the Thief's immediate capitulation after one honest offer and the Covenant's smooth approval limit bold risk; a second complication or deeper cost would have elevated originality into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivo's choices—unlocking the chip, pinning the oathfern, descending with the tether, speaking plainly, using the wire as a bow, tuning the box—drive every major beat and the closure. His decision to mend rather than combat the Thief narrows options and earns the ending. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (descent, confrontation), and closure (repair, light return), with causal pressure and visible cost (truth-binding, Covenant honor). Score reflects strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage, meeting all three gates with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chip appears in setup (drawer unlock), middle (raised to sing a gold note, making pipes answer), and closure (set into the black box "like a key," enabling the final repair and light release). It constrains Ivo's approach (borrowed from the Covenant, requires truth-binding) and charges the ending. Present across three beats, with causal pressure and closure participation. Minor swappability concern: another magical token could fill similar structural roles with edits, but the philosopher's-stone warmth and Covenant tie add specificity that justifies high-7 to low-8 placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Covenant of Rust is signaled early (drawer paragraph), shapes Ivo's constraint (truth-binding, oathfern requirement), and returns at closure ("rust flecked the joints as if approving"). It frames stakes (decay honored, heart of song protected) and the final repair's moral calculus. Present in setup, middle choice (honesty requirement), and closure approval, meeting all three gates. However, the Covenant itself does not force a second complication or tighten options mid-scene; it functions more as thematic frame than active antagonist, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The oathfern appears in setup (pinned to lapel), middle (shivered and stayed bright after Ivo's honest offer), and closure (still un-wilted upon return). It constrains Ivo's speech (must speak plainly to avoid cracks) and validates the honest-music tactic, directly enabling the Thief's cooperation. Present across three beats with causal pressure: the plant's feedback confirms the repair path and charges the ending image. Specificity is high (wilts near dishonesty) and irreplaceable within the story's logic, justifying mid-7 placement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tether (braided wire from belt to gear rail) appears in setup (climbed and tethered), middle (carried tremors, Ivo "could read the mood of metal"), and closure (used as a bow to draw a chord along the rail, easing pendulums into swing). It shapes Ivo's descent tactic, his sensory access to the chamber's state, and the final repair method. Present across three beats, with causal pressure and closure participation. The wire's dual function (safety/listening, then repair instrument) is specific and irreplaceable, meeting high-band criteria.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is signaled in the opening line ("mending what isn't torn, polishing the invisible scuffs"), frames the central conflict (Thief is misaligned, not broken), and governs the climax method (tune the mute comb, ease pendulums, let dawn seep through motion). It appears across setup, middle diagnosis, and closure execution, with high causal pressure: Ivo's entire approach hinges on this principle. The concept is specific, irreplaceable, and charges the final image (honest repair, tinkersong wonder), meeting all integration gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced early (descent paragraph), constrains Ivo's approach (copper lungs, pipes that answer in harmonics, the great bell's vibration), and directly enables the closure (light pours up the pipes, bell breathes out). It appears in setup, middle confrontation (chamber amplifies lies into cracks, pipes tilt the Thief's head), and closure (pipes as conduit for returned light). The setting's acoustic properties shape every tactical choice and charge the final image, meeting all gates with high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"In the balance" and "before dawn could be reclaimed" are signaled early, creating urgency for Ivo's descent. The timeframe returns at closure ("between night and morning," "dawn seep through," "midnight... bowed"). However, no live clock tightens mid-scene decisions; the descent and repair unfold without time-pressure complications. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight, but does not constrain middle tactics or force a second choice under temporal squeeze, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ivo's desire to reclaim stolen light is stated early ("midnight itself stole the citys light") and drives every beat: descent, confrontation, honest offer, repair. The motivation is dramatized through choices (borrowing the chip, binding to truth, offering to mend the Thief) and faces friction (Covenant constraints, Thief's hollow). Present in setup, middle confrontation, and closure (light returns, new music box in window). Cost is visible (truth-binding, borrowed chip, rust approval), meeting all gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is established in the opening ("shop sang softly," "polishing the invisible scuffs in a lullaby") and sustained through poetic compression ("headache of quiet," "cathedral of copper lungs," "scraped brass"). It modulates under pressure (Thief's silence "pressed on Ivo's teeth") and charges the final image ("tinkersong wonder"). Coherent through turns with purposeful cadence shifts, meeting the 9+ quick test narrowly. However, occasional elevated diction ("philosopher's stone," "Covenant of Rust") and the slightly declarative final phrase ("honest repair can return stolen light") keep the score just below 8.0.</comment>
