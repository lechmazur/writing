<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nira's engineer identity and her goal to "catalogue what the world discarded" are well-established. However, the backstory density (mother's surgery, dream-hiding miner) arrives mostly as told memory rather than lived pressure, limiting on-page choice-making cost. The final sequence—sorting memories via copper helix and synaptic plasticity drills—demonstrates micro-choices under pressure, but the mother reveal and miner subplot feel imported rather than tested. Interiority relies on elevated metaphor ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie") more than contradictory impulse, and the ending stance shift reads as acceptance plus archival mission without a visible forfeiture or relationship friction to ground the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Nira, canyon rim, moonlit night) land quickly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Nira's memory tangles densify through the periscope discovery, the mirror's fractured reflection, the copper helix modification, and the final descent with "layered sleeping histories." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she opts to "excavate every abandoned dream and file it under living names," reweighting her transformation from madness to archival inheritance. Cost is conceptual—she accepts the entanglement rather than severing it—but remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized (no relationship loss, physical price, or immediate trade-off shown on the page). The backstory block (mother, miner, surgery) arrives as reflective insert mid-story without a present scene cue, creating mild orientation drift; applying the BRR expanded allowance (reflection-led mode exceeding 30% with present anchors), the drift is minor but still noticeable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon, periscope half-buried in shale, and the rusted dream-mine instruments provide concrete anchors. The mirror's cracked reflection constrains Nira's final choice: she modifies it to "give each memory a clean angle of return," and the periscope tube at the end renders the canyon wall "translucent with layered sleeping histories," charging the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful ("sand gnawed," "moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes") and filtered through Nira's engineer lens. Spatial choreography is clear across the rim-to-floor descent, though the dream-mine mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Nira's need to sort entangled memories without losing "the threads that mattered"—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror reveals the hospital corridor and her mother's face. The modification of the copper helix and the synaptic plasticity rehearsals are on-page tactical choices. However, escalation is more conceptual than visceral: no external opposition tests her method, no memory threatens to overwrite her identity in real time, and the ending's "ready to excavate" posture is future-facing rather than a paid cost. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (mother reveal reframes inheritance), but agency is more cognitive than decisional, and the cost remains oblique—she accepts entanglement but doesn't visibly forfeit a path or relationship on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—entanglement, inheritance, and the archaeology of discarded dreams—emerges through the mirror, the miner's hidden periscope, and Nira's synaptic sorting rather than statement. The ending image (canyon wall translucent with "layered sleeping histories") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forgotten dreams seek an archivist, not isolation. The copper helix and synaptic plasticity drills ground the metaphor in physical action. Minor slip: "not madness but inheritance" and "a network of forsaken dreams seeking an archivist" edge toward explicit theme articulation rather than pure dramatization, but they remain rooted in the mother reveal and do not summarize a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with Nira's perceptual signature ("helix-minded," counts of five, labeling memory shards). Diction is elevated and consistent ("quaking reverie," "chaotically precise," "slow rewiring of synapses"), though under peak pressure the register remains lofty rather than compressing. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw") are present but voice-motivated. The backstory insert (mother, miner, surgery) shifts briefly into past narration without a strong present anchor, creating mild distance drift. Voice is distinctive but risks convergence with prompt language ("synaptic plasticity," "lucid drills," "entangled memories") rather than fully character-particular idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("breath pooling in ledges like quiet water," "memories snagged on hers like burrs on cloth"). However, repeated metaphor stems and elevated constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "tremor in her ribs," "cracked open and spilled strangers," "fear quake through her reverie," "moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes." The backstory block mid-story paraphrases the miner subplot rather than dramatizing it in a prior beat, creating mild loop effect. Sentence openings vary, but figurative density in high-pressure beats (mirror warming, images spilling) approaches overwriting without the payoff of concrete physical cost. Clarity holds; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—entangled memories stored in dream-mine periscopes, synaptic plasticity as sorting tool, archival mission—synthesizes speculative psychology and archaeology in a fresh frame. The copper helix modification and the final canyon descent with translucent histories feel specific to Nira's voice and world. Risk: the dream-mine mechanics and synaptic plasticity drills verge on prompt-label reliance rather than fully dramatized system, and the emotional arc (acceptance plus mission) is less novel than the conceptual apparatus. The mother reveal and miner subplot add emotional specificity but arrive late via summary. Transformation test: swap "periscope" for another memory artifact and much of the arc persists, suggesting mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: Nira is introduced in the opening line as "helix-minded engineer." Development: her engineer method (measuring by instinct, checking twice, drawing copper helix around the mirror, labeling memory shards) constrains her sorting approach across multiple beats. Payoff: the final modification "give each memory a clean angle of return" and her descent "ready to excavate every abandoned dream" are engineer-driven choices that shape the closure. However, the helix-minded trait is more lens than friction—it enables but doesn't visibly cost her or force a trade-off. Two beats plus closure participation, causal pressure moderate, specificity high, cost oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: periscope discovered "half buried in shale" early. Development: Nira "lifted the broken periscope mirror and saw the moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes," triggering recognition of the hospital corridor; she modifies it with copper helix, presses her thumb to the crack (mirror warms), and images spill; she modifies again to "give each memory a clean angle of return." Payoff: she looks through the periscope tube at the canyon wall, which turns "translucent with layered sleeping histories," directly charging the closure image. Three distinct beats, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong, cost tied (mother's memory retrieved via the mirror). Very strong integration with one slip: the miner's hiding of the mirror is told in backstory rather than discovered through a prior beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "entangled memories snagged on hers like burrs on cloth" and "memories that were not hers" introduced early. Development: the dozen pale eyes match a memory she never walked, the mirror as "node" where dreams were "routed and crosswired," the lover's goodbye and miner's laugh identified as foreign. Payoff: "Nira's transformation was not madness but inheritance, a network of forsaken dreams seeking an archivist." The concept shapes the dominant stake and drives the sorting method. One slip: the final line names the concept rather than showing its consequence, and the entanglement does not visibly constrain a choice with immediate cost—Nira accepts rather than fights it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "her hands moved chaotically precise, measuring distances by instinct yet checking them twice" in the opening paragraph. Development: the trait is echoed in "adjusting the copper helix until the moon's reflection steadied," suggesting iterative precision. Payoff: absent from the closure image. The attribute is label-only; it describes her method but does not visibly constrain or enable an action with a trade-off. One beat (measuring), ornamental reprise (adjusting), no closure participation. Swappable with "methodical" or "compulsive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "modify" previewed in "If she could modify it, she might sort the tangles in her head." Development: "she set the mirror on a flat stone and drew a helix of copper filament around its frame. Each turn corresponded to a memory segment, and each solder point marked where it had collided with someone else's past"; "She modified the mirror again, not to sever the entanglement but to give each memory a clean angle of return." Payoff: the second modification directly enables the final periscope look and the canyon wall's translucence. Two distinct modify beats plus closure linkage, causal pressure strong. One slip: the mechanics of modification remain abstract (copper helix symbolism over concrete mechanism), slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "She had trained herself in lucid drills that nudged recall through synaptic plasticity, strengthening one pathway while letting another fade" mid-story. Development: "Through synaptic plasticity, she rehearsed the miner's laugh until it settled into its own shelf, separate from her father's. She rehearsed the lover's goodbye until it stopped hijacking her mornings." Payoff: method mentioned in the rehearsal beats but absent from the final periscope look and descent. Late signal (second third), one extended beat (rehearsal), no closure participation. The method is told rather than shown in tactile detail, and the rehearsal sequence is summary rather than live action. Swappable with "mental discipline" or "memory exercises" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "moonlit canyon" in the opening line; "canyon floor strewn with rusted instruments from the old dream-mines." Development: Nira finds the periscope "half buried in shale," modifies the mirror on "a flat stone," and the moon's reflection serves as a constraint in the adjustment. Payoff: "She descended into the moonlit canyon...ready to excavate every abandoned dream," and earlier the canyon wall turns "translucent with layered sleeping histories." The canyon provides the discovery site and charges the final image. Two beats plus closure participation, causal pressure moderate (supplies the periscope, frames the final descent), specificity high. One slip: the canyon is more symbolic vessel than tactical constraint—Nira could perform the mirror modification anywhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "Nira had come during a period of profound transformation, when her own nights cracked open and spilled strangers into her waking hours." Development: the transformation is referenced throughout (memories arriving with someone else's voice, entanglement as inheritance), but no clock or urgency tightens the present scene. Payoff: "Nira's transformation was not madness but inheritance" names the element at the end. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure; no deadline forces the canyon visit, and the transformation is retrospective framing rather than a live ticking constraint. Present in setup and closure thematically, but does not alter tactics or narrow a window. Swappable with "crisis" or "upheaval."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Instead she chose a fiercer motive: to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams and catalogue what the world discarded." Development: the motive drives her canyon descent, periscope recovery, and mirror modification across multiple beats. Payoff: "ready to excavate every abandoned dream and file it under living names." The desire is clear, dramatized through action (find, modify, descend), and shapes the ending. Two slips: the motive is declared rather than shown emerging from prior loss, and the ending is future-facing (ready to excavate) rather than showing a first excavation with immediate cost. Three beats, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong, cost oblique.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "tremor in her ribs," "fear quake through her reverie until it became a steady vibration she could tune" establish quaking/vibration early. Development: "her knees loosen" at the dozen pale eyes, "quaking reverie guiding her steps" in the final line. Payoff: the final descent is framed by "quaking reverie," charging the closure. Tone is consistent—dreamlike, tremulous, contemplative—and modulates slightly (fear → tuned vibration → guiding force). Two beats (tremor/fear quake, final descent), closure participation strong, specificity moderate. One slip: "quaking reverie" in the final line risks label rather than embodied sensation, and the tone is more sustained than dynamically shifted under peak pressure.</comment>
