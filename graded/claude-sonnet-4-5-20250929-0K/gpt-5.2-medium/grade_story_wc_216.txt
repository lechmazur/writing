<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is consistent—seeking texture rather than extension—and the urn fragment embodies grief with specificity. Internal contradiction appears when he sets down the fragment: the act is dramatized but the shift to "timeless, not immortal but unmoored" reads more as authorial declaration than embodied choice under pressure. Mara remains functional but static, applying pressure without her own contradictory impulses. The final duty is earned by prior causality, but the cost (losing his pulse-countdown) lands conceptually rather than viscerally, weakening the embodied throughline at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (numbers fail, clocks ornament, riddles replace dates) and transitions cleanly through garage-sale stalls into the silo chamber. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli writes the new tag, a duty begins, and "the mystery of texture to deepen" crystallizes his shift from countdown to cycle. Cost is visible—his borrowed year "slips off"—but the final image of waiting dilutes immediacy slightly. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 120 words, no penalty. One meaningful deepening (capsule exchange) narrows options and the lens holds to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is signaled early, micro-setting (the capsule cradle, green light, iron-filings air) charges the exchange beat, and the spatial choreography (spiral stair, vent chamber, service door) remains coherent. The urn fragment and capsule seam function as object-as-setting, constraining the final choice when Eli places the shard and the humming stops. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eli's professional past (chronometric vents) and present urgency. The silo's stored wind and green-filtered light recur to charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and drives the climb into the silo. The capsule exchange is a meaningful tightening: Eli's borrowed year "slips off," options narrow to custodian duty. Cost is visible (timelessness replaces countdown) but the final move—writing a tag and waiting—reads passive, lowering agency at closure. Mara's invitation and the tag sequences deepen the accumulative lens without requiring reversals. One persistent constraint (grief as ballast) shapes the exchange, but the ending's open patience slightly diffuses the felt price compared to a decisive forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as texture and transition rather than count—emerges from concrete particulars: the urn shard, capsule humming, item-tag rhythms. The final image (Eli writing a new invitation, waiting for the next seeker) reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Mara's "anticipated mysteries" expression and Eli's fragment "like a splinter." Minor slip: "grief has weight that everyone agrees on" inches toward direct thematic statement but remains anchored in the capsule's ballast mechanic. The closing duty offers resonance without tidy resolution, and the green light recurs with earned charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is character-specific (Eli notices chronometric vents, vent chambers, seams). Distance control holds, no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent, with occasional elevated phrases ("hollow throat," "folded inward like a closing eyelid") that fit the lyric-accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal and functional: Mara's lines advance plot without subtext depth. Free-indirect style is clean. One brief filter-verb cluster ("noticed how," "suspected someone") in the garage-sale paragraph slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure at the capsule exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, paragraphs breathe, no hard scaffold loops. Information density is high (silo function, capsule history, tag mechanics layered across beats). Minor overwriting in the exchange beat: "the air went utterly still" and "unable to sense his pulse as a countdown" stack abstract emotion without concrete anchor, applying −0.3. One paraphrase near the opening ("clocks…ornaments / calendars…blank art") restates the same premise across two clauses, applying −0.2 for synonym churn. Figurative language ("green light folded inward like a closing eyelid") is coherent and purposeful. Clarity remains high; no coherence breaks touch closure. Cumulative deduction −0.5 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Core premise—numbers lose meaning, grief becomes ballast for measuring time—is specific and non-obvious. The garage-sale tag embedding avoids convenience by signaling the method early and making it load-bearing (Eli follows the invitation, writes a new one). Transformation of "time capsule" from archive to transition-keeper is fresh. Emotional calculus (trading the urn shard for timelessness) feels earned in hindsight. Minor derivative note: the "last keeper of old ways" frame echoes familiar post-collapse templates, mitigated by the specificity of chronometric vents and item-description messaging. Risk-taking (numbers as soft, time as texture) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli, the borrowed-time timekeeper, is signaled in the opening line. His decision to follow the tag's message (middle beat) and to trade the urn fragment (climax beat) drive the two key turns. The choice to write a new tag at closure shifts his role from borrowed-time countdown to cycle-keeper, foreclosing the option to hoard his remaining year. Present in setup, development, and payoff with visible cost tied to his professional identity and grief. Two distinct beats (following the message, placing the shard) plus closure participation. Causal pressure is strong. Specificity: his chronometric-vent past makes the silo choice inevitable. Cost is visible (timelessness, new duty). Slightly shy of indispensable because the timekeeper role could be lightly edited to "grief-keeper" without full collapse, but the integration is very strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears in Eli's pocket (setup), he sets it on the capsule seam (middle climax), and its absence charges the final image (he no longer carries the splinter of warmth). The fragment enables the key exchange and is transformed from personal relic to systemic ballast, reweighting grief as shared anchor. Three beats: pocket introduction, exchange act, implied absence at closure. Causal pressure: the fragment's initials and "date he could not trust" make it the only artifact that fits the capsule's grief-ballast mechanic. Cost connection: trading it costs Eli his last tangible link to his mother. Irreplaceable: the etched initials and cremation origin tie directly to the grief-weight rule. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is named in the opening third ("rumors said a damaged time capsule slept inside") and becomes the focal object of the middle and ending beats. It shapes stakes: Eli climbs to find it, Mara guards it, and its broken seam holds the exchange mechanic. The capsule's damage (protester smashed it, method splintered) creates the problem Eli solves by returning a fragment. Present in setup (rumor), development (Mara's explanation), and payoff (the seam closes, humming stops). Two distinct beats plus closure. Causal pressure: the capsule's need for grief-ballast drives the trade. Cost: Eli's timelessness is the capsule's gift. Slightly shy of indispensable because "ancient grief repository" could substitute with edits, but integration is strong and specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "suddenly timeless" state arrives at the climax when Eli's borrowed year "slips off" and he becomes "unmoored, unable to sense his pulse as a countdown." It enables the final choice to write a new tag by removing deadline pressure, but the trait is more consequence than constraint—it results from the urn trade rather than shaping prior tactics. Present in middle (transformation) and payoff (waiting without countdown). One beat (the transformation moment). Cost connection: the loss of pulse-countdown is the price of the exchange. Swappability: "deathless duty" or "unmeasured keeper" could substitute without major structural change. Missing setup signal and middle development as active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the verb that frames Eli's arc: he asks "what does a second feel like" and Mara tells him "he could rediscover what time felt like by reading what people left unsaid." The action structures the middle beats (sorting tags into sensation sequences, feeling time as pressure/release) and the ending (writing a new tag to guide the next seeker). Present in setup (the question), development (tag-sorting), and payoff (writing the radio tag). Two beats: reading the ledger and writing the new tag. Causal pressure: the rediscovery method replaces countdown with cycle-sensing. Cost: the new knowledge is open-ended, never complete. Slightly replaceable: "relearn" or "rebuild understanding" could substitute with minor phrasing edits, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale item descriptions is signaled early ("Eli noticed how each tag sounded like a confession…suspected someone was embedding messages") and shapes the inciting choice (Eli follows the teacup tag's invitation). The method reappears at closure when Eli writes a new tag for the radio. Present in setup (suspicion and teacup tag), development (following the message), and payoff (writing the radio tag). Two beats: reading the teacup card and writing the radio card. Causal pressure: the indirection is necessary because "direct dates and coordinates no longer held." Cost: the method requires custodial patience, waiting for seekers. Swappability: "hidden symbols in graffiti" or "coded letters" could replace with scene edits, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named in the opening third, provides the spatial frame for all middle and ending action, and its green light charges the final image. The silo supplies the setting constraint: Eli's past work on chronometric vents makes him the one who knows the service door; the vent chamber holds the capsule; the stored wind stirs when Eli reads the tags; the green light "filters steady" and "folded inward" at the exchange. Present in setup (location anchor), development (spiral stair, vent chamber, capsule cradle), and payoff (waiting "under the steady green light"). Three or more beats: entry, climb, exchange, closure. Causal pressure: only the silo holds the capsule and only Eli knows its interior. Closure linkage: the final sentence places Eli "in the emerald silo, under the steady green light." Irreplaceable: "glass tower" or "museum vault" would lose the wind-storage and green-light specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers changed meaning" is established in the opening line and sustained as thematic backdrop (clocks ornament, calendars blank, numerals unreliable). It shapes the garage-sale exchange mechanic (sellers swap labels instead of prices) and motivates the capsule's non-numeric method. Present in setup (opening line), development (label-swapping, Mara's explanation that dates no longer hold), and payoff (Eli's new tag avoids numbers). Causal pressure: the premise forces indirection and makes the capsule relevant. Cost: without countable time, Eli's borrowed year becomes meaningless until he trades it. Swappability: "after clocks stopped" or "during the unmeasured age" could substitute without breaking structure, lowering irreplaceability. The timeframe is atmospheric constraint rather than ticking deadline, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eli's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing, the grain under the fingertips" is stated early and drives his climb to the silo, his question to Mara, and his participation in the tag-sorting. The desire creates friction: he does not want more time, yet his borrowed year is the price of understanding. Present in setup (opening exposition), development (his question at the silo base, sorting tags into sensations), and payoff (writing a new tag as an act of textured counting). Two beats: asking the question and engaging the tag-reading ritual. Causal pressure: the motivation makes him the seeker who will trade rather than hoard. Cost: gaining texture costs him the countdown. Minor weakness: the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices, slightly lowering score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early (riddles at the silo, confessional tags, rumors of the capsule) and sustained through Mara's "expression of anticipated mysteries" and the closing wait for "the mystery of texture to deepen." The tone modulates with pressure: wonder and patience at the garage sale, quiet intensity at the exchange, contemplative openness at closure. Present in setup (riddles, rumors), development (Mara's knowing expression), and payoff (waiting for the next message). Coherent through turns without flattening into static mood. The tone charges the final image by framing Eli's new duty as perpetual anticipation rather than resolution. Minor note: "anticipated mysteries" as a label risks slight on-the-nose declaration, but the accumulative texture earns it.</comment>
