<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maelin's disenchantment is concrete—"tired of prophecies" and "courtiers who offered lacy menace"—and her final choice to enter the fissure and cauterize the wound demonstrates agency with visible cost. Interiority remains consistently embodied through metaphors like "polite and persistent as lace around a throat." Rovan remains functional but sketch-level, serving pressure without full interiority. Minor voice convergence in high diction ("velvet dragged over glass") but the protagonist's hierarchy of values—rejecting both awe and menace—drives the closure choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Hybrid lens with Causal scaffolding (dream → climb → ritual → choice) deepening into Accumulative pressure as motifs (lace, blood, ember) converge at closure. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maelin cauterizes the star's wound, refusing the voice's bargain; the "plainness" of the ordinary sky frightens her more than omens, reweighting the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors (queen, council chamber, warning) land early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ember fissure mirrors the dream's cut star, narrowing options to descent or complicity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered ("night had condensed into mineral," "ash and crushed violets") and charges the final image; the fissure's heat bites through gloves, a micro-setting detail that constrains Maelin's descent. Spatial choreography is clean (postern gate → ridge → ledge → grotto mouth → fissure). The cloud-sea below and the firefly patterns create atmospheric pressure. The shale and rope are integrated into action, not catalog. Minor: the palace interior and ridge topography remain sketch-level, but at this length selective detail serves closure more than breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop dreaming or the kingdom wakes to bleeding sky—signals early and tightens when the grotto ritual reveals the cut star pulsing wetly. The voice's bargain (close the wound and lose the throne vs. keep it open and rule) is a clear escalation that narrows Maelin's options. Her descent into the fissure is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (soot-streaked, ember heat). The final plainness of the sky is a felt reconfiguration: the choice is now hers, which "frightened her more than any omen." One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—autonomy vs. hidden hands, menace as strangling ornament—emerges through concrete particulars (lace imagery, "sick of both awe and menace," the velvet voice's temptation). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Maelin's fear of plainness and true choice reweights the premise without stating a moral. The fireflies-as-stitches motif and the cauterization act are specific, not symbolic tokens. Minor: "mystery" and "temptation braided with fear" edge toward thematic echo but remain anchored in scene. No prompt-speak in the final paragraph; the ending resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maelin; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and heightens pressure ("velvet dragged over glass," "embroidery over shale"). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and advances stakes ("we wait for the first fireflies of summer"). Perceptual signature is consistent (courtly formality under duress). Minor: elevated register ("cobalt grotto above clouds," "polite and persistent as lace") occasionally feels authorial rather than character-interior, especially under peak stress. Filter verbs are minimal. The final sentence's rhythm—"that plainness frightened her more than any omen, because it meant the choice was truly hers"—lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; figurative language is purposeful ("lace around a throat," "crown-shaped ring"). Clarity holds through complex actions (rope, descent, cauterization). Minor density issue: "bleeding starlight dripping into her hands" in setup, then "bleeding starlight, Maelin said, and the words tasted like copper" mid-scene is a near-loop that slightly flattens momentum. No filter stacks or template cadence. A few elevated constructions ("velvet dragged over glass," "liquid dawn") compress meaning but verge on purple in peak beats. Proofreading is clean; no loops or scaffold otherwise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—queen climbs to cauterize a bleeding star—synthesizes prophecy-fatigue with a fresh literalization of cosmic menace. The lace motif (courtly ornament as strangling constraint) is specific and transforms the familiar "tired ruler" trope. The ritual mechanism (shared exhale, fireflies, fissure descent) feels organic to the world. Risk: the velvet-voice bargain and the choice to descend are bold but not wholly unexpected given the setup. The ending's inversion—plainness as terror—offers a memorable inflection. Swappability test: the grotto, fireflies, and cauterization are integral; removing them breaks the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maelin's disenchantment frames the opening, motivates the climb, and drives the final choice to descend and cauterize. Her agency—choosing Rovan, commanding stillness, entering the fissure—creates key turns. Present in setup, development (climb, grotto entry), and closure (descent, cauterization). Causal pressure: her weariness of "awe and menace" directly informs the refusal of the voice's bargain. Cost: soot-streaked, ember-burned hands, fear of plainness. The trait is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember grotto is signaled early (map), used in setup (goal), entered mid-scene (cobalt walls, warm air), and becomes the site of closure (fissure descent, cauterization). The fissure mirrors the dream's cut star, enabling the ritual. It constrains action (heat bites through gloves) and charges the final image (embers cool to gray, sky becomes plain). Removing it would collapse the arc. Three distinct beats; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is the dream image, the ritual's visual manifestation (pulsing wet star, thread dropping), and the substance Maelin gathers to cauterize. It shapes stakes ("stop dreaming or the sky bleeds"), tactics (climb to find the place before the sky bleeds for everyone), and closure (she gathers and presses the light upward). Cost: the act rejects the voice's bargain and forecloses the stolen-stars option. Indispensable to logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice: choosing Rovan ("obeyed her softly commanding voice without mistaking gentleness for mercy") and stopping him at the fissure ("with the same courtly tone she used to pardon traitors"). It enables her to control Rovan without force, constraining his impulse to draw his sword. Visible in setup and closure-adjacent beat. Cost: implicit (she must maintain control under pressure). Swappable with "firm" or "authoritative" without major edits; the lyric phrasing adds texture but is not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The climb is the structural spine: decision to climb (setup), ascent with ledge moment (development), and arrival at grotto enabling the ritual and descent (closure). It narrows options (leaving the palace, physical danger) and delivers Maelin to the site where the dream can be confronted. The final descent into the fissure is the climactic action. Removing "climb" breaks the arc; no simple swap exists. Causal pressure strong; three beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ritual—"a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer"—is signaled early ("the Star-Priest said they are sparks that remember the sky") and performed mid-scene. The exhale triggers the fireflies, which stitch the constellation map and reveal the bleeding star, enabling Maelin's choice. It shapes one key turn (ritual revelation) and primes closure. Not used in closure itself (descent and cauterization follow). Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal enable +0.8, closure-adjacent but not present in final image −0.3. Functional but secondary to descent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is the destination (map goal), the ritual site (warm air, violet scent), and the location of the fissure descent. It supplies the fissure as a tool/constraint (heat, embers) and charges the final image (embers cool, cloud-sea below, ordinary sky above). Three beats; closure participation strong. Removing it collapses the arc. Minor: the grotto's properties (cobalt glow, breath mechanics) are evocative but not mechanically unique; another ritual site could serve with edits. Still, high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames urgency (Star-Priest's ultimatum) and motivates immediate departure ("At dusk they left"). The timeframe tightens the decision to act now rather than delay. Present in setup and implicit through the climb (dusk → night). Not tracked as a live clock during the ritual or descent; no moment where time pressure alters tactics mid-scene. Early signal +0.5, shapes one choice (departure) +0.4, no closure participation −0.6, no middle escalation −0.3. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The recurring dreams are the inciting cause (setup), the reason for the climb (Maelin: "sleep had become her enemy"), the template for the grotto ritual (cobalt grotto, bleeding star match the dream), and the mystery solved at closure (temptation, not prophecy; she cauterizes the source). The motivation is dramatized through conflicted choice (wine, lawmaking fail; climb succeeds). Cost: confronting the dreams forces her to reject the voice's bargain and accept the terror of true choice. Indispensable across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone—lacy menace—is established early ("courtiers who offered lacy menace with their smiles," "polite and persistent as lace around a throat") and sustained through diction ("velvet dragged over glass," "crown-shaped ring that hummed with a patient threat"). It modulates at closure: the menace dissolves into plainness, which becomes a new source of fear. The tone charges the final image (ordinary sky is more frightening than omens). Coherent through turns; cadence shift at the end reweights the dominant stake. High integration but not mechanically irreplaceable; a different menacing register could serve.</comment>
