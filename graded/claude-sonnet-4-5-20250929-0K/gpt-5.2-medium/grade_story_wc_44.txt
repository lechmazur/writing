<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior contradiction and embodied perception are present—ink-stained fingers, the felt loop in her teeth—but her agency reads more as enacted ritual than forced choice under pressure. The mentor's absence motivates her search yet never becomes a live obstacle she must navigate with visible cost. Her final insight and shadow-binding feel inevitable rather than earned by a renunciation or mistake that foreclosed alternatives. The piece leans on label-work ("quietly deliberate") without dramatizing what Liora sacrifices to complete the loop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure unit—Liora dipping her finger into the reservoir and relearning the last rune to send shadows home—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (self-binding to the reservoir). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern build toward the final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the automaton opens the sealed door and reveals the reservoir. Minor deduction: the spoon-bending premise remains ornamental scaffolding rather than a constraint that shapes tactics; cost at closure is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory, automaton key, chalk circle, mirrors, and light reservoir all function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the key's heart-spring must be wound, the rune-ring traced to close loops, the door opened by pattern rather than force. Sensory details—iron and cold tea, white pool under glass—are vivid and filtered through Liora's scholarly attention. The floating isle and spoon-bent reality remain postcard backdrops; only the immediate chamber, tools, and mirrors alter tactics. The final image charges when Liora's shadow joins the rest, fulfilling the micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightens once when the automaton reveals the hidden stair and again when the sealed door opens to the reservoir. Pressure accumulates through Liora's problem-solving (wind, trace, close the loop) rather than forced trade-offs. The cost at closure is conceptual: Liora binds herself to the reservoir to send shadows home, but no live option was foreclosed by mistake or renunciation on the page. Agency reads as discovery and enactment rather than decision under competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—sealed awakenings, loops over lines, knowledge returning by closure—emerges organically through action: tracing rune-rings, the automaton walking through the door without leaving, Liora's final self-binding. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sealing herself completes the loop and teaches darkness the way home. Subtext operates cleanly in the mentor's vanishing ("sealed himself until she was ready"). Minor slip: the spoon-bending premise adds conceptual texture but does not charge the final image; the core rune-loop logic carries full thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; Liora's perceptual signature—scholarly, deliberate, attuned to runes and patterns—shapes all sensory filtering. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated ("haste had been the first loop that snapped," "knowledge returns by closing loops") without therapy-speak or register drift. Purposeful compression and lyric phrasing (e.g., "the air smelled of iron and cold tea") are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor deduction: some exposition ("an instrument of sealed awakenings...") leans toward summary rather than dramatized discovery, though it remains anchored in Liora's present investigation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most sentences advancing knowledge or image. Two paraphrase loops stand out: the automaton's "sealed awakenings" purpose is restated twice in adjacent lines, and the "loops not lines" rule recurs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mirror-corridor beat ("showed...missing") and the final paragraph ("folded and stacked like letters," "drawn through those circles"). No figurative muddle or metaphor clash. Minor scaffolding in the exposition of the mentor's rule and the automaton's function slightly dulls momentum before the door-opening beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—rune scholar relearning her mentor's craft by enacting loop-closure to restore noon's stolen shadows—feels specific and committed. The automaton key that "walked out on the other side without leaving the lock" and the reservoir where noon is stored as pooled light offer fresh angles on familiar puzzle-magic. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the conceptual physics (spoons bending reality, shadows drawn through circles) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Derivative proximity is low; the piece does not echo workshop templates. The ending's self-binding move transforms prior material and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora frames the narrative, climbs the stairs, winds the key, traces runes, speaks the hinge backward, sets the automaton, traces the final ring, and completes the closure by dipping her finger and relearning the last rune. Her choices create all key turns. Setup clear (first paragraph). Development: she enacts each ritual step. Payoff: she binds herself to the reservoir. Causal pressure moderate—choices follow ritual logic rather than competing goods. Closure linkage strong. Swappability low; Liora's scholarly training and deliberate pacing matter. Cost is conceptual (self-binding) but legible. Score limited by lack of visible trade-off or mistake that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is unwrapped, wound, set on the chalk ring, taps each rune, points toward the crack, is set against the sealed door, slides in and walks through without leaving, and curls back to stillness at closure. Setup early (chart room). Development: enables the mural-opening and door-unlocking beats. Payoff: curls back as Liora completes her work. Causal pressure high—each use advances the sequence. Closure linkage clear. Irreplaceability strong; its "toothed mouth" and ability to be both key and traveler are unique. Visible cost tied to its use (Liora must trace rings, not force entry). Beat count: at least three distinct uses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings: the automaton is "an instrument of sealed awakenings, meant to open what had been bound without waking the binding itself." The concept shapes Liora's method—she traces rune-rings to close loops rather than forcing locks—and the closure reveals the mentor "sealed himself until she was ready." Setup clear (mentor's phrase). Development: dictates tactics (tracing loops, speaking runes backward). Payoff: explains the mentor's absence and Liora's self-sealing to restore shadows. Causal pressure strong. Cost legible (Liora binds herself). Irreplaceability high; the exact phrasing and logic constrain all key moves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears twice: Liora climbs "with...a quietly deliberate pace" and kneels "quietly deliberate" at closure. The trait is told more than shown. Setup: first paragraph. Development: implied in her methodical ritual steps but not tested by a visible trade-off where haste would cost or deliberation would save. Payoff: reprised at the reservoir but without on-page friction. Cost unclear—what does she sacrifice by being deliberate rather than swift? Swappability moderate; could be replaced by "careful" or "patient." Label-only deduction applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Relearn: Liora "had to relearn his craft from scraps," relearns the rule "knowledge returns by closing loops," and at closure "relearned the last rune by feel." Setup early (mentor vanished; she starts from scraps). Development: every ritual step enacts relearning—winding the key, inscribing runes, tracing rings. Payoff: the final rune completes her education and binds her shadow. Causal pressure high; relearning drives all tactics. Closure linkage decisive. Cost visible (self-binding). Irreplaceability strong; the story hinges on apprenticeship incomplete. Beat count: at least three references across beginning, middle, end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By closing loops": signaled early ("knowledge returns by closing loops, not by stretching lines"), enacted in every beat—chalk ring, tapping runes until "the last sound met the first," speaking the hinge rune backward, tracing rune-ring around the doorframe "until the beginning met the end," and the final ring that "joined her own shadow to the rest." Setup clear (mentor's rule). Development: method constrains every attempt; she cannot force, only close. Payoff: the final loop sends shadows home. Causal pressure maximal. Cost tied (self-binding completes the loop). Irreplaceability absolute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nocturnal observatory on floating Vey: anchors who/where/when in the opening; the dome of star-maps, chart room, spiral stairs, and underside corridor provide spatial coherence. The observatory's nocturnal schedule (open only at night "when the sky felt trustworthy") sets tone but does not constrain a choice. The hidden stair and sealed door matter more as puzzle elements than as floating-isle features. Setup strong. Development: space provides tools (dome, mirrors, door) but isle-ness and nighttime do not alter tactics. Payoff: "true noon returned above Vey" reprises the setting but the closure hinges on the reservoir logic, not the observatory's unique properties. Swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the year when spoons began to bend reality" anchors the timeframe as post-catastrophe but remains ornamental. The prompt says "after spoons bend reality"; the story delivers that in the opening clause and at closure ("the spoon-bending had snapped the world's straight beam"). Setup present. Development: the bent reality explains why shadows vanish at noon but does not tighten a live clock or force a deadline. Payoff: reprised conceptually but not causally active in the ending. No urgency or ticking pressure. Swappability high; could be "after the Fracture" with minor edits. Ornamental use deduction applies.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's question—where shadows go at noon—drives her climb, her ritual enactment, and the closure revelation. Setup early (second sentence). Development: every beat pursues this answer; the automaton reveals the path to the reservoir. Payoff: she discovers noon's shadows are pooled and binds herself to return them. Causal pressure strong. Cost legible (self-binding). Friction: the motivation is curiosity/duty rather than want-versus-need tension; no competing desire tests her commitment. Irreplaceability high; the exact question shapes all choices. Told and shown in pursuit but not dramatized as conflicted desire.</comment>
