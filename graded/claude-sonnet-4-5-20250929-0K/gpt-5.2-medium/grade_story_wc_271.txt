<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina's interior life is grounded in embodied trauma markers (wet palms, soft knees, copper taste) that constrain her choices. The mid-sentence freeze and subsequent request to the drone operator show genuine cost. The final choice to leave the photograph at the cypress base demonstrates earned renunciation with visible stakes. Minor slip: Dr. Harlow's interiority remains underdeveloped, but he serves primarily as pressure vessel rather than co-protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers trauma-management tactics (breathing, attention to somatic signals, pearl of stillness) until the final beat where the buzzing-as-gull reweights prior material. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph burial with date-not-wish signals a crystallized stance with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 80 words. One meaningful deepening (panic response → practiced pause → realistic assessment) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains Mina's exposure therapy choices and the lighthouse lens becomes a micro-setting that enables the pearl of stillness. The cypress sapling parallels her stakes-and-shelter formulation. Spatial choreography (gravel paths, glass pavilion, cliff edge) remains coherent. The reed-mat windbreaks function as both literal object and embodied metaphor that charges the final planting scene without resorting to overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can Mina return to purposeful work in the presence of triggers?) is signaled early and tightens when the hobby drone forces real-time somatic management. The freeze mid-sentence is a visible cost that narrows options. The final windbreak construction and photograph burial constitute an earned stance crystallization: survival without lying. One meaningful escalation (drone buzzing → freeze → request → later gull misidentification) suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the arboretum-as-grief-work parallel: growth at measured rates, irreversible loss, stakes-shelter-record. The pearl of stillness recurs with functional variation (lens light pooling, gathering until formed). The final image—photograph in waterproof box at cypress base, labeled in two scripts with date not wish—offers a non-literal answer to "how to anchor optimism in realism" without moralizing. The closing promise ("to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing in public") risks mild thesis echo but remains grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during panic, wider during tactical planning). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mina notices bodily signals, tree labels, and crease lines as maps. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the exchange with the teen operator and Dr. Harlow advances plot. Minor diction drift: "somatic markers" and "pearl of stillness" read slightly elevated for in-scene coinage, but the latter is explicitly named as Mina's term. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the panic beat and windbreak sequence. Two minor artifacts: "bodily signals so she could pause before panic grew teeth" stacks metaphor, and "a sound like tearing metal" borders on stock trauma descriptor. The phrase "her body kept a catalog of danger that words could not file away" shows purposeful compression. No paraphrase loops detected. The final paragraph's list ("to translate, to breathe, and to keep growing") risks slight template cadence but remains voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The arboretum-as-trauma-exposure-therapy frame is a non-obvious synthesis of post-violence rehabilitation and botanical care. The lighthouse-lens-as-stillness-anchor and photograph-as-survival-record carry specific weight. The piece avoids both therapy-speak prescription and sentimentalized recovery. The stakes/shelter/record formulation is fresh. Risk: the parallel between saplings and survivor is legible but not heavy-handed. Transformation test satisfied: the beat sequence and closure depend on these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina (drone strike wedding survivor) makes the key choices: accepts interpreter role to anchor optimism in realism, asks operator to land drone, unfolds photograph for Dr. Harlow, builds windbreaks while tracking somatic signals, walks to pavilion during second buzzing, and buries photograph at cypress. Each decision alters tactics and narrows options. Present from opening; drives at least four distinct beats; causally essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crumpled photograph appears in jacket (opening), unfolded on bench beside cypress (middle), traced with detail (Samir's ring, crease as map), and tucked into waterproof box at base (closure). Each handling reweights meaning: memory → teaching tool → embodied grief → permanent marker. The crease-as-map-of-ruined-streets charges the final burial with cost. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is named early as Mina's practice, enacted at the lens pavilion (noon light pooling, thoughts slowing), and returned to when buzzing recurs ("let the light gather until the pearl of stillness formed again"). It enables a tactic (pause before panic) and shapes the middle choice to walk to pavilion rather than flee. The concept does not decisively alter the final photograph burial, limiting top-band entry. Strong lyric reprise with causal middle use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented with languages" enables Mina's hiring as interpreter and surfaces when she translates warnings, names trees and grief, and labels plantings in two scripts. The trait is more credential than constraint: the story does not hinge on linguistic skill under pressure. No visible tradeoff (e.g., mistranslation, code-switch cost). Present across setup and ending but replaceable with another enabling skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The freeze mid-sentence is the inciting cost that forces volunteers to witness her vulnerability and prompts Dr. Harlow's later question. It is the pivot from concealed management to public negotiation of triggers. Removing it would collapse the arboretum-as-public-space stakes. Drives two beats (freeze → explanation to operator; freeze precedent → later pavilion walk). Causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled early ("her body kept a catalog") and demonstrated in the panic sequence (palms wet, knees soft, copper taste, throat tightening). Mina explicitly keeps "attention on bodily signals so she could pause before panic grew teeth." The method enables the tactical walk to the pavilion and underwrites the closing promise to track breathing. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending frame; shapes attempts without fully driving closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arboretum on seaside cliff supplies the lighthouse lens (micro-setting for stillness practice), gravel paths (exposure-therapy circuit), glass pavilion (shelter and anchor), and cliff edge (proximity to erosion as realism anchor). The setting constrains Mina's return ("if something could grow here on the edge, it had to do so in full view of the sea's erosion") and the sapling planting becomes the closure vehicle. Environment pressures every major choice and charges final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper died" frames historical context (beacon dark, arboretum planted) but does not tighten present decisions. The timeframe supplies thematic resonance (old purpose extinguished, new growth) yet exerts no tactical pressure on Mina's Monday choices. Present in setup and echoed at closure ("now-dark lighthouse") but swappable with other elegiac markers. Functional background, not causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mina's stated motivation ("to anchor optimism in realism") is dramatized: she accepts the job not for money but for the cliff's clarity, articulates the stakes/shelter/record formulation, and enacts it by labeling saplings with dates not wishes. The photograph burial with "promise to return tomorrow" embodies the motivation with visible cost (public commitment despite triggers). Desire is conflicted (exposure vs. safety) and shapes at least two choices. Essential to middle and ending.</comment>
