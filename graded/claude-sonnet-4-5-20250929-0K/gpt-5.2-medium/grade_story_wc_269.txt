<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her sensory avoidance of the bleached reef, the tactile practice of tapping rhythms, and her deliberate choice of measurement over mourning ground motivation clearly. The final choice to encode the beacon schedule into tapping is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of transparent guidance with visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces when she "wanted to argue that hiding routes was a kind of lie" yet immediately accepts the logic and becomes complicit, showing genuine conflict. Minor weakness: the hooded woman's explanation arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, slightly softening the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Mara rewrites her reports to hide the schedule in tapped rhythms, accepting complicity in controlled revelation with the cost legible in "those who listened could find the safe canal while the careless would keep following the disappearing line." The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens through pattern: atlas fragments → monthly failed attempts → beacon schedule discovery → palimpsest assembly → encoded transmission. Orientation anchors (Mara, floating station, post-ban world) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the atlas exchange reweights the "disappearance" from erosion to managed timing, narrowing Mara's stance from witness to gatekeeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its isolation enables Mara's monthly skiff attempts, the glass well frames reef observation, and the metal surfaces anchor the tapping practice that charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven—"slap of water under the deck," "fog," "aluminum gunwale"—filtered through Mara's professional attention without catalog excess. The post-ban archipelago's navigational ambiguity (shifting sandbars, buoy fields, vanishing routes) directly pressures the central mystery. The tidal cycle and beacon timing create a coherent constraint that shapes the final revelation and Mara's encoded response. Spatial choreography remains clear across station, skiff, and canal encounters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the beacon meeting reweights the mystery from loss to intentional timing, forcing Mara to choose between transparency and complicity. Agency crystallizes in her decision to encode rather than publish the schedule, foreclosing open guidance with on-page cost ("so that those who listened could find...while the careless would keep following"). The hooded woman's explanation functions as reversal that narrows options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: monthly failures → chart assembly → beacon pattern recognition → timed revelation → encoded transmission. The piece leans heavily on contemplation; a second micro-choice during the confrontation would have sharpened escalation further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the palimpsest of old red line and new green detour embodies the tension between transparency and protection, while the tapping practice becomes a method of selective transmission without stating a thesis. The piece resists moralizing—Mara's complicity is neither condemned nor celebrated, and the tension between "hiding routes was a kind of lie" and "people still hurried, cutting across recovering coral flats" remains unresolved, inviting reflection. The final image—"drifting moored, holding measurements and secrets in a world that moved by cycles that might be periodically eternal if people kept choosing restraint"—reweights prior material through the juxtaposition of fixity and drift, offering a resonant answer to controlled revelation without didacticism. The bleached reef freckling with new color anchors hope without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance remains stable third-close throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices millimeters, beacon schedules, and coral heads with professional granularity, while emotional filtering shows in "trying not to smell the reef" and "a question she could not ask anyone." Diction stays within her lexicon—scientific yet plainspoken—with controlled modulations under pressure. The single exchange with the hooded woman is brief but functional, goal-driven rather than expository. Purposeful compression in the middle third (monthly attempts summarized, lunar cycle condensed) maintains momentum without obscuring causality. Minor slip: "the delayed revelation struck her harder than guilt" tells rather than shows the emotional shift, and the phrase "periodically eternal" in the final line drifts slightly toward abstraction, though it remains voice-plausible as reflective summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, situation, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative beats in the opening balanced by shorter tactical sentences during the skiff sequence. The palimpsest image and tapping motif recur with reweighted meaning rather than mere decoration. Clarity remains strong throughout. However, a paraphrase loop appears in the opening: "the loss had made her choose work that measured change instead of mourning it" closely restates the prior "coral bleaching witness" concept without adding new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the middle: three consecutive sentences beginning with "She [verb]" or noun-then-verb in the chart-assembly passage create slight rhythmic drag (−0.3). The phrase "feeling moored to the station by duty and drifting toward a question" stacks two metaphors that nearly contradict (moored vs. drifting), though the tension reads semi-intentional given the "drifting moored" motif (−0.2). No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-ban navigation control, tidal-timed routes, and encoded transmission via rhythmic tapping feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template eco-fables. The transformation of "coral bleaching witness" from passive observer to active gatekeeper through the palimpsest and tapping motifs offers a fresh angle on environmental stewardship. The piece commits fully to its premise—paths hidden not by erosion but by intentional timing—and follows implications without retreat. However, the post-apocalyptic infrastructure detail (tide turbines, solar, skiff-and-sail transport) leans slightly generic in the opening, and the hooded stranger delivering the reveal is a familiar mechanism. The tapping practice and beacon schedule provide the most original textures. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, warranting modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's identity as coral bleaching witness frames her motivation (measurement over mourning) in the opening and charges the final image when she watches the reef "slowly freckling with new color." Her witnessing drives the key choice: accepting complicity in controlled revelation rather than transparent mapping. Present in setup, middle (chart assembly), and closure (watching through the glass well), with visible cost in her shift from witness to gatekeeper. The choice to encode rather than publish is causally rooted in her witnessing past. Strong integration, though the witnessing itself is more backstory anchor than on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in setup (torn out, kept in locker), drives the middle (monthly skiff attempts following the red line), and returns transformed at closure (taped into palimpsest with the new green detour). The object constrains choice: Mara's failed navigation attempts stem from following the atlas, and the hooded woman's second page reweights the first. The palimpsest becomes the conceptual hinge for the ending, where both pages together embody the hidden dual map. Handled physically in three distinct beats with escalating meaning. Essential to the story's logic; removing it would collapse the revelation structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire narrative: paths exist only "in time slices instead of space," the beacons blink on a periodic schedule, and Pelican Spur is revealed "only when tides were high enough." The concept constrains Mara's failed monthly attempts, shapes the hooded woman's explanation, and directly drives the ending choice to encode the schedule in tapping so guidance is transmitted selectively. Present in setup (paths that "disappear"), developed through beacon pattern recognition, and paid off when Mara becomes the next gatekeeper of timed knowledge. The concept is irreplaceable; substituting "hidden" or "forgotten" paths would break the tidal-timing logic and the periodically-eternal motif. Cost is legible: transparency is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as descriptor for the beacon schedule ("so regular it felt periodically eternal") and returns in the final image ("cycles that might be periodically eternal if people kept choosing restraint"). The trait constrains interpretation: the routes exist in repeating time rather than fixed space, shaping Mara's realization and her choice to encode the schedule as cyclical guidance. Present in setup idea, developed in beacon observation, and charged in closure. However, the phrase functions more as thematic label than concrete physical constraint—it describes rhythm rather than enabling a discrete action with visible cost. Solid lyric integration but one step short of indispensable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Assembly drives two major beats: Mara assembles the chart from atlas, GPS tracks, and beacon log (middle turn that reveals the periodic pattern), then assembles both atlas pages into the palimpsest (closure beat that crystallizes the dual-map logic). The action is causally essential—without assembling fragments, she cannot decode the timing or accept the revelation. The palimpsest image is irreplaceable; swapping "assemble" for "compare" or "study" would lose the physical synthesis that embodies her shift from observer to co-conspirator. Cost is visible: assembly requires accepting the logic of hidden corridors. The action appears across setup ideation, middle execution, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tapping practice is introduced in setup (Lito teaching knuckle-to-metal codes), used in the middle (Mara taps on the desk to guide thoughts, then on the gunwale to elicit the hooded woman's response), and becomes the method of closure (encoding the beacon schedule into tapped rhythms for service calls). The mechanics matter: tapping functions as both cognitive tool and covert transmission, shaping Mara's choice to hide guidance "without printing it." Present in three beats with escalating function. However, the middle usage (tapping on the desk "to guide her thoughts") is slightly ornamental; the gunwale tap and closure encoding do the heavier causal work. Strong integration but not quite indispensable across all appearances.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station supplies the isolation that enables Mara's monthly skiff attempts, houses the locker with the atlas, provides the glass well for reef observation, and offers metal surfaces (desk, railing) for tapping practice. The station's floating, moored state mirrors Mara's final condition ("drifting moored") and constrains her access to the world—she must take the skiff to follow the atlas. Present in setup, middle (monthly departures and returns), and closure (watching the reef, tapping the railing during service calls). The setting is irreplaceable: a land-based post would lack the tidal/navigational pressure. Strong micro-setting that shapes multiple tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The post-ban timeframe establishes the world constraint (walking and sailing as main transport, tide turbines and solar power) and provides the backstory catalyst (bleached reef, path disappearances). However, the ban itself is setup context rather than active pressure in the present conflict. The story could function with minor edits in any low-infrastructure maritime setting. The timeframe colors atmosphere and explains resource scarcity but does not tighten a decision within the scene window. Present in setup and thematic backdrop, absent from middle escalation and closure. Functional context, but swappable for other collapse/recovery scenarios.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's desire to discover why paths disappear is the dominant stake, signaled in the opening ("why some paths disappear, why routes...ended now in mangrove walls or in nothing at all") and pursued through every beat: monthly skiff attempts, chart assembly, beacon waiting, skiff journey into fog. The motivation is dramatized in her repeated failures and her physical actions (taking the atlas out, tracking GPS, cutting the engine to listen). Friction between the want and cost surfaces when she realizes the paths are hidden on purpose and must choose complicity over transparency. The motivation drives the closure choice directly. Desire, pursuit, conflict, and cost are all on the page. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" establishes tone in the opening image (the station "drifting in its leash like a patient animal") and returns in the final line ("she felt herself like the platform, drifting moored"). The tone—patient constraint, passive motion within limits—coheres through Mara's solitary waiting, her repeated failed attempts, and her acceptance of encoded rather than open guidance. Tone modulates with pressure: contemplative in the opening, alert during the beacon sequence, resigned yet purposeful at closure. The dual motion (drift and anchor) charges the ending by embodying Mara's new stance. Strong lyric bookend that reweights the opening image with closure cost. The tone is irreplaceable; "isolated" or "watchful" would miss the productive tension.</comment>
