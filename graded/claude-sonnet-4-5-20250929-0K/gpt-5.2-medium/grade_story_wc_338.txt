<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lena's interior is well-specified through her framing craft and "guarded kindness," and her choices track through the investigation with consistent curiosity. The trait of interpreting "silence with empathy" governs her final choice to honor the erased rather than treat the vault as exhibit. However, her emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction—she moves smoothly from curiosity to resolution without visible struggle or competing impulse that would raise stakes. The climactic sitting moment ("practiced the craft she used with customers") summarizes rather than dramatizes the renunciation, and the final choice feels prepared rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered discovery (torn map → video reels → henge → vault → parish records). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow "no longer needed to wander" after Lena witnesses with care) that reweights the premise with visible cost—she frames the rip rather than hiding it, and the vault becomes archive rather than exhibit. However, the cost remains conceptual and told ("the shadow no longer needed to wander") rather than felt on the page through a decisive image or forfeiture that alters Lena's stance. The "soft applause" of rain and the agreement with the archivist deflate tension rather than crystallize it, and the because/therefore linkage between her witnessing and the shadow's cessation is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shop above the harbor, the torn chart on the worktable, the henge ring, and the rain-scoured vault are all vivid and purposeful. The framing knife, notebook, and camera anchor Lena's professional lens, and the vault's pale fresco and persistent water constrain her investigation and charge the final archive decision. Spatial choreography (counter → back room → henge → stairway → alcove → ascent) remains clear across the full sequence. The setting works actively: the torn map divides known from unknown, the henge's seam marks the threshold, and the vault's dampness becomes "soft applause" at closure, reweighting the silence motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy to honor erased lives—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The investigation tightens through layered discovery: map tear → video shadows → henge seam → vault alcove → parish records. However, escalation relies on accumulation rather than a visible choice under pressure that narrows options or imposes cost. The climax ("she sat on the damp floor, let the silence settle, and practiced the craft") is reflective summary, not a dramatized decision with competing goods or felt forfeiture. The archivist's initial resistance vanishes off-page, and Lena's final framing choice—though thematically apt—arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that would ground the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—witness and consent for erased lives—emerges organically from the torn map, the wandering shadow, and the crossed-out parish records without thesis statement. The whispered chapel "keeping company" and Lena's refusal to "treat the vault as an exhibit" offer a resonant answer to how silence can heal or harm depending on who listens. The final inscription "FOR THOSE WHO WERE QUIET" and the frame that reveals rather than hides the tear charge the closure with purposeful ambiguity. One minor slip: "the whispers softened into a silence that felt like permission" edges toward thematic echo, though it stays within the metaphor system and avoids outright moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature—reading travelers from map creases, tracing lines "until it stopped," imagining consent—is consistent and distinct. Syntax and diction are controlled, though rhythmic variation is modest. However, two friction points lower the score: (1) "a wish to interpret silence with empathy" in the opening is prompt-echo phrasing that feels inserted rather than voice-organic, and (2) elevated register in reflection ("methodically curious," "guarded kindness shift into an openness she could still shield from superstition") drifts toward essayistic summary rather than embodied thought under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not assessed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances discovery or reweights prior material. Sentence openings vary, and spatial choreography remains clear across the full sequence. However, several template-cadence and paraphrase artifacts dull momentum: "She carried the reels… compared them… noticed something" and "She set her camera… then where the newer reel had stood, and by comparing" share identical syntactic stems across adjacent clauses. The phrase "silence that felt like permission" echoes "quiet that felt like [X]" stock constructions. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to thicken," "felt her guarded kindness shift") appear in mid-pressure beats without voice motivation. These patterns accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Clarity and momentum remain intact, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—a map framer investigating a chapel via silent video comparison—is specific and non-obvious. The torn chart as literal/metaphorical division and the shadow that "begs" to be witnessed offer fresh inflection on haunting-as-archive. However, the premise (historical injustice memorialized through objects and landscape) closely tracks academic and literary templates for witness narratives, and the emotional arc (curiosity → empathy → gentle archive) follows a predictable consent-culture resolution without significant friction or surprise. The final framing choice—revealing the tear rather than hiding it—is thematically apt but arrives without the bold risk or counter-intuitive turn that would elevate originality into the high band. Transformation is partial: the specifics are memorable, but the moral calculus is anticipated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena's perception shapes every beat: reading the map tear, comparing video angles, tracing the henge line, recognizing the alcove, imagining consent, framing the rip without hiding it. Her choices—walking to the henge, filming the ascent, assembling side-by-side videos, writing the inscription—create all major turns and charge the closure. However, her decisions arrive smoothly without visible cost or competing impulse on the page, so the causal pressure reads as methodical rather than pressured. Early signal (first sentence), three-beat involvement (video analysis, vault descent, framing choice), closure linkage (the frame and inscription), and specificity (framing craft informs every tactic) all support mid-7s; the lack of dramatized trade-off or forfeiture caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in two beats: Lena walks to it ("at its center she found the missing edge… the line of division cut like a seam") and leaves it after retrieving the box ("the rain on the henge stones sounded like soft applause"). It marks the threshold between known and unknown, and the seam motif links to the map tear. However, the henge itself is not handled or used—it is a spatial marker rather than a manipulated object. The "soft applause" reprise reweights the silence motif lyrically but does not alter Lena's tactics or impose cost. Early signal (first third via the archivist's circled ring), two-beat presence, closure proximity (the ascent), and thematic linkage support mid-5s; static use and swappability (any threshold symbol could serve) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispered chapel defines the dominant stake and governs tactics throughout: silence that "heals or harmed depending on who listened" frames Lena's empathy-driven investigation. It appears in the archivist's request, the video labels ("WHISPERED CHAPEL, DO NOT RESTORE"), the vault descent where "the air seemed to thicken with unsaid words," the alcove discovery where "the whisper was the chapel keeping company," and the closure where "the whispers softened into a silence that felt like permission." The concept shapes every turn—Lena listens for "what pain might be hiding behind the quiet," practices consent with the vault, and reopens it as a living archive rather than sealing or exploiting it. Early signal (first third), four-beat involvement, causal pressure (the whisper mystery drives all moves), closure linkage (the final silence is permission), and irreplaceability (no other premise fits) all support high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is signaled early ("kept her curiosity shielded… stayed methodically curious") and enables multiple on-page actions: comparing video frames "frame by frame," tracing the road to the henge ring, setting the camera at both historical angles, imagining consent before framing. The trait contrasts with superstition and guides her patient, evidence-driven approach. However, it never constrains or imposes visible cost—there is no moment where methodical patience conflicts with urgency or empathy, no trade-off where her curiosity forecloses another path. The trait functions as enabling label rather than friction. Early signal, two-beat involvement (video analysis, camera placement), and specificity support low-6s; absence of cost or conflict caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the inciting action (the archivist asks her to "reopen the case") and the climactic resolution (Lena and the archivist "agreed to reopen Saint Edrin… as a place where villagers could bring old maps"). The entire investigation is an act of reopening: she reopens the video case, the sealed henge threshold, the cracked alcove, and finally the vault itself—not as exhibit but as living archive. The action redefines options: reopening shifts from detective work to witness and consent. Early signal (first third), three-beat involvement (case, alcove, vault), closure linkage (the final agreement), causal pressure (every turn depends on this verb), and irreplaceability (no synonym captures the double meaning of investigation and restoration) all support high-8s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Video comparison is signaled early ("two reels of silent video footage… 1968 and 1999") and shapes two key beats: Lena "compared them frame by frame… noticed something no one had written down: in both decades, a shadow moved," and later "she filmed the ascent so future eyes could compare this moment with the earlier decades." The method enables discovery (the shadow's consistent direction toward the tear) and charges the closure (the shadow no longer wanders once Lena witnesses it). She replicates the camera angles on-site, proving the method's mechanics matter. Early signal, two-beat involvement, causal pressure (the shadow pattern drives the vault search), closure linkage (the final video completes the trilogy), and specificity (side-by-side comparison is irreplaceable) support mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vault appears in three beats: the descent ("a rain scoured fresco vault where saints and storm clouds had been painted together"), the alcove search ("she found not treasure but a box of unframed maps"), and the ascent ("the rain on the henge stones sounded like soft applause"). It supplies resources (the hidden parish records) that resolve the mystery and alter the outcome. The persistent water ("colors washed to pale bones by water that never stopped finding its way in") constrains access and charges the final image of erasure and endurance. Lena sits on the damp floor, embodying presence in the space. The vault's dual role as archive and wound links to theme. Early signal (first third as destination), three-beat involvement, causal pressure (the vault's contents redefine the whisper), closure linkage (ascent and reopening), and specificity (the water and fresco details are irreplaceable) support mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown"—is a spatial metaphor rather than a temporal constraint. The torn chart is present throughout as a visual anchor and thematic symbol, but it does not function as a clock or deadline that tightens decisions. The three-day interval ("Three days later she walked") is mentioned but does not create urgency or alter tactics. The map tear shapes what Lena investigates (the blank margin, the henge, the erased lives) but does not pressure when or how. Early signal (first paragraph), two-beat involvement (worktable and final framing), and thematic linkage support low-4s; absence of temporal pressure and swappability (any dividing line could serve) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is signaled early ("Lena accepted not from faith but from a wish to interpret silence with empathy") and governs every choice: she listens "for what pain might be hiding behind the quiet," sits with the vault's silence, "imagined the people behind the ink, listened for their consent," and refuses to treat the vault as exhibit. The motivation conflicts with the archivist's wish to seal the chapel again, creating friction at closure. However, the internal conflict between curiosity and empathy is asserted rather than dramatized—Lena never faces a moment where empathy costs her knowledge or where silence resists interpretation. Early signal, three-beat involvement (vault listening, consent practice, reopening negotiation), closure linkage (the final archive decision), and causal pressure support low-7s; lack of on-page trade-off or friction prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is embodied throughout: Lena "kept her curiosity shielded, offering customers only a practiced warmth," her "guarded kindness shift into an openness she could still shield from superstition," and the final vault becomes "a place where villagers could bring old maps and stories" (open) "not as a tourist stop" (shielded). The tone modulates with pressure: reserved at the counter, attentive at the henge, still at the vault, collaborative with the archivist. The diction remains measured even under discovery, matching Lena's professional restraint. The final image—"the whispers softened into a silence that felt like permission"—charges the tone with earned release. Early presence (first paragraph), coherent modulation across beats, and closure linkage support mid-6s; the tone never faces a test that threatens to break the shield or force unguarded exposure, limiting upper range.</comment>
