<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to repay the bride is clear and drives his final choice to give up the bead and match his heartbeat to its rhythm. Interior work is vivid—"joy and grief braided together until my chest hurt with a kind of mournful elation"—and the embodied cost of returning the bead is felt. However, the backstory of the marriage abandonment arrives through told exposition ("my hands in another life, sealing a marriage charm…and then abandoning her") rather than dramatized memory, weakening the felt urgency of the debt. The ending renunciation is earned, but the stakes feel abstract because we never see Eli wrestle with the trade-off on the page before he commits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive act—Eli returns the bead, matches his heartbeat to the stone's rhythm, and awakens the orchard—paying a visible cost ("knowing she would sleep unchained, and feeling elation mournfully echo through my empty name"). Orientation is swift and evocative, anchoring greenhouse, orchard, and moonlight elixirs by the second paragraph. The causal chain holds: bead pulses → trees respond → bride returns → resonator built → bead returned → orchard awakens. One slip: the bride's second visit introduces the debt backstory through summary flashback rather than dramatized pressure, which momentarily flattens the escalation before the resonator build recovers momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and functional: "alchemical orchard under glass, rows of grafted pear and mandrake trees, shrouded in endless night" anchors the space early, and tools (copper tubes, quince wood, the resonator) constrain Eli's choices. The winter-locked valley and moonlight-into-sap alchemy create a coherent, specific world. The bead and resonator charge the final image when the orchard wakes "in a rush of blossoms that smelled of weddings." Minor: spatial choreography of the bride's exact position among the roots could be sharper, and the valley's broader geography remains vague outside the greenhouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awaken the orchard to fulfill the debt and save the valley—is signaled early and tightens when the bride reveals "you owe me" and explains completion requires her death-frequency. Escalation is clean: bead pulses → trees tremble → bride returns with demand → Eli builds resonator → final act of matching heartbeat. The cost is visible: Eli must give up the bead (his only keepsake) and risk his pulse to unlock the orchard. However, the choice itself is not dramatized as a difficult trade-off; Eli moves straight to building the resonator without on-page hesitation or competing desire, which mutes the pressure at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: debt across lifetimes, the cost of completion, and the intertwining of gain and loss ("mournful elation"). The bead returns with reweighted meaning—from lucky trinket to the bride's missing heart to the key that unlocks both orchard and Eli's empty name. The final image of eating the glowing pear "in tears, knowing the valley would live, knowing she would sleep unchained" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the debt question without moralizing. The orchard-as-wedding motif ("blossoms that smelled of weddings") ties the failed marriage to the fulfilled promise. No thematic sermonizing; the concepts of resonance and completion are enacted rather than explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Eli with a consistent lyric-alchemical register ("distilled moonlight into sap," "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo appearance"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching the alchemist-narrator tone. The bride's single line of dialogue—"Eli, you still carry my bead"—feels natural and goal-driven, and her later "You owe me" and "Repay me" carry subtext of both tenderness and demand. Minor slips: "ephemeral cameo appearance" and "ashen-veil ghost bride" read as author-label intrusions rather than Eli's idiom, momentarily breaking the established voice. Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors, attention to resonance and frequency) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong images—"the hem of her dress sliding through fallen leaves without stirring them," "the mortars rang with a second tone, like a bell under water." Information density is high, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several overwriting artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: "joy and grief braided together," "lovingly venomous," "mournful elation," and the stacked metaphor "ashen-veil ghost bride…ghost forward" within a single passage create figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the second-night visit: "She had died…and I had fled…Now, in this night-locked valley, she had tracked…" (parallel past-perfect clauses). These issues do not obscure causality but dull immediacy. Minor: "ephemeral cameo appearance" is used twice, once as phrase and once as echo, and reads as scaffolding rather than organic repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, debt-across-lifetimes, and resonant-frequency-as-relationship feels specific and non-obvious. The bride as both creditor and catalyst, the bead as both keepsake and missing heart, and the orchard as the bride's family legacy all cohere into a unified premise. The transformation of the ghost-bride trope through alchemical mechanics and the moonlight-distillation conceit provide fresh angles. However, the "orphanage burned / only thing I rescued / stranger's bones" setup and the "debt I don't remember but must repay" frame are familiar templates, and the story does not fully escape their gravitational pull. Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and the quiet, inward climax, which heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride appears in three beats: first visit (signals debt), second visit (demands repayment and explains the orchard's need), and final materialization (receives the bead and awakens the orchard). Her demand—"Repay me"—forces Eli's climactic choice to return the bead and match his heartbeat. Her specificity (bead carved into her throat, death-frequency as key) and her dual role as creditor and enabler make her indispensable. The bride drives two major turns and shapes the ending directly. Minor: her first appearance is somewhat passive observation, but subsequent visits carry clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is present in four distinct beats: Eli wearing it (setup), the bride revealing its match in her throat (first turn), the bead pulsing with heat and pulling shiver from trees (escalation), and Eli placing it around the bride's neck while matching his heartbeat to its rhythm (closure). Each use reweights its meaning: lucky trinket → bride's missing heart → resonator key → final payment. The bead's removal forecloses Eli's link to his past and completes the orchard awakening. It is causally essential across the arc and charges the final image. No swappable equivalent could provide the same specificity or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings shapes the story's mechanics and stakes: the bead's frequency wakes the grafted trees, and only the bride's death-frequency can unlock the orchard's first purpose. Eli must build a resonator and match his heartbeat to the bead's rhythm to complete the awakening. The concept appears in three beats: trees trembling in response to the bead's pulse, Eli recalling "resonant awakenings, when a matched frequency wakes what has been sleeping," and the final act of singing until his heartbeat matches the stone. It drives tactics (building the resonator) and enables closure. However, the middle exposition ("I remembered old theory from my master…") is told rather than enacted, and the concept could have been introduced more concretely through earlier action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lovingly venomous appears once as a descriptor for the bride's voice: "a lullaby laced with the bite of truth." The paradox recurs thematically in her dual role—tender creditor and sharp demander—and in the final touch that is "cold enough to burn, sweet enough to make me want it again." However, the attribute itself is label-only in its initial mention and does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors tone and relationship but remains more descriptive than causal. It is present and thematically coherent but not indispensable to the plot's mechanics or Eli's choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ghost appears as the bride's mode of presence: she "ghost[s] forward" in her first entrance and later "could only ghost me through ephemeral cameo appearances." The action recurs across three visits and defines the bride's constraints (each visit costs her a century of rest, limiting her time). However, the ghosting itself is more atmospheric than mechanically essential; the bride could appear through another spectral means (fade, shimmer, flicker) with minor edits and the story's logic would hold. The verb choice is evocative and consistent, but the action does not uniquely redefine options at closure. Mid-band: present across beats, functional, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through ephemeral cameo appearances is signaled early ("She vanished then, an ephemeral cameo appearance that left frost on the glass") and recurs as the bride's constraint: "she could only ghost me through ephemeral cameo appearances, each visit costing her a century of rest." The method shapes Eli's tactics—he must build the resonator to enable her full materialization—and it structures the story's escalation across three visits. The bride's inability to stay long creates urgency and explains why Eli must act decisively. The method is causally active in the middle and enables the final turn when she "materialized fully, ashen-veil ghost bride no longer hiding behind quick entrances." Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is present from the opening line and anchors every beat. It supplies Eli's means (moonlight distillation, grafted pear and mandrake trees), constrains his world (no sun, winter-locked valley), and is the site of all action. The orchard's need—to remember its first purpose and wake for famine years—is the story's dominant stake. The greenhouse setting enables the resonator build, houses the bride's visits, and is transformed at closure when "the orchard woke in a rush of blossoms." Spatial choreography is clear (path between beds, roots, glass panes), and the setting's resources and constraints drive every choice. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Over the hush of winter-cracked fields appears in the opening phrase and establishes the story's atmosphere, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. We know the rivers freeze "on the first night," and events span at least two nights (first and second bride visits, then the resonator-build night), but no live clock pressures Eli's choices. The winter setting provides environmental constraint (cold, endless night) scored in Q9 G, but time as a discrete element remains vague and untracked. The phrase is evocative but functionally replaceable with another seasonal marker. Present in setup, minimal middle development, no closure participation. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To repay a debt across lifetimes is the story's dominant motivation, signaled when the bride says "you owe me" and reveals Eli abandoned her at the altar in another life. The debt drives Eli's choices: he builds the resonator, returns the bead, and matches his heartbeat to the stone's rhythm to fulfill the promise. The motivation is dramatized through the bride's demand and Eli's embodied response (giving up his only keepsake, risking his pulse). Friction between desire and cost is visible: "knowing she would sleep unchained, and feeling elation mournfully echo through my empty name." The debt reweights the orchard's purpose (her family planted it) and charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending, with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mournful elation appears explicitly in the opening encounter ("joy and grief braided together until my chest hurt with a kind of mournful elation") and recurs in the ending ("feeling elation mournfully echo through my empty name"). The tone is coherent through turns: the bride's tender-yet-venomous voice, the cold-yet-sweet touch, the triumph-and-loss smile, and Eli eating the glowing pear "in tears, knowing the valley would live." The paradox modulates under pressure, sharpening as Eli nears the final choice, and charges the closure image. The tone is purpose-driven and irreplaceable, shaping both emotional texture and thematic resonance. Strong across beats and ending.</comment>
