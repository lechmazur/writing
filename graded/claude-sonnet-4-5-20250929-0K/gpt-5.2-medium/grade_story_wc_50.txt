<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation is clearly stated early ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") and his peripheral focus is shown through concrete observation ("scratch beside a keyhole more than the door"). However, his interior experience during the core work remains largely externalized description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to carry the timer out feels like completion of a task rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; he experiences relief but no dramatized internal trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Ivo studies, measures, marks, and builds across days until the device ticks and the echoes align—a density increase that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he completes the work, the cavern exhales, and he carries wonder stored for later need. The cost is conceptual—wonder captured and deferred—but the final image makes it legible without a sharp emotional price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (veined marble, warped lantern bands, polished stone cathedral) and directly constrains Ivo's work: he marks reflection angles, shaves marble to exact angles, and anchors the timer to a reflective seam. Spatial choreography is clean across the days-long span. The setting participates in the closure—the cavern "exhales in relief"—charging the final image with purposeful environmental response.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: fix the timer mechanism and understand the echo-swallowing cavern. Pressure accumulates through study, marking, and gear-fitting across days; the nightly tremor introduces overflow as complication. The Accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening when Ivo realizes "the swallowing was not hunger but overflow" and responds by rebuilding the escapement to let echoes settle. The cost is legible—the timer now holds gathered sound—but the protagonist's agency at closure reads more as completion than a choice that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: wonder stored against grief and plainness, echoes as layered memory, the tension between reason and the miraculous. The final image—"when reason needed a hidden cellar door to wonder"—inverts the opening metaphor without stating a moral, and the timer as vessel for gathered sound resonates with the opening intention. The piece resists tidy resolution; the echoes remain a charged mystery rather than explained. One minor slip: "wounded season" recurs three times without deepening meaning, trending toward ornamental motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; psychic distance is controlled and consistent. The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly archaic texture ("peripherally focused," "reverse-engineer the problem by reading surfaces") that suits Ivo's craft and reflective bent. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon—technical, observant, precise—without unmotivated register shifts. One line approaches over-articulation: "the uneasy gap between them" feels like authorial comment rather than Ivo's thought under pressure, but it does not break focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and often vivid ("quick silver lines," "sharp tap and then a softer copy"), but several lines accumulate figurative density without clear pattern-teaching: "metal remembered when it cooled," "harvest of echoes," "surfaces were not only metal; they were sound, light, and the uneasy gap between them." This clusters metaphorical weight in the opening third without on-page payoff until the end. Sentence openings vary well; no template cadence or loops. The figurative muddle in early beats applies a −0.6 deduction within Q7 for density without coherence, but the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith craft, acoustic phenomenon, and temporal metaphor is specific and non-obvious; the idea of storing echoes in a timer mechanism through reflection angles feels fresh. Ivo's peripheral focus and his method of reading surfaces to solve problems are well-integrated. The "wounded season" frame and the metaphor of storing wonder remain somewhat abstract and could apply to other contemplative protagonists. Transformation test: the emotional arc (craftsman gathers wonder for future need) is transferable, but the specific mechanics (marble angles, escapement from reflection) anchor originality solidly in mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivo is named and characterized early; his reflective nature and peripheral focus shape his observational method. He makes one key choice: to go to the cavern (para 5) and another to rebuild the escapement with marble (para 15). These choices advance plot and enable closure, but they read more as craft problem-solving than decisions with competing costs. Present in setup, development, and ending; two beats; causal enabler; +0.3 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal, +0.7 closure = baseline 5.7 +2.7 = 8.4, but swappability (a careful artisan could replace him) −0.5 and no visible emotional cost in choice −0.3 = 7.6, rounded down to 6.2 after recognizing observational rather than decisional agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timer mechanism appears in para 3 (courier brings it), is turned in Ivo's hands at para 7, receives a temporary gear (para 13), and is rebuilt with marble escapement (para 15), then carried out holding echoes (para 16). Four distinct beats; causally necessary; charges the final image. +0.3 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.2 causal, +1.4 closure, +0.6 specificity (marble sliver at exact angle) = baseline 5.9, total signals +4.9 = 10.8, capped at 10.0 on scale. Slight downward adjustment for the fact that its interior function is told rather than shown in action: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is introduced in para 4 and governs Ivo's work: he separates layered sounds (para 12), aligns echoes with timer ticks (para 13), and carries a "gentle chorus" out (para 16). The concept shapes stakes (understanding echo overflow) and the closure image (timer holds gathered sound). +0.3 early, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.2 closure, +0.5 specificity = baseline 5.8, signals +3.9 = 9.7. Minor friction: the mechanics of "gathering" remain metaphorical rather than tactile; −0.4 for abstraction, −0.3 for some ornamental phrasing ("ripened into something you could gather") = 9.0 −0.7 = 8.3, adjust to 6.8 recognizing that echoes as theme rather than physical constraint limit irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is named in para 6 and demonstrated: Ivo notices "the scratch beside a keyhole more than the door" and "eyes kept sliding to the edges where snowmelt traced quick silver lines." This trait enables his method of studying reflection angles (para 10) and separating echo layers (para 12). Present in setup and development; one causal beat; lyric reprise in the method. +0.4 early, +0.4 one beat, +0.6 causal, +0.4 specificity = baseline 5.8, signals +1.8 = 7.6. Friction: the trait is labeled and then shown but does not create visible cost or constrain a choice with trade-off; −0.8 label-only at peak, −0.5 no cost = 6.3, adjust to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" is named in para 9 ("began to reverse-engineer the problem by reading surfaces") and drives the work: studying angles (para 10), marking where light strikes (para 10), recognizing echo layers (para 12), and rebuilding the escapement (para 15). Three beats; causally necessary; shapes closure. +0.5 early (para 9, ~midpoint, slight late penalty −0.1), +1.4 three+ beats, +1.3 causal, +1.0 closure = baseline 6.1, signals +4.1 = 10.2 capped at 10.0. Friction: the action is somewhat generic (any repair process reverse-engineers); swappability −0.6, and it is mixed with other methods (studying, marking) rather than distinct; −0.5 for blend = 8.9, adjust to 7.1 recognizing moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles appears in para 10 ("spent days studying reflection angles at different times, marking on marble where lanternlight and sunrise struck") and is used to cut the marble sliver "to the exact angle he had measured at dawn" (para 15). Two beats; the method is specific and its mechanics matter to the solution. +0.5 early (para 10), +0.9 two beats, +1.1 causal (enables escapement), +1.0 closure (marble angle in final device), +0.7 specificity (dawn angle, exact measurement) = baseline 6.2, signals +4.2 = 10.4 capped at 10.0. Minor friction: the marking is mentioned but not shown in embodied action; −0.4 summary, −0.3 swappability (study and measurement are common) = 9.3, adjust to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced in para 3, entered in para 7, and its properties (polished stone, echo behavior, reflection seams, nightly tremors) constrain every phase of Ivo's work. He marks angles on marble (para 10), recognizes overflow (para 14), shaves marble for the escapement (para 15), and anchors the timer to a reflective seam (para 15). The cavern exhales at closure (para 16). Four+ beats; indispensable. +0.3 early, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.5 causal pressure (all tactics depend on it), +1.5 closure (exhale, seam anchor), +0.8 irreplaceability = baseline 6.5, signals +5.5 = 12.0 capped at 10.0. Minor friction: some description is postcard-like ("cathedral of stone"); −0.3 = 9.7, adjust to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Wounded season" is named in para 2 and recurs in para 11 ("Across the lull of a wounded season, the entrance thawed and froze"). It frames the timespan but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Ivo works across days without a live clock forcing trade-offs. Setup present; vague development; no closure pressure. +0.3 early, +0.4 one beat (thaw/freeze cycle), +0.0 causal (time passes but does not constrain) = baseline 5.7, signals +0.7 = 6.4. Friction: poetic but untracked; −0.8 vague, −0.6 no live clock = 5.0, adjust to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ivo's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later, when grief or plainness made him doubt he had ever heard anything miraculous") is stated in para 5 before he enters the cavern and echoed in the final line ("when reason needed a hidden cellar door to wonder"). It governs his purpose but is not tested by conflicting desires on the page; he completes the task without dramatized internal friction. Setup and closure reprise; no middle conflict. +0.6 early, +0.4 one beat (lyric bookend), +0.0 causal (no competing want), +1.0 closure (final line inversion), +0.5 specificity = baseline 6.2, signals +2.5 = 8.7. Friction: told and reprised but not dramatized with cost; −0.9 no friction, −0.5 lyric-only = 7.3, adjust to 6.5.</comment>
