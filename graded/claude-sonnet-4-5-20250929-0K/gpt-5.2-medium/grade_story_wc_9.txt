<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and embodied ("the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat"), with contradictory impulses driving toward the closure choice. The decision to relive the stolen hours rather than simply reclaim them demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction: the mother's interior voice occasionally slips into elevated register ("cloudbound repentance") that feels slightly above the exhausted postpartum state, though this reads as stylistic choice rather than failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist's choice to "ask the tree to return them slowly" and "stay willingly perplexed" reconfigures her relationship to lost time, paid off in the final image where "the blank space had filled with overlapping palms" and "a scar that proved time can return when you stop unfastening yourself from it." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—vapor-tree, pouches of lost time, the cracked saucer—building density that culminates in visible cost (reliving the hours) and a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (postpartum, cartomancer, missing time). One micro causal slip: how the protagonist knows to look for the dolls' tea set or interprets the crack's match to the tablecloth blank feels slightly under-motivated, but the pattern teaches itself and the closure effect remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The midnight glade functions as more than backdrop: "the air turned painfully clear," "jeweled with ice-light," creating sensory constraint that "choked me the way milk chokes." The vapor-braided tree with pulsing pouches labeled with names anchors the metaphysical geography and directly enables the protagonist's choice. The sigh-stair, ribbon-tether, and cracked saucer all constrain tactics. The body (daughter wrapped against chest, fist clenched like seed) operates as micro-setting throughout. The final return to the kitchen table grounds the closure image in domestic space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost postpartum time—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist finds her own pouch "fat as a plum" containing confessions she'd "begged for sleep, bargaining with the universe." The reversal pivots on agency: instead of snatching the pouch, she chooses to "relive them without trying to escape," trading convenience for integration. The tree's physical constraint ("tightening the air around me until I could barely breathe") literalizes the pressure, and the cost is visible: she must endure "washing blood from sheets, rocking through feverish dawns" again to reclaim coherence. One tightening is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tablecloth custom, the crack-as-scar image, and the protagonist's shift from bargaining away time to inhabiting it. "Time is not only what I use, it is what I owe" and the final line "time can return when you stop unfastening yourself from it" feel earned by the spread-reading, the pouch encounter, and the choice to relive rather than extract. The concept of "willingly perplexed" threads without over-assertion. The ending image—overlapping palms and the thin scar—offers a non-literal answer with visible cost (the scar) and resonance (continuity despite rupture). No thematic echo penalty; the final insight grows from scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive: "onyx-ink cartomancer," "confusion were the only honest lullaby," "beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat." POV remains stable; psychic distance contracts under pressure ("Take it, take it, to the ceiling"). The diction occasionally elevates ("cloudbound repentance," "condensed sighs") but reads as the cartomancer's idiom rather than register drift. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. One minor slip: "the mystery made me willingly perplexed" tells the attribute rather than embodying it in contradictory action, though the phrase recurs purposefully at closure to charge the final stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: "fist clenched like a seed," "crack that split like a river delta," "vapor braided into bark," "pouches that pulsed like lungs." The final third maintains clarity. One deduction for mild overwriting in the glade passage where "the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat, sweet and urgent and impossible to spit out" stacks modifiers without added pressure. A few lines approach paraphrase ("I understood that to reclaim the lost hours I had to relive them without trying to escape, so I asked the tree to return them slowly, and I stayed willingly perplexed") but the reprise of "willingly perplexed" is purposeful. Information density is strong; no scaffold or loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—cartomancy, postpartum time loss, a vapor tree holding confessions—is specific and avoids stock postpartum-exhaustion templates. The tablecloth custom and cracked-saucer clue feel particular to this story. The turn (reliving rather than reclaiming) grows from established character logic. Minor deduction: the glade-above-clouds and tree-of-lost-things motifs echo familiar fantasy conceits (time-theft, sky realms); while the cartomancy frame and the saucer-as-key provide fresh inflection, the core structure reads somewhat derivative without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's choices—reading the spread onto the saucer, climbing the sigh-stair, dealing cards at the tree's roots, asking for slow return—drive all major turns. Early signal (opening line). Present in three beats: initial card-reading, saucer divination, tree negotiation. Causally indispensable; without the cartomancy, no path to the glade or closure choice exists. Cost is visible (reliving hours). Only friction: the onyx-ink attribute is mentioned but not mechanically constrained (any divination method might have worked), so slight swappability in method lowers from highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked saucer appears in two distinct beats: discovery in the cedar box where "the fissure matched the blankness perfectly," then as the vessel for the spread that "pointed upward." It returns at the tree's roots where the protagonist "set the cracked saucer...and dealt my cards into its fracture like seeds." The crack's delta shape is specific and its matching to the tablecloth blank enables the glade journey. Final image mentions "a thin line like the saucer crack, a scar" to reweight prior material. Setup ~mid-story; beat involvement (two clear uses); closure linkage (the scar echo). Swappability slight (any object with a branching mark might substitute), but the family heirloom context and the crack-as-scar resonance elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance is named once ("That was my cloudbound repentance, not a prayer sent upward but a confession trapped here in weather") and shapes the middle beat: the protagonist's realization that her missing time was self-bargained confessions held in the glade. It reframes the stakes (not theft but voluntary surrender) and enables the final choice (relive to reintegrate). Setup late (~60%); single beat; no closure-scene mention. The concept constrains the protagonist's understanding and thus her tactic (ask for slow return vs. snatch and flee), supplying one key turn. Swappability moderate (any metaphor for trapped confession might work). Scores mid-band for one causal turn without early signal or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears in paragraph 2 ("the mystery made me willingly perplexed, as if confusion were the only honest lullaby"), recurs in the tree scene ("I stayed willingly perplexed, open to whatever hurt came"), and echoes in closure framing (staying open rather than grasping). It enables the protagonist's choice to accept ambiguity and slow return rather than demand clarity or quick fix. Setup early; beat involvement (two uses); closure-adjacent (final stance). Cost: enduring uncertainty and reliving pain. One friction: the phrase is told twice rather than fully embodied in contradictory on-page action, so it trends toward label. Lyric reprise with cost pushes it into low-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unfastening operates three times: untying the ribbon-tether to reach the glade, the metaphor of "begging...bargaining" (throwing time away as unfastening from presence), and the closure image "when you stop unfastening yourself from it." The action enables the journey (literal tether) and charges the thematic turn (ceasing to discard time). Setup early-middle; beat involvement (three uses: physical, recalled, metaphoric); closure causal link (the final line directly inverts the action). Specificity high (ribbon detail, tether function). Slight swappability (any binding/releasing verb might work), but the ribbon-tether concreteness and closure reprise keep it in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hand-tracing custom frames the story: opening paragraph introduces it, paragraph 4 shows the birth-day trace with the blank space discovered, final paragraph closes with "tracing our hands again on the birthday cloth with steady ink" and the filled space with overlapping palms. It supplies the mystery (blank white space) and the proof of closure (space now filled, scar visible). Setup immediate; beat involvement (three: introduction, discovery, resolution); closure participation direct. The custom constrains the protagonist's knowledge (she can see time missing) and validates recovery. Swappability low (the specificity of palm-lines and the scar image depend on this exact custom). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade supplies the vapor tree, the pouches of lost time, and the physical constraint ("the tree answered by tightening the air around me until I could barely breathe"). It enables the protagonist's encounter with her pouch and the choice to relive vs. snatch. Setup mid-story (~50%); single extended beat; closure mentions the descent but the glade itself is not in the final image. The setting pressures choice (air constraint, tree's answer) and supplies the mechanism (pouches). Late signal and single-beat use limit the score despite strong causal role. No closure-scene presence (the kitchen table is the final setting).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the birth" anchors the timeframe in the opening and the postpartum state (missing minutes, sleep deprivation, blood, fever) drives the emotional urgency throughout. "Three days later" marks the blank-space discovery. The timeframe shapes motive (exhaustion, bargaining) but does not tighten decisions in real-time; the glade journey and tree encounter are not clock-pressured. Setup immediate; thematic presence throughout; no live countdown. The time-loss stakes depend on this window, but the mechanics are more atmospheric than tactical. Scores mid-band for shaping context without on-page countdown urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to find where lost time accumulates is explicit in paragraph 4 ("when I looked again three days later a blank white space yawned between the outlines, time unaccounted for") and drives the saucer clue-reading and glade ascent. Friction emerges when the protagonist finds her own pouch and realizes the time was self-surrendered, forcing the trade-off (snatch vs. relive). Setup early; beat involvement (two: clue pursuit, tree confrontation); closure shaped by this motive (the choice to relive fulfills and transforms the original want). Cost visible (reliving pain). Swappability slight (any mystery-solve motive would work), but the specificity of "where lost time accumulates" and the pouch discovery as answer elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Choking beauty is most vivid in the glade passage ("the beauty choked me the way milk chokes a tired throat, sweet and urgent and impossible to spit out," "each blade of grass...jeweled with ice-light") and modulates with pressure: opening has "confusion were the only honest lullaby," tree scene intensifies to breathlessness, return passage softens to "ordinary moments...steady ink." Tone charges the final image (the scar as proof, beauty integrated with cost). Setup early; coherent through turns; closure modulation clear. One friction: the phrase "choking beauty" itself is never used, so the tone is enacted rather than labeled, which is strong execution but prevents full keyword integration score.</comment>
