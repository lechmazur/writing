<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal pressure, embodied in her night-and-day actions, but her transformation feels linear rather than contradictory—she moves smoothly from Council employee to resistance leader without visible cost until the very end. The foundation stone chip moment with Majo provides external motivation more than internal struggle. Administrator Vell's sudden capitulation ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum he could not run") arrives without prior cues that he valued carnival authenticity over profit, undercutting the earned-change test. Micro-choices are present but lack the self-deception or hypocrisy that would deepen her orderly-intuitive trait under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing; the graffiti-code system and overnight reorganization provide because/therefore linkage. Closure lands on-page—Vell signs the moratorium and Ira paints the stone-heart mural—but the cost is more asserted than shown: we see exhaustion and hope but not a concrete forfeiture or newly impossible path. The Vell confrontation resolves too easily; his reversal lacks prior setup, creating a minor causality gap that weakens the final turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raft city is vivid and purposeful: pontoons, barges, theater floors, swing-bridges, and tie-points all constrain Ira's tactics and enable the reorganization climax. Sensory detail is selective (lantern light flashing quartz seams, brass bands against engine teeth) and filtered through Ira's carnival-native perception. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when its quartz map reappears. Spatial choreography during the reorganization night remains legible despite the moving decks, and the perpetual-carnival atmosphere supports the hopeful-desperation tone without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving Cadenza's autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens when the security launch arrives, forcing Ira to act. One meaningful escalation occurs: her graffiti warnings graduate to real-time reorganization under engine-threat. Agency is clear in her choice to flash the stone chip and guide the raft moves, but the Vell confrontation undercuts protagonist-driven resolution; his sudden agreement feels coincidental rather than earned by Ira's prior pressure. The cost at closure is conceptual (exhaustion, the mural's cracked-heart image) but lacks a visible forfeiture—no loss of berth, paycheck, or relationship is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the raft-reorganization conceit: freedom requires fluidity, maps fail against living systems, and dual allegiance can be synthesis rather than betrayal. The foundation stone chip and final mural (stone heart cracking into boats) provide a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Ira's encoded graffiti and the contrast between her Council smiles and night warnings. The piece resists tidy resolution—the moratorium is temporary ("safety reviews"), and Ira's hope is qualified by desperation—but Vell's epiphany ("museum he could not run") edges toward thematic overstatement, narrowly avoiding a −0.5 penalty for late articulation of thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close access to Ira's orderly-intuitive perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "desperation sharpened her hope into a plan she could not delay" and "heard the new engines like teeth" show character-specific filtering. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under peak pressure. However, the opening ~180 words hover in an expository register ("That gift mattered now, because the Council had posted...") that delays immersion, and Vell's interior claim at the bridge-confrontation ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum") briefly leaks into his head without full focalization shift. Perceptual signature is strong in carnival-specific idiom (bunting, ferris wheel, mask-makers).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly purposeful ("engines like teeth," "stone heart cracking into many boats"). Information density is high in the middle third (graffiti code, quartz seams, tie-points). However, the opening suffers from scaffold: "She was orderly intuitive, able to sense where a crowd would knot" is tell-heavy exposition, and "Dual allegiance kept her walking a tightrope above the music" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "hope rise and panic chase it" uses a template-adjacent construction. Paraphrase loop: "orderly intuitive" is restated as "the only language both sides ignored" without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for pervasive minor artifacts (scaffold stems, stock images) that dull momentum in the first third but do not touch the closure mural image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The raft-city premise and reorganization-via-graffiti are fresh, specific syntheses that avoid cliché gentrification narratives. The orderly-intuitive culture-shock-absorber role is memorable and grounds Ira's tactical choices in concrete skill. The quartz-seam map and foundation-stone chip avoid quirky ornament by functioning causally. Risk-taking is evident in the mosaic opening and the encoded-graffiti mechanic. However, the Vell-conversion beat ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum") relies on a familiar trope (administrator has last-minute conscience) without transforming it through prior character work, preventing full originality credit at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ira as culture-shock-absorber is signaled early, drives her graffiti-encoding tactic (only she wanders every alley), enables the reorganization night (her mobility and crowd-reading), and appears in the Vell confrontation and final mural beat. Her role constrains her dual-allegiance choices with visible cost (paycheck vs. neighbors). The trait shapes at least three beats and the ending, meeting high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip is introduced early (Majo's gift), reappears at the climax when Ira flashes it at lantern height to read the quartz seams, and charges the final mural (stone heart cracking). It drives the reorganization mechanics causally. However, its middle development is thin—Majo explains its function in one beat, then it vanishes until the climax—so it lacks the spaced, evolving handling that would push it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is the story's engine: it fractures Ira's tactics (Council paycheck vs. neighbor warnings), shapes every middle beat (smiling at investors by day, passing warnings by night), and crystallizes in the Vell confrontation ("admitted her dual allegiance and offered him a choice"). The concept narrows options with visible cost (she risks both berth and community trust) and charges the final mural (synthesis rather than betrayal). Setup, development, payoff, and causal pressure are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is named early and demonstrated in Ira's crowd-sensing and graffiti-code design ("orderly, intuitive in its logic of currents and foot traffic"). It enables the reorganization night and the encoded-message tactic. However, the trait is more often told than tested under pressure—there is no moment where her intuition fails or her orderliness constrains a choice with visible cost. It shapes one major beat (graffiti system) and primes the ending but lacks a second distinct causal involvement or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is seeded in Majo's explanation ("neighborhoods reorganize themselves overnight"), drives the climactic beat when Ira walks the decks leaving graffiti arrows that send blocks drifting, and makes Vell's moratorium necessary ("addresses change beneath him"). The action is irreplaceable—no near-synonym could substitute—and it redefined Cadenza's legal status with conceptual cost (fluidity over fixed grid). Setup, development, payoff, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all exemplary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Graffiti encoding is introduced in the first third ("messages encoded in graffiti art, sprayed under bunting"), demonstrated in the middle (blue spiral, red swallow, white square), and executed in the climax (fresh graffiti arrows guide the raft moves). The method constrains Ira's tactics (symbols must be carnival-legible to strangers, intuitive to her people) and shapes the reorganization. The final mural is graffiti but thematic rather than tactical, so closure participation is oblique. Strong across setup, development, and mid-escalation; ending linkage is partial.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival raft city is anchored early, supplies resources (bunting, ticket booths, swing-bridge, tie-points) that enable Ira's graffiti and the reorganization, and makes the privatization threat concrete (investors measuring decks, muttering about railings). The setting constrains choices (Ira's mobility, the raft seams' mappability) and charges the final image (moving lights, dancers hauling ropes, barge-homes like swans). Environment shapes tactics, escalation, and closure with specificity and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Before privatization" frames the story and the ticking-clock arrives when the first private security launch appears, sharpening Ira's decision to act ("could not delay"). However, the timeframe is more situational backdrop than live constraint—no deadlines narrow her window, and the moratorium ending is open-ended ("safety reviews"). Setup and escalation are present; closure participation is thematic but not tactical. Functional across two beats; upper bands require a tighter on-page clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is dramatized in Ira's split tactics (Council paycheck vs. neighbor warnings), tested under pressure (the security launch forces her hand), and resolved with visible cost (exhaustion, the fragile moratorium). The motivation shapes her graffiti system, the Vell confrontation choice, and the final mural's hopeful-desperation charge. Friction between wants (preserve community) and costs (livelihood, berth) is legible on the page. Setup, development, payoff, and causal pressure all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is coherent throughout: Ira's dual allegiance, the carnival's perpetual motion vs. encroaching investors, and the final mural ("hopeful and desperate that Cadenza might stay free by staying fluid") all carry the paradox. Tone modulates under pressure—hope rises when Majo offers the chip, desperation sharpens when engines arrive—and charges the ending image. The tone is not static, and it reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Strong tonal control across beats and closure.</comment>
