<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and evolves under pressure: instinct screams to flee, but she overrides it twice with visible micro-choices that foreclose escape. Her embodied stress ("air hissed thin," "panic rose again") is specific, and the final choice to share memory via the mirror feels earned by her mother's teaching about ephemeral art. Internal contradiction operates in scene—fear vs. curiosity, survival vs. salvage—and the renunciation of easy escape carries palpable cost. Minor: the wire-knot moment could show more tactical fumbling to deepen struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a layered pattern early (lonesome splendor, hush, ephemeral treasure) and pays it off at closure when the mirror sends the distress call as "shared recollection," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the temple's silence thins, her memories pour out). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, temple, failing rebreather, distress signal). One meaningful deepening occurs when the relief's mouth opens and stored stillness spills out, narrowing her options and forcing the perfume-drop gambit. Closure lands on the page: the message leaps outward, the hush thins, and she will not surface alone—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (gauge at last bars, memories shared). The cost is legible in "letting it map her memories onto the temple's" and "poured in the scent of home, the ache of her crew." No causality breaks. Gate met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered (coral-furred pillars, lapis mosaics, bronze mirror, spiral of shells) and constrains choice: the wire knot traps her beacon, the relief's mouth is a lock she must engage, the mirror is the final tool. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency (silver beads, gathered hush, "shaky reports"). The crystal vial and bronze mirror function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor: the Lark above remains abstract; one concrete anchor (deck detail, crew name) would deepen the pull.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: send the distress signal before air runs out. The wire-knot discovery tightens pressure (beacon sealed in silence), and the relief's mouth opening narrows options to a gambit with the perfume vial. Two override-instinct moments escalate agency with visible cost (time bleeding away, memories exposed). The mirror-touch resolution is earned by her prior choice to share rather than steal, and the cost is felt: gauge at last bars, personal memories poured out, and the hush—her potential treasure—now ordinary water. The phrase "sensed answering thoughts like distant bells" delivers closure participation with undeniable pressure. One reversal (lock tightens when pulled) and one deepening (perfume drop transforms darkness) are sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality vs. preservation emerges organically from the mother's teaching, the temple's "gathered hush," and the final act of sharing memory to unlock the signal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the ephemeral (scent, memory, silence) becomes the medium of connection, not commodity. Mara's arc is inseparable from the thematic question—she learns the hush is "not a curse but a reservoir" and trades personal treasure for shared survival. The final image ("guarding its ephemeral treasure and hers") reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing vial to relief, breathing in the hush) and implication. No label-only theme statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, distance stable. Perceptual signature is selective and apt: Mara notices the vial's warmth, the hush as "stored stillness," and mosaic flashes as memories. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("lonesome splendor," "unanswered prayers," "gathered hush"). No dialogue; all pressure is interior and sensory. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress ("panic rose again, but she overrode instinct"). Minor slips: "the gathered hush deepened, sealing her beacon" uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy, and the phrase "ancient technology for storing the fleeting things humans squander" edges toward essayistic register for a beat. Overall, voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. "Each exhale made silver beads that wandered up into the vaulted dark like unanswered prayers" is vivid and propulsive. Minor loop: "gathered hush" recurs five times, three in adjacent beats without fresh charge until the mirror scene. Template cadence: "she overrode instinct" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphor: "like distant bells" is serviceable but not fresh. Figurative density is controlled; no muddle. Proofreading clean. −0.7 cumulative for loop and template stem, but closure beats remain clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater salvage, perfumery as memory-tech, and ancient silence-storage is specific and non-obvious. The wire-knot-as-lock twist and the perfume-drop gambit arise from established particulars (mother's teaching, Mara's theft, temple's purpose). The ending image—distress call as shared recollection riding "the sea's living network"—is fresh and earned in hindsight. Transformation test: the plot would collapse with generic substitutes (e.g., radio, treasure chest). Premise avoids template fantasy-quest beats by grounding stakes in breath count and sensory memory. Risk: lyric compression and invented tech (silence reservoir, scent-memory map) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. +0.3 for bold, coherent conceptual risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (distress signal sender) drives both major turns: unsnarling the kelp and engaging the mirror. Present by paragraph one, active in the wire-knot beat and the mirror beat, and shapes the closure (message leaps outward). Her choices alter tactics twice (override instinct, pour memory in). Causal pressure high; closure linkage direct; visible cost (air, memories). All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crystal perfume vial appears in paragraph four (setup), is used in the relief beat (drop floats, transforms darkness), and again at the mirror (pours scent in). Two distinct functional beats; causal pressure (enables the hush-unlocking); closure linkage (mirror message uses the scent-memory map). Irreplaceable: its properties (memory-touching, ephemeral art) are unique. All three gates; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is introduced in paragraph three, named and defined in the relief beat ("stored stillness"), explained as "not a curse but a reservoir," and reweighted at closure ("thinned into ordinary water" vs. "guarding its ephemeral treasure"). It constrains tactics (seals beacon, tightens wire) and charges the ending image (traded for the signal). Present in five beats; causal and closure pressure undeniable; indispensable to story logic. All gates; closure would fail without this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is signaled in paragraph four ("warmed, as though it touched memories"), enacted when the perfume drop "each molecule carrying a memory it had touched," and used at closure ("breathing the perfumed hush in, letting it map her memories onto the temple's"). Two beats; causal role (unlocks path); closure linkage (enables mirror message). Cost: personal memories exposed. Specificity high; swappability low. All three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" drives the first major turn: loosening the kelp opens the relief's mouth and releases the stored stillness. Present by paragraph seven; causal (without it, no hush release); middle development (changes her options from flee to engage). Ending consequences trace to this act. Two gates (middle, payoff via consequence); if the setup is the wire-knot discovery, all three. Strong causal role; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled in paragraph eight ("overrode instinct, forcing slow hands"), repeated in paragraph thirteen ("overrode instinct once more"), and shapes two key choices (unsnarl vs. flee; breathe hush vs. panic). Mechanics matter: deliberate slowness and breath control enable the unlocking. Present across three beats; causal pressure high; closure participation (final override leads to mirror). All three gates; indispensable method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater temple is named in the opening line, pressures every choice (current muffles signal, kelp traps wire, relief locks path, mirror sends message), and charges the closure image ("settled back into lonesome splendor"). Environment supplies resources (relief, mirror) and constraints (hush, depth). Present in six beats; causal and closure pressure strong; irreplaceable. All three gates; removal would collapse the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is tracked explicitly (gauge countdown, "time ran short," "air hissed thin," "last trembling bars") and tightens every choice: flee vs. unsnarl, use perfume vs. hoard, engage mirror vs. conserve breath. Clock is live and visible; alters tactics in real time. Present in four beats; causal pressure (forces override choices); closure linkage (gauge at last bars when message leaps). All three gates; indispensable timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated in paragraph five, tested in the perfume-drop beat (does she commodify or share?), and resolved at closure (she trades treasure for connection). Desire is dramatized through the theft of the vial and the choice to pour memories in rather than extract. Friction: want to harness vs. cost of sharing. Two beats; middle and payoff gates met. Setup is late (second third). Causal role clear; closure linkage strong. Cap at 7.3 for late setup; round to 7.1 after small late-intro penalty.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears in the opening line, recurs in the lapis-flash beat ("all of it braided into the hush"), and returns in the final phrase ("settled back into lonesome splendor"). Tone is coherent through pressure (melancholy beauty held against crisis) and charges the final image (the temple resumes its solitude, now shared with Mara's memories). Modulates with tension (splendor vs. panic, beauty vs. cost). Three beats; closure linkage direct; lyric reprise reweights the opening. All three gates; strong tonal control.</comment>
