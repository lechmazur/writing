<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice remains specific and embodied throughout—"my anger and gratitude mixed into something furiously tranquil" anchors contradiction in image rather than therapy-speak. The backstory revelation (father's confession) shifts the narrator's stance with visible cost, allowing rage and understanding to coexist without resolution. Micro-choices (loading plates, stopping the timer at breath stutters) reflect a hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor weakness: Lysa's motives remain functional but underdeveloped; she facilitates rather than applies independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator descends with "plates like fragile oaths," carrying a new mode of resistance—measured light instead of louder speech—and the cost (accepting father's betrayal, relinquishing direct confrontation with censors) is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes density through layered images (darkroom timer, star map, bus timetable) and cadence shifts (storm easing at dawn, masks coming off) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words (stormlit observatory, annual Skywatch, censored poet). One meaningful deepening: the father's confession reframes the narrator's understanding of scars from personal wounds to shared coordinates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory's sensory particulars—wet black domes, thunder rolling under the mountain, roof slit aimed at a crossed-out star—are filtered through the narrator's professional and emotional lens. The darkroom functions as micro-setting: its red safelight, glass plates, and timer constrain choices (snapping the dial at three minutes, stopping exposures mid-bloom). The storm's rarefaction guides the vigil's timing, and the final image (dawn streets, damp masks) charges the closure by contrasting raw sky with the city's return to routine. Setting details remain selective and purposeful, integrated into action rather than catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: understanding "the cartography of scars" through timed exposures rather than censored verse. One meaningful tightening: the father's confession narrows options—the narrator must integrate betrayal with love, abandoning simple anger. Agency is decision and endurance: choosing to measure hurt with light instead of fighting censors with speech. The climax (reading the note, loading plates all night) is driven by protagonist choice under accumulated pressure. Cost is legible: accepting the father's complicity forecloses the path of pure righteous fury, and the new atlas carries both hurt and latitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: scars as durations rather than lines, pauses that refuse to be blacked out, the paradox of betrayal as protection. The darkroom timer and star map accrue meaning without overt statement, and the final image—plates as fragile oaths, measured light vs. louder speech—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The father's bus timetable returns reweighted (route map → confession → coordinates of shame), and "furiously tranquil" models the story's tonal integration of rage and stillness. No diagnostic moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person; distance modulates purposefully (close during the father's revelation, wider when describing the vigil's mechanics). Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices in metaphor (domes "wet as black pearls," second hand "like an insect"), filters setting through poetic and political awareness ("censored tongue," "bars of ink"). Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—elevated but not academic, charged but legible. Minor slip: "furiously tranquil" as a phrase recurs (Lysa's face, the narrator's mixed emotion) without enough variation, risking template cadence. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I realized," "I saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; high-density lines often do multiple jobs ("She led me past the telescope to the darkroom where plates were developed, and set the timer on the counter like a small altar"). Figurative language is coherent and voice-driven (storm as weather the mountain floats above, star as "wound that refused to close"). Minor overwriting in mid-section: "rarefying the hours into clean slices" and "scrubbed raw" sky cluster metaphors without fresh pressure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but one template-cadence risk in parallel explanatory clauses. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final image ("carried the plates like fragile oaths") recharges prior material without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—censored poet, darkroom timer as resistance tool, father's timetable-as-confession—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise (measuring scars by duration rather than image) transforms familiar tropes (artist vs. censor, father-betrayer) through grounded ritual and the observatory's literal/figurative apparatus. Risk-taking (sustained metaphor linking photography, poetry, and scars; quiet ending that refuses direct confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional calculus (anger and gratitude coexisting) avoids safety-hedging. One friction: the annual Skywatch mask festival frame is functional but slightly generic; the story's freshness lives in the darkroom vigil itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The censored poet shapes the story's central choice: accepting the father's betrayal and forging a new mode of resistance (measured light vs. louder speech). Introduced in the opening sentence and present across all key beats (reading the confession, loading plates, descending with oaths). The poet's constraint (censored verses) drives the tactic (timed exposures as atlas) and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears early (ticking in pocket, set on counter "like a small altar"), structures the ritual (started and snapped to zero at three minutes), and becomes the method for measuring scars as durations. Used in ≥3 beats: intro, first exposure, repeated all-night ritual. Its mechanics (dial stopping process mid-bloom) enable the protagonist's new cartography and charge the ending ("observatory would remember our pause each time a shutter clicked").</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" frames the entire action: the Skywatch as suspended festival, the darkroom ritual as arrested exposure, the narrator's choice to hold rather than fight. Lysa announces it explicitly ("vigil in pause began"), and the concept structures tactics (stopping the timer at breath stutters, ending exposures without finishing). The closure hinges on it: measured pauses become the atlas, and the new resistance is defined by deliberate incompletion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears twice with visible cost: Lysa's face embodies the paradox at the threshold, and the narrator's mixed anger/gratitude models it at the confession beat. The attribute constrains behavior (no pure rage, no easy forgiveness) and enables the final synthesis (storm-kissed wonder that refuses loud speech). Label-mention deducts slightly, but the trait does alter on-page choices and charges the tonal resolution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears in two forms: Lysa instructs the narrator to listen for "the moment the storm rarefies" (air thins, fear becomes measurable), and later "rarefying the hours into clean slices." The action shapes the vigil's method (waiting for thinned air to measure scars) and recurs in the all-night ritual. Moderately essential but could be substituted with similar precision language; the timer and exposure mechanics do more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable is signaled early (Lysa hands it over, page seven) and its mechanics matter: the timetable pocket hid the narrator's first banned sonnet, now returns as the father's route map and confession. The method drives the revelation beat (reading the note, learning the father reported the verses) and ties directly to the closure theme (coordinates of shame, atlas of absence). Strong setup and payoff; middle development is implicit rather than on-page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory structures all action: metal stairs, wet domes, telescope, darkroom with roof slit. Setting pressures choices (extinguishing safelight to listen, opening roof slit to aim at the star) and supplies resources (glass plates, timer, the storm's rarefaction as cue). The observatory's suspension "above its own weather" mirrors the vigil's conceptual stance, and the closure promise ("this observatory would remember our pause") charges the final image. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"When masks slip" frames the Skywatch festival (annual, masks damp at dawn) and governs the confession's legibility: "when masks slip in lightning, you can read the seams." The timeframe enables the ritual (all night until dawn, storm easing) and the ending (revelers removing masks as the narrator descends). Tracked consistently; tightens decisions by linking storm duration to exposure work. Strong presence but not as mechanically essential as timer or observatory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated in Lysa's note and drives every subsequent choice: loading plates, stopping the timer at breath stutters, forming a new atlas where "every absence had a place and every hurt a latitude." The motivation is dramatized through friction (anger vs. gratitude, censored speech vs. measured light) and costs are visible (accepting father's betrayal, relinquishing direct confrontation). The desire shapes tactics across all beats and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" modulates coherently: opens with stormlit menace, tightens during the vigil's rarefied listening, softens at dawn ("sky scrubbed raw"), and resolves in the final image (wonder "that could not be neatly blacked out"). Tone charges the ending by refusing both rage and despair, holding contradiction. Consistent through turns; a single late mention as summary phrase slightly weakens, but the tone is enacted throughout rather than declared.</comment>
