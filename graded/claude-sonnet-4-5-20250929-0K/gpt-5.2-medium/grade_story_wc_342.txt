<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's face-blindness anchors her perceptual world; she reads posture, voice, and gesture, and the limit drives her reliance on pattern over portrait. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "the familiar limit of her mind, the blankness where a face should have anchored a memory," then discovers the book offers "another method, one that trusted patterns over portraits." The final choice to seal the book and leave the sky is earned by her acceptance of temporal and cognitive limits. Minor slip: the emotional payoff—"less alone in her defect"—edges toward tidy articulation rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend): Liora accepts both temporal and cognitive limits, sealing the book and stepping out under her painted sky with visible cost (the demolition begins; she leaves the knowledge hidden). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (name, setting, commission). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coin unlocks the book and she translates indentations into her fractal star code, narrowing her options from simple task to symbolic acceptance. The foreman's pause and the final hammer strike charge the ending image with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt: she leaves behind both the book and the illusion of unlimited preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hollowed oak library with spiral shelves "like ribs" and the heartwood panel smooth "as a closed eyelid" constrain Liora's movements and encode the secret. The coin's faint indentations require light, touch, and fractal translation—specific micro-setting that enables her central action. The demolition crew's distant engines and the foreman's boots anchor the temporal pressure. The final painted ceiling becomes a charged object that reweights the commission: not a copy of the outside sky but a recursive map that fits inside walls. Spatial choreography is clean; the ladder, desk, and panel track coherently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the ceiling map before demolition while preserving the hidden book. The coin puzzle tightens pressure by requiring fractal translation under time constraint. One meaningful deepening: discovering the book reweights her task from commission to philosophical acceptance—she must honor both the guild's secrecy and her own limits. Agency is clear: she translates the code, paints the sky, negotiates five more minutes, and seals the safe. The foreman's pause and the first hammer strike land as visible cost. No reversals required under the Accumulative lens; the single tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—discovering limits, both structural (how far a wall can hold a sky) and personal (how far a mind can hold a person)—emerges from the coin's recursive code, the tree's containment, and Liora's face-blindness without overt statement. The book's constellation sketches "bent and repeated, as if the heavens were testing their own boundaries" operate as image-driven thematic anchor. The final act of sealing the book and leaving the painted sky offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she accepts the limit of time while leaving the sky inside the tree, trusting pattern over permanence. The closure reweights "the familiar limit of her mind" into a shared method rather than solitary defect. No moralizing; the ending image does the thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens at key beats ("she felt the familiar limit," "realized the safe was not only to hide knowledge"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Liora notices posture, voice, hand habits, the foreman's boot rhythm, and translates visual indentations into fractal star patterns. Diction—"like tiny valleys and branching rivers," "the heightened stillness of a chapel that had forgotten its prayers"—is consistent and purposeful. Single line of dialogue is goal-driven and advances the scene. Minor pattern: several sentences open with prepositional phrases or conjunctions ("At the central desk," "In the book," "When footsteps"), but rhythm varies enough to avoid true template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Figurative language—"shelves spiraled upward like ribs," "smooth as a closed eyelid," "night vault, dot by dot"—is vivid and purpose-driven. Sentence rhythm modulates with urgency. Minor artifacts: "the familiar limit of her mind, the blankness where a face should have anchored a memory" edges into paraphrase redundancy, and "She carried the book to her ladder, opened her tin of pigments, and began to craft the ceiling" lists actions rather than integrating them through embodied perception. The phrase "felt less alone in her defect" risks soft therapeutic phrasing. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of face-blindness, fractal star-mapping, and a tree-trunk library with a coin-locked safe is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the familiar trope of "artist racing demolition" by rooting urgency in cognitive and philosophical limits rather than simple preservation. The coin's indentations as recursive code that Liora reads through her own pattern-language is a fresh inflection. Risk: the story commits fully to its premise and follows the implications without retreat—Liora does not overcome her face-blindness; she accepts it and finds solidarity in the book's recursive method. The final image of sealing the book and leaving the sky inside the tree feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's face-blindness is signaled in paragraph one and constrains her memory ("she could not rely on faces to recall Senn's instructions"). It drives her reliance on posture, voice, and pattern, enabling her to translate the coin's indentations into fractal code. The trait shapes at least two beats (recalling instructions, recognizing the foreman by boot rhythm) and contributes to the ending when she "spoke calmly" without needing his face. The final acceptance of limits traces directly to her lived experience of cognitive constraint. Causal pressure is visible; the trait is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The secret book safe is set up early ("the tree kept one volume that must not be crushed") and unlocked at midpoint via the coin. The book's constellation sketches reweight Liora's task from technical commission to philosophical acceptance. She carries it to her ladder, consults it while painting, then seals it back into the heartwood at the end with visible cost (knowledge hidden, demolition imminent). The safe appears in three distinct beats and charges the closure by requiring her final act of sealing and leaving. Strong causal role and closure linkage; irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is the conceptual spine: Senn's warning about the hidden book, Liora's face-blindness ("the familiar limit of her mind"), the coin's recursive code that "always narrowed toward a point," and the realization that "the safe was not only to hide knowledge but to teach discovering limits." The concept shapes stakes (preserve knowledge while accepting temporal and cognitive bounds) and alters tactics (she paints not a copy but a recursive map "of what could fit"). The final line—"accepting the limit of time while leaving the sky inside the tree"—lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. The concept is indispensable; remove it and the story collapses into simple preservation plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is signaled early ("the fractally precise ceiling map she had designed from night walks") and operationalized when Liora translates the coin's indentations "into the fractal pattern she used for stars, a rule of recursion that always narrowed toward a point." The trait enables the unlock and constrains her painting method: "smaller spirals within larger spirals, galaxies implied in flecks of ash." It appears in two distinct beats and charges the thematic closure (limits as recursive, not linear). The specificity is irreplaceable—remove "fractal" and the coin-translation logic weakens.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Craft" anchors the commission, the coin translation ("Counting the marks by touch, she translated them"), and the climactic painting sequence ("began to craft the ceiling into a night vault, dot by dot, curve by curve"). The action shapes the foreman's pause ("caught by the stillness and the strange sky blooming above shelves") and the final image of stepping out "under her painted constellations." It drives at least three beats and contributes decisively to closure (the sky remains inside the tree). Strong causal role; the act is irreplaceable and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coin is introduced early ("centuries old coin") and its mechanics—faint indentations read by light and touch—are demonstrated on the page ("held the coin to the window slit and turned it until the morning light grazed the metal, making the indentations appear like tiny valleys"). The method constrains her attempt (she must translate marks into fractal code) and enables the unlock. It appears in two beats (receiving it, using it) and returns at closure when she seals the safe "with the coin." The specificity is purposeful; a generic key would not tie to her fractal star-mapping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is anchored in paragraph one and pressures every choice: the hollow interior with spiral shelves provides verticality and ribs-like constraint, the heartwood panel hides the safe, the window slit supplies light for the coin, and the "heightened stillness of a chapel" charges tone. The setting enables the commission, the coin puzzle, and the foreman's pause. The final painted ceiling transforms the setting into a charged object. The library appears in setup, middle unlock, painting sequence, and closure; it is indispensable to the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The demolition deadline is signaled in the opening line ("hush before the condemned annex...was to be demolished") and tracked throughout: "the distant cough of the demolition crew warming their engines," Liora's request for "five more minutes," and "the first hammer struck outside" as she steps out. The timeframe tightens tactics (she must translate the coin, paint, and seal under pressure) and charges the final image with undeniable cost. The clock is live, legible, and alters moves; it is essential to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The commission "to mirror the sky inside walls before the books and the wood were reduced to rubble" is signaled early and dramatized through her painting. Friction surfaces when the book's discovery reweights her task: she paints not a mirror but "a map of what could fit," prioritizing pattern over literal copy. The motivation drives the foreman negotiation and the final sealing act. It appears in three beats (setup, reweighting, closure) and carries cost (she leaves the sky incomplete in one sense, complete in another). Strong thematic integration; the desire is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established in the opening ("stood still enough to hear dust settle") and modulates with pressure: the tree's "air held the heightened stillness of a chapel that had forgotten its prayers," the foreman "caught by the stillness," and the final step out "accepting the limit of time while leaving the sky inside the tree." Tone coheres through turns (urgency layered with calm focus) and charges the closure by making Liora's acceptance feel inevitable rather than rushed. The stillness is both aesthetic texture and thematic container; it shapes reader perception and the final image's resonance.</comment>
