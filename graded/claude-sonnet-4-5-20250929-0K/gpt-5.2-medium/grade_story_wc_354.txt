<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's exile and his refusal to teach cruelty establish clear motivation, and the worry stone provides recurring embodied action. His choices drive the plot through correlation of chess pieces to the nexus's patterns. However, interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("discover beauty in the difficult") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final choice feels more declarative than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal chain: Sable translates the nexus's silence into an alphabet of restraint, discovers the covenant's betrayal, delivers the message to Mera, and the council votes to renounce the nexus. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the choice not to use power—with visible cost (enemies may laugh, the choice is "narrow"). Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, stakes by the third paragraph). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative textures; the covenant's response to the vote provides on-page confirmation that the refusal has weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered with compasses spinning, iron dust spirals, and field murmurs that respond to chess-piece placement. The travel board functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining Sable's method of listening. The dust's crescent formation when the pawn moves forward demonstrates how environment shapes and validates his interpretation. Spatial choreography remains clear across the field, elder's approach, and council hall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and honoring the covenant before the next moon phase—is signaled early and tightens through Sable's experimental placements. The story delivers one meaningful deepening: his realization that the covenant asks for restraint, not power, which reframes the entire conflict. The council's narrow vote provides on-page cost (political risk, potential enemy mockery), and the choice forecloses the military option. Escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the pressure operates through accumulation of symbolic meaning rather than rising external threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the covenant's message: "We were not meant to bind the sun, only to honor its leaving and return." Sable's exile functions as proof that refusals endure, and the worry stone's placement where the king would sit anchors restraint as power. The final image—twilight deepening but not collapsing—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the chess-piece alphabet and the dust's geometry rather than character explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct elevated register with purposeful compression ("posture of a man still teaching invisible students"). POV remains stable in tight third; Sable's perceptual signature filters the nexus through chess and pedagogy. Mera's brief dialogue carries goal and subtext without exposition. Some diction edges toward the ornate ("hopeful melancholy as the last pages of a book you cannot bear to finish"), and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy, but voice remains consistent and the register suits the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing double work (the worry stone both embodies and symbolizes his stance). However, several passages edge into overwriting: "the posture of a man still teaching invisible students," "measuring breath in a sickroom," and the extended book-pages simile for Mera's face feel decorative rather than propulsive. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. The loops don't obscure causality but they slow momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—chess tutor using board mechanics to decode a magnetic covenant—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (exile, eclipsed promise, symbolic alphabet). The transformation of chess from war-game to listening tool inverts the trope meaningfully. However, the "weaponized eclipse" backstory and the narrow council vote follow recognizable beats from restraint-versus-power narratives. The worry stone placement on the king's square provides a specific, earned inflection that charges the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's choices create every major turn: he comes to the nexus (inciting), experiments with piece placement (discovery), decodes the covenant's message (turning point), and convinces the council (climax). His refusal to teach the siege forced-mate establishes the character logic that makes the final renunciation credible. Present across all structural beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The worry stone appears in three beats: pocket mention during setup, held during the silent translation, and placed on the board as proof for the council. The final placement reweights it from personal talisman to public argument. However, the middle use (counting stillness intervals) is more gestural than causal; the stone doesn't constrain his listening method, it accompanies it. Two-gate model (setup + payoff) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant shapes every layer: it is the reason for the silenced bells, the source of the magnetic disturbance, the object of Sable's investigation, and the entity that must be appeased before the deadline. The backstory revelation (Collegium weaponizing the eclipse) redefines the present stakes, and the covenant's response to the vote provides on-page validation. Indispensable to plot logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is demonstrated through Sable's methodical piece placement and his correlation of movements to field responses, and it explicitly contrasts with the Collegium's demand for a forced-mate shortcut. The trait enables his translation success. However, the attribute is more labeled than tested under pressure; no moment forces him to choose between precision and speed, or shows precision failing him with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Correlate" is the method Sable uses to discover the covenant's language: "he began to correlate each movement with the field's murmurs." This action drives the central discovery beat and distinguishes his approach from brute interpretation. The pawn-movement crescent formation is the on-page proof that correlation works. The action could be replaced with "interpret" or "decode" with some loss of specificity, but the scientific precision of correlation fits the chess-tutor logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is signaled early ("the only way to listen was by translating silence"), demonstrated through the intervals-as-alphabet method, and produces the covenant's message. The method is specific and unusual—measuring pauses rather than reading symbols—and it cannot be swapped without losing the story's central conceit. Present in setup, execution, and payoff with clear causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus supplies the core mechanic: compasses spin, iron dust responds to piece placement, and the field "murmurs" with tidal pressure. Without this specific setting, Sable has no medium to translate and no proof for the council. The nexus actively constrains his method (he must work through the dust's geometry) and validates the final choice (twilight stabilizes when the council renounces it). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "before the next phase" deadline is established early and repeated ("Sable had only until before the next phase"), creating urgency for the investigation. The timeframe motivates Mera's hooded approach and the council's immediate vote. However, the clock is more stated than dramatized; no on-page moment shows time running out or forces a tactical compromise. The deadline functions as stake-framing rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover beauty in the difficult" is stated outright and echoed in the final line ("quiet beauty settle over their difficult choice"). Sable's refusal to teach cruelty and his patient experimentation dramatize the desire for principled complexity. However, the motivation operates more as theme than as conflicted want; no beat shows him tempted by an easier, uglier solution. The friction is philosophical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy is embodied in Mera's face description, the "quiet beauty" of the ending, and the overall cadence of restraint rewarded. The tone modulates appropriately: somber during the exile memory, pressured during the translation, tentatively hopeful when twilight stabilizes "but did not collapse." The tone charges the final image—renunciation brings relief, not triumph—and remains coherent across structural beats.</comment>
