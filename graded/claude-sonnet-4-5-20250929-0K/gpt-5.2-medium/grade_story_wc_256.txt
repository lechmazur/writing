<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority shows through the prism-bell work and the stance on connection versus signal, but key choices feel more prompted than earned—particularly the shift to "raw archive" honesty, which arrives without prior dramatized struggle between loyalty and truth. Mara's arc from engineer-auditor to collaborator proceeds smoothly but lacks embodied contradiction; her admission of doctored reports lands as plot information rather than a moment of genuine cost. The protagonist's response ("my job was to ring truths without shattering hands") reads as aphoristic rather than wrestling with stakes. Micro-choices under pressure remain sparse; much decision-making is summarized rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the dominant stake—whether artificial pilgrimage can carry real connection—deepens through the lens experiments and culminates in the press-walk reversal where raw voices replace polished curation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the city continues walking the loop for months, learning connection requires care), and conceptual cost is legible: officials must answer aloud, the program shifts from spectacle to conversation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara proposes raw archive over polish. However, the reversal itself is told in compressed summary rather than dramatized scene pressure, and the final paragraph's "the grid kept humming, but the city walked the loop for months" relies on distant retrospective summary rather than an on-page moment with immediate felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly established with velvet baffles, copper throats, and golden shadows; the soot-blackened lens focusing sound functions as both tool and symbolic anchor. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (narrator's table, the chamber, the press walk). The lens and chamber constrain the protagonist's method—refracted sound must pass through specific apparatus—and charge the final image when visitors "reached out as if feeling fabric, because the sounds had weight and temperature." Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's acoustic priorities (overtones, textured air) without catalog excess. Minor gap: the "mapped loop of sensors and screens" for the pilgrimage remains abstract; we never see a station's physical layout or how visitors move through it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can artificial pilgrimage heal civic trust without scripting comfort) is signaled early and braided with the narrator's personal stake (discovering texture of connection). One meaningful tightening: Mara's decision to play raw archive instead of polished loop forces officials to answer on the spot. Agency is present in that choice, but the turn itself is compressed into a single paragraph of summary ("we propelled the lens toward honesty") rather than a dramatized beat with visible resistance or cost in the moment. The press walk's outcome—reporters meet their own doubts, questions leap hand to hand—is recounted at distance rather than shown with immediate pressure. Escalation reads more as conceptual deepening (the pilgrimage design shifts from spectacle to conversation) than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices under mounting opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—connection as texture requiring care, not signal strength—emerges organically from the prism-bell work, the lens experiments, and the contrast between curated stories and raw voices. The piece resists simplistic binaries; Mara's doctored reports complicate rather than flatten her arc, and the narrator's choice not to condemn her ("my job was to ring truths without shattering hands") introduces moral nuance. The final image (city walking the loop for months, learning connection requires care) offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing, though "connection has texture and requires care" hovers close to explicit summary. The lens-as-focus metaphor and the refracted chorus accumulate meaning across beats. Minor slip: "the route mattered as much as the destination, like a pilgrimage" is slightly on-the-nose thematic assertion in dialogue rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature (acoustic focus: "overtones," "textured air," "sigh that sounded like a crowd turning together"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, balancing lyric compression ("small sun in shadow") with grounded idiom ("Mara snorted"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Mara's "powerfully gentle" and the narrator's pilgrimage analogy carry subtext about values. Filter verbs ("I told," "she argued") are present but not excessive. Minor pattern: several beats open with "I [verb]" or "Mara [verb]" stems in sequence, creating mild syntactic monotony in the middle third. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The phrase "my job was to ring truths without shattering hands" reads slightly elevated for the moment but remains within the narrator's established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or theme without padding. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (prism bell breaking silence into colors, lens as small sun, sounds with weight and temperature) is vivid and coherent, though "golden shadows" recurs as a motif without always doing new work. Slight scaffold: "We began feeding the lens fragments…" and "We redesigned the loop…" compress significant design work into summary transitions rather than scene beats, but this serves momentum at this length. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The phrase "the more we questioned assumptions, the more the artificial pilgrimage shifted" uses a parallel construction that borders on template cadence but remains functional. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—sound refracted through a lens, pilgrimage as civic healing—offers a fresh synthesis of acoustic metaphor and post-crisis community repair. The lens as focus for echo and flame is a specific, verifiable detail that anchors the concept. However, the broader frame (post-blackout city, contested civic project, outsider consultant who learns a lesson) echoes familiar reconciliation templates. The piece transforms through acoustic specificity and the textured-air metaphor, but the emotional arc (skeptical engineer softens, protagonist teaches via example, officials must face honesty) follows a well-worn path. The final turn—raw archive over polish—feels earned in hindsight but arrives without the friction or resistance that would make the choice surprising. No close echoes of famous lines; world detail reads plausible. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric compression and acoustic focus elevate, but structural choices remain conventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prism-song bell ringer is present from the opening, defines the protagonist's perceptual lens (acoustic focus, texture over signal), and drives two key beats: ringing the prism bell to test the lens (middle) and ringing it in the chamber during the press walk (closure). The choice to play raw archive is tied to the narrator's role ("my job was to ring truths"), and the final image foregrounds the refracted chorus the narrator helped create. The role is irreplaceable; swapping to another sound technician would lose the thematic resonance of "bell ringer" as truth-teller.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in three distinct beats: Mara's introduction (setup), the first experiment in the chamber (development), and the press walk where it focuses raw voices (closure). Its specific property—focusing flame, now focusing sound—is causal and irreplaceable; the soot-black glass becomes "a small sun in shadow" and propels overtones. The lens enables the refracted archive and charges the final image ("we propelled the lens toward honesty"). Strong integration; removing it would break the story's mechanics and symbolic throughline.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage is the dominant stake: Mara arrives to audit analog habits and proposes the choreographed loop; the protagonist's method transforms it from spectacle to conversation. The concept shapes tactics across at least three beats (initial proposal, redesign with refracted stations and paper cards, press walk reversal). It constrains the protagonist's choices (must work within the pilgrimage frame) and is causally active at closure when the raw archive upends the officials' script. Conceptual cost is legible: the program succeeds by abandoning its original design. Irreplaceable; this exact premise drives the conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears once in dialogue when Mara names the chamber's effect. It echoes the story's tonal stance (texture over force, care over efficiency) but does not constrain an on-page action or present a visible tradeoff. The trait is more thematic label than dramatized attribute; we see gentleness in the narrator's refusal to condemn Mara, but "powerfully" is asserted rather than tested under pressure. Present and resonant, but not essential to a choice or the closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Propel" appears twice with purpose: physically ("the lens gathered the overtones and propelled them into the baffles") and metaphorically ("we propelled the lens toward honesty"). The second use is the key turn—choosing raw archive over polish—and it drives the press-walk climax. However, the action itself is summarized in one line rather than dramatized as a scene beat with visible resistance. The verb is specific to the lens metaphor and irreplaceable within the idiom, but the moment's compression limits its felt cost. Functional and memorable, but not fully realized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is named explicitly in dialogue ("I answered by questioning assumptions, because assumptions were what the blackout had fed on") and is the method by which narrator and Mara transform the pilgrimage: questioning whether comfort should be scripted, whether the route matters, whether raw voices can replace polish. It shapes two beats (the initial conversation and the press-walk decision) and is thematically central. However, the method is more asserted than shown in tactical friction; we see the results (redesigned loop, raw archive) but not the on-page back-and-forth of assumptions being tested and discarded under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Laboratory of Lost Sounds is established early with vivid, functional detail (velvet baffles, copper throats, golden shadows) and provides the physical space for both the lens experiment and the press walk. The chamber constrains the method—refracted sound requires this specific apparatus—and charges the final image when visitors reach out to feel the textured air. The lab also reflects the protagonist's motivation (saving what the grid could not carry). It shapes at least two beats and is causally active at closure. Minor gap: the lab's social or institutional context (who funds it, who else works there) remains vague, but this does not harm the dominant stake at this length.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" anchors the post-blackout era and sets up the thematic contrast (wires versus texture, signal versus connection). It appears in the opening and is referenced obliquely ("when the blackout years ended") but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The timeframe provides context but is not a source of pressure; no countdown or temporal constraint shapes tactics. Present and coherent, but functionally replaceable with any post-crisis setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is stated explicitly in the opening ("I wanted to discover the texture of connection, the way a voice feels before it becomes data") and drives the protagonist's stake throughout. It is dramatized in choices: saving sounds in jars, questioning whether the route matters, insisting that pilgrimage should not overwrite pain but let people touch it. The motivation is braided with the dominant stake (artificial pilgrimage) and is causally active in the press-walk decision to play raw archive. Friction between wants and costs is present when the narrator must risk funding by proposing honesty over polish. The motivation charges the final image (city learning connection requires care). Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening (Laboratory of Lost Sounds as "a place of golden shadows") and recurs when visitors step into the chamber ("golden shadows pooled around the soot lens"). The tone is coherent—contemplative, textured, warm—and modulates appropriately (Mara's initial skepticism, the press walk's tension). However, "golden" itself is more atmospheric than causally active; it colors the setting but does not constrain a choice or shift meaning at closure. The tone supports the premise but could be replaced with another warm, liminal quality without breaking story logic. Present across the arc and thematically resonant, but not indispensable.</comment>
