<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is highly wrought but her choices emerge from consistent observation rather than contradictory impulses. The shadow's metamorphosis is motivated by recognition rather than struggle, which flattens the protagonist's agency at closure. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (the river-stone rubbing, hand tightening) but much is conveyed through elaborate metaphor rather than bodily sensation. The final "borrowable light" turn feels declared more than earned through visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery and petal-screen investigation until the shadow metamorphoses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow accepts weight and becomes "careful, borrowable light"), and cost is present—Mara gives her river stone and withheld name—though the transformation reads smooth rather than fraught. Orientation anchors promptly (Blooming Library, dusk hour, Mara's role). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the shadow is consequence, not invader, which reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Blooming Library above clouds is vividly rendered with blossoms as screens, vines, and petals dropping perfume. The river stone constrains choice: Mara presses it to the screen and finally offers it to the shadow, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the stone, the desk, the petal screens) shapes tactics across beats. Some geography remains abstract—how patrons "arrive," where the main conservatory sits relative to the terrace—but the core visual anchors hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve damaged dreams / the shape of hope) is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara refuses the purge, then escalates through her investigation and the shadow's recognition. The final metamorphosis is enabled by Mara's choices (comparison footage, offering her unshared dusk, stone and name), so agency is present. The cost—giving the river stone and true name—is visible, though the shadow's cooperation reduces friction. One meaningful deepening: realizing the shadow is shed disappointment, not invader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core question—how to preserve hope when its weight is lost—emerges through particulars: the abandoned anchoring rite, the shadow born from unmoored longings, Mara's gift of stone and name. The final image (shadow "turning losses into careful, borrowable light") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Theme resists tidy binaries; the shadow is neither villain nor victim but consequence. The "luminous regret" motif bookends without becoming hammer. One slip: "the shape of hope" is invoked often enough to verge on label-speak, though it drives action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is distinct ("sharp eyed dusk noticer," "a candle for the last room"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the Blooming Library's fantastical register, but under peak pressure (the shadow's metamorphosis) the syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices edges, thresholds, absences. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. The patron-teaching beat shifts briefly to instruction-mode voice but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across the piece ("garden turned inside out," "sunlight thinned to amber," "hope torn into ribbons") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Some phrases loop conceptually: "softly deliberate" appears twice in identical construction (lines 3 and 12), and "the shadow unbound" recurs as a label without evolving. Sentence openings vary and syntax is controlled, but information density suffers when metaphor stacks (e.g., "luminous regret for what the light could not keep" conveys mood more than plot). No grammar errors; momentum is steady but not propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination—shareable dreams, floating library, shadow as shed disappointment—synthesizes familiar SFF elements into a specific premise. The anchoring-rite twist (old footage reveals lost practice) and the shadow's metamorphosis through recognition offer non-obvious angles. Emotional specificity lifts the material: Mara's valley nostalgia, the "name saved from the networks," the patrons outrunning grief. Risk is moderate; the lyric register and accretive structure are handled competently but not daringly. No close echoes of famous work detected. The premise transforms its tropes enough to avoid derivative cap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's noticing gift is signaled early (first sentence: "sharp eyed dusk noticer") and enables the investigation beat (spotting the shape in damaged dreams, comparing footage). Her choices—refusing the purge, inviting the shadow, offering stone and name—drive the ending. Present in setup, middle, and payoff. However, "sharp eyed" reads more as occupational flavor than a trait that constrains later action with visible cost; the noticing enables but does not limit. Specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three distinct beats: on Mara's desk (setup), tightened in her hand during the footage comparison (middle pressure), and pressed to the screen then given to the shadow (closure). Each use is dramatized, not summarized. The stone's weight contrasts the unmoored dreams and directly enables the shadow's transformation. Removing it would collapse the anchoring-rite logic and the final gift. Irreplaceability is high; cost (Mara loses her last valley anchor) is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is named early, drives the investigation (Mara refuses to purge it, traces its origin), and the metamorphosis at closure hinges on it accepting weight. The concept shapes stakes (preserve vs. erase) and tactics (comparison of footage, offering anchoring). Present in setup, complicates middle beats, and is causally active in the ending. Specificity: the shadow is consequence, not invader; it speaks in gesture and shadow script; it accepts the stone "like a heart accepting a pulse." High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice: Mara rubs the stone "softly deliberate" (setup) and breathes "softly deliberate" before pressing the stone to the screen (closure reprise). The trait colors her manner but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—any careful action could substitute. Lyric reprise is purposeful and the return reweights the stone's significance, qualifying for mid-band under the allowance. However, no on-page tradeoff (speed vs. care, risk vs. caution) hinges on this exact attribute, capping higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the climactic action: the shadow watches itself being born and "began to metamorphose, thickening into a figure that could choose." This turn redefines options (the shadow gains agency, asks for weight) and enables the resolution (accepting the stone). Present in middle recognition and central to the ending beat. Removing it would require a different transformation mechanism. Specificity is high (the shadow gains face, voice, choice). Cost is visible: Mara's gift and the shadow's new responsibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (Mara "began an investigation by comparing silent video footage from decades apart") and its mechanics matter: older footage shows stone-clasping, newer shows darkness pooling. The comparison drives Mara's realization (consequence, not invader) and she replays the footage side by side at closure so the shadow can witness its birth. Present in setup, enables the key middle turn, and is causally active in the ending. Swappability is low; another method (e.g., interviewing donors) would not yield the visual birth-recognition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is vividly present from the opening line and houses all action. The setting provides resources (petal screens, conservatory stacks) that Mara uses in her investigation and the shadow's transformation. The "above clouds" isolation and the dusk-lit terrace where the shadow appears shape the mood and constrain access (patrons "arrive to trade their sleep"). Present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the Library's fantastical properties (blossoms as screens, vines on ladders) serve atmosphere more than they constrain tactics; Mara could conduct the same investigation in a grounded archive with minor edits. Specificity is high; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after dreams became shareable") is signaled in the opening line and the share-dream conduits are the story's enabling condition. The premise shapes the problem (damaged dreams, unmoored disappointments) and Mara's investigation compares "decades apart" footage to trace the change. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock or deadline pressures Mara's choices. It establishes context but does not escalate tactics. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but not active in closure beyond backstory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to preserve the shape of hope" is named early ("she promised herself to preserve the shape of hope even if it had to be traced in absence") and drives her refusal to purge the corrupted files. The motivation shapes her investigation, her invitation to the shadow, and her final teaching of the anchoring rite. Friction is present: preserving hope means risking her river stone and her withheld name, and the shadow's hunger could harm others. The motivation is dramatized across beats and converges with the ending. Cost is visible but the phrasing ("shape of hope") recurs as a label often enough to verge on told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named early (Mara "listened with luminous regret") and bookends the story ("Mara still felt luminous regret for the valley she could not return to"). The tone modulates with pressure: elegiac in the valley memory, investigative during the footage comparison, charged when the shadow metamorphoses, instructional when teaching patrons. The final image—shadow "turning losses into careful, borrowable light"—sustains and reweights the tone. Coherence is high; the tone charges the closure by making regret productive rather than paralyzing. However, "luminous regret" is invoked as a phrase rather than embodied in every beat, slightly lowering integration.</comment>
