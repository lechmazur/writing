<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ivar's interiority is concrete and character-particular—his belief that clocks measure "pressure, wear, hunger, and the small human fear between ticks" drives his deliberate mis-winding and his final explanatory choice with the inspector. Embodied emotion appears in "squinted until his eyes watered" and the countdown calming ritual. The ending choice (leaving the mantle clock wrong as "a reminder that meaning is chosen") feels earned by his prior obsession with clock disagreement, though the inspector's anger-to-quiet conversion happens quickly with minimal interior contradiction shown on his side.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: ice narrows the flow → hydraulic clock lags → Ivar melts the channel → clock recovers but the sighting is late → inspector arrives angry → Ivar explains the razor-edge margins → they reset together and leave the mantle clock wrong. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the deliberate wrongness becomes a chosen meaning-marker, and the inspector's softening plus joint action forecloses correction with conceptual cost (abandoning precision as the only virtue). One minor slip: the inspector's conversion is compressed, but the closure image—"left the mantle clock deliberately wrong, a reminder that meaning is chosen, not merely ticked"—lands with clear cost and reconfigures the station's ethos.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fjord, the regulator house, the brass telescope, and the intake pipe with ice constrain Ivar's choices materially: he must use a warmed probe to avoid cracking the pipe, and the fog blurs the horizon sighting. The mantle clock on the mantel and the key in his pocket anchor micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("ice blooming along the intake pipe like white moss," "the horizon's edge met not as a gentle kiss but as two blades crossing"). The station's function—telegraphing the sunrise instant—pressures the plot throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: maintain accurate national measurements under physical constraint (ice, fog, missed supply boat). The ice discovery narrows options (can't chip from outside), forcing the warmed-probe tactic. The fog complicates the sighting, and the inspector's arrival escalates the test of Ivar's methods. The final joint action (rewarming, resetting, leaving the mantle clock wrong) reflects protagonist agency, though the inspector's participation dilutes solo cost slightly. One meaningful tightening—ice to probe to late sighting to inspector confrontation—suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: clocks as instruments of pressure and chosen meaning rather than neutral time. The razor-edge metaphor ("accuracy lived on razor edges too, on margins where a hair of frost could change a whole calendar") integrates with Ivar's horizon belief and the ice-slit crisis. The ending's "meaning is chosen, not merely ticked" arises organically from the mis-winding habit and the inspector dialogue, avoiding direct thesis. The fjord-quiet recurrence and the countdown method fold into the theme without heavy-handed echo. No late motifs; the mantle clock and key seed early and reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Ivar's perceptual signature ("he spoke to pipes like sheep," "a clock…did not measure time but pressure, wear, hunger"). Diction remains character-consistent: technical ("escapement clicked unevenly"), pastoral ("like sheep"), and philosophical ("meaning is chosen"). The inspector's speech is brief and functional, carrying goal and status shift without full voice distinction, but no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance tightens during the probe insertion and sighting beats. Minor filter-verb presence ("he felt the click") fits voice and does not dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; information density is high (most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). One minor paraphrase: "the click of a moment being severed" and "marked the time" cover similar conceptual ground in adjacent beats, but the phrasing differs enough to avoid true loop. Template cadence appears briefly in the first paragraph with multiple "he" + verb stems, though the variety of verbs and clause types keeps it from flattening momentum. No stock metaphors or therapy-speak; figurative language ("ice blooming…like white moss," "two blades crossing") is fresh and coherent. The final sentence runs long but remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The hydraulic-clock shepherd at a horizon-measurement station is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The ice-in-the-pipe crisis transforms the "precision vs. meaning" theme from abstraction into tactile constraint. The countdown-to-calm method and the deliberate mis-winding (keeping disagreement as a clue) are fresh character choices. The ending—leaving error as chosen meaning—inverts the expected "restore accuracy" resolution with earned logic. Risk: the philosophical interiority could tip into essay, but concrete action (probe, squint, wind key) anchors it. No close echoes of famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivar makes key on-page choices: uses the warmed probe (constrained by instructor's method), deliberately winds the mantle clock further off, explains razor-edge margins to the inspector, and jointly resets the hydraulic while leaving the mantle clock wrong. His peculiar belief system (clocks measure pressure, horizon has razor edges) drives tactics and the final Earned Stasis. Present early, involved in the ice crisis (middle), and decisive at closure. Scores high for causal pressure, beat involvement (three distinct: probe, sighting, inspector scene), and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The key appears twice: once as talisman in pocket (early signal), once when Ivar "wound it further off…deliberately" to watch drift. This mid-story use constrains his tactic (choosing to increase disagreement rather than correct it) and primes the ending's "deliberately wrong" stance. Not present in the final image itself but the winding decision shapes the closure logic. Two-beat involvement (early mention, deliberate mis-winding) and causal link to the ending theme, but the key is not handled at closure, limiting top-band eligibility. Swappable with another small tool in principle, though the "tighten spring" mechanics fit the theme well.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Razor edges" shape stakes on the page: Ivar believes "the horizon had razor edges, thin and sharp enough to cut a day in two," and during the sighting "two blades crossing" manifests that belief. He tells the inspector "accuracy lived on razor edges too, on margins where a hair of frost could change a whole calendar," directly linking the concept to the ice-slit crisis. Present early (first paragraph), active in the sighting beat, and invoked at the climax to reframe precision as fragile choice. Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (the concept justifies Ivar's obsessive methods), and closure linkage (the razor metaphor charges the inspector's conversion). High irreplaceability: removing "razor edges" would flatten the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is assigned by the valley people (early label) and evidenced by speaking to pipes and the horizon-belief. The trait enables Ivar's obsessive methods (countdown, deliberate mis-winding) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—his peculiarity is validated rather than traded off. Present in setup, colors middle beats (the philosophical interiority), but not tested as a liability at closure. One-plus-beat involvement (label plus enacted quirks), modest causal pressure (justifies his approach), weak cost connection (no price paid for being peculiar; the inspector softens instead). Functional but not indispensable; another character trait could carry the same thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Squinting occurs twice: once through the telescope during the fog-blurred sighting ("squinted until his eyes watered, searching for the sun") and once in the opening when he "would squint through the brass telescope at the line where sea met sky." The action is Ivar's primary observational mode and directly tied to the station's purpose (measuring the sunrise instant). The foggy sighting is a key turn—he performs his duty under constraint, marking the time that will be compared to the mantle clock. Present early, drives the sighting beat (middle-to-late), and the sighting's result (forty-seven-second difference) leads to the deliberate mis-winding and inspector dialogue. Three-beat involvement, strong causal role, and irreplaceability (the squint embodies his obsessive precision). Not literally in the final image, but the sighting it produces structures the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through counting backwards" is seeded early as the instructor's delicate-fix method, used once during the ice crisis ("From sixty he counted down…At zero he slid a warmed brass probe"), and invoked again with the inspector ("through counting backwards again, he asked the inspector to listen between numbers"). Two on-page uses that enable key tactics: calming hands to use the probe without cracking the pipe, and teaching the inspector to hear what clocks measure. The method's mechanics matter (the countdown disciplines action), and the second use reweights it as a teaching tool. Present by the first third, active in two distinct beats, and thematically charged at closure (listening "between numbers" = meaning chosen, not ticked). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the method could theoretically be swapped for another ritual with edits. Two-beat involvement and thematic payoff push it into the 7-range, but the method is more enabler than indispensable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is the story's engine: it pressures Ivar with the mandate to "telegraph [the sunrise instant] inland," provides the hydraulic clock and regulator house (where the ice crisis unfolds), supplies the brass telescope and wet platform (sighting), and frames the inspector's arrival (national measurements at stake). The station's function—measuring the instant the sun nicks the horizon—is Ivar's job and his existential puzzle ("to understand what clocks really measure"). Present in the opening, active across all major beats (ice discovery, sighting, inspector scene), and the ending's joint reset occurs within the regulator house. The setting is irreplaceable: removing it would collapse plot, stakes, and theme. High causal pressure, three-plus-beat involvement, strong closure linkage, and total irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the opening moment but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The story unfolds over "that morning" and "the afternoon," tracking the ice crisis, the late sighting, and the inspector's arrival in loose sequence. No countdown or deadline pressure; time is more atmosphere ("the day after the supply boat failed to arrive") than tactical constraint. The temporal marker is present but replaceable—"after blowing the whistle" could be "at dawn" without altering causality. One-beat mention (opening only), no middle development or closure participation, and no visible cost tied to the timeframe itself. Functional setup but swappable and ornamental beyond that.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ivar's motivation "to understand what clocks really measure" is articulated early ("his own reason for staying was simpler and stranger") and dramatized through choices: he keeps the disagreeing mantle clock as "a clue," deliberately winds it further off to "watch how each device drifted," and explains to the inspector that "what the clocks measured was not the horizon or the sun but the station's ability to keep promises." The motivation drives the plot (why he tolerates the ice crisis philosophically, why he leaves the clock wrong) and charges the ending's "meaning is chosen, not merely ticked." Three-beat involvement (early declaration, mis-winding, inspector dialogue), strong causal pressure, and closure linkage. Minor friction: the motivation is slightly told in the opening rather than inferred solely from action, and the inspector dialogue borders on thesis statement. Still, the motivation shapes tactics and payoff with undeniable cost (foregoing precision's comfort).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" is established in the opening ("the fjord swallowed the sound and returned it as silence, a fjord quiet that made even his thoughts seem to drip") and reprised when "the inspector's anger softened into the same fjord quiet outside." The tone is coherent—contemplative, textured, unhurried—and modulates subtly under pressure (the ice-crisis beats tighten syntax slightly without abandoning the meditative register). The final reprise charges the closure by linking the inspector's shift to the environmental stillness, reinforcing the theme of chosen meaning over mechanical urgency. Two-beat involvement (opening establishment, climax reprise), strong thematic payoff, and the tone's specificity (fjord + dripping thoughts) makes it irreplaceable. The tone does not constrain a choice directly but reweights the final image with atmospheric cost (silence as acceptance, not void).</comment>
