<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's professional curiosity and personal grief are established, but her interior contradictions remain muted under pressure. The choice to sit beside Eli and trace the call through the hearing aid shows agency, yet the emotional cost feels more asserted than embodied—"her own throat felt full of ash" tells rather than showing degradation. The final beat offers endurance rather than transformation, which fits Earned Stasis, but the visible price paid on the page is thin. Eli's arc from suicidal ideation to walking back with Mara compresses too quickly without sufficient on-page struggle or micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Mara, atrium, twilight, her role). The piece follows a causal chain: photograph → hearing aid pulse → stairwell → intervention → closure image. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mara logs Eli as a promise and sits with her own stubborn life—a reconfiguration with felt cost. However, the mother's voice "softening into static that sounded almost like relief" relies on metaphor rather than a concrete, unmistakable image of cost. The hearing aid growing warm functions as a lyric callback, but the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, stairwell, and decades-old hearing aid are vivid and purposeful. The hearing aid's "tiny pulse" and "four quick pulses" constrain Mara's tracking choices and charge the final image when it grows warm. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara moves from atrium to corridors to stairwell to atrium. The photograph's soot-smudged "PLEASE" offers tactile, lived-in detail that shifts meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing Eli from succumbing to the dead voice—is signaled early and tightens in the stairwell confrontation. Mara's choice to sit beside him rather than grab him, then to name the traced connections and revise the photograph's meaning, shows protagonist agency that narrows options. The hearing aid pulses provide escalation cues. However, the resolution hinges partly on Mara's exposition about what the dead can "only repeat" and the living can "revise," which borders on convenience; the voice retreating feels more facilitated by explanation than by a dramatized, costly trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the photograph's revision ("STAY, PLEASE"), the hearing aid as both relic and tool, and the contrast between the dead repeating versus the living revising. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate exchange, where Mara tells Eli "the dead could only repeat what they died believing, but the living could revise it"—a near-thematic statement that tilts toward articulation rather than pure implication. The final image of the hearing aid growing warm with "her own stubborn, curious life" offers resonance without a stated moral, reweighting prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is consistent ("persistently curious," professional idiom). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Eli's silence and the phone's calm rain-voice carry subtext. The hearing aid's sensory cues (ticks, pulses, warmth) are filtered through Mara's tactile attention. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully when the orderly Jessa hands over the envelope. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon—"reeling hush," "fern shadows"—without register drift. Minor: "the woman's voice, calm as rain" and "sounded almost like relief" edge toward stock phrasing under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is mostly sustained. However, multiple sentences open with "Mara" or "She," creating mild template cadence in the middle third. "The hearing aid ticked once in her pocket, a tiny pulse that meant the call was not for comfort but for contact, a chain that needed tracing before it tightened around someone else" stacks clauses that could be tightened. "Persistently curious, the kind who listened past words" leans on appositive summary. No major loops or scaffold, but density dips in expository beats. Information load is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts" premise is fresh, and the hearing aid as a grief-tracking device offers specificity. The photograph's soot-smudged revision and the dead repeating/living revising motif provide a non-obvious synthesis. However, the stairwell intervention follows a familiar "talk someone off the ledge" structure, and the mother's voice retreating after Mara's explanation feels somewhat convenient. The combination of elements is purposeful, but the emotional arc's final turn lacks the sharp, inevitable surprise that would push into the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as contact tracer shapes the premise, drives the tracking sequence (atrium → stairwell), and her decision to sit beside Eli rather than grab him is the key turn. Her role is signaled immediately, involved in at least three beats (receiving photograph, following pulses, intervening with Eli), and her professional method informs the closure when she logs Eli as a promise. The role is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears in beat one (envelope delivery), is examined in the stairwell with Eli, and its smudged "PLEASE" becomes the pivot that reweights the message from command to plea. Mara recognizes herself as the girl, anchoring personal stakes. The photograph is slipped into Eli's pocket at closure, completing the arc. Three distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is articulated once ("incidental heroism, she had learned, often looked like showing up at the right breath") and demonstrated when Mara sits beside Eli without dramatic intervention. The concept shapes her tactics—passive presence rather than force—but remains more thematic accent than driver of multiple beats. It influences one key choice but does not recur or constrain later action, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is labeled in the opening ("Mara was persistently curious, the kind who listened past words") but its on-page cost is diffuse. Her curiosity drives her to follow the pulses and listen to the hearing aid, enabling the tracking sequence, but no moment dramatizes a visible tradeoff where curiosity itself forecloses an easier path. Present across beats but more trait-background than sharp constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assure" appears twice with causal weight: Mara assures Jessa she will handle it (committing her to the chase) and assures Eli "that wanting silence did not mean he had to surrender to it" (the hinge that begins his turn). The second instance directly enables the resolution. The action is not ornamental; swapping it for "promise" or "tell" would dilute the professional calm that defines Mara's method. Strong integration across setup and climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early as a relic, ticks to signal the call's nature, gives metronome beats to guide Mara through corridors, flares with four pulses to identify the caller, and grows warm at closure to embody her living heartbeat. It appears in at least four beats, constrains her tracking method, and charges the final image. Mechanics are taught and matter; the device is indispensable to both escalation and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The atrium frames the opening and closing, providing spatial anchor and the "reeling hush" atmosphere. The mist-clad windows and fern shadows contribute to tone, and the stairwell becomes the pressure point. However, the setting does not constrain Mara's choices—she could track Eli anywhere. The atrium's return at closure offers lyric bookend and some reweighting, but the setting functions more as backdrop than active shaper of tactics, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the dead call" anchors the temporal premise and the title beat. The dead voice's intrusion via phone and the hearing aid's pulses mark the timeframe as now, during active haunting. However, the story does not establish a ticking clock that tightens Mara's window; the call unfolds at narrative pace rather than racing against imminent danger. The timeframe is present and coherent but does not apply urgent time pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's drive "to protect vulnerable voices" is stated in the opening and dramatized when she follows the pulse to Eli and intervenes. Her throat "full of ash" hints at personal cost, and the choice to log Eli as a promise rather than a case shows friction between professional duty and personal investment. The motivation shapes at least two beats and informs closure, but the internal conflict between protecting others and managing her own grief remains more backdrop than live dilemma on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is named twice (opening atrium, closing atrium) and the prose sustains a muted, fog-soaked atmosphere throughout: "mist pressed to the glass," "fern shadows," the orderly "hurrying," the voice "calm as rain." Tone modulates subtly from waiting to intervention to earned quiet, supporting pressure without jarring shifts. The final "reeling hush" charges the closure image by returning the phrase with new weight (Mara's own life replaces the summoning call). Coherent and purposeful, earning solid integration.</comment>
