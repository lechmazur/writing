<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysa is rendered through concrete particulars: tin eartrumpets, bone-handled chisel, tactile sensitivity to vibrations. Her profession shapes perception throughout ("felt vibrations as if they were sentences"), and the final choice to catalog and pin the tapestry is earned by prior action and her established role. Internal texture remains consistent, though her interior voice could show more contradiction under pressure; she proceeds methodically without much emotional friction or cost to her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates density through nested discoveries (hearth → diaries → tapestry → shadows → understanding) that reweight the opening premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lysa realizes the axis cannot be restored because dreamers are gone, so she pivots to cataloging the shift—a renunciation with visible cost (the impossible plea "Set the axis back" must be refused). Orientation anchors are present early (silo library, Lysa, post-dream world). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry fragment's shadows and diary confessions converge to reveal the library's purpose, narrowing Lysa's options to documentation rather than repair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silo's concrete skin, central stair, bricked hearth, and window slit form a coherent micro-architecture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "scent of smoke," "cedar and panic," "scaled shadows that crawled across the shelves." The tapestry fragment held to the window slit constrains the final beat—sunset through warp casts dragon shadows that help Lysa understand direction itself changed—directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (draft up stair, chiseling hearth, laying fragment on table, holding to window) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to collect and preserve knowledge of the displaced axis before it vanishes. Pressure accumulates through the nested artifacts (diaries, tapestry, shadows) that reveal the library's hidden purpose. The tightening occurs when Lysa realizes no restoration is possible, forcing renunciation with felt cost: she must settle for cataloging rather than repair. Agency is clear—her probing, reading aloud, and pinning the tapestry are deliberate acts that foreclose the path of hoping for axis restoration. The plea "Set the axis back, or at least remember where it went" directly tests her against an impossible demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the impossibility of restoring a world-order that depended on vanished minds. The dragon tapestry, "scaled shadows," and diary plea crystallize the question without stating a thesis. The ending offers a resonant answer—Lysa cannot set the axis back, so she catalogs the hum and pins the fragment as a signpost—without moralizing. The conceptual cost (accepting irreversibility) is legible in the final image of "stories turning toward their new north." No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV held throughout with stable psychic distance. Voice is distinct and controlled: "bronze quiet," "displaced axis," "dreams tried to stitch an old map onto a world that was slipping its bearings." Diction remains within Lysa's historian idiom without register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent—she listens, feels vibrations as sentences, reads walls. No dialogue to judge. Minor stiffness in a few constructions ("their dreams tried to stitch") but rhythm modulates appropriately with the accumulating discoveries and never obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Figurative language ("bronze dust," "sealed mouth," "ember scales," "extinguished lanterns") is coherent and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe with the accumulative design. Minor stiffness: "the charred lines began to align with the dragons' threads, each entry a coordinate" reads slightly mechanical, and "the only repair left to her kind" leans toward Tell, though it remains efficient. Overall propulsion is strong with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—post-dream historian cataloging a world-axis shift—offers a fresh synthesis of archival mystery and speculative metaphysics. The nested discovery structure (hearth/diaries/tapestry/shadows) feels organic rather than formulaic. Specific details (tin eartrumpets, bone-handled chisel, singed tapestry, dragon shadows crawling) anchor the concept in tactile particulars. The transformation from "set the axis back" to "catalog and signpost" is earned in hindsight. Risks a slight abstraction in the "displaced axis" metaphor but grounds it through concrete objects and sensory proof, avoiding generic placeholders.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa Quell, odd historian, is signaled immediately and her choices drive all major turns: following the draft, chipping the hearth, reading the diaries, holding the tapestry to light, realizing restoration is impossible, cataloging the shift, and pinning the fragment as signpost. Her profession and method (listening to rooms, probing debris) shape every beat and the closure hinges on her renunciation and pivot to documentation. Removing her exact role would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (nested in the first diary), is physically handled (laid on table, held to window slit), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure: its dragon scales cast shadows that help Lysa understand the directional shift, and she pins it beside the door as a signpost in the final beat. It enables two key actions (discovery and signposting) and charges the ending image. The object's medieval origin and singed state tie to the theme of lost anchors.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The displaced axis is named in paragraph five and frames the dominant stake: the world's directional and mnemonic anchor has shifted because dreamers stopped. It shapes Lysa's investigation (mapping the shift) and narrows her options at closure (she cannot restore it, only document). The concept reappears in the diary plea and the final image ("stories turning toward their new north"). It is more than thematic echo—it defines what is at stake and what is lost—but remains somewhat abstract compared to the physical objects.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lysa's sensitivity is established early ("felt vibrations as if they were sentences," "fingertips tingled," "heard the wall answer with a faint hum") and enables her method of listening to rooms. It constrains her work (she walks slowly, wears eartrumpets) and allows her to perceive the directional hum in the concrete at closure. However, the cost or tradeoff of this trait is not dramatized—no on-page moment where heightened perception creates vulnerability or friction. It enables but does not visibly constrain with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Probing appears explicitly ("she probed for material proof," "probing through half-burned diaries") and drives the discovery sequence: chiseling the hearth, turning diary pages, interpreting charred lines. The action is integral to the accumulative structure and cannot be swapped without losing the historian's method. It shapes two beats (hearth excavation, diary reading) and underlies the closure pivot to cataloging. The verb "probe" is thematically charged (both physical and investigative) and recurs purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered early (paragraph eight) through Lysa's chiseling, and their mechanics matter: the charred edges limit what can be read, their cedar scent and panic anchor the timeframe, and their repeated final line drives the plea Lysa must refuse. The method shapes the middle investigation (reading entries that align with tapestry threads) and the closure realization (the plea cannot be fulfilled). Removing this exact container and its damaged state would break the story's evidentiary logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored immediately and its architecture matters: the central stair channels the draft, the bricked hearth hides the diaries, the window slit enables the tapestry/shadow revelation, and the concrete skin "heard direction itself change." The setting supplies resources (hearth as archive, window as lens) that affect discovery and constrain the final beat (pinning the fragment beside the door). It is more than backdrop—its structure enables key turns and its walls are active witnesses—but does not pressure a tactical choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last human dream was dreamt") is signaled in the opening line and frames the story's conceptual stakes: the world has shifted because dreaming stopped. The night of cessation is named "the displaced axis" and the diaries' last entries mark its approach. However, the timeframe does not create on-page urgency or tighten Lysa's moves—no ticking clock alters her tactics. It provides conceptual context and historical marker but does not pressure moment-to-moment decisions with time scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation—"to collect the stories walls have heard, before weather and moss and time erased the last witnesses"—is stated early and dramatized through every action: following the draft, chiseling, reading, cataloging. The final beat shows friction between the plea to "set the axis back" and her realization that she can only document, not restore. This friction forces the renunciation and pivot to signposting, with visible cost (accepting irreversibility). The desire is not merely told; it drives choices that alter the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone phrase "bronze quiet" appears early and modulates coherently through the accumulative design: silence settled like bronze dust, Lysa listens in "bronze quiet," the final night wraps the silo. The metallic stillness supports the post-dream atmosphere and charges the ending ("in the walls, the stories turning toward their new north"). Diction and rhythm remain measured and textural throughout, avoiding melodrama at the closure. The tone does not pressure a choice but coheres across beats and enriches the final image with its sustained quiet.</comment>
