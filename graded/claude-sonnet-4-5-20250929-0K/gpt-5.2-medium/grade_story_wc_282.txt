<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina's interior is richly specific—her sensory training shapes perception ("taste air currents, read salt on stone"), and her motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" drives concrete choices under escalating pressure. The heat-mapping method embodies emotion without diagnostic labels, and the pivot from personal comfort (fossil as talisman) to recognizing non-human presence shows contradictory impulses resolving into stance. Minor slip: the handprint discovery and Mina's leap to "transitional object between species" feels slightly unearned; the connection is declared more than tested through micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with anchors (Mina, coastal cave, post-hibernation), teaches a pattern of heat-mapped emotion early, and deepens through tide entrapment → floating fossil → handprint discovery. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mina names the cave, leaves the fossil as promise, and begins to sing—a crystallized final moment that reweights her role from mapper to co-participant with visible cost (solitary renunciation of the fossil, acceptance of unknown presence). The lens holds; cost is felt in the act of leaving her mother's gift and singing alone to an entity she can never fully map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave network constrains choices throughout: sealed exit forces reliance on the floating fossil, shell-lined tunnel and clay handprints provide tactile discovery, moonlight vent becomes the escape route. Sensory detail is filtered through Mina's training ("dripped in slow metronome clicks," "limestone," "shell fossils"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from chamber to slit to older tunnel to vent. The environment charges the final image—Mina etches her map on slate and places the fossil in a niche, integrating geology and emotion. Minor: the "older tunnel" could use one more grounding detail to sharpen the transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mapping what sleep will not, crystallized as "become the voice of the unknown." Pressure tightens causally: tide seals exit → fossil floats → Mina follows into deeper passage → handprints reveal non-human presence → she speaks aloud and is guided to escape. Agency is clear (she chooses to follow the fossil, to speak, to leave it behind), and the final act—singing the cave its own name—forecloses the path of neutral observation with visible cost (solitary communion, relinquishing the maternal object). One meaningful deepening transforms her from cataloger to co-voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the fossil as "transitional object" shifts from personal comfort to interspecies evidence, reweighting what "archives" and "voice" mean. The final image—Mina singing the cave its own name—answers the implicit question (Can the unmapped speak back?) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the handprints' "too many joints" and the warmth's non-human longing. No thematic echo; the piece trusts image and action. The recurring fossil constrains her final choice and charges closure with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with intimate psychic distance; Mina's perceptual signature (heat-mapping emotions, sensory training idiom) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction matches her lens: "factually mystical," "heat-swept edges of something like longing," "enormous sleeping body." Reflection anchors in present stimuli (fossil pulse, limestone touch) and tilts present stance. Minor slip: "jointed handprints" and "she set the elm leaf fossil into a niche...watched it float once more and settle like a promise" compresses the floating-settling sequence slightly; the simultaneity is legible but rushes the final beat's temporal unfolding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("mouth that might open," "enormous sleeping body") serves thematic weight without overwriting. Minor issues: "Now the fossil sat warm against her palm, factually mystical" and "The longing did not feel like hers, and that frightened her more than the tide" are clean but edge toward summary-assertion where embodied perception would sharpen. "She set down her lantern, pressed the fossil to her chest, and watched it float" sequences cleanly. No loops or scaffold. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography + floating fossil as interspecies comfort marker is fresh and internally coherent. The piece commits fully to its premise (heat-mapping emotions as method, caves holding non-human archives) and follows implications without retreat. The turn—fossil as evidence rather than magic, cave as sleeping body leaving comfort markers—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking (POV that trusts dense diction, floating object without mechanistic explanation) heightens stakes and meaning. The final act (singing the cave its own name) is specific, non-obvious, and inevitable given Mina's role and the handprint discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames expectation early. Mina's choices create key turns: she follows the floating fossil (middle beat), speaks aloud to the cave (deepening), and sings it its own name (closure). Observation paired with decision; her sensory training enables action under pressure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: mother's gift, tested with spectrometers, pulse of heat when she misses home. Development: floats above her shirt, guides her through the dark crack. Payoff: she sets it into the niche beside handprints, it floats and settles "like a promise." Appears in ≥3 beats with evolving use; reweighted from personal talisman to interspecies evidence. Irreplaceable; visible cost in leaving it behind.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: named explicitly as mother's gift. Development: Mina realizes the fossil is "not magic so much as evidence, a transitional object between species." Payoff: she places it as a comfort marker for the cave's unknown presence. Shapes stakes (what it means to map the unknown) and final image. Strong thematic and closure work, though the mechanics of "transition" remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "factually mystical in the way certain stones could be dated and yet still seemed to whisper." Development: the pulse of heat rises when she misses home; the floating defies physics yet reads as evidence. Payoff: the handprints radiate the same warmth, linking fossil to non-human presence. Constrains interpretation (rules out pure magic) and enables trust in the floating. Mid-band: label-only in the setup line, but causally active in the middle and ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: fossil floats "a finger width above her shirt, held up by no thread or trick." Development: "she loosened her grip and let the fossil drift toward the darkest crack...moved like a compass needle in water." Payoff: "watched it float once more and settle like a promise." The floating action is the hinge that enables escape and redefines the fossil's role. Two distinct beats; high irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "heat-mapping emotions the way cartographers once traced shorelines, by laying her fingers on rock and letting temperature draw the lines." Development: records "heat-swept edges of something like longing"; finds handprints that "radiated the same steady warmth." Payoff: etches "a map that showed not just passages but the feelings that lived there." Shapes attempts and closure; signaled early and used across ≥2 beats. Specific mechanics matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: cave network "braided under the cliffs," "unknown spaces." Development: tide seals exit, forcing chamber entrapment; slit opens onto older tunnel with shell fossils; vent allows escape. Payoff: Mina etches map on slate, places fossil in niche. The setting constrains every major choice and supplies resources (handprints, vent). High causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "after the humans settled into their scheduled hibernation, Mina remained awake." Development: solitude underscores that warmth "belonged to no waking human." Payoff: "so the sleepers could someday listen." Present in all three gates and tightens isolation stakes, but the temporal pressure is looser than a live clock—no countdown shapes tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the premise; mid-band for moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "Mina wanted to become the voice of the unknown, not by inventing stories for sleeping people, but by listening until the caves spoke back in facts." Development: she speaks aloud to the cave, names currents and chambers "as if introducing herself," and warmth shifts in reply. Payoff: she sings the cave its own name, fulfilling the desire. Desire is dramatized through choices with friction (fear of the longing, relinquishing the fossil). Strong causal and closure work.</comment>
