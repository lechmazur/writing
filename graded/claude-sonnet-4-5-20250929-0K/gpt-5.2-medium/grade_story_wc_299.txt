<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction—reinventing himself to avoid feeling, then being forced back into emotional territory—drives key choices throughout. The motives are clearly traced from televised failure through isolation via facts to final recognition that "purpose was not applause but what you do after it." Embodied emotion appears in concrete moments (hands remembering catalog numbers, pinning cloth to corkboard), though the final epiphany risks slight over-articulation. The arc from emotional insulation to connection is earned by the scrap's physical handling and Marla's brother revelation, with visible cost in the protagonist's professional identity shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist moves from proving correctness to "tracing where sound had tried to stay," a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (abandoning the appraiser's defensive posture). The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the speaker-cloth investigation causally links televised failure → quarry contract → research → Marla's brother, while accumulating meaning through layered memory. Cost is legible in "I did not hide behind jargon" and the shift from earplugs-as-facts to facts-as-connection. One mild orientation delay (quarry context arrives ~140 words in) and slight lens drift between modes, but the closure unit itself is clean and the because/therefore chain holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: thin walls humming, window overlooking the stone scar, isolation enabling overnight work with the scrap. The pit's acoustic memory (crowd roar "rolled off the quarry walls and came back doubled") charges the final listening-station proposal. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tarp "smelled of rain," grille cloth texture measured with calipers). Spatial choreography remains clear across office, crate, corkboard, and pit view, with the valley's "stone throat" holding voices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring professional credibility after public failure—tightens when the protagonist shifts from defensive cataloging to meaningful documentation, narrowing options from self-protection to vulnerable connection. The reversal occurs when "the more I stared at it, the more I heard the old after-applause hush," forcing engagement with avoided loss. Agency is clear: the overnight work request, the cross-referenced report draft, the choice to tell Marla about a listening station rather than hide behind jargon. Cost is visible in the abandoned appraiser armor and the acceptance that "purpose was not applause but what you do after it." One escalation beat (pinning cloth, drafting report, delivering findings) creates sufficient pressure for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: purpose redefined through physical objects (speaker cloth, calipers, corkboard) rather than abstractions. The "after the applause" concept threads through multiple beats—the hush where loss lived, the singer's question "what any of it was for," the quarry's held echoes—and lands in the final image of handing someone proof their memory is real. The listening-station proposal functions as earned wisdom arising from specific experience (cross-referencing invoices, weather logs, newspaper photo). The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: validation replaces performance. Minor risk: "purpose was not applause but what you do after it" approaches explicit statement, though it's grounded in the trailer scene and Marla's response.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with consistent distance and perceptual signature (roadie-turned-appraiser noticing "manufacturer marks, corrosion patterns" and hands remembering "touring catalogs"). Voice modulates appropriately from defensive early cataloging to vulnerable final delivery. The narrative certainty stays within character knowledge; past-tense reflection is cleanly anchored to present stimuli (the cloth triggering memory of the valley show). Marla's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances plot. One minor register slip: "wrest meaning from it the way I used to wrest a stubborn road case" borders on overly literary phrasing for crisis processing, and "what you do after it" at the end risks slight distance break into summative wisdom, though both remain plausibly within the introspective narrator's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance multiple dimensions (e.g., "manufacturer marks, corrosion patterns, probable dates" shows both method and emotional defense). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. Some minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "ears filled with silence," "facts felt like earplugs," "the valley holding our voices in its stone throat" stack metaphoric vehicles within short spans without full integration. The closure beat itself remains clear. One scaffold phrase: "confidently uncertain nods, the kind I once gave sound engineers" over-explains the gesture. Overall propulsion is strong, with strategic compression of the appraisal work allowing focus on the emotional investigation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of roadie grief, antiques appraisal, and acoustic archaeology offers a specific angle on loss and validation. The speaker-cloth-as-evidence premise is non-obvious and the transformation from defensive cataloging to empathetic documentation feels earned. Emotional specificity (the after-applause hush, the singer's silence-fear confession) avoids generic templates. However, the core emotional arc—professional humiliation leads to meaningful connection via an artifact—follows a recognizable redemption structure. The listening-station proposal and Marla's brother revelation provide fresh texture but don't fully subvert the template. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications without retreat, landing in the solid middle of originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (first sentence establishes both roles). Drives multiple beats: takes the contract, catalogs artifacts defensively, requests overnight access, drafts the cross-referenced report, proposes the listening station to Marla. The dual identity (roadie/appraiser) is causally essential—roadie past enables recognition of the grille cloth and quarry-concert memory; appraiser training provides tools (calipers, burn test, invoices). The character's choices create key turns, especially the shift from hiding behind jargon to vulnerable delivery. Removing this exact dual background would break the story's causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (midpoint of first half, within setup window). Handled across multiple beats: physical examination with calipers and burn test, pinning to corkboard, overnight contemplation, cross-referencing with newspaper photo showing "the same silver thread," becomes proof for Marla that "felt like him." The scrap's specific properties (weave, silver filament, tear pattern) matter causally—they enable dating and authentication. Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: shifts from defensive catalog item to "proof that their memory is real." Removing this object would collapse the investigative structure and the emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (first paragraph: "the applause that used to rescue me"). Shapes stakes throughout: protagonist fled "after the applause" silence where loss lived, reinvented to avoid that moment, and the entire quarry investigation circles back to "what you do after it." The concept constrains tactics (defensive cataloging vs. vulnerable connection) and charges the final image (handing proof replaces seeking applause). The hush-after-applause appears in three distinct beats with escalating pressure. However, it functions more as thematic lens than active plot constraint—the protagonist's actions aren't visibly altered by applause's absence on the page, only by memory of its aftermath.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present early (first scene: "confidently uncertain nods, the kind I once gave sound engineers"). The trait recurs in "I answered with confidently uncertain nods" and shapes the protagonist's defensive cataloging approach. It enables one visible tradeoff: the appraiser persona allowed emotional insulation but led to televised failure. At closure, the protagonist abandons confident uncertainty for direct vulnerability ("I did not hide behind jargon"). However, the trait is more labeled than dramatized in action—we're told about the nods rather than shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure moments. The final shift away from it is clear but the attribute itself doesn't constrain a middle-scene choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("wrested away" describes the cloth's torn state). Recurs purposefully: protagonist begins to "wrest meaning from it the way I used to wrest a stubborn road case up a ramp." The verb choice reflects the roadie background and physical effort applied to emotional work. However, "wrest" functions more as metaphoric texture than irreplaceable action—the investigation could proceed with "extract," "derive," or "force" with only minor tonal loss. The action appears in two beats (cloth description, meaning-making) but doesn't create a turn that requires this exact verb. It enriches voice and connects past/present labor but remains somewhat swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early (first half: "I reinvented myself as an antiques appraiser because facts felt like earplugs"). Method shapes multiple beats: cataloging with manufacturer marks/corrosion patterns/dates, measuring weave with calipers, burn test for cotton percentage, cross-referencing invoices and weather logs. The mechanics matter—this documentary rigor enables the authentication that becomes meaningful to Marla. The method's limitation drives the turn: "facts came first, because facts were safe," but they couldn't answer "what any of it was for." At closure, the method transforms from insulation into connection tool. Removing this approach would eliminate the professional structure that makes validation possible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (end of first third: "quarry office trailer, bolted to gravel"). Supplies resources (corkboard for pinning cloth, isolation for overnight work, window view of the pit) that enable investigation. The trailer's thin walls and the pit's acoustic history ("crowd's roar rolled off the quarry walls and came back doubled") charge the listening-station proposal. Setting constrains one key choice: Marla locks the gate, creating the solitary overnight space where the protagonist can "wrest meaning." However, much of the trailer's function is atmospheric rather than tactically essential—the investigation could occur in other isolated spaces. The quarry's acoustic memory is more integral than the trailer itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Established immediately (opening: "After the livestreamed appraisal blew up in my face"). The recent failure motivates flight and defensive behavior throughout. Timeframe pressure appears in "short contract" and the overnight request creating urgency. However, time remains somewhat loose—no live clock tightens decisions within the investigation scene, and the "after" framing is more contextual than tactical. The public failure's recency matters (poisonous name, need to prove competence) but doesn't create scene-level temporal constraints that alter moment-to-moment choices. The timeframe shapes why the protagonist is here but not how quickly they must act.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Signaled early ("after my televised mistake I had even less" answer to what it's for). Desire is dramatized through contradictory impulses: seeking purpose while hiding from feeling, investigating the cloth despite wanting emotional distance. Friction between wants and costs appears in multiple beats—cataloging to avoid emotion vs. the cloth forcing memory, overnight contemplation vs. vulnerability with Marla. The motivation drives the key turn from defensive documentation to meaningful connection and shapes the final realization that purpose is "proof that their memory is real." One minor limitation: the discovery moment approaches told epiphany ("I realized purpose was not applause") though it's grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone established early through "echo valley" setting and language ("thin walls humming," "scar of stone," "valley holding our voices in its stone throat"). Coherent through turns: longing modulates from isolated (defensive cataloging) to connected (Marla's brother memory) without breaking. Acoustic imagery threads throughout (ears filled with silence, after-applause hush, crowd roar doubled by walls, listening station proposal) creating consistent sonic-emotional texture. The tone charges the final image: the valley as a "stone throat" holding voices pairs with the protagonist's shift from silence to speaking Marla's brother back into presence. The elegiac register remains stable while allowing for intensification at closure.</comment>
