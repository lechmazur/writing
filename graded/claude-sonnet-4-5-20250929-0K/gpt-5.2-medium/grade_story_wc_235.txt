<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular—"feral nostalgia" hunts rather than mourns, jealousy targets past selves' unspent chances—and contradictory impulses (warning vs. envying the younger self) act simultaneously in the dream-ridge swap. Motivation is consistent: the lucid-dream chronicler uses the same observational trade to escape panic, and the final choice to "keep writing until the dates behaved" forecloses spiraling and earns stasis with visible cost (accepting authorship over rumor). Minor slip: some reflective passages ("the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it") lean slightly toward exposition, but they anchor in concrete cues (the scroll's sap smell, the grave's letters) and tilt present stance, so BRR is satisfied. The swap and the gratitude beat both show embodied contradictions under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Causal threads (Hybrid, dominant accumulative at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph (grave → cabin → ranger's table). Closure lands as Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing: "I chose to keep writing until the dates behaved" forecloses the loop-driven panic with visible cost (accepting narrative discipline over passive spiraling), and the final birch-bark line reweights the premise (grave as calendar-puncture, not death prediction) with conceptual clarity. One meaningful deepening occurs at the ridge swap, where jealousy-of-past-selves crystallizes into method and the older/younger roles invert, narrowing options. Cost is legible: the protagonist trades chaotic time-sliding for the labor of continuous recording. Minor slip: the second lucid dream (threads-of-light map, thanking the younger self) adds texture but does not escalate pressure as sharply as the first; the turn feels lateral rather than tightening, though it does break the loop and earn the calm.</comment>

<comment>The cabin's birch-bark scroll constrains the protagonist's choice at two beats (untying it, tracing grooves to write) and charges the final image ("last length of birch bark"). The graveyard's absurd slope placement and the ridge's "too sharp" moonlight are vivid and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean across dream and waking moves. The scroll functions as micro-setting, meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining action and charging closure. Minor slip: the "down-valley" cemetery hike adds a concrete anchor but does not alter tactics or reweight the dominant stake; it reads as corroborative texture rather than pressure, slightly diluting focus.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (distill chaos into narrative before it eats me) is signaled early and drives the protagonist's lucid-dream interrogations and writing acts. One meaningful tightening: the ridge-swap crystallizes the method (jealousy of past selves) and narrows options by revealing the grave as calendar-puncture rather than prophecy. The gratitude beat in the second dream breaks the loop, and the final choice to "keep writing" forecloses spiraling with on-page cost (continuous authorial labor vs. becoming a rumor). Agency is renunciation and endurance (Earned Stasis), not decisive external action, which fits the lens. Minor slip: the second dream's thread-map and thanking-the-younger-self beats feel more like affirmation than escalation; the pressure plateaus rather than tightens further, though the closure choice remains earned.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme (narrative as fence against landslide, authorship vs. rumor) emerges from image and action rather than statement. The birch-bark scroll's grooves, the ridge-swap's role inversion, and the final line's "dates behaved" distill the question without moralizing. Feral nostalgia—hunting not childhood but "the exact moment before I learned that endings could be scheduled"—is a specific, non-generic inflection. The final image offers a resonant answer: writing imposes order with visible cost (continuous labor), reweighting the premise (grave as rupture, not fate) without stating a moral. Minor slip: "jaded wonder" as a phrase ("like a miracle delivered by a clerk") leans slightly into prompt-language echo, though it is integrated into voice and moment.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled: "the pines stood like witnesses with needles dull from old snow," "nostalgia… hunts it, teeth out," "I dove toward him, meaning to warn him, but the dream rewound." Perceptual signature is character-specific (trade-based observation, jealousy as escape method). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("not like a bird but like a page torn free") and non-standard syntax ("while my older self hovered above, stained with the same weary surprise") are legible and voice-motivated. Minor slip: "jaded wonder, like a miracle delivered by a clerk" and "feral nostalgia, the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it" use appositive glosses that slightly over-articulate the effect, edging toward explanatory interiority in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (scroll, dreams, swap, gratitude, writing all advance). Sentence openings vary. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("nostalgia… hunts it, teeth out," "soar… like a page torn free"). Minor slips: "the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it, teeth out, in the dark" and "the kind who sells other peoples nocturnal revelations to daytime magazines" use appositive-gloss structures twice in the opening, creating a faint pattern of explanatory scaffolding. "I realized my method for escaping panic was getting jealous of past selves, counting their unspent chances like coins" summarizes the insight rather than fully dramatizing discovery, though the prior swap beat does show it in action. These touches slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis (grave as calendar-puncture, all versions leaking into one another; jealousy of past selves as panic-escape method) is specific and non-obvious. The lucid-dream-chronicler occupation integrates with the method (recording as fence-building). The ridge-swap and the gratitude-loop-break feel earned rather than gimmicky. The ending's choice (author vs. rumor) reweights prior material without neat resolution. Minor slip: the "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" phrases slightly echo prompt-language, and the two lucid-dream sequences follow a parallel structure (soar, observe, realize) that risks feeling formulaic; the second adds affirmation more than fresh inflection. The core remains fresh, but the execution in the second half trends toward the safety middle rather than bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream-chronicler trait frames the story (opening occupation label, "by trade"), drives two key choices (forcing lucidity to interrogate the grave, deliberately soaring in the second dream), and enables the closure tactic (writing on birch bark as professional habit extended to self-rescue). The gratitude beat explicitly credits "the habit of recording," linking occupation to method and closure. Cost: accepting continuous authorial labor over spiraling. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, causal pressure, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The scroll is handled in three beats: untying and smelling it (first night), tracing grooves to write (dawn after first dream), and writing the final distillation ("last length of birch bark"). Its grooves guide the pen "as if I were tracing scars," constraining the writing act and charging the closure image. The fishing-line tie and sap-and-smoke smell anchor it concretely. Early signal, development (guides writing), closure participation (final length), causal pressure (enables narrative fence-building), and specificity (birch bark left by the ranger, not generic paper) all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Feral nostalgia is defined early ("the kind that does not miss a place but hunts it, teeth out") and recurs at the ridge swap ("the nostalgia in me went feral again, chasing… the exact moment before I learned that endings could be scheduled"), shaping the protagonist's emotional stance and linking to the method (jealousy hunts unspent chances). It pressures the ridge-dive choice (diving to warn the younger self) and charges the swap realization. Present in setup, development, and closure orbit. Minor friction: the concept is slightly over-glossed in appositive phrases, reducing irreplaceability; a near-synonym (aggressive longing, predatory regret) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Chronological confusion is signaled in the opening ("time in my skull has been chronologically confused, sliding forward and back"), dramatized in the ridge-swap (younger/older roles invert, "the dream rewound"), explained causally ("the grave had punctured the calendar, and all my versions leaked into one another"), and resolved at closure (writing "until the dates behaved"). It constrains perception (past/future interrogation in dreams) and enables the swap tactic. Early signal, two beats (swap, threads-of-light map), closure linkage, causal pressure, and cost (must continuously write to stabilize time) all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Soaring occurs in two dream beats: the ridge flight where the swap happens ("I began to soar… like a page torn free") and the second dream where the protagonist follows light-threads and outflies the graveyard. The first soar enables the swap (observing younger self, then inverting roles); the second enables the gratitude beat and loop-breaking. The action is occupation-linked (lucid-dream flight as professional tool) and metaphorically charged ("like a page torn free"). Present in setup (ridge), development (swap and gratitude), and closure orbit (outflying the graveyard). Minor friction: swappable with "fly" or "rise" with small edits; the specificity is more metaphorical than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The method is signaled at the ridge swap ("I realized my method for escaping panic was getting jealous of past selves, counting their unspent chances like coins"), used to frame the younger-self observation (jealousy first, not warning), and transformed at the gratitude beat (thanking instead of envying breaks the loop). It shapes two key choices (dive-to-warn becomes swap; gratitude breaks loop) and charges closure (choosing authorship over rumor is the final escape from panic). Present in setup (realized at swap), development (gratitude beat), closure linkage. Cost: must continuously record to sustain the escape. Minor friction: the realization is slightly summary-voiced, though the prior jealousy beat does show it in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The cabin provides the scroll, the bunk for lucid sleep, and spatial anchors (table, window). It frames the writing beats (dawn at table, noon return, last birch-bark line) and supplies the tool that enables closure (scroll as narrative skin). Present in setup (arrival, scroll discovery), development (two writing sessions), and closure (final distillation at table). Minor friction: the cabin itself is slightly generic (potbelly stove, bunk, table); its constraint is more passive (container for action) than active pressure. The scroll does more causal work than the cabin structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The timeframe is signaled in the title-beat opening ("After I saw my own grave") and drives all subsequent action: time in the skull sliding forward/back, the need to "distill chaos into narrative before it ate me," the ridge-swap inversion, and the closure choice to "keep writing until the dates behaved." The grave's future date creates the dominant stake (calendar-puncture, not death prediction) and the cost (must continuously write to stabilize chronology). Early signal, causal pressure across all beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (remove the grave-sighting and the story collapses).</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The motivation is stated early ("I needed my own record to distill chaos into narrative before it ate me") and dramatized in three writing beats (untying scroll, tracing grooves at dawn, final birch-bark distillation) and two lucid-dream interrogations. It conflicts with the easier path (spiraling, becoming a rumor) and the jealousy-of-past-selves escape method. The closure choice (author vs. rumor, writing until dates behave) earns the desire with visible cost (continuous labor). Early signal, development across writing and dream beats, closure linkage, and cost connection all present. Minor friction: the opening statement is slightly tell-heavy, though subsequent beats dramatize the friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Jaded wonder is voiced in specific images: "miracle delivered by a clerk," "weary surprise," jealousy as method, nostalgia hunting "teeth out," the grave's "absurd" placement. The tone modulates under pressure (feral at the swap, calm at the gratitude beat, resolved at closure) and charges the final image ("until the dates behaved" balances jadedness and earned control). Coherent through turns, distinct from generic melancholy, and purposeful in shaping voice. Present in setup, development, and closure. Minor friction: "jaded wonder" as a phrase is slightly prompt-echoic and named explicitly ("the sentence hit me with jaded wonder") rather than fully implicit, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>
