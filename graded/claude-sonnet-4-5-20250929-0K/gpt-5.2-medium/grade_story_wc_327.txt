<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilen's obsession to preserve Vey through sensory translation is concrete and drives his experiments with the diamond and canyon. His micro-choices—timing whispers to bird-flight, scraping the bone floor with copper-veined fingers—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The night Toma dies and the swifts don't fly, Ilen's solo improvisation (breathing aligned to the late flock's spiral) shows contradictory impulses: desperation versus methodical craft. Minor slip: the elders' consonants "softening" is told rather than dramatized through failed speech attempts on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the diamond goes still, the walls answer with a new voice, and travelers later hear texture translated—Ilen succeeds in creating a library without pages, though no living person can speak Vey from birth. Cost is visible: Toma's death, the speakers' throats failing, and Ilen's solitary night scraping bone until vibrations match memory. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered attempts (diamond on palm, word for roughness, silk/grit timed to swifts) and the cadence shift at closure (late flock spiral, structured chorus) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/concept by the second paragraph (Ilen, Resounding canyon, tunnel of echoes, dying language). One meaningful deepening: the diamond's hunger nearly erases rather than preserves until Ilen harnesses bird-patterns to control resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes and bone towers constrain Ilen's tactics throughout: he must time whispers to avoid cacophony, the diamond placement in a crack matters, and the canyon's geometry (wind funneling through ribs of stone) enables the translation method. The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting, vibrating "like an eager mouth" and requiring physical scraping to match Toma's voice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the "dry rasp" from the chipped edge, ash-gray swifts drawing a slow spiral (the Vey sign for return), and Ilen's copper-veined fingers used as tuning fork. The canyon evolves causally—unpatterned repeats threaten uniformity when swifts don't fly, then late flock restores structure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Vey's texture-words as sound before all speakers die) is signaled early and tightens through Toma's inability to name velvet versus bark. Escalation is Accumulative: Ilen progresses from single-word experiments (roughness) to silk/grit pairs timed to bird-flight, then to the crisis night when unpatterned repeats threaten uniformity. Agency drives resolution: Ilen enters alone, uses his own body as tuning fork, and aligns breathing to the late flock's spiral—choices that foreclose easier paths (waiting for ideal conditions, relying on others). Visible cost: Toma's death, the risk that the diamond's hunger will erase faster than death, and years passing until "no living person could speak Vey from birth." One tightening moment (the curse shows itself as hunger) narrows options with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sensory knowledge outlasting speech, communal memory encoded in place rather than persons, and the cost of translation (what is lost when texture becomes sound). The flawed diamond's transformation—from hungry curse to sated conductor—parallels Ilen's journey from obsession to structured method. Final image offers non-literal answer: travelers "brushed their hands along the rock, and heard the canyon translate them," embedding the question (can touch survive as sound?) in ongoing resonance without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy closure—Vey is dead as spoken language, yet present as haptic echo—embracing complexity through the swifts' recurring spiral (a sign for return that reweights prior flight-patterns). No thematic echo or sermonizing; the copper-veined storyteller's success is shown, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable distance; narrative certainty matches what an external observer plus Ilen's demonstrated knowledge can plausibly know. Diction is distinct and purpose-driven: "copper-veined storyteller," "towers of bone rose like ruined organs," "dry rasp...as though it had stored a hundred unspoken syllables." Perceptual signature is consistent—Ilen notices texture (chipped edge, grain, pressure) and sound-pattern (harmonics, distinct strands). Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("Years later...") accelerates to closure without detail-bloat. Minor slip: "their consonants softened, as if time was sanding them down" edges toward poetic summary where a concrete failed-speech moment would sharpen immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses. Information density is high: "He had not taken it for wealth, but because its imperfections caught vibrations the way clean gems could not" does three jobs (motive, object property, thematic link). Figurative language is selective and integrated: "the canyon returned every shout as a thousand mangled copies," "their throats failed, the canyon kept their meanings, layered in the rock as harmonics." Minor loop: "the diamond vibrated in his hand like an eager mouth" (once) versus "the diamond flashed once, then went still, its curse sated" uses similar vehicle (animate hunger) but transforms it, acceptable as bracket. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Core synthesis—preserving a tactile language through canyon acoustics and cursed-gem resonance, calibrated by bird-flight geometry—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "dying language" and "oral archive" tropes through grounded mechanics: diamond vibrations match texture, swifts' lattice-patterns provide timing measures, and bone-floor scraping tunes memory. Emotional truth anchors novelty: Ilen's solitary night when the swifts don't fly dramatizes desperation without sentiment. Risk-taking (dense exposition, compressed timeframe, no dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the final image (travelers brushing rock, hearing translation) earns its resonance from prior particulars. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with generic "archive" or "teacher" substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilen drives every major turn: bringing Toma to the tunnel, placing diamond on his palm, timing whispers to swift-patterns, entering alone when swifts don't fly, scraping bone floor with his own fingers as tuning fork, and aligning breathing to the late flock's spiral. His choices narrow options (using the cursed diamond despite hunger-risk) and enable the ending (structured chorus that sates the curse). Present across all three gates: setup (copper-veined storyteller introduced paragraph one), development (multiple middle beats: diamond-on-palm, silk/grit words, bird-led rhythm), and payoff (final night's solo improvisation shapes closure directly). Causal pressure is high—remove Ilen's agency and the story fails. Cost is visible: solitary risk, physical effort (scraping until vibrations match), and years passing as he becomes legend.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in four beats: carried in pouch (setup), placed on Toma's palm to elicit rasp (first use), pressed against tunnel wall to multiply echo (second use), and set in a crack during final night where it "flashed once, then went still, its curse sated" (payoff/transformation). Its chipped edge and cloudy heart enable function—catching vibrations clean gems cannot—and its hunger nearly sabotages before being harnessed. The diamond's transformation (eager mouth → sated stillness) directly shapes closure: the curse's satisfaction allows the structured chorus to persist. Irreplaceable: the flaw is load-bearing for both mechanics and theme. Early signal, multiple touches, closure linkage, and visible cost (risk of erasure) all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is the story's engine: it holds and bends whispers, threatens to make every word "the same dull note" without pattern, and ultimately becomes the throat for Vey. Shapes stakes (can Ilen control resonance before the diamond's hunger wins?) and tactics (timing whispers, diamond placement, scraping bone). Present in setup (slit in rock between towers, described paragraph two), development (roughness-word experiment, silk/grit timing, unpatterned-repeat threat), and payoff (walls answer with new voice, travelers hear canyon translate). Remove the tunnel and no action remains—it is both setting and mechanism. Causal pressure, closure charge, and irreplaceability all maximal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" constrains on-page action: Ilen "never raised his voice, because the canyon returned every shout as a thousand mangled copies." This trait enables his method (control through restraint) and creates visible tradeoff—he must use whisper-level volume and precise timing rather than forceful projection. The attribute appears in setup (paragraph one), informs middle experiments (whispered words for roughness, silk, grit), and charges the final solo attempt (breathing aligned to spiral, words "shaped by the birds' geometry"). Cost is implicit: the discipline required when desperation might tempt louder, faster efforts. Tradeoff is visible but could be sharpened with one moment where Ilen nearly shouts and pulls back.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Harness" defines the central conflict: Ilen must harness the diamond's hunger (otherwise it "would swallow the language faster than death could") and harness the canyon's echoing chambers. Two major turns trace directly to this action: discovering that bird-flight patterns can "harness [the diamond's hunger] into resonance instead of erasure," and the final night when he uses his fingers and breath to harness unpatterned repeats into "clear strands." The word recurs with escalating stakes: first as intention ("if he learned to harness"), then as method (bird-led rhythm), finally as successful completion (structured chorus). Remove this verb's specific meaning and the plot dissolves into generic "use" or "control." Swappability test fails—"harness" implies yoking volatile force, not mere operation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bird-flight patterns supply the mechanics for controlling resonance: "when the flock tightened, he spoke the word for silk, and when it scattered, he spoke the word for grit." Signaled early (Ilen watches swifts crossing between towers, recorded patterns on hide strips) and used in two escalating beats: daily sessions with speakers and the crisis night when "a late flock finally rose...and their wings drew a slow spiral, the old Vey sign for return." The method's absence (night when swifts did not fly) creates the story's peak danger—unpatterned repeats threaten uniformity—proving necessity. Ilen aligns breathing to the spiral, letting geometry shape words until cacophony separates. Mechanics matter: the patterns are verbs describing curve, stutter, braid, providing temporal measures. Early setup, development constraint, and payoff presence all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon pressure every choice: the canyon's echoing property forces quiet speech, wind funneling through ribs of stone provides resonance chamber, and the tunnel's crack holds the diamond. The setting supplies resources (bone floor to scrape, wall to press diamond against) and creates obstacles (threat of mangled copies, unpatterned repeats). Setup immediate (paragraph one), developed across all middle beats (tunnel placement, wall harmonics, bone-floor scraping), and charged at closure (walls answer with new voice, travelers brush rock). Spatial choreography is precise: "between two of the bone towers lay a slit," "Ilen placed the diamond on Toma's palm," "set the flawed diamond in a crack." Remove this exact setting and the translation mechanism fails—no generic "cave" or "valley" could replicate the resonance properties and bone-as-instrument use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Timeframe creates pressure throughout: elders' consonants soften "each season," Toma reaches the moment he "could no longer name the difference," daily sessions occur before throats fail entirely, and Toma's death night forces solo improvisation. The clock tightens tactics—Ilen cannot wait for perfect conditions or conduct leisurely experiments. Setup clear ("across the death of a language"), development visible ("day after day he brought speakers"), and payoff explicit ("when no living person could speak Vey from birth"). The temporal span (years) is tracked with causal specificity: progression from fluent speakers to failed throats to post-death travelers. Cost is legible: each passing season erases more phonetic detail, forcing Ilen to work faster and take risks (using the cursed diamond, entering alone). One phrase could sharpen urgency: how many speakers remain between Toma's first session and his death?</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilen's desire to "translate texture into sound" drives all on-page action: asking Toma to stroke the diamond's edge, matching rasp to word for roughness, letting speakers rub stone/bone/hide/water while Vey names what they feel, and scraping bone until vibrations match memory. Friction between want and cost is dramatized: the diamond's hunger threatens to erase faster than death, requiring discipline (bird-pattern timing) and physical risk (solo night when flock is late). Setup in paragraph one ("his one obsession"), developed through escalating experiments, and achieved at closure (canyon translates touch into sound for post-Vey travelers). Internal conflict implicit: preserving texture risks losing the speakers' living voices if he prioritizes archive over companionship. Choice cost visible: years spent in canyon, solitary final night, and transformation into legend rather than person.</comment>
