<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ione's motivations are clear—lore keeper curiosity with a childlike hope—and the choice at the throne to bring witnesses rather than claim power feels earned. However, the internal contradiction between "adventurous" and "cautious with facts" is stated but never dramatized in a difficult choice where these impulses collide. The refusal to take the crown reads as predetermined virtue rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost; we never see her tempted or struggling. Embodiment is present in moments like the ruby warming in her palm, but peak emotional beats rely on summary ("her adventure had never been about owning") rather than enacted conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear spatial progression: Archive → perimeter → waterfall → orchard → chamber. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ione refuses the throne and instead installs the community record, foreclosing personal power. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than viscerally felt—she "carries no crown" but we don't see what she's given up or what returning to the city without power will mean. The linked discoveries (log → waterfall → mural → gate → chamber) create meaningful accumulation, but the final reversal (descent not ascent, circle not monarch) lands more as thematic cleverness than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, bioluminescent orchard, and painted pavilion are vivid and selective. The ruby flake as tool meaningfully shapes two beats: unlocking the gate disguise and revealing the murals. Spatial choreography through the grotto and chamber is coherent, and the setting detail—"static from a radio tuned between stations," "leaves edged with bioluminescent veins"—filters through the lore keeper's sensibility. The descent into the chamber and the "dark glass" steps modulate atmosphere at the turn, supporting rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: find the stairway before sunrise. The clock is present ("until sunrise," "dawn pressed pale light") but never tightens a decision or creates a close call. Ione encounters obstacles (waterfall, gate disguise) that she solves via tools (badge, ruby flake) without trade-offs or cost. The throne's question ("name your lineage") could be a pressure point, but her answer is immediate and uncomplicated—no want vs. fear friction, no visible price for renunciation. The escalation reads as spatial accumulation (deeper into the mystery) rather than narrowing options or raising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the particulars: collective memory over individual power, the distinction between owning and remembering. The ruby flake and painted murals work as recurring images that reweight at the end, and the voice recording's question becomes the hinge. The final line—"the story she would tell had finally found its heir"—reframes the quest as an act of transmission rather than possession. However, the mural showing "a circle of citizens climbing together" is a bit on-the-nose, and the phrase "I am the one who remembers, and I bring witnesses" edges toward thematic statement. Still, the conceptual repricing (ascension = approach, not height) is earned and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: "the hiss of a cassette and the click of a mechanical lock," "like static from a radio tuned between stations." Diction reflects the lore keeper's lexicon (archaic clearance, dynasty, orchard mapped by old records). Some phrases slip into elevated register under no particular stress—"sallied into the night," "the method when she saw the peeling edges"—but remain legible. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she trusted") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue is present to judge. The final line's rhythm ("the story she would tell had finally found its heir") modulates effectively for closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. A few constructions carry template cadence: "The throne had been empty for a century, ever since the dynasty's ships burned and their succession map vanished. Older records hinted that a stairway of ascension still stood..." chains exposition without scene pressure. "She was wisely adventurous, cautious with facts yet hungry for the edge where history became path" tells rather than shows the trait in action. Figurative language is mostly controlled ("ruby flake warmed," "dawn pressed pale light"), though "kaleidoscopic waterfall sounded like static" mixes visual and auditory metaphors. No paraphrase loops or significant scaffold. Propulsion is steady, with one or two beats (the paint-peeling sequence) that could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inversion—"ascension in the old tongue meant approach, not height"—and the refusal to claim the throne offer a fresh angle on quest-for-lost-throne templates. The futuristic nostalgia texture (cassettes, electric skiff, neon, bioluminescent trees) synthesizes archaic and high-tech specificity. However, the emotional arc is linear and predictable: Ione never wavers from her collectivist ethos, and the murals conveniently spell out the moral ("a circle of citizens climbing together"). The piece commits fully to its premise but retreats from risk at the throne scene, where a more ambiguous temptation could have deepened the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening and drives all major beats: chooses to leave the Archive, navigates the perimeter, decodes the murals, opens the gate, and refuses the throne. The refusal is the story's pivot, though it lacks dramatized internal conflict. Ione's role as lore keeper frames the final answer ("I am the one who remembers") and the closure image (bringing witnesses). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the decision feels predetermined rather than earned through visible cost, capping the score in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Appears early (velvet box, first scene) and returns in three distinct beats: warms in her palm, unlocks the mural pigments, and slots into the throne socket. Each use is functional and specific—revealing hidden information, activating disguised systems—and the flake's presence in the chamber ties the Archive discovery to the final act. The object's final use (enabling the murals to replay and unlocking the route back) participates in closure, though the emotional charge of the moment belongs more to Ione's spoken answer than to the flake itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is the story's destination and frames the dominant stake. It appears in the tag line (first scene), the hidden mural, and the chamber climax. The throne's interface poses the lineage question, creating the story's conceptual turn. However, the throne itself is passive—a seat with a waiting console—and Ione's refusal to claim it is thematic rather than causal. The concept shapes the quest's direction but does not constrain tactics or create friction; removing it would require a different destination, but the emotional arc (collective memory over individual claim) could transfer to another setup.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous, cautious with facts yet hungry for the edge where history became path" is stated in paragraph one but never tested. Ione proceeds methodically without visible tension between caution and hunger—she simply solves each puzzle in sequence. The label does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it's a character tag rather than a dramatized trait. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sallied into the night" marks the inciting action (leaving the Archive) and initiates the spatial progression. The verb's archaic flavor ("sally") matches the futuristic-nostalgia tone and Ione's lore keeper idiom. However, the action itself is not irreplaceable—"set out," "departed," or "ventured" could substitute with minimal adjustment. The sally launches the quest but does not redefine options or return with reweighted meaning. One key turn, clean setup, but mid-range on specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled ("the log had said the map was not written but buried") and occupies a full beat: Ione kneels, peels layers of paint, and the ruby flake activates the pigments to reveal the mural. The mechanics matter—each layer teaches history, and the lowest mural points to the gate. The method is specific, irreplaceable (no other discovery technique would yield the layered narrative), and enables the next turn (finding the gate). Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, with closure linkage (the murals replay in the chamber). Just shy of 8+ because the method does not return with reweighted cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present by early second third (after the waterfall crossing) and supplies the pavilion with murals, the hidden gate, and spatial coherence. The orchard's bioluminescent trees and careful rows create atmospheric texture, and the gate "hidden among the fruit trees" constrains Ione's search (she counts trunks, listens for echo). The setting enables two beats (mural discovery, gate access) and participates in closure (she emerges into the orchard at sunrise). However, the orchard does not impose a resource limit or tactical cost; it's a puzzle space rather than a pressure chamber. Solid integration across beats but mid-band on cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sunrise is mentioned in the warning ("seek it only until sunrise"), the motivation line ("before the sun returned"), and the closure image ("emerged into the orchard at sunrise"). The clock is present but never tightens a choice—Ione proceeds methodically, and we never see her rushing, sacrificing accuracy for speed, or fearing she'll run out of time. The timeframe is a frame rather than a constraint. Lyric reprise (setup and payoff) without mid-story pressure, fitting the 5–6 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("to find the stairway of ascension before the sun returned") and drives the spatial quest through all beats. The motivation is clear and goal-directed, and Ione's actions align with it. However, the desire is never conflicted—she pursues it without hesitation, cost, or competing want. At the throne, her refusal to claim power feels like fulfillment of the lore keeper role rather than friction between finding and owning. The motivation shapes beats and closure but lacks dramatized internal friction, capping it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is consistent and coherent throughout: cassettes and mechanical locks against memory clouds, electric skiff on forgotten service roads, bioluminescent leaves "remembering older lanterns," consoles "shaped like antique altars." The tone modulates subtly—warmer in the Archive and orchard, cooler and more liminal at the waterfall and chamber—without breaking. The final image ("the story she would tell had finally found its heir") charges the tone with the piece's central theme (preservation as transmission). Strong texture and closure linkage, reaching the 7–8 band.</comment>
