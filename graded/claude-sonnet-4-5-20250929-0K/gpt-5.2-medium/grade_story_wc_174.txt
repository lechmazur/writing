<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority demonstrates internal conflict between artistic ambition and ethical boundaries, and his micro-choices (walking out, carving questions onto the stick, offering it to Mara) reveal values under pressure. The arc from "uncommonly serene" detachment to "serenity...earned" shows alteration with cost, though the epiphany feels somewhat delivered rather than discovered through visceral struggle. Mara remains a prompt-figure whose resistance is told more than dramatized through her own contradictory impulses. The contract-on-napkin beat reads slightly too tidy as closure, though the cost of forfeiting absolute creative control is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal agency braided with accumulative imagery) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors quickly (Ilya, gallery exit, radar dome journey). The reversal structure—from serene detachment to ethical accountability—narrows options through the puppet performance, Mara's appearance, and the napkin contract, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he forecloses unfettered appropriation). Cost is visible in the contract's terms and the final shared-authority performance. One substantive tightening occurs when Mara's veto demand crystallizes the line he "kept smudging," foreclosing his former practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as both literal setting and symbolic constraint: its "meteor hush" acoustics mirror Ilya's need to strip noise from his practice, and the storage closet housing the stolen stick makes the space complicit in his moral inventory. The seedy bar's spilled-gin specificity and basement lighting ground the puppet show, and the dome's curved walls serve the final shadow-projection performance. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (gallery exit, dome interior, bar basement, return to dome). The dome's decommissioned surveillance past subtly charges the theme of ethical listening without becoming allegory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Ilya reconcile artistic freedom with consent—is signaled in the opening accusation and tested through the reversed puppet narrative, which makes harm visible by inverting causality. Pressure escalates when the audience's laughter turns to "quiet that felt like the radar dome," then again when Mara appears and her veto demand forces a concrete trade-off. The napkin contract forecloses his former method with visible cost (shared proceeds, subject veto). Agency drives each turn: his choice to reverse the alphabet, to start the thief story at the gallows, to offer Mara the stick as microphone. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling and the violence of appropriation—emerges through the reversed alphabets, the thief-unstoling, and the carved questions ("Who profits, who is harmed, who is heard") without thesis statements until the final participatory performance, which dramatizes collective consent rather than declaring it. The story stick's theft returns as dramatic irony that earns the contract beat. The final image of the stick passing hand to hand, each person adding "a truth and a boundary," offers a resonant answer to the opening accusation: stories become ethical when subjects co-author closure. The "meteor hush" recurs to frame listening as active discipline. Minor slip: "the only ending worth writing was one everyone could consent to" edges toward moralizing, though it's filtered through Ilya's earned stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; Ilya's perceptual signature (calligrapher's eye for flourish-to-bone, hearing what "ink had been hiding") is character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Mara's "You reversed the story" and her veto request carry subtext and advance the ethical negotiation. The prose modulates from reflective ("silence let him hear") to concrete action (carving, performing) without filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. One minor register drift: "a seedy bars where he performed through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" contains a repetition artifact and awkward phrasing ("through...shows") that momentarily blurs clarity, though voice recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high across most beats (the dome's dual function, the stick's theft-memory, the reversed thief arc). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes. However, several artifacts cluster: "seedy bars...in seedy bars" is a clear repetition loop; "the circuit of seedy bars where he performed through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is syntactically awkward with redundant mention. The phrase "deliberately began to reverse them, drawing each letter from flourish back to bone" reads as slightly over-written for a high-pressure beat. The closure image (stick passing, shadows projected) is vivid and propulsive, so non-closure artifacts are capped at −0.8 per guidance, but the loops touch a key setup beat (puppet-show introduction), raising the penalty slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reversal method—walking plot backward to make harm visible—is a fresh synthesis of the prompt's "reverse" action and the ethical-storytelling concept, avoiding derivative templates. The campfire story stick as stolen prop-turned-ethical-tool is a non-obvious particularity. The radar dome as decommissioned listener inverts surveillance into introspection without allegory. Risk is present: structuring a puppet show that starts at the gallows and unwinds to the first coin, performed for a heckling bar crowd, heightens stakes through unconventional narrative grammar. The napkin contract avoids sentimentality by listing concrete terms (veto, proceeds-sharing). The piece synthesizes tropes (artist's redemption, found object, mentor-challenger) through grounded choice and world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilya's choices create the story's turns: walking out (setup), reversing alphabets, carving questions onto the stick, performing the backward thief tale, offering Mara the stick, writing the napkin contract, staging the final participatory performance. His decisions narrow options (forecloses unfettered appropriation) and drive escalation under pressure. Present early, involved in at least four distinct beats, and central to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The campfire story stick is handled in the dome storage-closet beat, carved with new questions, used as the puppet-show control rod, offered to Mara as microphone, and passed hand to hand in the final performance—at least five beats with evolving function. Its theft returns with guilt-friction, it constrains the puppet mechanics, and its final use reweights consent from individual to collective. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" shapes the dome scene where Ilya sees "half-lit epiphanies in the dim dome light: every time he had edited a friend's pain for pacing, he had erased consent." This realization alters his tactics (carving questions, reversing the puppet narrative). It recurs implicitly in the final performance's co-authored truths. Present by first third, changes options, and charges closure, though the concept reads slightly more as thematic flavor than a persistent mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is established in the opening ("uncommonly serene, not because he agreed") and contrasts with his snap at Mara, creating a tension that drives his retreat to the dome. The trait constrains his response to accusation—detachment lets him hear rather than defend—and reappears transformed in the closure: "serenity...earned." It enables the reflective beats and trades unexamined calm for conscious choice. Early signal, one key turn, closure reprise with reweighted meaning, though the cost tied specifically to serenity is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reverse" is the story's structural spine: Ilya reverses ornate alphabets to bone, reverses the puppet plot from gallows to first theft, and the reversed arc makes harm visible, prompting the audience's transformative quiet and Mara's engagement. Removing reversal collapses the ethical mechanism and the closure's participatory turn. Present by midpoint, drives two major beats (alphabet reversal, puppet performance), causally essential to closure, and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The puppet shows are signaled in the first third ("his other stage, the circuit of seedy bars...subversive puppet shows"), executed on-page in the basement bar performance, and provide the mechanism for testing the carved questions. The reversed thief narrative using the story stick as control rod is the method in action. The shows' subversive reputation draws Mara, advancing escalation. Setup, development (on-page performance), and payoff (Mara's response) are present, with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The radar dome appears early (first third), houses the stolen stick and Ilya's ethical inventory, its acoustics ("meteor hush") frame the introspective work, and it becomes the venue for the final participatory performance with shadows on curved walls. The dome's decommissioned-listener past subtly mirrors Ilya's shift from taking to listening. It constrains (storage closet, echo chamber) and enables (projection surface, ring seating). Early signal, involved in three beats, shapes tactics, and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" establishes the immediate aftermath as temporal frame and is echoed when the bar audience's laughter turns to "quiet that felt like the radar dome" and "static before rain" hovers between Ilya and Mara. The hush primes listening as tactic. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with urgency or a live clock; weeks pass between scenes without pressure. Present, thematically integrated, but does not constrain pacing or force rushed choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to explore ethical storytelling" is dramatized through Ilya's retreat to the dome, his alphabet-reversal experiment, the puppet performance that tests public reception, and the napkin contract that codifies boundaries. Friction arises between his want (artistic control, applause) and the cost (veto power, shared proceeds, borrowing permission). The motivation drives at least four beats, shapes the escalation, and governs closure. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is established in the dome's acoustic signature, recurs when the bar audience falls quiet, and frames the final performance's ring of participants. The tone is coherent—contemplative, acoustic, stripped—and modulates with pressure (from introspection to public test to collective ritual). It charges the final image by making listening a felt discipline. The tone is present across beats and integral to closure, though "meteor" as modifier adds more lyric texture than mechanical constraint.</comment>
