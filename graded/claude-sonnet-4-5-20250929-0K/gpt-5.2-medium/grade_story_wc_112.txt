<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's character is rendered through micro-choices under pressure: she moves from obliging compliance to active problem-solving when she recognizes the rotor threat. Her gloved warmth is embodied ("threaded with microheaters") and her stance shift from mechanic-to-caretaker is earned by the immediate stakes. Sen's motivations are clear but remain secondary, appropriate at this length. Interiority is concrete and avoids therapy-speak, though Mara's final assertion about "responsibility" edges toward stating theme rather than demonstrating it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens—causal linkage (nexus activation → rotor vision → repair) braided with accumulative texture (recurring images of warmth, breath, wings). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (station, Mara, Sen, lab). Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nexus is reset to neutral, time resumes forward, and the "sideways secrets" line charges the final image with conceptual cost. The cost is felt (Mara's intervention forecloses further experimentation) but remains somewhat oblique; a sharper on-page constraint or visible sacrifice would tighten the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The station setting is vivid and selective: frost-filmed dome, radiator grids, ventilation echo. The rotor on the roof becomes micro-setting that constrains Mara's choice and charges the climax. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (grease fluidity, magnetic gooseflesh), though the hologram mechanics receive more exposition than tactile grounding. Spatial choreography is coherent across lab and roof, and the gliders' caged presence pressures the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing rotor failure and glider panic—emerges clearly by midpoint and tightens when Mara sees the vision of the cracked blade. The lever pull initiates escalation, and Mara's roof repair enacts agency with visible cost (choosing a stable past, foreclosing Sen's data-gathering). The conflict between Sen's theoretical ambition and Mara's practical caretaking is legible and resolved through Mara's decisive action. One meaningful pressure point drives the turn, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "sideways time" conceit interrogated by pragmatic repair: the piece asks whether prediction serves knowledge or safety. The final image—"time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The gloves and rotor serve as recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. However, Mara's line "sideways time was not a highway to prediction but a toolbox, and tools required responsibility" edges into explicit thematic statement rather than letting the action speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; psychic distance remains close to Mara's perceptual signature (mechanic's attention to grease, bolts, magnetic tug). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression ("a lung holding its breath," "geometry drawn through holographic principles"). Sen's dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Mara's internal voice balances technical specificity with lyric rhythm. No head-hopping, and the final beat's reflective turn remains anchored in Mara's stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, pressure, or atmosphere. The opening's "hush of beating wings at rest" and "lung holding its breath" establish texture without stalling momentum. However, the middle beat contains mild filter-verb stacks ("watched," "felt," "heard") and the phrase "subdued awakening without opening eyes" borders on oxymoron without sufficient grounding. No paraphrase loops, and the final line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-as-geometry, xenobiology, and mechanic-as-protagonist offers a fresh angle on "repair as metaphysics." The holographic repair—choosing a stable past—is specific and non-obvious, and the "sideways" conceit avoids stock time-travel tropes. However, the core premise (scientist needs mechanic's practical wisdom) is familiar, and the piece does not fully subvert or deepen it through contradictory character impulses. The ending's conceptual move is elegant but not wholly surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara the obliging sky mechanic drives two beats: accepting Sen's request (lever pull) and prioritizing station safety (rotor repair). Her obliging nature is signaled early ("never asked why"), tested when she pulls the lever despite risk, and transformed when she asserts "tools required responsibility." Her choices create the key turn and foreclosure at closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in setup (on the table), development (lever pull activates it), and payoff (reset to neutral at closure). It constrains Mara's tactics (the vision it generates drives her to the roof) and its state change marks the resolution. The nexus is handled across three beats with evolving function and charged reprise. Irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Subdued awakenings appear twice: the gliders' synchronized sigh when the lever is pulled, and their gentle stir when Mara repairs the rotor. The concept shapes stakes (panic flight must be avoided) and signals theme (the station "revised its own memory"). Present in setup and payoff but not directly constraining mid-scene choices; more thematic echo than tactical driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mechanically warm gloves are signaled early ("microheaters that kept grease fluid and her fingers steady") and reprised when Sen reflects on "circuits, not sentiment." The attribute enables Mara's repair work but does not constrain a specific choice or cost on the page. The warm/cold contrast charges tone but remains largely metaphorical rather than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lever pull is the inciting action: Mara pulls it, the nexus activates, the vision appears, and her subsequent roof repair follows causally. The lever is signaled, dramatized, and its reset at closure marks the resolution. Removing the lever would collapse the story's logic. Major turn traces directly to this action; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Holographic principles are signaled early ("hologram bloom over the ring, maps of field lines") and return when Mara uses a portable projector to overlay "possible pasts" on the rotor. The method enables the repair and links Sen's science to Mara's toolkit. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; deeper grounding in how the projection constrains the bolt would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station frames every beat: the caged gliders supply immediate threat (panic flight if freed), the roof and wind rigs provide the repair location, and the ventilation echoes biological rhythm. The setting pressures Mara's choices and supplies the rotor as a tactical problem. Micro-setting (gloves, projector, rotor) alters tactics. Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "within the hush of beating wings at rest" establishes tone and metaphor but does not function as a live clock. The narrative unfolds in one continuous sequence without time pressure altering Mara's tactics. The phrase seeds the final image ("time resumed forward motion") but remains more poetic anchor than escalatory constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sen's motivation to prove sideways time is stated and drives the lever pull, but Mara's counter-motivation (station safety) takes narrative priority by midpoint. The conflict between proof and pragmatism is dramatized when Mara interrupts Sen's experiment. Sen's desire shapes the inciting beat but is not tested through internal contradiction or visible sacrifice; it functions more as setup for Mara's arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Icy warmth is woven throughout: frost and radiator grids, cold tea and mechanically warm gloves, Sen's voice "tender and sharp," the final "quiet that followed." Tone modulates with pressure—softer spectrum when the nexus hums, tight focus during the roof repair—and charges the closure image where warmth and secrets coexist. Coherent and purposeful across beats.</comment>
