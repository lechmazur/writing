<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is concrete and embodied through her lantern-lighting role and the loss of her father's recognition. Her choice to defy the council by exhuming the jars shows agency under pressure, with the wildflowers serving as a tangible anchor for memory. Internal conflict between mercy (the council's story) and grief (her lived experience) drives the escalation. Minor slip: the parasite's mechanics and Lysa's sudden grasp of the council's bargain feel slightly under-motivated in the moment of discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain: whale → parasite → memory deletion → pocket gravity → saltworks archive → release ritual → closure. Orientation anchors promptly (Lysa, harbor, post-whale). The ending delivers a Decisive Change—memories returned, parasite pacified, father recognizes Lysa—with visible cost (the town must now carry "lived-in sorrow"). The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture (coffee grounds, wildflowers). One friction: the council's collection motive and the parasite's appetite are told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the middle causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The saltworks chamber is vivid and functional: glittering walls swallow sound, tools float, gravity shifts as Lysa opens the drain. The harbor's "gleaming silence" and the whale carcass anchor the timeframe and atmosphere. Coffee grounds and wildflowers serve as micro-settings that constrain choices. Minor gap: the pier and net shed receive less spatial grounding than the saltworks, and the beach ritual at the end lacks concrete choreography detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memories—signals early and tightens through the coffee-ground reading, the saltworks infiltration, and the choice to break the council's seal. The exhumation narrows options (defying the story of mercy) and the beach ritual delivers visible cost: the parasite stirs, pockets snap shut, ordinary grief returns. One pressure gap: the council's potential opposition is declared but never dramatizes resistance, leaving the escalation slightly unopposed in the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief as both poison and proof of love, mercy as erasure versus sorrow as lived truth. The wildflowers shift from keepsake to archive key to persistent proof at closure. The final image—"silence gleamed with lived-in sorrow"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The parasite and pockets of gravity function as embodied metaphor rather than allegory. No lapses into theme statement or false symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person present anchors Lysa's perceptual signature: lantern-tender diction, maritime vocabulary, and a poetic register that fits her mother's gift of pressed flowers. Distance remains stable. Two frictions: "Old Maru taught me to read answers through patterns in coffee grounds" briefly shifts to past exposition without anchoring cue, and the phrase "the story of mercy" recurs as a thematic label rather than dramatized perception. Otherwise voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; vivid images ("crystals rose like glass cities," "silence shone so hard it felt like a blade") carry density. Two artifact clusters lower the score: synonym loops ("deleted," "release," "exhume" cycle without adding pressure), and the phrase "the pull fluctuates mysteriously" repeats verbatim from Maru's teaching into narration without fresh context. The closure beat remains clean. Proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—deep-sea parasite feeding on grief, council monetizing sorrow via salt archive, pockets of gravity as physical memory wells—feels specific and non-obvious. The lantern-lighter POV and coffee-ground divination add fresh texture. Risk: using a whale beaching as inciting incident and "memories stored in objects" leans toward familiar templates, but the saltworks chamber and the choice to return grief (rather than destroy the parasite) offer a meaningful turn on the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's role as lantern lighter appears early, recurs in her nightly rounds and the midnight witness moment, and her ability to "keep the dock lamps steady in storms" earns the foreman's trust—enabling saltworks access. The profession directly shapes two key beats (foreman's permission, lantern flame bowing at the beach) and charges the final image when her father sees her lighting his door lantern. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers seed early (mother's last gift), reappear in the coffee-ground vision ("a mark like a pressed wildflower"), unlock a memory flare when touched, become the storage medium in the jars (one pale flower per memory), crumble to release scent and voice at the climax, and persist "without vanishing" at closure. Three distinct beats plus closure reweighting; high irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity introduced early via Maru's teaching, constrain Lysa's lantern flame and boots, drive her to tie herself to a pipe before descending, shape the archive's existence (what pockets catch), and close with "a pocket of gravity snapped shut" as memories are returned. The concept governs world logic, escalation tactics, and the resolution mechanism. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" appears in Maru's exposition and echoes in "the pull fluctuates mysteriously from street to street." The fluctuation justifies Lysa's precaution (tying her waist) and the pockets' widening threat, but the attribute itself remains abstract—never dramatized as a visible consequence or tradeoff in a peak beat. Functional, contributes to escalation, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exhume seeds in the title "what the sea and the brain release," recurs as Lysa's explicit goal ("what I had to exhume next"), drives the midnight breach of the saltworks seal (literal exhumation of jars), and the climactic beach act ("we returned the stolen grief"). The action redefines the conflict from retrieval to restoration and is irreplaceable—no synonym would carry the burial/resurrection resonance that charges theme and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coffee-ground reading taught by Maru appears early, Lysa brews and reads grounds twice (spiral sinking to saltworks; chain of dots to whale), and the method provides the map for both infiltration and release. It shapes two attempts and bridges setup to climax. Moderate irreplaceability—divination could be done via other means—but the specificity (grounds as "dark maps") integrates well with the salt/archive imagery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is introduced at the one-third mark, supplies the drain/archive location, demonstrates pocket-gravity effects (floating tools, sound absorption, hair lifting), and forces Lysa's rope precaution. Its "glittering walls" and clean air contrast with the rotting whale, underscoring the council's sanitized storage. The setting enables the discovery, constrains action, and charges the middle turn. Strong across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whale's arrival frames the inciting condition (rot draws forgetfulness, parasite introduction), and "after the whale beaches" anchors the timeframe in the opening line. The beaching recurs at closure when "the whale sank into ordinary weight." However, the time element functions more as static backdrop than live pressure—no ticking clock tightens Lysa's choices. Functional frame, but the timeframe itself does not escalate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa's desire "to find where deleted memories go" is declared early, dramatized through her father's empty eyes ("already made me a rebel"), tested when she chips the mortar (defying mercy), and fulfilled when she breaks the jar seal and hears her mother's voice. The motivation costs her safety, drives every major beat, and lands at closure when her father speaks her name. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" introduced in the second sentence ("quiet in a way that sounds like light"), recurs in the saltworks ("silence shone so hard it felt like a blade"), and reweights at closure ("the silence gleamed with lived-in sorrow"). The tone modulates from eerie sanitization to charged grief, supporting pressure and theme. Strong lyric coherence and closure charge; the phrase itself is specific and irreplaceable within the story's idiom.</comment>
