<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's agency at closure (walking in with shell, exposing Vaughn) is motivated by prior adaptive training and fear-as-compass realization. However, the transformation moment—"betrayal became transformative…because I finally saw my fear as a compass"—leans toward diagnostic epiphany without sufficient embodied cost in that beat. The boy's cast-decryption sequence shows micro-choices under pressure, but Mara's interior voice occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power") that weakens character-particular texture. Internal contradiction (fear vs. certainty) operates across beats but the final confrontation reads more declarative than contradictory in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change: Mara walks in trembling, exposes Vaughn via shell recording, signs her real name, and steps into a future she authors. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative accents (shell motif, fear-as-compass realization). Orientation anchors (stunt double, props vault, library, soundstage) arrive promptly. One meaningful tightening: the cipher message narrows options to a specific location/time, forcing the confrontation. Cost is visible (Mara's tears, vulnerability on display) but the crew's instant turn on Vaughn deflates stakes slightly—no tactical struggle, no price for recruitment. The shell's "recorded confession he thought erased" introduces a mild convenience (how did old takes stitch into a usable confession?) that isn't fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Settings—studio mirrors, props vault, rusted library, soundstage—are vivid and purposeful. The library's "iron shelves bled orange dust," "moths skated through moonlight like shredded film" charge atmosphere without stalling momentum. Micro-setting qualifies: the boy's cast and charcoal rubbing constrain the decryption method, directly affecting tactics. Spatial choreography across four locations (studio, vault, library, soundstage) remains legible. The shell as recurring object charges the final image when its whisper fills the microphone. Minor: the "backlot" and "call sheets" anchor occupation, but the rusted catalog cards' production codes feel slightly decorative—used once without prior grounding in studio systems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: survive Vaughn's erasure and reclaim identity. One meaningful tightening: the cipher resolves into location/time, forcing the confrontation. Agency drives escalation—Mara flees, decrypts, recruits the boy, and confronts Vaughn with evidence. Visible cost: she lets the boy see her tears, accepts vulnerability. However, the crew's immediate turn on Vaughn after hearing the shell dilutes pressure—no negotiation, no risk of disbelief, no tactical struggle. The shell's "recorded confession" feels convenient (Vaughn's own voice stitched from old takes?) without sufficient groundwork; if it were dramatized as fragile or ambiguous, the cost would sharpen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power—emerges through Mara's arc: adaptive training hides shaking, then tears become evidence at closure. The shell motif reweights across beats (broken prop → salt voice → confession vessel). The final image (signing real name, taking child's hand, authoring future) offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "the certainty that trembled in my chest said the only way to survive was to prove that vulnerability is power" states theme overtly mid-story, reducing subtext. The boy's smudged notes and Mara's charcoal rubbing interweave method and meaning without false complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, first-person narration maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: adaptive training, fear-driven selectivity, "salt voice," "erasers." Diction stays character-particular ("Moths skated through moonlight like shredded film"). The boy's dialogue—"Vaughn had broken his arm…wiped them so no adult could read"—carries goal and subtext efficiently. Minor register drift: "the betrayal became transformative in that moment" and "authored" at closure edge toward elevated abstraction outside Mara's established idiom. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (charcoal rubbing, soundstage confrontation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (long opening sentence, shorter beats at cipher resolution). Minor loop: "adaptive training" appears three times without functional variation. Template cadence in adjacent sentences: "I fled…I was searching…I matched…" stems cluster mid-story. The final paragraph risks overwriting: "trembling and certain," "products," "turned on him," "authored" stack conceptual weight without concrete anchoring action. Figurative language is controlled ("moths skated," "iron shelves bled") but "erasers" as metaphor for Vaughn's agents feels slightly abstract. No paraphrase loops; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—stunt double with phobias, identity theft via face reconstruction, child's cast as cipher key—feels specific and non-obvious. The charcoal rubbing (gravestone technique applied to cast) is a fresh, grounded method. The shell's dual function (prop memento → confession vessel) transforms a trope through specificity. Risk-taking: the gothic library setting and "whispering shell" could tip into genre pastiche but remain anchored by Mara's adaptive training and the boy's smudged notes. Minor: the "dead actress's face rebuilt on mine through contracts I never signed" premise echoes identity-theft thrillers; transformation arises from the phobia-vulnerability arc and the cast-cipher method rather than the core betrayal setup alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (phobia-ridden stunt double) is present throughout, drives the vault discovery, library decryption, and soundstage confrontation. Her phobias (heights, fire, applause) are stated early but only fear—reinterpreted as compass—shapes the closure choice (letting boy see tears, walking in trembling). The "firmly adaptive" trait enables tactics across three beats (hiding shaking, decryption, confrontation). Swappability: another identity-theft victim could execute similar moves; the phobias themselves don't constrain on-page choices as distinctly as intended. Present in closure (signs real name, takes boy's hand) with visible cost (vulnerability on display).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seashell half appears in four beats: pocket (early), whispers warning of Vaughn, "Listen to the hurt" cue during decryption, and held to microphone at closure to broadcast confession. It enables the confrontation and charges the final image. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weaker (the "salt voice spoke in fragments of my lost life" moment advances mood more than tactics). Causal pressure: the shell's recorded confession resolves the conflict, but its mechanics—"stitched from old takes and my own buried memories"—are asserted late without prior grounding in how a prop could store/play audio. Irreplaceability: moderate; another recording device could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is the premise: actress died, face rebuilt on Mara, contracts never signed. It sets the stake (survive erasure, reclaim identity) and Mara's discovery in the vault incites flight. The "betrayal became transformative…because I finally saw my fear as a compass" articulates the concept explicitly at the library climax, shifting tactics. Present in closure subtext (signing real name = reclaiming identity post-betrayal). However, the betrayal itself is backstory; the on-page action centers on decryption and confrontation rather than the transformation process. The concept shapes frame more than beat-by-beat choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is labeled early ("I stayed employed only because I was firmly adaptive, learning new ways to hide my shaking in plain sight") and invoked at the decryption beat ("my adaptive training took over as I began to outwit Vaughn"). It enables the charcoal rubbing tactic and shapes Mara's approach at closure (walking in trembling yet certain). Cost: the trait historically hid vulnerability; at closure, she inverts it by displaying tears—visible tradeoff. Setup and payoff met; middle development is modest (one tactical application). Swappability: "resourceful" or "resilient" could replace with minor edits; "adaptive" specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the action driving the middle and closure: Mara decrypts the cast notes (charcoal rubbing, catalog cross-reference), recruits the boy, and confronts Vaughn with evidence rather than force. Three beats involve outwitting tactics. The decryption sequence is the story's mechanical spine. At closure, the outwit payoff (shell confession + projected notes) turns the crew. Cost: vulnerability must be displayed to succeed. Irreplaceability: high for the middle; moderate at closure (the crew's instant turn dilutes the outwit struggle—no counter-move from Vaughn tests the tactic's fragility).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast is signaled when the boy appears ("white cast covered with smudged notes…wiped them so no adult could read") and executed on-page in detail: charcoal from burnt script, rubbing technique, cipher resolution via catalog cards. The method's mechanics matter (rigging terms, production codes, location/time extraction) and shape the entire middle sequence. Present in closure (boy lifts cast, notes project as subtitles). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; the cast-as-cipher is unique and non-swappable. Minor: the projection mechanism at closure (how do handwritten notes project like subtitles?) is asserted without prior tech setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars (backlot gothic set, iron shelves, moths, cracked roof) is the locus for decryption across multiple beats. It supplies resources (catalog cards with production codes) that directly enable the cipher solution. Atmosphere is vivid and distinct. The library anchors the middle sequence and its abandonment/isolation pressures Mara's choice to trust the boy. Not present in closure (final confrontation is at soundstage). Setup and development gates met; payoff gate missed. Swappability: moderate—another archive or prop room could serve, though the gothic texture and "backlot relic" status add thematic resonance (film-industry metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is the inciting frame: Mara discovers the file in the vault ("the day I unmasked my own file"), triggering the entire sequence. It sets the premise and Mara's flight to the library. The timeframe is stated rather than tracked; no live clock tightens decisions (how much time before Vaughn arrives? when is the soundstage meeting?). Present as emotional frame (identity crisis persists through closure) but doesn't constrain tactics beat-by-beat. Setup met; development and payoff are thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to prove that vulnerability is power" is articulated mid-story ("the certainty that trembled in my chest said the only way to survive was to prove that vulnerability is power") and dramatized at closure: Mara lets the boy see her tears, walks in trembling, and succeeds by being seen rather than hiding. The motivation shapes the final choice with visible cost (exposure, risk of disbelief). However, the phrase itself is told/labeled rather than discovered through action. Friction: earlier, adaptive training hides vulnerability; at closure, she inverts the tactic—tradeoff is clear. Setup is late (second third); development and payoff are strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone "trembling certainty" is signaled early ("the certainty that trembled in my chest") and sustained through diction: "firmly adaptive," "shaking in plain sight," "hands wanted to recoil," "trembling and certain" at closure. The oxymoron charges multiple beats (fear as compass, vulnerability as tactic). Modulation: tone tightens under pressure (library decryption, soundstage walk-in) without flattening into single static mood. Present in the final image (trembling walk, signing real name). Coherence across turns is strong. Minor: repetition of "trembling" and "certain" risks becoming formulaic, but the contradiction remains purposeful and tied to the arc.</comment>
