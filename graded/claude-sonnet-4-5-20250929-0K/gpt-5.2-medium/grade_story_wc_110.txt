<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are consistently rooted in fear and complicity (hiding the lens, watching Eli), and her final gesture of transparency is earned by the accumulated weight of secrecy. Interior states remain embodied—"her own secret weight of the hidden lens pressed her tongue"—though some gestures (the doodles, the split-circle eye) border on symbolic convenience rather than fully organic discovery. Minor slip: Eli and the stagehand's motives are told more than dramatized, reducing friction at the reveal. The choice to sign her name is credible and forecloses her prior evasion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story uses an accumulative/textural lens: Mara's nightly copying of doodles builds pattern and density, and the lens discovery at midpoint reweights the meaning of the tickets, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at closure when she lays out the evidence and signs her name. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: honesty reframes suspicion into shared transparency with conceptual cost (her complicity exposed). Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, context by ~100 words). One weakness: the final reveal that Eli's conspiracy was benign (caption system for deaf children) arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, softening the causal charge of the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "crystal whispering forecourt" opens and closes the story, charging the final image with tactile and acoustic specificity; the forecourt "steamed gently" evokes thaw and matches the thematic shift. The lens as micro-setting object constrains Mara's choices (she hides it, uses it to decode tickets, then reveals it), and the projector room anchors the final explanation. Minor limitation: the conservatory interior (office, hallway, rehearsal room) remains generic; selective detail supports tone but does not pressure choice beyond the lens itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: Mara must decide whether to reveal the lens and risk betraying Eli or remain complicit in mounting mistrust. Her choice to decode the tickets (midpoint) narrows options, and her final act—placing the lens on the counter and signing her ledger—forecloses her prior evasion with visible social cost (exposure of her complicity). The tightening is meaningful under the accumulative lens, though the benign resolution (caption system vs. sabotage) softens the stakes retroactively; the friction was more internal than external, which fits the "resonant hush" frame but limits felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—"secrecy manufactures suspicion" and honesty as thaw—emerges organically from Mara's arc and the image of the lens breaking Eli's reflection into "two ghostly images that could not hide from each other." The final gesture (tickets and lens "laid out like transparently arranged stones") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: the phrase "freed by what was plainly shared" in the closing line edges toward summary rather than letting the image carry the full weight, and the benign reveal (caption system for deaf children) risks sentimental softening of the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is consistent: sensory specificity ("the stones whisper, a sound so soft it seemed borrowed from breath") and perceptual bias (Mara's archival lens) remain character-particular throughout. Minor slips: several run-on sentences in the opening and middle compress causal links in ways that require re-reading ("she did it because mistrust had frozen the building, not in policy but in the way..."), and the phrase "letting the overhead light pass through it so his reflection broke into two ghostly images" borders on constructed symbolism rather than naturalistic perception under pressure. Distance control is otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("crushed crystal," "a window with no curtains"). Persistent template cadence weakens momentum: "she told herself... yet she had begun," "she could have... but her own secret weight," "when Eli arrived... she watched him... saw him... slip it" recur across multiple beats, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loop: "she did it because mistrust had frozen the building... the missing lens... was blamed on sabotage, a rumor that turned every silence into an accusation" restates "mistrust" and "suspicion" across adjacent clauses without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "thaw begin where it always could" and "freed by what was plainly shared" lean generic at closure. Apply −0.8 for cadence and loop artifacts; no closure-beat obscurity but momentum drags mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of silent concerts, cryptic doodles, and a hidden lens offers a fresh synthesis, and the choice to make the conspiracy benign (caption system vs. sabotage) inverts genre expectation in a character-driven way. The world-building (words "become unnecessary") is under-explored and risks feeling decorative; the story would function with only social mistrust and non-verbal communication rituals, reducing the necessity of the premise. The lens-as-magnifier twist and the doodle code are specific and purposeful, but the resolution's sentimentality (deaf children, scholarship, board distrust of inclusion) edges toward safety rather than bold moral complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as night registrar frames her archival habit and access to tickets; her choices—hiding the lens, decoding tickets, confronting Eli, signing her ledger—drive all major turns. Setup early, involved in decoding (middle), and decisive at closure. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lens appears in beat one (hidden), is used at midpoint to decode tickets, held up to break Eli's reflection, and placed on the counter at closure. Its dual function (evidence of complicity, tool of revelation) is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse both the decoding mechanism and the final gesture of transparency. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes Mara's arc from complicit silence to transparent disclosure, with visible cost (exposure of her own theft). The concept is dramatized in her final act (signing her name, laying out evidence) and charges the ending image. Not merely thematic echo; it alters her tactics and forecloses evasion. Could score higher if the middle development showed more friction between honesty and fear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" describes the doodles and their dual-layer meaning (gossip vs. coordination), enabling the midpoint decoding turn. The trait constrains Mara's early choices (she cannot parse the patterns without the lens) and the final reveal hinges on disambiguating the marks. Functional but somewhat ornamental: the phrase itself does not recur with reweighted meaning, and a simpler "cryptic" would serve similar plot function. Present in setup and payoff; mid-development role is implicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eavesdropping on the tickets is Mara's nightly habit, motivates her pattern recognition, and leads directly to the lens discovery and final confrontation. The action is signaled early, repeated across beats, and drives the major turn. Removing it would require a different discovery mechanism. Strong integration, though the act itself is somewhat passive (observation rather than high-cost decision).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The doodles are signaled early (archived stubs, tracing loops), become the decoding mechanism at midpoint (split circle as key), and anchor the final exchange (Mara's window drawing, Eli's eye). The method is specific, irreplaceable (no generic "clue" would work), and shapes Mara's tactics throughout. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forecourt opens and closes the story, providing lyric symmetry ("gleamed like crushed crystal" → "steamed gently"), and the "whispering stones" echo the voiceless concert world. The setting does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its function is primarily atmospheric and symbolic. The reprise reweights the tone (frozen mistrust → thaw) with some cost, reaching mid-band via lyric resonance rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" establishes the story's speculative premise and justifies the doodle communication, but time does not tighten decisions or track causally. The nightly repetition ("each midnight," "two weeks earlier," "third night of the pattern") marks duration but does not create a live clock or deadline. The timeframe is functional but replaceable; the story would work in any low-speech setting. Setup present; middle and closure roles are weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "thaw mistrust" is dramatized through her choice to decode, confront, and finally expose herself. The friction between fear (hiding the lens) and transparency (revealing it) drives her arc with visible cost (signing her name). The motivation is present in setup (archiving for security vs. eavesdropping), tested in the middle (watching Eli), and resolved at closure. Strong integration; could reach higher if the benign reveal did not soften the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is coherent across the piece: the silent concerts, "voiceless grief," cryptic marks, and the final exchange without speech all sustain the tone. The tone modulates subtly (mistrust → exposure → thaw) and charges the final image ("the musicians gathered close, finally freed"). Present throughout with purposeful control, though the phrase "resonant hush" itself risks becoming a mood label rather than enacted silence. Strong tonal integration with minor reliance on summary at closure.</comment>
