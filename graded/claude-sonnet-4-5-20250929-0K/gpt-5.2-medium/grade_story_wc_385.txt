<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her perceptual trait colors choices, but the vast cast (Senn, Jaro, Mael, masked singers, messenger) and rapid character introductions dilute focus. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves efficiently from discovery to confrontation without significant doubt or competing impulses that would test her values under pressure. The ending reunites Senn off-page (he "walks out"), undercutting embodied emotional payoff; the cost of the confrontation is told rather than felt in her body or choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Lira, canyon echo singer, Hollow Canyons). The plot follows a quest structure with clear beats: shell → messenger → journey → nexus → confrontation → restoration. However, causality is thin: Mael's capitulation after one song feels unmotivated, and Senn's physical return is not dramatized—he simply appears in the final sentence. The closure unit (joining the shell halves, revealing the theft mechanism) lands conceptually but the felt cost is abstract; no on-page sacrifice or tactical trade-off makes the victory precarious or charges the final image with loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting and the spiral chamber with luminous threads supply vivid, purpose-driven images that constrain movement and charge the climax. The shell—pressed to ear, guiding her journey, split and rejoined—functions as micro-setting and shapes key turns. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (rim → mouth → spiral chamber → ledges), though the ledges and masked singers remain underdeveloped. The "star-silver rocks" and "luminous threads" anchor the nexus effectively, and the final image (canyons answering with "softer, kinder returns") uses environment to reconfigure meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover Senn's stolen echo and prevent further harm—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the shell has a twin and confronts Mael. However, escalation is muted: the journey is episodic (argument → confession → riddle) without mounting resistance, and the climax resolves via a single counter-song without visible cost or tactical sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the ending, but no price is paid on the page; Mael's defeat and Senn's restoration feel convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—identity theft via echo, the reclamation of stolen self—emerges through image and action (shells, luminous threads, the truth that "people echo when someone has stolen the part that says I am"). The story resists explicit moralizing until the thematic reveal, which is integrated into the climax rather than appended. The final image (canyons answering with "softer, kinder returns," melancholy becoming "a promise to listen") reweights the opening motif without stating a moral. Minor slip: the phrasing "the part that says I am" edges toward abstract philosophizing, though it remains anchored in the shell's mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Lira; perceptual signature ("thin tremor like reed-blown melancholy") is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse; Mael's brief exchange lacks subtext or goal-driven friction. Elision of Senn's rescue and the final reunion creates a momentum gap: the peak emotional beat is summarized ("among them Senn's true voice rose, faint but whole") rather than dramatized with embodied reaction or direct exchange. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the compressed ending flattens key intimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("moon bone," "reed-blown melancholy," "star-silver rocks") creates texture without overwhelming clarity. Minor loops: "echo" recurs heavily in exposition; "threads" and "voice" are leaned on throughout. The middle journey section lists three shell disclosures in sequence without varied syntax, creating a summary feel. No major artifacts or grammatical errors, but density dips in the travel montage where episodic beats are paraphrased rather than dramatized. The closure image is clean, but the reunion sentence ("walked out with Jaro") is generic and undercuts the line-level charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The echo-theft premise and the paired-shell mechanism offer a fresh synthesis of voice, identity, and intrigue. The spiral nexus with luminous sound-threads is memorable and specific. However, the quest structure and the mentor-guide archetype (Jaro) are familiar, and the climax—hero sings counter-spell, villain flees—follows a predictable path. The story commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through surprising tactical choices or moral ambiguity; Lira's victory is unambiguous and costless, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira drives the journey (follows map, tests shell, sings counter-phrase) and the climax (joins shell halves, frees echoes). She is present in every beat and her perceptual skill enables the final revelation. Two integration frictions: the ending resolves via her song without visible cost, and Senn's restoration happens off-page, reducing her final-beat agency. Still, her choices create the key turns and the closure image centers on her renewed promise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shell appears in at least four beats: discovery with Senn's echo, progressive disclosure during travel, confrontation when Mael reveals the twin, and the joining that frees voices. Its mechanics (paired halves siphon echoes) are specific and drive the climax. Early signal and closure linkage are strong. Minor cap: the shell's final state ("sang origins") is told rather than shown in action, slightly reducing irreplaceability in the closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is signaled (messenger, Nexus Choir, masked singers on ledges) and shapes Lira's stake (prevent others being trapped). The nexus itself is a courier hub using echoes, which Lira disrupts. However, the intrigue remains backdrop; no tactical deception, alliance shift, or competing factions pressure her choices on the page. The concept orients the quest but does not constrain moves or generate reversals during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" enables Lira to distinguish living echoes from wind and to hear the lie in Senn's captured echo. It drives one key beat (detecting pain in the echo) and colors her journey observations. The trait is not label-only; it has mechanical consequence. Cap: no visible trade-off or cost (e.g., sensory overload, missed social cues) balances the advantage, reducing integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Ensure Senn's voice was not being used to trap others" motivates the journey and frames the climax. Lira's counter-song explicitly enacts this intent by loosening threads and freeing hidden voices. The action is signaled early, drives the confrontation, and shapes the resolution (restoring the shell "to ensure any stolen echoes could be given back"). Minor friction: the action succeeds without complication, making it less irreplaceable than if alternatives had failed first.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" structures the journey: the shell reveals dockside argument, priest's confession, child's riddle, each mile changing its whisper. The method is signaled and mechanic-specific. It shapes middle beats (Lira suspects the twin) and primes the climax revelation. Cap: the method does not recur during the confrontation itself; once at the nexus, the shell's disclosure function is replaced by direct confrontation and song, reducing payoff integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is the climax location, described with functional detail (spiral chamber, luminous threads, ledges). It enables the Choir's echo-weaving and provides the acoustic mechanism Lira disrupts. The star-silver rocks and thread-harp imagery charge the final confrontation. Early signal (map, songs that never resolved) and closure participation are strong. Minor friction: the setting does not impose navigational cost or constrain Lira's approach; she descends and confronts without spatial obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears only in the opening line as lyric frame. It does not create deadline pressure, track elapsed time, or modulate tactics. The journey and confrontation unfold without temporal constraint or urgency. The phrase contributes tone but does not shape plot or choices, making it ornamental at the beat level.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To learn why some people echo" drives Lira's investigation and reframes her stake from personal (find Senn) to systemic (understand and stop the theft). The motivation is dramatized through her refusal to bargain and her choice to free all voices, not just Senn's. The final revelation (echoes result from stolen selfhood) directly answers the question and charges the closure image. Minor friction: the broader curiosity does not create internal conflict or competing desires that would pressure her choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" colors Lira's perceptual signature, the canyon's answers, and the closing promise. The tone is coherent and modulates from sorrow (Senn's vanishing) to determination (confrontation) to quiet resolve (finale: "not sorrow, but a promise"). It charges the final image and integrates with the echo motif. Cap: the phrase itself is used sparingly and mostly at the frame; mid-journey beats do not consistently embody the melancholy in action or choice, slightly reducing pervasiveness.</comment>
