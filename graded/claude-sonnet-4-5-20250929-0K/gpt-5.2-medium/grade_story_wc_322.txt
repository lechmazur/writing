<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—fever-driven architectural thinking, the notebook as lifeline, memories that "slip like wet paper"—and embodied through the sinew work. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between rational control and delirium, and the choice to "let it erupt" then anchor names in the lattice feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the father/mother backstory, while anchored to present stimuli, occasionally drifts toward summary rather than micro-choice in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through pattern (chalk grids → weaving → maze → eruption → stable lattice) with a clear cadence shift at "let it erupt" that reweights connection from preserved story to maintained tension. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final lattice image crystallizes the texture of connection with conceptual cost (memories alter, but the structure holds). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One micro-penalty: the child's role in the climax arrives late and feels slightly convenient, though it does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gallery's "honest lies," sinew as surgical leftover, and the mirror that "showed no face, only more thread" constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (floor grids → hanging webs → central chamber maze). The sinew's tactile presence—"sang softly," "scraped," "brushed their sleeves"—keeps the micro-setting active. Sensory selection reflects urgency (calm that "scraped," fever easing as memories alter). No slips touching closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: discover the texture of connection when words fail. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror/maze traps the protagonist, forcing the structural solution to erupt. The eruption narrows options (sinew doesn't fall, it rises into new geometry) and the cost is legible: memories alter again, but the lattice anchors what might be lost. Agency is clear (yanking the mirror, choosing eruption). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through pattern deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: connection as tension maintained rather than story preserved, tested via sinew geometry that mimics optical illusion. The final image—strangers turn with "certainty of recognition" as the thread installs shared memory—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Rational enchantment" and "realistically imaginary" avoid prompt-label echo by remaining integrated into the architectural work. The child holding "one loose end" and the protagonist letting "the sinew anchor the names" charge the closure without stating a thesis. No thematic drift or false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person; distance modulates purposefully (close during fever/memory shifts, slightly elevated during installation description). Perceptual signature is distinct: "fever dream architect" filters detail through architectural and medical idiom ("proof lines," "texture of connection," "sutures"). Diction stays character-bound; "rational enchantment: spells that could be checked like math" and "smiles were also knots" feel voice-motivated. One minor slip: "the curator called it disturbing, but he smiled" lacks subtext in the dialogue itself (none is quoted), though the beat advances. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Since the pneumonia, my thoughts built rooms faster than my hands" = backstory + current state + metaphor). Rhythm varies without template cadence. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor deduction: a few near-echoes in sentence openings ("I did not trust," "I did not say," "I tried to step out," "I understood then") create subtle repetition in the second half, and "rational enchantment" as a coined phrase risks elevated register at the opening, though it's quickly grounded. Closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of optical illusion gallery + surgical sinew + memory alteration + connection theory is specific and non-obvious. "Fever dream architect" as title and organizing metaphor transforms familiar grief-and-art material through the concrete mechanics of weaving angles and the mirror's refusal of faces. The eruption that rises instead of falling feels earned in hindsight by the established pattern of "perspective tricks." The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk: the sinew as medium and the lattice-as-connection metaphor are bold and legible without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist designs the installation (beat 1: chalk grids and weaving), expands it into the maze (beat 2: tightening the weave, suspending the mirror), and chooses to erupt the structure (beat 3: yanking the mirror, letting it rise). Each choice narrows options and alters tactics. The final stance—letting the sinew anchor names—grows from prior agency. Present in closure as the one who "let the sinew anchor the names I was afraid to lose." Cost tied to the character's realization and endurance is visible. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, causal pressure all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sinew thread appears in beat 1 (found in surgical leftovers, woven through nails with counted angles), beat 2 (tightening into maze, "sang softly"), beat 3 (eruption: snapping into new geometry, brushing sleeves, anchoring names). Its properties—surgical origin, iron smell, ability to hold tension—are specific and irreplaceable. The thread's transformation from wound-closing to pattern-opening to memory-anchoring charges the closure. Early signal, three beats, closure active (the lattice holds the protagonist steady), high causal pressure, specificity/irreplaceability, and visible cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" is coined early and shapes tactics: the protagonist writes angles "like proofs," keeps a notebook as "lifeline," and uses measurable wonder to prevent delirium. The concept constrains the work method (counted angles, grids) and is tested when the "rational enchantment held, yet it held too well, like a bridge that becomes a cage." At closure, the concept is implicit in the "stable lattice" that anyone can walk through—wonder made structural. Early signal, two beats (construction, eruption), closure linkage via the stable architecture, causal pressure present. Minor reduction: the phrase itself doesn't appear in the final third, though its effect does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginary" is the design brief: "something the eye accepted and the skin doubted." It constrains the medium choice (sinew as both real surgical material and imaginative geometry) and appears in the final line ("a realistically imaginary architecture anyone could walk through"). The attribute enables the installation's effect—strangers recognize each other via shared installed memory. Early signal, closure participation, one clear beat (the visitors' response). Moderate causal pressure. Reduction: the trait is more thematic accent than on-page constraint; the story's logic would largely hold if the phrase were absent, though the resonance would diminish.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Erupt" is the protagonist's chosen solution ("my fever dream architect mind chose the only structural solution: let it erupt") and triggers the story's climax. The mirror is yanked, the web shivers, and the sinew snaps into new geometry rather than falling. This action redefines options: the maze becomes a lattice mapping every person to every other. The eruption cannot be swapped; "unravel" or "collapse" would not produce the rising, connective outcome. Early setup (fever, pneumonia suggest volatility), peak beat, closure causality, high specificity, visible cost (memories alter, protagonist surrenders control). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By weaving patterns" is signaled early: "I laid out chalk grids, then pulled the sinew through nails, by weaving patterns that mimicked the perspective tricks on the walls." The method's mechanics matter: each strand meets at "a counted angle," written down as proofs. The weaving appears in beat 2 (tightening into maze) and beat 3 (snapping into new geometry that maps connections). At closure, the lattice is the weaving's final form. The method enables the installation's function and is irreplaceable—sculpture or painting would not produce the tension-based connection. Early signal, three beats, closure active, causal pressure, specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gallery provides "clean white halls" where "lines on the walls bent into false corridors"—its "honest lies" frame the protagonist's search for "realistically imaginary" medium. The central chamber becomes the maze site. The gallery's opening night deadline creates light time pressure. At closure, "the gallery held me steady" as memories altered. The setting constrains the work type (optical illusion) and supplies the conceptual frame (rational enchantment in a place of honest lies). Early signal, two beats (search, installation), closure participation, moderate causal pressure. Reduction: the gallery is more conceptual frame than spatial constraint; most action could occur in any large exhibition space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"As memories alter" is signaled early ("my memories began to alter, slipping like wet paper") and recurs: father's laugh → cough → silence; mother's humming shifts mid-memory; "the memory changed mid hum." The alteration creates urgency: the protagonist needs the notebook's "steadiness" and ultimately lets "the sinew anchor the names I was afraid to lose." At closure, "As my own memories altered again, the gallery held me steady." The timeframe is not a countdown clock but an accelerating degradation that tightens decisions (expand the maze, erupt it, anchor names). Early signal, three beats, closure active, causal pressure, cost tied to memory loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is dramatized through the installation work and tested via personal history: "I wanted to know what held people to one another when words failed, and whether it could be built." Friction between desire and cost appears when the maze traps the protagonist and when the eruption installs shared memory in strangers at the expense of the protagonist's own memory stability. The final realization—"connection was not a story preserved, but a tension maintained, and the texture was neither soft nor cruel, just true"—is earned by the sinew work and memory alteration. Early signal, three beats, closure active (letting sinew anchor names), high causal pressure, visible cost (memories alter, names feared lost).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Unsettling calm" is established early: "The calm in the room became unsettling, a quiet so smooth that it scraped." The tone recurs: "smooth panic of the calm room," and at closure "no one spoke above a whisper." The tone modulates with pressure—calm intensifies into entrapment, erupts, then resolves into "stable lattice" where the unsettling quality persists (strangers recognize each other with eerie certainty). The tone charges the final image: the quiet lattice "anyone could walk through" retains the uncanny smoothness. Early signal, coherent through turns, closure participation, tone shapes the ending's affective weight. Strong integration.</comment>
