<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is consistent and drives his choices under pressure. His embodied actions—tapping joints, climbing the tree, shouting the spar's arc—are concrete and reflect his belief system. Internal conflict is present but thin: he paces and listens, yet we see little contradiction or genuine struggle between competing impulses. The crew's shift from wanting "nets and ropes" to following his rhythm is told rather than dramatized through individual micro-choices, and their interiority remains opaque.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: Leeward layers sound, the crew joins, the storm arrives, the freighter alters course, and the sailcloth score reveals a path. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final night moment where he sits "grateful that his calling was not to predict disaster but to translate it into music" reweights his role with felt cost (gratitude implies prior doubt or fear). The orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the squall forces the crew to use the loose spar as a beater, integrating danger into the music and narrowing their options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard afloat in open seas constrains tactics throughout: the torn anchor line forces the noise solution, the freighter's approach pressures the timing, the storm's arrival threatens the pear tree that holds Leeward. Micro-setting (the xylophone mallet, water barrels, iron bell buoy, loose spar) directly enables the sound-layering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "branches heavy with salt pears," "fruit thudding like drumbeats," "the wet deck." Spatial choreography is coherent across the driftwood circle, tree, deck, and approaching freighter light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—avoiding collision with steel hulls in the shipping lanes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the approaching freighter light, the sudden squall, and the loose spar threatening to smash Leeward's perch. One meaningful tightening occurs when the squall arrives and the crew must catch the swinging spar with ropes, then repurpose it as a beater; this choice forecloses the option of passive waiting and commits them to Leeward's method. The cost is legible: they exhaust themselves in the restless euphony and trade safety for the gamble that sound will alter the freighter's course. Minor deduction: the freighter's response ("confused by what sounded like a floating harbor") and the storm "hearing itself mirrored" both lean toward convenience rather than fully dramatized causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of translating disaster into music: obstacles become instruments, prophecy needs harmony, patterns can be heard and played. The final image—"even a prophecy needed harmony to keep people moving"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The sailcloth score, sketched resonance, and fractal spirals recur with shifting meaning, moving from map to teaching tool to invitation. Subtext operates in Leeward's gratitude and his "no sermon" approach with the fishermen. The piece resists tidy resolution: the orchard drifts on, hunger and boredom rise as new obstacles, and the fishermen board with "wary smiles."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Leeward; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-technical register: "the sea still held the day in its throat," "sketched resonance," "fractal generating a score." Diction is controlled and purposeful. However, several phrases veer toward elevated abstraction that strains the character's plausible lexicon in peak moments: "restless euphony," "dubbing the map in sound," "trading the beat with distant gulls." Filter verbs ("listening for," "watching," "believing") cluster in the opening without harming immediacy. Minor convergence: the crew's collective voice is not individuated, though they remain ensemble rather than distinct speakers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance action or setting. Several template-cadence runs appear: "From a cracked storage chest he drew... he held it up... With the mallet he tapped... then sketched..." and "He let the danger join... shouting... and the crew caught it... then used it..." (−0.5 for template runs across multiple beats). Stock metaphor: "the sea still held the day in its throat" is evocative but not character-particular. Register drift: "fractal generating a score" and "restless euphony" import technical/academic diction without clear POV grounding (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph summarizes the closure insight ("his calling was not to predict disaster but to translate it into music") immediately after dramatizing it through action (−0.2). Total artifact deductions: −1.0. Propulsion is strong in the storm sequence; clarity is mostly maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a tide prophet who uses sound to navigate a floating orchard—synthesizes maritime survival, acoustic mapping, and improvisational music in a fresh combination. Leeward's method (sketched resonance, fractal scores, dubbing the environment) is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the loose spar from threat to instrument feels earned in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc (doubt → gratitude, isolation → teaching) follows a familiar template: the misunderstood specialist whose unconventional method wins over skeptics. The setting and tactics are memorable; the underlying human story is less distinctive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leeward's choices drive all key turns: he decides to use noise instead of nets, climbs the tree to read clouds and dub the orchard, shouts the spar's arc as a count, spreads the sailcloth to reveal the current path, and teaches the crew to keep dubbing. His agency shapes the freighter's response, the storm's mitigation, and the eventual rescue by the fishing flotilla. He is present in setup, middle escalation, and closure. Cost is visible: he risks his position in the tree during the squall and accepts that prophecy requires harmony, not prediction. Minor deduction: his internal conflict is thin—he "wanted noise" and the crew "wanted nets and ropes," but we don't see him genuinely torn or forced to choose between competing values.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mallet appears in three beats: drawn from the storage chest and held "like a talisman," used to tap driftwood joints and water barrels to sketch the score, and repaired with tar in the final paragraph. Its properties matter: the "scarred" rubber head and its status as "a relic from before the orchard went to sea" suggest history and specificity. The final repair charges the closure by embodying Leeward's commitment to his method. However, the mallet is not irreplaceable—any percussive tool could serve the tapping function. The talisman framing and the repair elevate its integration beyond functional use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is defined early ("quick charcoal lines on sailcloth that mapped where sound should strike and return") and appears in the middle beat when Leeward sketches "each response on the sailcloth in spirals that repeated within spirals." It shapes tactics: the crew follows the rhythm, the pattern aligns with currents, and the sailcloth becomes a teaching tool. It participates in closure when Leeward offers "the sailcloth and the mallet" to the fishermen. However, the concept overlaps heavily with "fractal generating" and "dubbing," creating some redundancy. The sketch itself is described but not shown constraining a choice under pressure; it functions more as method than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is signaled in the opening: Leeward "watching the cloud movements above as if they were written notes" and "had learned to interpret cloud movements from fishermen who swore weather was a language." It enables one key action: "Leeward climbed into the highest pear tree, read the clouds for the next gust, and began to dub the orchard." The trait is specific and purposeful, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the gust timing is mentioned but not shown altering tactics or forcing a trade-off. The attribute is functional but not indispensable; the sound-layering could proceed without the cloud-reading detail.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Dub" anchors the central action: Leeward "began to dub the orchard itself, layering knocks and rings into a restless euphony," and later the crew learns "to keep dubbing the map in sound until their muscles remembered it." The verb recurs with purpose and drives escalation: the dubbing summons the freighter's response, integrates the storm, and becomes a teaching method. It participates in closure when hunger and boredom are turned into percussion. The term is specific (music production idiom) and irreplaceable within the story's logic. Minor deduction: the mechanics of "dubbing" (layering, looping) are implied rather than shown constraining a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fractal generating a score" appears once in the middle: Leeward "sketched each response on the sailcloth in spirals that repeated within spirals, fractal generating a score from the materials at hand." The method is signaled and its result (the score aligns with currents) matters for the path revelation. However, the fractal property is not shown constraining a choice or enabling a tactic under pressure; it functions as description of the pattern rather than a mechanic that shapes attempts. The phrase overlaps with "sketched resonance" and is not revisited at closure. Swappable with "recursive" or "nested" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard afloat on driftwood in open seas pressures every choice: the torn anchor line initiates the crisis, the driftwood circle must be kept "tight with timed pulls," the shipping lanes threaten to "shear the driftwood circle apart," the storm causes the orchard to lurch, and eddies provide the escape path. The setting supplies resources (pear tree for elevation, buoy in branches, barrels, driftwood joints) and constraints (exposure, instability). It is present in setup, escalates in the squall, and shapes closure when the crew rides eddies "back toward calmer waters." The setting is indispensable; no other configuration (raft, ship, island) would preserve the story's logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At the blue hour" frames the opening and closing scenes but does not track as a live clock. The timeframe is poetic rather than tactical: it sets atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or alter moves. The freighter arrives "when the first freighter light winked on the horizon," the squall is "sudden," and "days later" hunger rises—none of these use the blue hour as a constraint. The timeframe is mentioned in setup and closure but does not shape middle beats or escalation. Replaceable with "dusk" or "evening" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to turn obstacles into instruments drives Leeward's choices throughout: he "wanted noise, believing every obstacle could be turned into an instrument," uses the loose spar as a beater, turns hunger and boredom into percussion, and reflects that "his calling was not to predict disaster but to translate it into music." The desire is dramatized in conflict with the crew's preference for "nets and ropes" and tested under the squall's pressure. Cost is visible: the method exhausts the crew and risks Leeward's safety in the tree. The motivation is present in setup, development, and closure, and it shapes the final image of repair and gratitude.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" appears once as the sound Leeward creates by "layering knocks and rings." The tone is coherent through the piece: lyric-technical diction, patterned action, accumulative rhythm, and a focus on sound as solution. The tone modulates with pressure: the opening is contemplative, the storm sequence is kinetic, and the closing is reflective. However, "restless euphony" is not revisited at closure or shown reweighting the final image; the tone supports but does not explicitly charge the ending. The phrase is specific and apt but functions more as descriptor than active element.</comment>
