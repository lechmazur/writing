<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, anchored in embodied contradiction: her theatrics "had become her way to keep grief from sealing shut," and her throat tightens remembering the faces she abandoned. The decision to leave the emergency locks engaged and her return to build transparent glass rooms both arise from consistent characterization—an impulse to weigh consequences yet choose wonder. The final quiet moment where she stops narrating and waits registers as earned stasis with visible cost. Minor penalty for the cracked bookmark's "split spine still gripping a penciled question," which reads slightly ornamental in its introduction; the question itself could be more concretely grounded in her crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through layered images (melting ice, narration habit, glass panels) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Mara's decision to stop narrating and wait is Charged Poise, crystallizing options with undeniable cost (the silence "felt like a door opening instead of a sentence ending"). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (Mara, research station, coastal thaw). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from internal guilt ("the silence afterward was a verdict she carried") to external action (crafting transparent rooms, laying out the bookmark). The ending reconfigures the station from bunker to observatory with felt cost legible in "the quiet felt like a door opening." Closure lands on the page under the accumulative lens with cost visible in her shift from performance to waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "curved consoles like ribs around an empty heart" anchors the space, and the transformation to "observatory" at closure reweights prior material. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"corridor tiles sighed with each drip," meltwater "in bright threads"—filtered through Mara's glassblower's eye. The kiln, salvaged fuel cells, and aluminum frame ground her work tactilely. The final image of monitors reflecting glass walls and stars constrains and charges the closure moment, qualifying for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (craft safe zones for inquiry vs. shame and silence) signals early and tightens once: the glass-panel construction and bookmark placement are deliberate moves that foreclose the path of continued flight. The piece leans accumulative rather than causal reversals; the tightening occurs when Mara stops narrating and lets the quiet open rather than seal. Cost is visible in her throat tightening and the decision to wait for "the first stranger to enter and ask," a renunciation of performance with on-page consequence. No explicit antagonist, but the prior committee's surveillance and her own verdict create coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (inquiry vs. surveillance, thaw vs. stasis) emerges organically from the glass panels with visible seams and the transformation of the control room into an observatory. The cracked bookmark's question "What makes a mind safe to ask?" and the seam signature "knowledge breaks where we pretend it is unscarred" avoid moralizing; the final image of the open notebook and waiting stance offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Mara's theatrical narration—grief management masked as performance—and in the silence at closure being "a door opening instead of a sentence ending." The piece resists binary resolution; the thawing is "a steady decision" rather than confession, and the ending invites reflection without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close, with diction filtered through Mara's glassblower sensibility: "molten silica," "salvaged aluminum," "faint seam." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture, breakage, and transparency. The theatrical narration ("Behold, I remove the tarp") carries distinct idiom and reveals character under pressure. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the final beat when she stops performing and the quiet becomes legible. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent throughout. Minor penalty: "thoughtfully spirited" in the narrator's voice reads slightly external and label-like rather than fully embodied in her choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and thematic layering. Figurative language is controlled: "ribs around an empty heart," "ice inside her chest," "pale lanterns" all serve pressure without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears in "Back then" transition and "On the night she chose to abandon" which slightly flattens momentum. The opening and closing images charge effectively. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure modulates with scene needs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The piece passes the read-aloud ear test with natural rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of glassblowing, surveillance architecture, and post-crisis return offers a fresh angle on inquiry-under-censorship material. The specific detail of transparent panels with visible seams as both literal construction and thematic signature feels non-obvious. Mara's theatrical narration habit transforming from trainee joke to grief management to final silence provides character-specific emotional progression. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would require substantial rework. The piece commits fully to its premise—glass as both material craft and conceptual answer—without hedging or retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's glassblowing shapes two key beats: she fires the kiln and crafts transparent panels, and her decision to stop narrating at closure is tied to the completed work. The craft enables her plan and her final waiting stance. Present in setup (paragraph 2 kit mention), development (panel construction), and closure (reflection in glass walls). Choices alter tactics: she uses the craft to answer the bookmark's question materially. Cost is tied to her decision to return and wait rather than continue performing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in setup (pocket, paragraph 1), development (tucked between cooling sheets, creating the seam signature), and payoff (laid on console beside blank notebook at closure). It carries the central question and its flaw becomes Mara's signature. Two beats: introduction and tucking/final placement. The object reweights at closure by pairing with the blank notebook, signaling shift from carried question to open invitation. Swappability moderate—another object could carry a question, but the "split spine" and seam-pressing mechanics are specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The thawing shapes stakes throughout: ice melting along the coast is the condition of return (setup), the permafrost cracking drives her back, and the final paragraph explicitly names "the thawing heart" as "a steady decision to let warmth circulate where shame had frozen everything." It alters options—thaw makes return possible and urgent. The concept is enacted in the ice-to-observatory transformation and the move from frozen obedience to open inquiry. Present in all three gates and charges the final image. Cost is tied to confronting the verdict she carried.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is named once in exposition ("the kind of person who could weigh consequences and still choose wonder") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It describes rather than dramatizes. The trait aligns with her choices (returning, building transparent rooms) but could be inferred without the label. Missing middle development as a named constraint; the attribute is told rather than tested under pressure. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandonment redefines all options: Mara's guilt over leaving coworkers trapped in protocol is the verdict she carries, the reason she fled, and the reason she returns. The act is present in setup (backstory anchor), drives her motivation throughout development, and the closure moment (laying out the bookmark, waiting for a stranger) is her answer to that original choice. Two beats: the recounted night and the final gesture of opening the notebook. Cost is visible in "the silence afterward was a verdict she carried" and her throat tightening. Major turns trace to this action; removing it would collapse the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks appears in setup ("began dramatically narrating… 'Behold, I remove the tarp'"), recurs in the kiln-ignition beat ("Listen, loyal audience, as I twist this valve"), and the closure pivot is her decision to stop narrating ("for once, stopped narrating, because the quiet felt like a door opening"). The method is signaled, used twice under pressure, and its cessation charges the ending. Cost is felt in the shift from performance to vulnerability. The mechanics matter: narration as grief management becomes the thing she must renounce to craft genuine safe zones.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control room supplies resources (consoles, monitors, space for kiln and glass panels), pressures choices (condemned status, memory of the night she fled), and charges the final image (transformation from bunker to observatory, monitors reflecting stars). Present in all three gates: setup anchor, development workspace, and closure transformation. Micro-setting qualifies—the curved consoles, the camera that no longer blinks, the aluminum frame salvaged from the station. Removing this exact setting would require fundamental rework; a generic workshop would not carry the surveillance/transparency stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ice melting provides the condition of return and frames urgency (setup and development: "meltwater ran in bright threads," permafrost cracking). Time is signaled but not tracked as a live clock; "when night came" marks passage but does not tighten tactics. The thaw is backdrop and conceptual anchor more than temporal constraint. Present in setup and development, implied in closure (stars visible, suggesting continued thaw). Functional but replaceable—another seasonal or environmental shift could serve similar purposes. Mid-band: shapes one key turn (return) and the atmosphere, but does not narrow options beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crafting safe zones for inquiry drives all on-page choices: returning to the station, firing the kiln, shaping transparent panels, creating the seam signature, and laying out the blank notebook. The desire is dramatized in action (glass construction) and conflicted by cost (confronting her verdict, throat tightening at memories). Present in all three gates: setup (she "had come with a plan"), development (panel-crafting beats), and closure (waiting for the first stranger to ask). Friction between want (safe inquiry) and cost (facing her abandonment) is visible. Visible trade-off: she must stop performing to make genuine safety possible. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weighty lightness is sustained through tonal modulation: the theatrical narration carries playful language ("Behold," "sacred sweep," "patient work of mercy") layered over grief and guilt. Tone is coherent through turns—lightness edges into heaviness at memory beats (throat tightening, "the silence afterward was a verdict"), then opens at closure when "the quiet felt like a door opening." The final image of stars and glass walls charges with both weight (years of shame) and lightness (observatory, invitation). Modulates with pressure and charges the ending. Stronger integration than a static mood; the tonal balance itself enacts the thawing.</comment>
