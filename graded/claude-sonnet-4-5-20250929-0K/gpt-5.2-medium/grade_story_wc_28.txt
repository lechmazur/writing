<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Samir's motivation is embodied through the iron frame and Grasp design, with concrete choices that reveal values under pressure. The retrocognitive trap provides a believable constraint that shapes his watching-as-tool methodology. Lina's arc from vengeance to truce is earned through the forced watching and her cousin's recognition. Minor slip: the cousin's trembling at the end feels slightly summarized rather than shown through specific gesture, and Samir's "warmth that felt cold" risks abstraction without sufficient grounding in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Samir, plaza, post-fire, dawn. The retrocognitive vision provides causal pressure that leads to the tessera discovery, which enables the renaming climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared loaf under the new names reconfigures survivor identity and the plaza's future with visible cost (the boy's restraint, Lina's forfeited vengeance). The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative textures; the because/therefore chain from mosaic chips → vision → tessera → Grasp → truce holds clearly. Cost is legible in the steel cuffs and the ash-taste of both vengeance and forgiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza's ash-white stones, shattered sky, and chipped mosaic ground the setting with sensory specificity. The mosaic stepping stone constrains discovery (retrocognitive trap) and the tessera's blue fragment charges the final renaming beat. Spatial choreography is clear: plaza center, minaret base, storehouses. The iron frame functions as wearable micro-setting, pressuring others' reactions. Minor gap: the storehouses Lina guards are mentioned but not used to complicate access or resources.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rename survivors to shift posture and forestall vengeance. The retrocognitive vision tightens by forcing Lina to see her cousin as the arsonist, escalating her internal conflict. Samir's choice to offer the Grasp instead of a blade narrows options with visible cost (the boy's restraint, Lina's bitter laugh). The shared loaf is a meaningful deepening that reweights the truce. One micro turn (Lina's recognition) sets up the closure without diluting pressure. Agency is clear: Samir's renaming act and Lina's decision to bring the cousin drive the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the Grasp's paradox (restraint as embrace), the tessera fitting "like truth into a wound," and the names Cinders/Keepers as scaffolds for souls. Aberrant mercy is dramatized rather than stated: bread carried in steel cuffs, watching without changing, the cousin's trembling as the first quiet truce. The ending reweights the premise—retrocognitive trap now "served a future he had named"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in Lina's "bitter and soft" laugh and the blue tessera as mirror. Minor slip: "names were scaffolds for souls" risks abstraction, though the renaming act immediately concretizes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Samir's POV cleanly with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "a ruin could be a mirror," "the chips spelled a route," "warmth that felt cold." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lina's "why he collected ruins instead of weapons" and her question about naming the punishment advance plot. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("dissident's patience," "aberrant mercy") that risks slipping outside embodied perception under stress, though it remains mostly voice-coherent. The final paragraph's narrative certainty about the future ("served a future he had named") stretches POV modesty slightly but stays within inferential bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. The opening "stones rinsed white by ash and rain" and "chewing was the first quiet truce" demonstrate strong concreteness. Several figurative phrases cluster in non-peak beats without obscuring clarity: "jointed like a cradle," "through ice," "blue as river depth." Minor artifacts: "the boy trembled as Samir buckled the Grasp" tells rather than showing specific tremor; "despair hardened into law" is abstract. "Loosed by heat" and "pried it free" work cleanly. Paraphrase check: "the council had called the survivors...Cinders, a name meant to keep them small" and the immediate follow "Samir believed names were scaffolds" stay distinct. No major loops, but cumulative elevated diction ("dissident's patience," "aberrant mercy," "retrocognitively trapped") applies a mild density load in the opening third that slightly slows momentum before the vision beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of retrocognitive constraint + physical restraint-as-mercy + renaming ritual offers a fresh synthesis. The Grasp (cuffs that also carry bread) transforms the punishment/mercy binary through specific design. The tessera-as-puzzle-piece and chipped-pattern-as-historical-text avoid generic ruin symbolism by making the mechanism causal. "Warm coldness" and steel-cradles-empathy create tonal complexity without retreat to safety. Minor friction: the post-apocalyptic-fire + council-vs-survivors frame echoes common templates, though the aberrant-mercy stance and the retrocognitive method provide enough specificity to avoid derivativeness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Samir is present from the opening and drives every major beat: walks the plaza, kneels at the stone, pries the tessera, invites Lina to step on the mosaic, offers the Grasp alternative, renames the plaza and survivors, buckles the cuffs, and makes the cousin share the loaf. His "gentle radical" stance shapes all tactics. The closure choice (renaming and the shared loaf) is his agency. Cost is visible in the steel frame he wears and the responsibility he accepts. High integration: setup, development across multiple beats, and closure participation all met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blue tessera appears in beat two (pried from the minaret base), is held up as a mirror in beat three, and is set into the stepping stone's groove in the climax to trigger the plaza's older name and enable the renaming. Early signal, mid-scene tactile use ("felt a pulse of remembered prayer"), and closure participation where it "fit like truth into a wound" and flared the new name. The tessera's unique property (loosened by heat, carries prayer) matters. Cost connection: the act of setting it completes the renaming ritual. Minor gap: it could be slightly more irreplaceable if another object couldn't serve the lock-and-key function, but the specificity and three-beat involvement push it high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly and dramatized through the Grasp design (restraint + bread), the refusal of vengeance, and the shared loaf. It shapes Samir's tactics from the opening ("insisting instead on aberrant mercy") and the stakes (rename before despair hardens into law). The concept pressures Lina's choice and the cousin's fate. Closure is the enacted mercy: cuffs + loaf + sharing. Strong thematic charge. Deduction for overt labeling ("aberrant mercy") rather than pure dramatization, and the phrase appears as summary before the on-page test; still, the Grasp and final beat earn solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early, explained through the mosaic chips, and used twice on the page: Samir's vision of the fire's origin and Lina's forced viewing of her cousin. The trait constrains (can only watch, cannot change) and enables (reading history, showing Lina the truth). Cost is explicit: "helpless watching...its cruelty and also its lesson." The trait shapes the discovery route and Lina's transformation. Final paragraph acknowledges the trap will return but "now the watching served a future he had named," a clear reprise. Setup, development, and closure linkage all met with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The renaming action is central to the premise, foreshadowed ("planned to rename them"), executed at the climax ("renamed the survivors not Cinders but Keepers," "Haven of Hands"), and immediately shown to alter stance ("shoulders less bowed, eyes less hungry for revenge"). Early signal (paragraph four), causal pressure (names as scaffolds for souls), and closure participation (the new names frame the final truce). The act is irreplaceable: swapping it for another symbolic gesture would break the story's logic and Samir's core method. Cost is conceptual and social: the names must be spoken and accepted under the shattered sky with witness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic stepping stone is introduced early as the mechanism for retrocognitive visions. Its pattern spells a route (middle development), Lina steps on it and sees her cousin (second use), and Samir sets the tessera into its groove to trigger the plaza's older name (closure). The method shapes multiple attempts and is causally necessary: without the stone's pattern, no visions; without the tessera fitting the groove, no final name reveal. Three-beat involvement, clear mechanics, and closure participation. Minor deduction: the exact mechanism (why chips = vision, why tessera = name) relies on given-world logic rather than earned discovery, but the method is signaled, used, and essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza is named in the opening, serves as the stage for all action, and is renamed at closure ("Haven of Hands"). The shattered sky recurs as a framing image. The mosaic stepping stone (micro-setting) constrains discovery and enables visions. The minaret's broken base supplies the tessera. Spatial anchors are clear. The setting pressures survivors' identity and the council's control. Closure participation: the plaza's new name redefines the space. Deduction: the setting functions more as stage than active constraint; removing the plaza and setting the action in another post-fire ruin wouldn't fundamentally break the logic, though the mosaic and minaret are essential. The "shattered sky" is vivid but mostly atmospheric rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors the timeframe in the opening and shapes all stakes: survivors are called Cinders, the council controls resources, despair threatens to harden into law. The fire's aftermath pressures the renaming urgency. The retrocognitive visions return to the fire's first minute, tightening Lina's choice. Closure: the shared loaf is "the first quiet truce the plaza had heard since the smoke." Setup and thematic linkage are strong. Deduction: the timeframe is static (post-fire present) rather than a live ticking clock; no immediate deadline tightens tactics within the scene. The fire functions as backstory cause rather than present constraint, though its consequences shape every choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Samir's vow "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" is introduced early via the iron frame and dramatized through the Grasp design (cuffs that carry bread). The motivation shapes his refusal of vengeance, his invitation to Lina, and the final act of buckling the Grasp and making the cousin share. Friction: the warmth-versus-steel tension is enacted when Lina "understood his vow: cold metal could carry warmth if it carried responsibility." Cost: Samir wears the frame and accepts the burden. Closure: the shared loaf under the Grasp enacts the empathy-in-steel. Minor deduction: the motivation is stated early rather than discovered through action, and the phrase "cradle empathy in arms of steel" risks abstraction, though the Grasp concretizes it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is introduced through Samir's paradox ("he answered their fear with a warmth that felt cold") and recurs in Lina's realization ("cold metal could carry warmth if it carried responsibility") and the Grasp's cuffs clicking "with a sound like winter" followed by the warm loaf. The tone coheres across beats and charges the final image: restraint as care, mercy with cost. Setup and closure linkage are strong. Deduction: the tone is more thematic assertion than modulated narrative texture; the prose itself doesn't consistently enact coldness-warmth in rhythm or diction. The phrase "warmth that felt cold" is told rather than shown through specific gesture. Still, the tone shapes the piece's emotional signature and the closure's charge.</comment>
