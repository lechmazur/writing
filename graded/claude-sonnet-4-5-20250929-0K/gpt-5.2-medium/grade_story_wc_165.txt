<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's characterization is concrete and consistent: his analytical nature drives his orchestrated serendipity method, and his micro-choices—sanding the board, using the bishop as wedge—reveal hierarchical values under pressure. The rescue sequence shows genuine problem-solving under stress with visible tradeoffs (abandoning his planned comic act). Internal voice remains distinct throughout, though the "lightly attentive" trait functions more as atmospheric description than embodied contradiction. The night watch's trajectory from skeptical to engaged is economically rendered, and the boy's mother's panic reads authentic without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Milo's vow to "serenade monotony" transforms from abstract performance philosophy into life-saving praxis, with visible cost (altered routine, abandoned comic act). The causal spine is tight—weighted board leads to booth choice, footprints shift the plan, bishop becomes tool—under a Causal lens that holds through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The single meaningful tightening occurs when discovery of the trapped boy forces Milo's orchestrated system to meet genuine emergency, and the final image recharges the opening frame with earned weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal arcade functions as active constraint: rising water creates time pressure, the warped booth lock becomes the problem, and the bishop's diagonal shape supplies the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt wind, neon, water tapping pilings—filtered through Milo's performer's awareness. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from suitcase stage to barrel to booth. The micro-setting (the booth, the bishop as tool-object) directly charges the closure moment when the wedge action saves the boy, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint shaping outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving orchestrated serendipity can transform monotony into meaningful intervention—escalates cleanly when the boy's entrapment tests whether Milo's calculated system can handle real crisis. Agency is consistent: his choice to follow wet footprints and improvise the bishop-wedge solution alters tactics under time pressure with visible cost (abandoning his planned escape act). The night watch's skepticism provides secondary pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door won't open and water rises, forcing Milo to repurpose his symbolic tool into literal救援 implement. Cost is legible: he converts performance into救援, reweighting his entire evening's purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bishop's transformation from performance prop to救援 tool, dramatizing the question of whether calculated creativity can meet genuine need. The ending offers a non-literal answer: Milo doesn't claim prediction, only that "a mind could arrange little gates for chance to walk through," which reweights the opening's abstract "orchestrated serendipity" with concrete救援 evidence. Subtext operates in the night watch's progression from "snorted" skepticism to silent listening. Minor slip: the phrase "sometimes that was enough to change a night" edges toward summary-statement where the dramatized救援 already proves the point, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Milo with controlled distance and distinct perceptual signature: he "marked her as the hinge," "scanned faces...as if they were variables," thinks in diagonals and probabilities. Diction stays consistent—"calculated wilderness," "variables," "orchestrated serendipity"—reflecting his analytical performer identity. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the night watch's "'All right, numbers man'" and "'let it tell me where you want trouble to happen'" carry subtext and advance plot. The prose modulates appropriately under stress (short, decisive beats during the救援). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (the bishop introduction establishes character philosophy, plot device, and thematic anchor simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the救援 sequence. Two friction points lower the score: (1) mild template cadence in the opening's exposition—"He played...then vanished...Between acts...he became"—creates a presentational rhythm, and (2) the phrase "sea-yellowed" and "crab nets" deliver atmospheric specificity but the opening paragraph stacks descriptive elements without immediate pressure. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of street performer + analytical method + tidal setting + chess piece as救援 tool feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template rescue-story beats. The weighted chessboard detail and the bishop's diagonal wedge function show ingenuity. Risk: the piece commits to a conceptual premise (orchestrated serendipity) and follows it through to physical application without hedging. However, the "performer rescues child" armature is familiar territory, and while the execution is fresh, the emotional terrain—proving one's craft has real-world value—is well-trodden. The transformation is solid but not startling enough for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Milo's analytical nature directly enables all three major beats: he weights the board (causal setup), interprets footprints as variables requiring attention (middle turn), and calculates the bishop-wedge solution under time pressure (closure action). His trait constrains his method (he can't rely on pure improvisation) and enables the救援 (only an analytical mind would sand a board or see the diagonal wedge possibility). Present in setup (first paragraph), development (barrel roll, footprint scan), and payoff (wedge calculation and execution). The rescue would fail without this exact character trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bishop appears in four distinct functional beats: (1) introduction as philosophical compass, (2) barrel roll determining story mode, (3) night watch's counter-roll selecting the booth, (4)救援 wedge. Its slanted diagonal cut is established early ("diagonals were how you slipped past boredom") and pays off literally when that geometry solves the warped lock. The object's transformation from symbol to tool charges the closure image ("scooped up the bishop before it floated away" and "set the bishop back in his vest"). Removing this exact object—its shape, portability, Milo's attachment—would break both the selection mechanism and the救援 solution. Specificity and irreplaceability are maximal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Orchestrated serendipity" is defined in paragraph two, demonstrated via the weighted chessboard in paragraph four, tested when coincidence (wet footprints) enters the system, and proven functional when Milo's preparation (carrying the smooth bishop) meets emergency. The concept shapes tactics: he doesn't rely on pure chance or pure control, but arranges "little gates for chance to walk through." It reweights at closure when he explicitly states the philosophy proved adequate. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure, though the rescue's success also requires straightforward problem-solving (door physics), slightly diluting the concept's necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lightly attentive" is named in paragraph two and demonstrated once with visible cost: Milo notices the wet footprints "too small for any adult" and his "light attention sharpened," causing him to abandon his planned comic act and follow the prints. This trait enables the救援 discovery. However, it appears in only two beats (initial description and footprint moment) and does not return at closure, missing the payoff gate. The trait constrains his method (he scans rather than forces) but could be replaced with "observant" or "vigilant" without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Happen" structures the entire piece: Milo's goal is to make good accidents happen, the bishop roll makes the booth "happen" as the next location, the boy's entrapment happens to align with that choice, and the救援 happens through Milo's intervention. The verb recurs at closure: "dawn happened." This action/concept hybrid shapes every major turn—the selection method depends on letting outcomes happen within constraints, and the ending validates that controlled happening as sufficient. The piece teaches that "happen" means neither pure chance nor pure control but arranged emergence, and closure pivots on proving that philosophy functional. The exact verb's semantic range is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (paragraph two: "ordering randomness rather than denying it"), demonstrated via the sanded board (paragraph six: "shaping the roll the way a composer shapes silence"), and tested when unordered randomness (the boy's crisis) intrudes. Milo's response—using the smooth bishop as wedge—shows the method's utility: he's prepared with a tool whose properties he's internalized through ordered practice. The mechanics matter: the weighted squares influence the roll, and the bishop's diagonal geometry solves the lock. Present in setup, development (two rolls), and payoff (improvised wedge). The rescue requires both the ordered tool and the ability to reorder its use under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal arcade supplies three concrete constraints: (1) rising water creates time pressure and the owner's warning establishes stakes, (2) the "shuttered photo booth...closed since the last storm broke its window" becomes the trap location via the roll, (3) the warped lock and seeping water force the improvised wedge solution. The setting's liminality—"where salt wind met old neon," "where nature pressed against plywood"—charges the closure image where water "tapping the pilings like applause" reweights performance as救援. The environment is not merely backdrop; it selects the problem, constrains the solution, and provides the final metaphor. The "under stars" detail enriches atmosphere without adding causal pressure, keeping this below 9.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Between acts" frames the entire piece (title-like opening phrase and explicit return: "Back at his suitcase stage, between the next two acts"). The timeframe creates urgency—Milo must resolve the救援 and return before the next performance window closes—and structures his choices (he's in the liminal space where he practices orchestrated serendipity). The rising tide adds a live clock. However, the actual救援 sequence doesn't emphasize minute-by-minute pressure; we're told water "seeped" and later "tapped" but the rescue feels decisive rather than race-against-seconds. Present in setup and payoff with moderate middle constraint, but not indispensable—the story would survive "during a break" without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Milo's motivation—"to serenade monotony with creativity"—is dramatized through his performance practice (opening acts), tested when genuine crisis interrupts routine, and validated at closure when he "altered his routine, letting the rescue become the story." The desire faces friction: his calculated method risks sterility (the night watch's skepticism), and the boy's crisis forces him to choose between planned entertainment and救援. The final image—"went on serenading monotony until dawn happened"—shows the motivation enduring but transformed by the救援 experience. Cost is visible: he abandons his comic escape act. The motivation shapes all major choices and charges the ending, though the internal conflict could be sharper for 9+ range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Calculated wilderness" is established in paragraph three ("the calculated wilderness of performing where nature pressed against plywood, because it forced numbers to share space with instinct") and sustained through the piece's diction: analytical terms ("variables," "probabilities," "options") coexist with organic imagery ("salt wind," "tide," "water tapping"). The tone modulates appropriately—cooler and observational during setup, tighter during the救援, expansive at closure. The ending's "went on serenading monotony until dawn happened" maintains the paradox of control and surrender. The tone directly supports theme (order meets chaos productively) and charges the final image where applause becomes surf. Coherent and purposeful throughout, reaching the lower 9-band threshold.</comment>
