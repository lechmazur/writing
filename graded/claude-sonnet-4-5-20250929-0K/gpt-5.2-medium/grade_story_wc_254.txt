<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reach her brother is concrete, and her use of paraphrase to soften boundaries shows agency. However, her interior life remains somewhat abstract—phrases like "aesthetically driven" and "hunger she cannot rhyme away" gesture toward personality without grounding it in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Soren is present but applies only mild pressure; his warning and recoil feel more atmospheric than a true crucible. The final transformation into "simply air" lacks embodied cost; we see dissolution but not the felt price of crossing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early and maintains it: each paraphrase dissolves boundaries incrementally until Lira crosses. The ban-lifting timeframe and colonnade are anchored by the second paragraph, satisfying orientation. The closure—Lira walking forward with the shadow until "both are simply air"—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (a form of Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid), reweighting the sacred boundary with conceptual cost. The cost, however, is more implied than dramatized on the page; we infer self-dissolution rather than witness a specific forfeiture or price paid in her final thought or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (milky pillars, lantern-moth hush, mist threading between ribs). The quartz vibrating through boot-soles and the blue light deepening as boundaries dissolve tie setting to the protagonist's actions. The colonnade constrains Soren's physical reach (his fingers pass through her cloak) and charges the final image when Lira steps into the circle's center. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching her brother across the border of the dead—is signaled early and drives Lira's choices. Pressure accumulates as each paraphrase loosens the carvings and the mist thickens, narrowing her path toward dissolution. However, escalation remains textural rather than a sharp reversal; no moment forces a trade-off or forecloses an option with visible consequence until the final crossing. The cost of becoming "simply air" is conceptually present but not felt as a tangible sacrifice on the page—no specific ability, memory, or connection is named as lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of language dissolving sacred boundaries emerges organically from Lira's paraphrase work and the colonnade's function. The shift from "worlds apart" to "words apart" is a sharp conceptual hinge that reweights the premise. The final image—walking forward with the shadow until both are air—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether grief can be made symmetrical. The piece avoids overt moralizing and sustains ambiguity about whether crossing is transcendence or erasure. Minor slip: "sacred lines were meant to guide beauty, not imprison it" edges toward thematic statement rather than purely dramatized realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with a distinct perceptual signature: "lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "grief look symmetrical." Focalization is stable; no head-hopping. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels more authorial than character-specific ("sensation in her teeth, the way truth sometimes arrives quietly"). Soren's interiority is briefly accessed when he "recoils, suddenly afraid of his own hands," which reads as clean free indirect style. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Lira's paraphrase of Soren's warning drives the central action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is image-rich and rhythmically controlled, with strong figurative language ("air holds a lantern-moth hush," "letters on the quartz loosen, sliding like frost melting"). However, density occasionally tips into overwriting: metaphors stack without always advancing causality ("cloth has become weather," "shadow made of shadowed cloud"). A paraphrase-loop appears: "repeating his sentence but changing a single noun" is immediately followed by the demonstration, which could be tighter. Minor template cadence in exposition ("She was raised on," "She circles the colonnade, reading"). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping penalties modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—dissolving boundaries through paraphrase and a humming quartz colonnade—is fresh and specific. The image of a "cloud-shadow poet" using language to soften sacred architecture avoids stock fantasy tropes. The transformation of "worlds" to "words" is an elegant conceptual hinge. However, the broader arc (crossing a forbidden boundary to reach a lost loved one) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not fully transform it through unexpected cost or moral complexity. The lyric mode and tight integration of setting elevate it above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes multiple key decisions: entering the atrium, rewriting the decree, paraphrasing Soren's warning, circling the colonnade, stepping into the circle's center, and walking forward with the shadow. Her choices drive all major turns. However, her decision-making feels more atmospheric than conflicted; she does not face a moment of genuine doubt or trade-off until the final crossing, and even then the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Capped by lack of sharp friction in her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (Lira taps it with her chisel, reads its carvings, steps into its center), and its vibrations and dissolving properties directly enable the crossing. It returns with reweighted meaning at the end when Lira's breath and the quartz humming merge into a pattern. The colonnade's function as a boundary-dissolver is causal and irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement push it into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" appears once, anchored in Lira's teeth when she paraphrases Soren's warning. It shapes her next move (tapping the pillar) and signals her commitment to crossing. However, it does not constrain a later choice or recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Its presence is specific but not essential; she could reach the same crossing without this exact sensation. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is mentioned once in the opening as a trait shaping Lira's gaze, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It labels her motivation without dramatizing a trade-off between aesthetic pursuit and another value. No later beat tests this attribute under pressure. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase is the engine of the plot: Lira rewrites the decree to pass the guards, transforms Soren's warning from "worlds" to "words," and circles the colonnade rewriting carvings until the letters loosen. The action is signaled early, used across at least three distinct beats, and directly enables the final crossing. Swapping it for another linguistic act (translation, erasure) would require structural rewrites. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" names the method early (Soren warns the pillars "dissolve boundaries by design") and its mechanics matter: each paraphrase loosens carvings, mist threads inward, Soren's fingers pass through cloth. The method shapes Lira's tactics (she must "let the frame soften") and is present in the closure when she walks forward "until both are simply air." The mechanics are legible and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by the frozen lake is introduced in the opening line and provides the spatial container for all action. The colonnade within it constrains Soren's reach and channels Lira's approach to the center. The frozen lake's mist pushes inward to enable the crossing. Setting shapes choices and charges the final image. However, the atrium itself (as distinct from the colonnade) is more backdrop than active constraint; the lake's role is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" is signaled in the opening and provides the enabling condition for Lira's entry. It creates a narrow window (the atrium is open "to allow repairs, not crossings") that adds urgency. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; no clock or deadline forces Lira to choose quickly. The ban's expiration is a setup condition rather than a live pressure that alters her tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is dramatized through her actions (rewriting the decree, paraphrasing warnings, circling the colonnade). Friction appears when Soren warns her and she must choose whether to force a door or let the frame soften. However, the cost of pursuing this motive is conceptual (becoming air) rather than viscerally felt as a trade-off between wants. The motivation drives the plot but is not tested by a sharp dilemma on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" names the tone in the opening line and recurs when Lira sees the silhouette ("in the lantern-moth hush she sees"). The tone remains consistent—quiet, suspended, aestheticized—and modulates subtly as the mist thickens and boundaries dissolve. It charges the final image of air and shadow. However, the tone does not shift sharply under pressure; peak beats maintain the same lyric register rather than compressing or intensifying. Coherent but static.</comment>
