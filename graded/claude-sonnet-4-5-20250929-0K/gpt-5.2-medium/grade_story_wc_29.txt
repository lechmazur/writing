<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to outwit the tricksters is clear and drives her final action, but her interiority relies heavily on observational summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The manager and physics chair appear only as externalized obstacles without distinct psychological pressure or status dynamics. Her final choice to hand over the recordings feels somewhat abrupt; the renunciation lacks visible cost that would elevate it to earned stasis—she simply explains her insight rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, radio station, night shift, two months post-decode) land within the first sentence. The piece operates under a Causal lens: Mara recognizes the trickster pattern, rewires the broadcast chain, sends the subsonic reply, observes the beacon slip along her false map, then hands over her shield to the authorities—each beat follows motivated linkage. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: "the real contest was not contact versus fear but who got to weaponize wonder" reweights the premise, and her request to keep broadcasting the shield carries conceptual cost (she surrenders control to preserve the town's agency). The cost is stated rather than felt in image, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio station's "glass and rust," the observatory dome, the studio transmitter, and the spectrum analyzer all anchor the setting concretely. The astronomical charts constrain Mara's choice twice (she traces alignments, then uses them as evidence), and the subsonic shield device charges the final act. The fault line "split the town into east and west, signal and silence" elegantly mirrors the social divide. Minor gap: the vigil and rally outside remain postcard description rather than sensory immediacy that shapes Mara's tactical window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to silence the signal or answer it—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes the trickster pattern. Her decision to send a subsonic countercurrent is protagonist-driven and narrows options: she risks exposing her tactic to both factions. The beacon's attempt to reassert and then slip along her false map constitutes a meaningful reversal. The cost is visible (she locks the door, defies both manager and chair, surrenders her recordings), though the final beat's explanatory mode slightly softens the felt price. One deepening turn is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—who weaponizes wonder, signal versus silence as power contest—emerges from Mara's tactic and the community fracture rather than overt statement. The astronomical charts, the subsonic shield, and the trickster recognition converge without allegory. The final image of Mara handing over charts and recordings with the line "who got to weaponize wonder" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the binary. Minor slip: "counting on humans to do their work for them" verges on thematic echo, though it remains character inference rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("braided sound to starlight," "baited meanings"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. The manager and chair lack differentiated speech or gesture—both appear only as externalized pressure without voice distinction. Under peak stress (2:13 a.m. climax), syntax remains ornate ("inaudible lattice," "prayer spoken through concrete") rather than compressing with urgency, which slightly undercuts psychic distance modulation. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every clause advances plot or atmosphere. However, the piece suffers from moderate overwriting: figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax ("grit under her nails," "something vast had leaned closer," "spectrum analyzer blossomed," "pressure change") without pattern-teaching, creating tonal saturation. The opening sentence runs to 46 words with nested clauses, slowing initial propulsion. Minor template cadence: "the manager… the physics chair… the Quiet… the Votaries" list structure recurs. No loops or scaffold, but density occasionally tips into ornament. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.2 for opening sentence drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—cosmic tricksters who manipulate through signal rather than invasion, countered by subsonic misdirection—is specific and non-obvious. The braided audio-ephemeris beacon and the false-map tactic feel fresh. The community-division frame is less distinctive (standard polarization allegory), but Mara's recognition that "the real contest… is who got to weaponize wonder" elevates it beyond binary moralizing. Risk-taking in structure (single scene, high exposition density, no dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the trickster-outwit premise echoes folklore and Cold War shortwave lore without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout and makes the key decision to send the subsonic reply, which narrows options and drives the climax. Her choice to hand over the recordings and ask the authorities to continue the shield shapes the ending. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure) and her occupation's technical knowledge (ephemerides, spectrum analysis, subsonic modulation) is causally essential—another role could not execute this exact plan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astronomical charts are handled in two beats: Mara consults them to confirm the beacon's shifts, then traces alignments with a pencil before transmission, then hands them over at the end. They enable her tactical plan (aligning Perseus rift, tower, fault line) and appear in the closure unit as evidence. However, their reweighted meaning at closure is thin—they remain tools rather than accruing symbolic or relational charge. Two-beat involvement + closure presence lifts the score, but specificity and cost connection are modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Power plays shape the dominant stake: the Votary manager demands live broadcast, the physics chair threatens funding cuts, and the Quiet/Votaries factions vie for control of the narrative. Mara's tactic is explicitly framed as "who got to weaponize wonder," and her final act—handing over the shield—redistributes power. The concept appears in setup, constrains middle tactics (she locks the door, defies both sides), and is articulated at closure. It drives options rather than merely providing theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" appears once in the opening line as a label ("a cautiously hopeful grin she did not quite trust") but never constrains an on-page action or generates visible tradeoff. Mara's choices—lock the door, send the signal, hand over recordings—are tactical and defiant, not modulated by cautious hope. The trait remains ornamental description without causal weight. Present in setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the pivot: Mara decides "to outwit them, she needed to interfere, not by silencing the signal, but by speaking back." The subsonic transmission at 2:13 a.m. is the story's major turn, and its consequence (the beacon slipping along her false map) validates her tactic and leads directly to her final choice. The action is signaled in the first half, executed at climax, and its result shapes closure. Removing "interfere" and replacing it with, say, "observe" or "decode" would collapse the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subsonic-frequency method is signaled early ("routing a tone generator… tuning it to subsonic frequencies") and its mechanics matter: it rides "under the music, under the talk shows" to evade human detection while the tricksters triangulate. Mara's plan depends on this exact technique—audible frequencies would alert both factions and fail to target the rift. The method enables the climax beat and appears in the closure request ("keep broadcasting her subsonic shield"). Strong causal pressure and specificity; minor gap is that the technical plausibility is asserted rather than dramatized under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The university radio station provides the transmitter, tone generator, and broadcast chain Mara rewires; the studio's lockable door lets her defy the manager. The observatory dome and the alignment with the fault line supply the triangulation geometry her tactic requires. Setting pressures choices (manager pounding on locked door) and supplies resources. Present in all three gates. Minor limitation: the vigil and rally outside remain atmospheric rather than altering Mara's tactical window or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The community division is established in the opening (Votaries vs. Quiet, "every decode felt like a vote") and tightens pressure throughout: the manager and chair represent opposed factions, and the vigil/rally converge at the climax moment. The timeframe compresses decisions—Mara acts at 2:13 a.m. when "the beacon surged" and both sides arrive. However, the division functions more as static backdrop than live clock; we never see Mara racing a deadline or tactical window closing because of the schism's escalation. Present in all gates but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to outwit cosmic tricksters—is dramatized through her recognition ("she recognized the signature"), her tactical plan (false map, subsonic shield), and her final realization ("the tricksters were not omnipotent, only opportunistic"). The desire shapes every major choice and is tested when she locks the door and sends the signal despite institutional pressure. Friction between her goal (protect the town's agency) and cost (surrender control to authorities) is visible. Strong integration across all beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends ethereal diction ("braided sound to starlight," "inaudible lattice," "something vast had leaned closer") with grit ("bunker of glass and rust," "grit under her nails," "prayer spoken through concrete"). The combination is coherent and modulates under pressure—ornate observation in exposition shifts to tactile urgency at climax. However, the final beat returns to explanation ("she asked them to keep broadcasting") rather than a charged image, slightly softening the tonal payoff. Tone supports closure but does not fully charge the final moment.</comment>
