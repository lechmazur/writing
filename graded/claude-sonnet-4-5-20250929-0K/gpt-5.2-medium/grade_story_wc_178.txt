<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nabu-iddin's frugality and grief anchor his actions with clear motivation, and his empirical skepticism creates productive contradiction when he snaps his trusted stylus to seal a covenant with the unknown—an earned choice with visible cost. Interior states are embodied (eating "thin barley cakes," wrapping the tile in linen from a discarded curtain) rather than labeled. The astronomer's professional lens filters every perception, and his final peace reads as earned stasis with conceptual weight. Minor: the mason and the "unnamed presence" remain abstractions; more friction in the decision to sacrifice certainty would deepen the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (astronomer, palace, between regimes), and the drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: omens, tile, schematic mapping, and star-alignments layer pressure toward the chamber reveal and covenant seal. The tile's vow guides three on-page choices (acceptance, mapping, arranging tablets) with clear because/therefore links, and the climax—snapping the stylus—forecloses his most conserved certainty with felt cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): new constellations on his palms and "empirically ironic peace" reweight the premise without stating a moral. One persistent constraint (Mars crossing the Lion) shapes tactics. The piece exceeds minimal escalation standards but remains mid-7s because the cost at closure is conceptual and oblique rather than viscerally dramatized in dialogue or physical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reimagined palace (glass roofs, baked-brick arches, bricked-up stairwell) and the underground chamber with "metal lines like circuit traces" create a vivid, specific environment that constrains movement and choice. Micro-setting works well: the tile's square depression, the bronze mask, the rack of tablets are handled objects that charge the closure. Sensory selection stays purposeful (cool darkness, lapis glaze, evening water color) and filtered through the astronomer's POV. The timeframe "between regimes" is atmospherically rich but functions more as backdrop than spatial pressure on most moves; still, the chamber's design alters tactics at the key beat, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seal the covenant by offering what he most conserves—is signaled midway and drives the climax, but early escalation reads passive (accepting, waiting, recording) with the tile supplying most causality rather than protagonist agency shaping each turn. The stylus sacrifice is a genuine on-page cost that forecloses certainty, and the final image (constellations on his palms) reweights options, qualifying as meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. One tightening choice is sufficient at this length, but the peak decision arrives late with minimal friction dramatized beforehand, keeping the score in mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: frugality versus faith, empirical method as a language for devotion, the unknown borrowing the astronomer to look back. The tile's encrypted vow and the mirror-face avoid overt thesis statements, and the final image—constellations drawn on his palms—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "empirically ironic" frame threads through the arc (he verifies arithmetic yet seals a covenant requiring faith) and the ending line ("devoted to what he could not name") crystallizes the tension without summarizing. Minor: "between regimes" as metaphor for liminal knowledge is clear but not fully exploited in micro-choices; deeper friction in the devotion would push this into 8+ range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Nabu-iddin's perceptual signature: his professional idiom ("gnomon and sighting tube," "schematic representations," "recorded angles") and frugal attention (counting copper nails, reusing tablets, wrapping in discarded linen) create a distinct, voice-specific texture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the tile mapping, wider during the chamber reveal). No dialogue appears, so voice convergence is not testable. Diction remains within the astronomer's plausible lexicon—no unmotivated register drift—and the prose rhythm tightens at the climax without melodrama. One minor slip: "the unknown were borrowing him to look back" edges toward abstract poeticism rather than character-specific perception, but it remains legible and voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance character, stakes, or setting). The opening line anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Two paraphrase loops stand out: "He understood then why the devotion was encrypted, why it survived purges and fires between regimes, because it was meant for someone who might never arrive in human history at all" rehearses prior causality without new pressure; and the phrase "schematic representations" recurs three times across the text as a template marker. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood") appear but remain voice-motivated. Stock metaphor "the unknown" and the abstract "unnamed presence" dilute specificity in the climax. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for loops and template cadence, placing the score in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian astronomy, magic square cryptography, and science-fiction vault aesthetics ("metal lines like circuit traces") is fresh and specific, avoiding template mysticism. The "empirically ironic" devotion—faith demanded in arithmetic's language—is a non-obvious angle, and the tile's dual function (omen + key) feels earned rather than gimmicky. The premise transforms familiar "lost knowledge" tropes through the astronomer's professional lens and frugal materiality (bone stylus, discarded curtain linen). Minor: the covenant's stakes remain abstract ("the unknown," "unnamed presence") rather than grounded in lived cost or consequence that would make the ending image inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the vault reveal and closure resonance justifies placement in high-7s, but greater specificity in the covenant's terms would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nabu-iddin's frugality drives three on-page choices: accepting the tile instead of wages, mapping its numbers against star positions, and snapping his bone stylus to seal the covenant. The trait is signaled early ("frugal by habit and by grief") and constrains the climax with visible cost (sacrificing his most trusted instrument). Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and causal across beats. The final choice reweights certainty into devotion, making the trait essential. Swappability is low; a different astronomer without frugal habits would not read the same. Score reflects strong integration with minor room for deeper friction in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tile appears in five distinct beats: acceptance from the mason, schematic mapping at the table, waiting for Mars alignment, insertion into the wall depression, and final placement of stylus halves at the covenant seal. Its nine-cell magic square structure enables both the star-name vow and the tablet arrangement, and the tile's numbers constrain tactics (waiting for Mars, arranging three tablets in the square's pattern). Present in all three gates and causally active in the closure (receives the stylus halves). Specificity is high (lapis glaze, cuneiform numbers, square depression fit). Minor: the tile's role in the final beat is receptive rather than transformative; it charges the act but does not reweight prior meaning in a new way, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion frames the tile's discovery, drives the decryption beat (mapping numbers to star names spells a vow), and shapes the climax when the astronomer offers certainty to seal the covenant. The concept appears early and constrains the middle choice (arranging tablets per the vow's instructions). Present in all three gates. The ending—"devoted to what he could not name"—reprises the concept with thematic weight. Causal pressure is moderate; the vow guides but does not force choices, and the friction between empirical method and faith is told more than dramatized in micro-decisions. Swappability is moderate (another hidden message could replace the vow with minor edits). Score reflects solid integration with room for deeper on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is labeled twice ("empirically ironic routine," "empirically ironic peace") and demonstrated once at the climax: the tile demands faith in arithmetic's language, which Nabu-iddin verifies with his hands before sealing the covenant. The trait constrains the peak choice (he must offer certainty, not gold) and charges the ending. Setup is present, development is implicit (verifying the magic square's sums), and payoff is clear in the final line. Cost is visible (snapping the stylus). Minor: the attribute feels more thematic accent than tactical constraint across beats; it shapes the final image more than middle moves. Swappability is moderate; another paradoxical trait could serve similar thematic work. Score reflects lyric-resonance integration with solid closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uncloak" drives two major beats: removing the black cloth from the bronze mask and the mirror-face revealing itself. The tile's vow explicitly instructs "to uncloak what had been kept veiled," linking setup to payoff. The action is necessary (without it, the covenant ritual remains incomplete) and specific (slackening cloth, smooth mirror). Present in setup (tile vow), development (implied in arranging tablets), and payoff (the mask reveal and its consequences). Causal pressure is strong; uncloaking is the hinge that shifts from preparation to encounter. Minor: the physical act is brief and not tactically difficult; the astronomer arranges tablets and the cloth "slackened and slipped away" without resistance, reducing embodied stakes. Swappability is low; the mask cannot be merely "opened" or "discovered" without losing the vow's language. Score reflects essential integration with room for greater physical or emotional friction in the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" appears in three beats: Nabu-iddin draws them of the tile, palace, and constellations; the underground chamber's walls display them for eclipses, floods, coronations; and the ending constellations are "drawn as schematic representations across his own palms." The method is signaled early and recurs with shifted meaning at closure. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weaker (the chamber tablets are described but not actively used in problem-solving). The method enables the tile decryption (mapping numbers to star names) and charges the final image (new sky coordinates). Causal pressure is moderate; the astronomer's habit of drawing schematics primes the reader but does not constrain a difficult middle choice. Swappability is moderate; another analytical method (e.g., "calculations," "diagrams") could replace it with minor edits. Score reflects lyric-resonance integration with solid early-seed → final-reprise work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reimagined palace provides five on-page constraints: glass roofs and baked-brick arches establish the setting, quiet courtyards enable astronomical work, the bricked-up stairwell hides the chamber, the square depression in plaster receives the tile, and the underground chamber supplies the mask and tablets. The setting is present in all three gates and directly shapes tactics (tile insertion opens the sealed corridor, chamber layout guides the covenant ritual). Specificity is high (metal lines like circuit traces, lapis glaze, bronze mask) and the "reimagined" attribute—ancient structure with anachronistic details—charges thematic tension. Minor: the palace is more stage than crucible; it supplies resources but does not resist or test the astronomer's choices. Swappability is low for the chamber's unique design, moderate for the palace frame. Score reflects strong integration with room for the environment to pressure decisions more actively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is signaled in the opening line, atmospherically rich, and returns in the ending ("distant boots and fresh proclamations"). The timeframe enables the astronomer's solitude (students scattered, patrons gone) and frames the covenant as liminal devotion that survives political change. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is thin (the three nights waiting for Mars are noted but not dramatized as urgency). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; Nabu-iddin's actions are patient and methodical, not pressured by regime turnover. Cost linkage is conceptual (devotion "between regimes" as metaphor) rather than tactical. Swappability is moderate; another period of political transition could serve similar atmospheric work. Score reflects purposeful lyric framing with limited causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to seal a covenant with the unknown is signaled midway (the tile's vow ends with instructions) and drives the climax (offering certainty to seal the covenant). The astronomer's actions—mapping the tile, waiting for Mars, arranging tablets, snapping the stylus—are causally linked to this desire. Present in all three gates. The motivation creates one on-page cost (sacrificing the stylus) and charges the ending (new constellations, "devoted to what he could not name"). Friction is moderate; the astronomer accepts the vow's terms without visible internal debate or conflicting wants. The desire is told more than dramatized in contradictory impulses. Swappability is low; no other motivation would fit the covenant ritual. Score reflects solid integration with room for deeper on-page conflict between empirical habit and faith-driven action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is established in the opening phrase and modulates through the arc: quiet courtyards, evening waiting, "cool darkness" of the chamber, "evening water" color of the mirror-face, and "dawn" arrival at closure. The tone supports the astronomer's patient empiricism and the liminal "between regimes" setting. Pressure does not disrupt the dusky register; even the climax (snapping the stylus) remains quiet and controlled. The final image (climbing out "quietly" with "empirically ironic peace") reprises the harmony with thematic weight. Coherence is strong, modulation is subtle rather than dynamic. Minor: the tone is static across beats; no moment of stark contrast or tonal rupture sharpens the stakes. The ending charges the tone with closure resonance but does not transform it. Score reflects consistent, purposeful tone that supports rather than intensifies pressure.</comment>
