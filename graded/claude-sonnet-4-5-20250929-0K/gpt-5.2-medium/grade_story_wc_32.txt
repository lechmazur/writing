<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal landscape is established through embodied metaphor ("tears had learned to stand at attention"), and her final choice to transform the crozier carries visible cost—risk of punishment she admits aloud. Jun's penny-drop realization provides a clean micro-turn, though his fear and hesitation read slightly mechanical. The "stoically sensitive" trait appears as label more than constraint; it does not visibly force a trade-off in the climactic beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: successive approximation and ember-breath imagery build density until the crozier's transformation cuts the charter seals—a Decisive Change with felt cost (risk of punishment, collapse of the furnace). The causal chain from broken crozier → heating → reshaping → seal-breaking is legible, and the final image (tool carried forward, pit collapsed to glass) reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies heat, basalt, and a furnace pit that enable the transformation; the "frozen bloom" leaning closer and the pit's final collapse to glass charge the closure image. Sensory detail (iron, saffron, old prayers) and spatial choreography (rings, center, stone table) remain coherent. The setting constrains choice—Mara must use the nexus's ember breath—and the environment's collapse completes the creative destruction, meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: interrupting the charter that chains Mara. The crozier's transformation narrows options (no return to obedience) and the seal-breaking is an on-page reversal driven by protagonist agency. Mara admits fear yet acts, and Jun's hesitation briefly complicates before resolution. The cost is legible—risk of punishment, loss of the old future—but the furnace's collapse feels slightly convenient, lowering the escalation charge by a notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: destiny as mold, breaking the mold to pour a new future, creative destruction that tears down form for truer building. The crozier's shift from commanding to guiding light answers the thematic question without moralizing. The final image (tool carried between them, pit collapsing to glass) offers a resonant, non-literal closure. "Successive approximation" and "vivify" tie method to meaning organically, and the frozen bloom's lean adds motif weight without forced recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is present ("stoically sensitive," "listening to tiny cries of metal"), though some phrases ("when the penny drops," "the place itself approved") momentarily drift toward external certainty. Diction is elevated and consistent, yet several constructions ("a soot masked in gray," "vivify the cooling alloy") feel lexically strained for the POV's urgency. Jun's dialogue is minimal but functional; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and density is high, yet several lines loop conceptually: "creative destruction, the kind that tears down a form so something truer can be built from the shards" glosses the concept already dramatized. "Stoically sensitive" recurs as label without embodied cost in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear: "frozen bloom that held heat and grief" and "soot masked in gray" (soot as person?) blur clarity. Filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed," "thought") and elevated diction ("vivify," "tinctures") in high-pressure moments slightly dull immediacy. No scaffold loops, but cumulative drift lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of alchemist, charter-breaking, and crozier transformation offers a specific synthesis; "successive approximation" as method and "frozen bloom" as tonal anchor avoid stock fantasy beats. The "destiny as mold" metaphor is fresh enough, and the furnace collapsing to glass completes the concept with earned closure. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its lyric register and experimental diction, though some elevated vocabulary ("vivify," "tinctures") edges toward ornament. The premise transforms trope material without feeling derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in every beat: walks the nexus (setup), arranges tools and heats the crozier (middle), reshapes and uses it to cut seals (closure), then carries it forward despite fear. Her decisions—come to the nexus, break the crozier, file and drip tinctures, set it upright, tell Jun to take it—drive all major turns. Removing her exact choices collapses the arc. Cost is visible: risk of punishment, admission of fear, old future loosened.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crozier is established as broken (para 5), heated and filed (middle beats), reshaped and set upright to cut seals (climax), then carried forward as a guiding tool (closure). It appears in at least four distinct beats, drives the central turn (seal-breaking), and its transformation from commanding spiral to light-catching curve is irreplaceable. Removing it breaks both plot and thematic logic. High integration, strong causal linkage, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Creative destruction" is dramatized: Mara breaks the crozier to build something truer, destruction completes creation when the furnace collapses to glass. The concept shapes her tactic (filing down the hook, controlled fracture) and directly alters options at closure (seals burned, old future loosened). It is thematized explicitly ("the kind that tears down a form") yet also enacted on the page with cost. Strong integration, though one line of exposition slightly lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears as descriptor (para 2, para 15) but does not visibly constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Mara's "tears at attention" and her voice staying steady are present, yet the trait itself remains label-only; no beat shows her sensitivity enabling one move while her stoicism blocks another. Functional but swappable with "determined" or "conflicted." Mid-band, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vivify" appears when Mara drips tinctures to vivify the cooling alloy (middle beat). The action is dramatized, and the crozier's pale heat afterward ("like ice lit from within") follows causally. It shapes one major beat but is not the sole driver of the seal-breaking turn—reshaping and heating also contribute. Causal role is clear, yet easily swappable with "charge" or "infuse" without breaking structure. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Successive approximation" is signaled early ("measure, note, correction, next measure"), shapes Mara's tactic (inching toward change, letting error become instruction), and the final transformation validates the method (tinctures as "careful guesses refined again and again"). It appears in setup, middle, and implicitly at closure. Removing it collapses the story's methodological spine. High integration, strong causal linkage, closure-relevant.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies the furnace pit, ember breath, and basalt that enable heating and transformation. It is anchored early (twilight, slag dunes, rings), pressures choices (Mara must use its heat), and the pit's collapse to glass completes the creative destruction at closure. The "frozen bloom leaning closer" charges the final image. Strong across setup, middle, and payoff; micro-setting (furnace pit) constrains tactics and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the penny drops" marks Jun's realization (middle beat), a clear moment of understanding that alters his stance. Time otherwise progresses as twilight drains to violet, providing atmosphere but no tight clock. The phrase itself is idiomatic and signals the pivot, yet it is brief and does not recur or tighten decisions elsewhere. One-beat causal role; functional but not indispensable. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Interrupt a stifling destiny" is stated early (para 4) and dramatized: Mara breaks the crozier, reshapes it, burns the charter seals, and admits fear while acting. Her motivation drives every choice, and the old future loosening at closure is the direct payoff. The friction between wanting freedom and fearing punishment is visible on the page. Strong setup, causal middle pressure, and closure linkage. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Frozen bloom" anchors the opening image (frost holding heat and grief) and returns when the nexus leans closer during transformation, charging the atmosphere. Tone is consistent—lyric, measured, elegiac—and modulates with rising pressure (heating, striking, seal-breaking) without breaking register. The phrase itself reweights the ending's cold-light imagery. Strong early–final reprise; tone supports closure without becoming static.</comment>
