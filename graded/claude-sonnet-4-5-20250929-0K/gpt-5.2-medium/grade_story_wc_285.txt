<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is grounded in grief and embodied through the yarn needle, creating clear stakes. His "closely attentive" trait manifests in concrete observations (wet boots, salt-stiff sleeves) that drive plot decisions. Senn's admission feels slightly convenient but serves the causal chain. Minor weakness: Mara remains more symbol than person, though the scope allows this.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with visible cost: Senn speaks the erasure aloud, Mara returns, and Rowan's anger "percolates down" into something portable—a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses vengeance. The causal lens holds: palimpsest → ferryman's condition → spoken truth → return. Orientation is swift (coachman, fog-bound crossing, evening rain). One meaningful tightening when the gutters near silence forces the crossing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog-bound crossing, gutter-tick, and ferryman's condition create spatial and temporal constraint that tightens the final beat. The yarn needle as micro-setting object charges the vellum-reading and final scratch. Sensory hierarchy is strong: spindrift, lamp halos, barley tea percolating. The river-mist bargain and Gloom Hill anchor setting in stakes rather than postcard detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Mara—is signaled early and tightens when the gutter-tick countdown begins. Rowan's demand that Senn strip the promise to "names, not seals" is agency that narrows options and forces cost. The fog's release of Mara after Senn's confession is earned by the setup. Visible price: Senn's admission, Rowan's anger transformed but not erased.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the palimpsest conceit: promises are "never erased but clarified." The yarn needle tracing scars, the percolating tea, and the final vellum scratch form a coherent pattern without moralizing. Rowan's task—"keep driving, closely attentive"—answers the thematic question through image and action. The line "I owe, I repent, I restore" risks explicitness but remains diegetic and tied to Senn's arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "spindrift serenity," "scabbed and scraped," "arguments and paperwork collapse into one simple fact." Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Rowan. Senn's speech ("I traded Mara for my office") feels slightly templated for a high-pressure confession but serves the causal need. Minor register drift: "ambient awareness" and "distill complexity into essence" edge toward prompt echo rather than Rowan's idiom under duress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Density is high; most lines advance image, character, or stakes. Figurative language clusters in the opening ("lamp halos," "spindrift serenity," "scabbed and scraped") without overwriting peak beats. Minor loop: "closely attentive" and "ambient awareness" recur as labels rather than varied embodiment. The final sentence runs long with stacked clauses ("keep driving, closely attentive, until dawn rinsed...") that slightly dull propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The palimpsest-as-contract and yarn-needle tactility transform familiar supernatural-bargain territory into something specific and grounded. The gutter-tick countdown and ferryman's river-current rule add fresh procedural constraint. Risk: the prompt elements (gloom-hill coachman, ambient awareness, percolate) are visible seams but integrated well enough that the synthesis feels purposeful rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rowan drives two key beats: tracing the vellum with the needle to uncover the bargain, then demanding Senn speak the erasure aloud. His choice to wrap Mara and drive toward Gloom Hill closes the arc. The coachman role supplies the ferry transit and the "keep driving" final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The yarn needle appears in three beats: drawn from coat and used to trace the vellum scars, set on table "like a compass," then used to scratch away the final blessing. It charges closure by linking Mara's net-mending past to the vellum's erasure. Slightly ornamental in the "compass" beat but functional overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise is the story's engine: Rowan recognizes it, traces hidden layers, demands its spoken essence, and Senn's confession fulfills the bargain. The concept shapes every tactical choice and delivers the closure when the erasure is completed on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" is seeded early ("by trade and by grief") and shown in the bridgehouse observations (wet boots, salt sleeves, gutter echoes). It enables the vellum tracing and the ferry crossing under "ambient awareness." The trait is more demonstrated than constraining; no visible cost tied to hyper-attention itself, only enablement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Percolate" appears twice: barley tea percolating on the stove (ambient detail) and anger "percolate down into something he could carry." The second use charges the emotional closure but the action itself is metaphorical rather than plot-driving. Swappable with "settle" or "distill" without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named twice and demonstrated in the bridgehouse cataloging and the ferry crossing ("current, rope, and breath"). It shapes Rowan's method of reading the scene and steering through fog. The mechanics are shown but the phrase itself reads slightly like a prompt label rather than organic idiom.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing supplies the ferryman's condition (current won't settle until rain stops), the spatial bottleneck that forces confrontation, and the fog that releases Mara. The crossing is indispensable to stakes, tactics, and closure; removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-gutter countdown tightens the middle and ending: "last thin drips slowed," "first moment of silence arrived after the rain gutters stop ticking." It forces the ferry crossing and times Mara's return. The ticking is tracked across three beats and alters tactics, though slightly mechanical as a device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To distill complexity into essence" is stated in the opening and fulfilled when Rowan demands the promise be "stripped to its essence and spoken aloud with no ornament." The motivation drives his confrontation with Senn. The phrase itself leans abstract and prompt-like; dramatization is stronger than the label.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" bookends the story (opening and closing lines) and colors the fog imagery. The tone is poetic and consistent but largely atmospheric rather than modulating under pressure. The final image recharges it, lifting the score, but it remains more lyric texture than stakes-shaping force.</comment>
