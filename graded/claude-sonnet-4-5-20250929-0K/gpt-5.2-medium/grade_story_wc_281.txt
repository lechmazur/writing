<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's affectionate-skeptic trait is embodied early (hugs friends, doubts miracles) and drives her empirical test design rather than dismissal. Her squeeze of Jory's hand and choice to test rather than believe show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final refusal-hug of the lawyer lands with character consistency. However, her arc from skepticism to "learned to listen for paths" feels more like thematic assertion than earned transformation; the specific cost of her stance shift remains unclear on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Mara, studio, post-Static). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: Jory's somatic markers → lattice test → muscovite split → route discovery → tunnel photo → public exhibit protocol. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's protocol offer and refusal to sell the negatives crystallizes her stance with social and professional cost (defying recall company). The cost is felt but not fully dramatized; the final "learned to listen for paths" operates more as conceptual repricing than embodied consequence, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The studio setting is anchored early and provides concrete resources (violet wand, camera sensor, darkroom) that enable the lattice test and photo archive. The muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting, constraining how light splits and enabling the fractal route discovery. Spatial choreography during the square-walk test and tunnel expedition remains clear. The willowglass-hope motif recurs but does not visibly alter a choice at closure, limiting its charge. The exhibit wall functions thematically but lacks direct pressure on Mara's final negotiation with the recall company.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (test the recall effect, preserve agency for recalled users) is signaled by paragraph two. Pressure escalates through Jory's plea → Mara's empirical test → recall agents' arrival → tunnel expedition proving utility → company buyout attempt. The final refusal carries professional and legal risk, foreclosing the safe path. Jory's agency is genuine (he volunteers, navigates by markers), and Mara's protocol offer is her own tactical pivot. However, the recall agents' "polite threats" and company lawyer encounter lack on-page friction; the conflict resolution feels compressed rather than tested, capping escalation credit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: somatic markers as "shortcuts between panic and care," the fractal lattice as paths rather than voices, and the final image of shared protocol as collective listening. The muscovite's fracturing recurs with shifted meaning (light memory → route map → willowglass hope). Mara's final smile and refusal to confirm telepathy answers the central question obliquely without moralizing. Minor drag: "willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken" in the penultimate sentence edges toward overt thematic statement where the image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mara's empirical attention to bodies, light, and patterns). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Jory's plea and Mara's refusal/protocol offer advance plot. However, the prose carries mild template cadence and elevated diction throughout ("affectionate skeptic who hugged friends first," "willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken") that feels more constructed than voice-particular. The final "what mattered was that, after the shock, they had learned to listen for paths" reads as thematic closure rather than Mara's idiolect under pressure, slightly flattening immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences multi-task (e.g., the muscovite gift anchors father, tool function, and thematic image in one paragraph). Syntax varies purposefully, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, the prose carries mild overwriting: "fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "tiny repeating forks," and stacked metaphors ("map under his skin," "lattice of light," "nest of melted cables") in quick succession elevate register without clear POV motivation. Paraphrase appears: "hidden pathways" recurs across four beats without functional shift. The penultimate sentence's "willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken" adds figurative density at closure without necessity, slightly dulling propulsion. No major loops, but cumulative decorative weight −0.6 to −0.8 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy-pill recall, light painting, somatic markers, and muscovite geode feels purposeful rather than checklist; each element constrains tactics (e.g., somatic markers enable empirical test, muscovite splits light to reveal hidden routes). The premise—testing recall victims through embodied sensation rather than interrogation—offers a fresh angle on post-event paranoia. The fractal-route discovery and public-exhibit protocol are specific, non-obvious outcomes. Risk-taking in structure (sustained Accumulative pressure without set-piece confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "affectionate skeptic" and "willowglass hope" labels edge toward prompt-fulfillment rather than organic voice, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (affectionate skeptic) is present throughout. Setup: introduced paragraph one. Development: her skepticism drives the empirical square-walk test (paragraph six), and her choice to hide photos from agents alters tactics (paragraph nine). Payoff: her refusal to sell negatives and protocol offer shape the ending directly (final two paragraphs). Her trait constrains choices (she requires proof, devises tests, offers care) and enables the closure stance. Cost is visible (defying recall company, professional risk). Two beats + closure linkage + causal pressure + specificity → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver: Setup (paragraph five, gift from father, catches light fractally). Development: inserted over lens during Jory's test, splits lattice into repeating forks that reveal the warehouse route (paragraph eight). Payoff: the final offer includes "let the muscovite sliver break every bright stroke into willowglass hope" (penultimate sentence), directly shaping the protocol and closure image. Three beats + causal pressure (enables route discovery) + closure linkage + irreplaceability (fractal property matters) + cost connection (protocol depends on it) → 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall: Setup (paragraph two, manufacturer recall, callers claim thought-hearing). Development: recall agents arrive with threats (paragraph nine), pressuring Mara to hide evidence. Payoff: recall company attempts buyout, Mara refuses, company insists recall requires "full compliance" (final paragraphs). The concept frames the dominant stake (preserve agency, test the effect) and the antagonist pressure. Two beats + closure linkage + causal pressure (shapes Mara's goal and final conflict) → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fractally precise: appears once in paragraph five ("mica sheets caught light in fractures that looked fractally precise") and returns in paragraph eight ("the lattice split into tiny repeating forks"). The fractal property enables the route discovery (precision reveals hidden paths) but is not explicitly tested or shown to constrain an action with trade-off. Setup + development (one beat) + specificity (precision matters) but no visible cost or second distinct beat → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Devise: Setup (paragraph six, Mara "began to devise a test"). Development: the devised square-walk test yields the lattice (paragraph seven), and she later "devised a public exhibit" (paragraph eleven). Payoff: her final offer is "her protocol" (paragraph twelve), the devised method that shapes closure. Three beats + causal pressure (test changes tactics, exhibit becomes the solution) + closure linkage + irreplaceability (the devising action defines her agency) → 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through somatic markers: Setup (paragraph six, "somatic markers, the way a body tags choices with sensations"). Development: Jory steps when ribs warm, stops when wrists chill (paragraph seven); the markers serve as compass in the tunnel (paragraph ten). Payoff: Mara's public exhibit interprets "the new sensitivity through somatic markers" (paragraph twelve), directly shaping the protocol. Three beats + causal pressure (enables test, navigation, and solution) + closure linkage + specificity (the mechanism matters) → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Light painting studio: Setup (paragraph one, Mara reopens studio on Harbor Street). Development: studio houses the violet wand, camera, and darkroom where the lattice test occurs (paragraphs six-eight); recall agents visit there (paragraph nine). Payoff: Mara pins photos "at the studio" (paragraph eleven) and calls other users there for sessions. Two beats + setting enables key action (test) and provides resources, but does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off or directly charge the final image → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>After the Static Shock: Setup (opening sentence, "After the Static Shock"). Development: burn marks from the Shock on Jory (paragraph six), melted cables still sizzling in tunnel (paragraph ten). The timeframe establishes causality (Shock enabled pill ingestion, caused infrastructure damage) but does not tighten decisions with a live clock or deadline. Two beats + causal framing but no escalation pressure from time itself → 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To illuminate hidden pathways: Setup (paragraph six, Jory begs Mara "to illuminate hidden pathways"). Development: Mara's violet-wand drawing illuminates the lattice (paragraph seven), and the fractal route discovery illuminates the tunnel path (paragraph eight). Payoff: the public exhibit creates "a map" that illuminates stress signals for crews (paragraph eleven), and the final line reframes pathways as listening (paragraph thirteen). Three beats + causal pressure (desire drives test, route discovery, and exhibit) + closure linkage + cost (professional risk, defying recall company) → 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Willowglass hope: First appears paragraph eleven ("willow branches etched in glassy neon" as camouflage for photos). Returns in penultimate sentence ("willowglass hope, delicate but unbroken") as tonal anchor for the protocol and closure image. The tone modulates through turns (skepticism → empirical care → defiance) and charges the final image with fragile resilience. Setup + payoff (lyric reprise) + tone coherence + closure linkage, but mid-scene absence and late coinage limit irreplaceability → 6.1.</comment>
