<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and driven by a clear hierarchy of values—restoring masks, honoring the dead, breaking a family vow—but the motivation shift at "the secret the elders never said aloud" arrives late and feels more asserted than earned through prior contradiction. The ancestor connection reframes stakes, yet the protagonist's emotional progression from hired restorer to family liberator lacks visible micro-choices that demonstrate cost before the final act. Embodied emotion is present ("hands shook," "heart raced") but leans toward stock reactions under pressure. The final renunciation of the family vow carries weight, though the protagonist's internal conflict between duty and compassion could have been dramatized earlier to deepen the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the interlaced hush thickens through knot-unraveling beats, and the final image—spirits dropping, sanctuary breathing—reweights the premise with visible cost (ancestor bound into mask, vow broken). Orientation anchors promptly (prism sanctuary, midnight, quartz staircase). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist discovers the storm-spirit is their ancestor, narrowing the choice to personal sacrifice. The closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the sanctuary shifts from haunted to inhabited, and the protagonist's act forecloses the family's fear-fed pattern. Minor causality slip: the elders' half-whispered secret and the protagonist's agreement to exhume feel under-motivated in setup, slightly weakening the before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly realized—angled walls bending starlight, quartz staircase, salt mirrors—and the setting constrains the protagonist's choices (descent to slab, needle work in the burial chamber). The tapestry needle and the net function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through urgency (hush "pressed back, dense as wool"). Minor dock: the sanctuary's spatial choreography is mostly clear, but the transition from slab to chamber and the spirits' simultaneous presence above the slab and later dropping "to the floor" introduces a slight spatial ambiguity. Tone (lucid unrest) is well-supported by setting; the environment actively participates in escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the storm-spirit to ground wandering dead—is signaled early and sustained. The knot-unraveling sequence provides one meaningful tightening when the protagonist learns the spirit is their ancestor, forcing a trade-off between vow and liberation. Agency is clear in the choice to speak the true name and stitch the breath into the mask. Cost is legible: the family vow is broken, the ancestor is bound anew (though voluntarily), and the protagonist forecloses the hush-feeding pattern. Escalation under the Accumulative lens succeeds through density increase (each knot releases sound, spirits gather, starlight wraps wrists). Minor gap: the spirits' restlessness and the protagonist's courage faltering feel declared more than tested through competing on-page pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: vows made of fear keep the dead unmoored, faces must meet air, silence as prison versus choice. The final image—freed spirits lying among salt mirrors, sanctuary "inhabited rather than haunted"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The tapestry needle, net, and masks accrue symbolic weight through repeated use and shifting function. Subtext operates in the protagonist's whispered name, the ancestor's choice to flow into the mask, and the dissolved rope as "forgiven." One minor slip: "every mask I repaired taught me faces are meant to meet air" leans slightly toward thematic articulation, though it remains tied to the protagonist's craft rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (the protagonist notices masks, knots, sound). Narrative distance modulates purposefully under pressure (close during knot-work, slightly elevated during the ancestor's appearance). Diction fits the restorer's craft idiom ("porcelain and resin," "stitching the storm-spirit's breath"). Two voice slips: "lucid unrest" in paragraph 12 reads as externally imposed descriptor rather than character-filtered perception, and "across sharing a secret" (used twice) is a non-idiomatic construction that disrupts the otherwise grounded voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one moment ("their lucid unrest made my vision sharp") straddles uncertain psychic distance. Rhythm under pressure is controlled, with sentence length varying to match urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows vivid imagery ("heart of stormlight," "figure of rain and lantern-glow") and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, action, or stakes. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) "across sharing a secret" is used identically in paragraphs 6 and 15, creating a template-cadence artifact that reads as unrevised scaffold; (2) several figurative constructions in rapid succession ("interlaced hush," "prismatic threads," "heart of stormlight," "lantern-glow") approach density overload in the closure sequence without clear pattern-teaching; (3) minor clarity slip in "spirits dropped softly to the floor" when the spatial relationship between slab, chamber, and floor is not fully established. Propulsion is strong; paragraph cut test passes. Accumulation cap applies: three issues = −2.0 from a baseline ~8.9, yielding 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration, storm-spirit burial, and fisherman's net as grief-trap is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar haunting setup through the protagonist's craft-based agency (tapestry needle, knot-unraveling) and the familial vow twist. Emotional specificity is present in the protagonist's conflicted relationship with ancestor and elders. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Minor limitation: the priest-versus-truth framing ("They were wrong about one thing") and the sanctuary-as-gem metaphor lean toward familiar fantasy templates, though the restorer angle and the interlaced hush concept add freshness. The final image—sanctuary breathing, spirits choosing to rest—offers a satisfying inversion of the haunted-space trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken mask restorer is introduced in the second sentence and their craft expertise drives key turns: agreeing to exhume (paragraph 5), using the needle to unravel knots (paragraphs 11–13), and stitching the storm-spirit's breath into the mask (paragraph 18). The protagonist's final choice to break the family vow and speak their true name (paragraph 15) is causally rooted in their craft philosophy ("faces are meant to meet air"). The character's occupation is indispensable to the story's logic and closure. Three gates met: setup (early), development (needle work across middle beats), payoff (mask restoration completes the closure). Causal pressure is strong; specificity high; cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in paragraph 5 (worn on a cord), is used to unravel the first knot in paragraph 11, and touches the stormlight heart in paragraph 17. It returns in the mask-stitching beat (paragraph 18) with reweighted meaning—transitioning from unmaking tool to restoration tool. Three gates met, two distinct beats, closure linkage present. The needle's unique property (ability to tease knots by feel) enables the protagonist's approach. Minor limitation: the needle's function in paragraph 17 ("touched that heart with the needle") is slightly underspecified compared to the detailed knot-work; clearer mechanics would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The interlaced hush is introduced in paragraph 3, frames the central problem (spirits can't touch ground), and its mechanics shape every beat: the protagonist must unravel the net to release the suffocated storm-spirit's breath (paragraphs 7–8), the hush presses back during descent (paragraph 10), and when the net is finally opened the hush "snapped…into breathing" (paragraph 17). The concept redefines the sanctuary's nature at closure (paragraph 23: "quiet no longer a prison but a choice"). Three gates met robustly; causal pressure across at least four beats; closure image directly charged by the concept's transformation. Irreplaceable and essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is dramatized on the page: the hush thickens each year (paragraph 7), presses back "dense as wool" when the protagonist listens at the slab (paragraph 10), and the sanctuary's walls "stopped hoarding silence" after the net is opened (paragraph 19). The attribute constrains tactics (the protagonist must work by feel in paragraph 11 because sound is muted) and the cost of ending accumulation is visible (the spirits drop, the sanctuary shifts from haunted to inhabited). Three gates met; two beats where the attribute alters action; closure linkage strong. The attribute is core to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exhumation is the protagonist's agreed action in paragraph 5, structures the descent sequence (paragraphs 10–16), and the act of opening the burial chamber (paragraph 16) triggers the story's climax. The exhumation is not swappable—removing it would collapse the plot's spatial and causal logic. Three gates met; the action appears in or shapes at least four beats (agreement, descent, slab opening, aftermath). The method (unraveling rather than cutting) is essential to the exhumation's success and tied to the protagonist's craft. High causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is visible (vow broken, ancestor bound anew).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The centuries-old fisherman's net is mentioned in paragraph 7 (burial trap), appears physically in paragraph 16 (still wet, cradling stormlight), and the unraveling-by-knots method is executed across paragraphs 11–15. The method's mechanics matter: each knot releases a syllable, and the protagonist must unravel (not cut) because "the trap was tied by human fear" (paragraph 9). The net returns in paragraph 18 (threads pulled for mask stitching) and dissolves in paragraph 21 ("strand of net…dissolved into soil like forgiven rope"). Three gates met; method shapes tactics across multiple beats; closure image directly includes the net's transformation. Specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is established in the opening line and its unique properties (angled walls bending starlight, quartz staircase, salt mirrors) constrain and enable the protagonist's choices throughout. Starlight functions as a pressure element (paragraph 13: "prismatic threads…wrapped around my wrists, urging me to finish") and the sanctuary's shift from "haunted" to "inhabited" charges the final image (paragraph 23). The setting provides the burial chamber, the descent path, and the physical context for the spirits' manifestation. Three gates met; setting shapes at least three beats and the closure effect. Micro-setting (body, needle, net) also qualifies and is tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" appears twice (paragraphs 6 and 15) as a timeframe marker. The phrase is non-standard and its mechanics are unclear—does sharing take hours, minutes, or a ritual duration? The story's main timeline is a single night (midnight descent to dawn), which is tracked clearly, but "across sharing a secret" does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in a legible way. It reads more as thematic flavor than a functional clock. Two gates met (setup and payoff via reprise), but the timeframe does not constrain a middle choice. Swappable with "during the exhumation" or similar. Lyric resonance is present but pressure function is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to ground restless spirits is introduced in paragraph 4 and drives the protagonist's agreement (paragraph 5), the descent (paragraph 10), and the choice to finish unraveling despite fear (paragraphs 14–15). The motivation is tested when the protagonist learns the storm-spirit is their ancestor (paragraph 14), creating friction between family duty and the spirits' need. The final act (stitching the breath into the mask, paragraph 18) directly fulfills the motivation, and the spirits' grounding is shown on the page (paragraph 17: "spirits dropped softly to the floor"). Three gates met; motivation drives at least three key beats; cost is visible (vow broken). Specificity and causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lucid unrest is established early ("hands shook because the air itself seemed to accumulate silence," paragraph 2) and sustained through the piece via diction ("restless," "bright and restless," paragraph 4; "lucid unrest," paragraph 12) and rhythm (varied sentence length, urgent syntax during knot-work). The tone modulates under pressure—calm in the opening, tense during descent, charged at the climax—and charges the final image ("ordinary air," paragraph 24, contrasts with prior thickness). The tone is coherent across turns and fits the accumulative lens. Minor slip: "lucid unrest" in paragraph 12 reads as a label rather than an embodied tonal effect. Three gates met; tone shapes reader experience across beats and closure.</comment>
