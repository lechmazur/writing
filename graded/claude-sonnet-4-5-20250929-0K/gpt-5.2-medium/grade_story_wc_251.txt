<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and his listening ability is consistent, but his interior contradiction is minimal—he moves smoothly from observation to plan to execution without genuine struggle. The students remain undifferentiated save for their collective excitement, and the mayor's shift feels more convenient than earned; her nephew mention arrives late and does little causal work. The final choice (delay → land trust) lacks visible cost on Eli's part; he offers tea and a question, and the system bends.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through synchronized display and the final canopy image. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (library, Harbor Street, Eli, chess club). The closure is a Decisive Change (council votes to keep the grove), but the cost is externalized to the mayor's memory rather than Eli's sacrifice, and the because/therefore chain from grotto magnetism to window timing to vote outcome relies on summarized causality ("passersby began to walk the pattern"). The final paragraph compresses the vote and outcome in two beats of tell, diluting on-page presence of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library, mist, Harbor Street grid, and magnetic grotto are vividly anchored with sensory specificity (blue stone swallowing sound, black ore tugging metal). The grotto's magnetic pull constrains the plan's timing mechanism, directly shaping tactics. Spatial choreography across town windows and the cliff-to-street sightline remain clear. Minor slip: "watery stars" and "amplified quiet" veer toward stock lyricism without adding sensory concreteness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the grove) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the synchronized windows compel the mayor to walk into the library, but escalation is largely offstage—we're told "unspoken irritation turn[ed]...into curiosity" and that the mayor saw the display, then proposed a delay. No on-page reversal tests Eli's commitment; coincidence (the mayor's childhood memory) resolves the conflict without visible cost to the protagonist. The midnight grotto assembly and text-trigger are clever tactics but do not narrow Eli's options or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (influence as gentle pressure, second thoughts vs. easy damage) emerges from chess metaphor and window-board imagery without overt statement. The final canopy-over-sapling image and "what kind of town built a future by erasing its shade" line pose the thematic question concretely. However, the ending lands as a tidy moral victory—"their rebellion complete and humble as a pawn that reaches the far rank"—that borders on theme summary rather than resonant ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but does not resist resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable psychic distance and Eli's perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words). The mayor's interiority at the library steps ("her unspoken memory of climbing those same trees") breaches focalization briefly, though the effect reads as Eli's inference. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, but some register drift appears: "amplified quiet," "forests of second thoughts," "the hush where past meets prophecy" feel more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "what kind of town...") and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "Eli heard the unspoken..." appears three times in similar constructions, creating a template cadence. "Cradled" (magnets, tin) repeats twice in identical syntax. Mixed metaphor: mist that "swallow[s] sound and return[s] it as an amplified quiet" contradicts itself (swallowing precludes return). Figurative language clusters in the opening and grotto beats without always clarifying ("mist outside into watery stars," "hush where past meets prophecy"). No paraphrase loops, and sequence clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The chess-as-activism frame and synchronized window tactic offer a fresh synthesis, and the magnetic grotto timing cue is a specific, non-obvious choice. However, the emotional arc (committed teacher organizes peaceful protest, mayor remembers childhood, council votes to preserve nature) follows a familiar template of grassroots-wins-over-power without complicating the moral calculus or risking failure. The story commits fully to its premise but the resolution's tidiness and the mayor's convenient nephew connection reduce risk and surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli is present throughout, frames the plan, leads students to the grotto, texts shopkeepers, and meets the mayor. His coaching role motivates the synchronized-display method and his listening trait enables the plan's inception. His choices create the key turn (window activation → mayor's visit). Visible cost is low—he offers tea and a question—but his agency drives all three beats (setup, grotto execution, mayor meeting) and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in the grotto scene (~midpoint), where its ore pulls metal pieces into alignment, providing the natural metronome for the plan's timing. This is one functional beat with causal pressure (timing cue). It does not reappear or gain reweighted meaning at closure; the ending focuses on the mayor's memory and the vote, not the grotto. Introduced near the middle, used once with mechanical necessity, then absent from the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named in paragraph one ("he planned a humble rebellion that would move like a quiet combination") and shapes the method: non-shouting, synchronized, chess-patterned protest. It governs tactics (window displays over confrontation) and echoes in the ending ("their rebellion complete and humble as a pawn"). The concept frames stakes and approach but is largely described rather than tested; no moment forces Eli to choose humility over a louder path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Eli "hears unspoken words" in paragraph one, enabling him to learn of the dawn vote and later sense the council's irritation-to-curiosity shift and the mayor's memory. The trait is told three times but only the initial beat (learning of the vote) is causal; the later instances describe reactions Eli observes indirectly. No on-page cost or constraint tied to this ability; it functions as narrative convenience rather than a trait with tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears twice: Eli cradles the tin of magnets in the grotto, feeling the cave's pull, then cradles it again during the tea meeting with the mayor, "letting their weight remind him that influence could be gentle and still hold." The action links the grotto beat to the closure conversation and charges the theme of gentle pressure. It is specific and irreplaceable in those two moments, but does not drive a major turn; the mayor's decision traces more to her memory than to Eli's gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synchronized window displays are introduced in paragraph two (Eli's notebook, students painting squares), executed in the grotto beat (text-triggered activation), developed across the middle (midgame knights, drawn trunk), and present at closure (final canopy flip, mayor's reaction, vote). The method shapes all three gates, drives the escalation, and enables the ending. Its mechanics (magnetic timing, painted squares, notation) matter on the page. High specificity and beat involvement; the story's logic depends on this exact tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library is anchored in the opening (blue stone, amplified quiet, map room with stained windows) and returns at closure (mayor walks into the library, Eli offers tea there). Its quiet atmosphere supports the tone and humble-rebellion theme; the map room provides the planning space. The setting enables the meeting that secures the vote. It does not constrain choices under pressure, but its presence in setup, planning, and resolution elevates integration beyond mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is named once during the midnight grotto scene and described as a feared interval when tide pauses. It sets atmosphere but does not tighten decisions—Eli could have chosen any night, and no on-page cost derives from this specific timing. The dawn vote creates urgency, but "past meets prophecy" remains ornamental phrasing without mechanical stakes. Introduced late (grotto beat) and absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Plant forests of second thoughts" is stated in paragraph one as Eli's self-promise and dramatized through the window-display plan (each square carries "Think again"). The motivation drives his choice to act and shapes the method (puzzle-solving to generate reflection). It lacks on-page friction—Eli never weighs personal cost or competing wants—but the desire is coherent across setup, execution, and the mayor's shift. The "admission was the first seed of a second thought" line ties motivation to effect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is introduced in the opening (library's effect on sound) and echoed at the tea meeting ("in that amplified quiet, what kind of town..."). Tone remains consistent—gentle, observational, non-confrontational—and modulates subtly as pressure rises (mist, starlight, hush). The final image (walking home under misty stars) maintains the quiet register. However, the tone does not sharply charge the closure; it supports rather than intensifies the ending's emotional weight.</comment>
