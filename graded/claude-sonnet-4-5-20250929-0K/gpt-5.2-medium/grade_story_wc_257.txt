<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's arc from "hands that still shook" to "subdued ardor" and "the steady heat of a forge kept low" is earned through concrete micro-choices: leaving birds, shaping the ring, standing within curtains. Internal contradiction appears when she admits lost faith yet immediately engages Sen's method, and the final image shows her meeting strangers with purpose "not their past," a credible renunciation of oblivion. The husband's imagined presence late in the piece adds embodied cost without therapy-speak. Minor: Lysa and other strangers remain functional but thin, limiting relationship crucible; Mara's jewelry-making identity is declared but not leveraged in her actions beyond ring-smithing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara moves from craving oblivion to meeting strangers "with subdued ardor," teaching intention-setting "not their past"—a visible stance shift with felt cost (husband's ashes carried, imagined beside her asking to "keep the light from spilling into harm"). Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: paper birds seed across beats, density increases as strangers arrive, cadence shifts to "bloom was a craft." Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, observatory, after rock bottom). One meaningful deepening: from her first bird/Lysa to the line of strangers, reweighting survival as craft. The husband's imagined constraint ("use it instead like solder") charges the final image. Causality is loose but accumulative pressure coheres under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's "brass instruments never tarnished," "stone floor held the cool of all winters," and dome that opens to rearranging constellations establish timeless constraint and tone early. Micro-setting details—curtains of intention, meteorite filings, the pot of basil under telescope—constrain Mara's ritual choices and supply resources (lamp, stencil projection). Spatial choreography mostly tracks (hanging cloths around central telescope, control room, dome), though the line of strangers arriving is staged generically. The basil pot and ring return charged at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's jeweler attention (soldering, polishing, etching). No occupational depth beyond jewelry basics, but germane to conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mara's pull toward oblivion versus finding direction after rock bottom. One meaningful tightening: Sen's origami method transforms her isolated grief into outward teaching, narrowing her options from passive despair to active craft. Lysa's arrival and the basil sprout crystallize the method's cost and efficacy, foreclosing retreat. The imagined husband's constraint ("keep the light from spilling into harm") adds moral calculus. Agency is renunciation and endurance with visible cost (carrying ashes, "the old hunger for oblivion loosen its grip"). The strangers' arrival escalates via accumulation under the Accumulative lens. No explicit antagonist; coincidence (birds found) complicates but does not resolve—Mara still must perform the ritual and teach each person.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief and survival as craft, artificial means enabling organic renewal—emerges through particulars: lab-grown opals, alloyed gold, stencil-etched coordinates, the basil coaxed by cold starbeam. "Bloom was a craft" and "what was genuinely artificial" anchor the thematic question without moralizing. The final image of Mara meeting strangers "with subdued ardor…showing each person how to stand within the curtains and set a small intention" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forward motion as repetition and teaching, not redemption. The husband's imagined presence asking her to "use it instead like solder to join broken days" seeds metaphor that pays off at closure. Minor: "grief made people crave what was pure and natural" briefly edges toward thesis statement but is grounded in Mara's own jewelry practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable distance and filters perception through Mara's jeweler idiom ("every pendant…a small coffin, each clasp a promise"). Diction remains elevated but consistent: "subdued ardor," "muted glow," "narrow corridor of shadow and light." Lysa's brief dialogue ("how anything could live again") feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure ("imagined her husband beside her"). Two weaknesses: the long opening sentence stacks abstractions ("mornings she wished she could forget," "ashes she carried in a jar of salt") without immediate spatial grounding, causing brief orientation lag; Sen's exposition about curtains is functional but borders on tour-guide voice. Under pressure, voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "She was a mourning jewelry maker, and every pendant she had ever soldered now felt like a small coffin, each clasp a promise she had failed to keep" front-loads metaphor before spatial anchor. "Subdued ardor, the steady heat of a forge kept low" stacks near-synonyms. Figurative density in most sentences of the opening and Lysa's arrival beats (curtains "woven to respond," "folds were set with purpose," "bend starlight into an answer, or into a wound") without crisp payoff. Paraphrase loop: "teach…that even at the end of oneself there remained a direction" recaps prior "paper birds that would guide the desperate" without added pressure. Template cadence: "From a box…shaped…set it…used the stencil…stepped between…whispered…pulled…aligning" chains actions in identical stems. Clarity survives but momentum drags. No pronoun confusion; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" that bend starlight via projection and origami birds seeding coordinates offer a fresh synthesis of craft-magic and grief-work, avoiding pure fantasy convenience by grounding in Mara's jewelry skill (meteorite filings, etched ring band). The basil-as-verdict and "bloom was a craft" turn a familiar metaphor specific through ritual mechanics. Transformation test partially satisfied: the observatory's timeless setting and stencil-driven ritual feel particular to this voice. Proximity check clean. Risk: the accumulative structure and subdued tone elevate stakes without gimmickry. Deduction: the "teach withering to bloom" frame echoes workshop templates (mentor teaches strangers hope through symbolic objects), and Sen's exposition about curtains reads like prompt-filling. The husband's imagined presence is emotionally honest but not wholly original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all major turns: admits lost faith, accepts Sen's method, leaves first bird, performs ritual for Lysa, imagines husband's constraint, begins leaving more birds, meets the line of strangers. Setup immediate (first sentence identifies her). Development across multiple beats (bird-leaving, ring-making, curtain alignment, teaching). Closure: she actively meets strangers "with subdued ardor," teaching intention-setting—agency visible and tied to her mourning-jeweler identity (solder metaphor). Cost legible: carrying ashes, imagining husband, "old hunger for oblivion loosen its grip." Irreplaceable: only a jeweler mourning her husband would forge rings with meteorite and etch coordinates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stencil appears in two beats: Sen offers it (setup ~15%), Mara uses it to project inked petals onto curtains and etch the ring's inner band (middle). It enables the ritual but does not return charged at closure; final image focuses on Mara teaching within curtains, no stencil mention. Causal role: without it, the basil-constellation etching and curtain pattern-catching would not occur. Swappable concern: another template or pattern source could serve similar function with minor edits. Cost tied: the etching maps "where no one else could see her trying," but that cost belongs to Lysa, not Mara. Late payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Curtains of intention frame the core mechanic: Sen explains they "respond to whoever stood within them" and "bend starlight into an answer, or into a wound." Mara uses them twice on-page: aligns them for Lysa's basil (middle), then shows strangers "how to stand within the curtains and set a small intention" (closure). Setup early (~20%). Development: curtains narrow Mara's ritual tactics (pull into corridor, align telescope). Closure: teaching strangers to use them defines her new stance. Irreplaceable: removing curtains breaks the intention-setting ritual and the "bend starlight" logic. Cost: Mara must stand within to perform, constraining her physically and emotionally. Minor: the phrase "curtains of intention" borders on label-convenience but the physical choreography (hanging cloths, folds catching pattern) grounds it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" shapes one key beat: Mara tells Lysa "survival often depended on what was genuinely artificial: lab-grown opals, alloyed gold, a practiced smile, and rules for breathing when the world felt poisoned." She then forges a ring with lab-grown opal and alloyed materials (implicit). Setup ~40% (mid-story). Development: the trait justifies her craft-based survival method and enables the ring-making action. Closure linkage indirect: the attribute underpins "bloom was a craft" at the end but is not named again. Cost: Mara must accept artificial means counter to "what was pure and natural" cravings, a conceptual tradeoff visible in her teaching. Swappable concern moderate: another paradoxical attribute could serve, but the opal/gold specificity ties to her jeweler identity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Illuminate drives two major beats: Mara "illuminate[s] the vellum stencil from behind with a lamp, letting the inked petals project onto the curtains" to prepare the ritual, then "aligning the telescope until a cold starbeam struck the pot, warmed, and coaxed a single green point to rise" (Lysa's basil). Setup implicit in "the place had forgotten how to aim its light." Development: illumination is the method's hinge—without it, no pattern projection, no starbeam warming, no sprout. Closure: teaching strangers "the observatory could illuminate their next step, not their past" reprises the action thematically. Cost: Mara must master the lamp/telescope alignment, a tactile skill tied to her jeweler precision. Irreplaceable: removing illuminate requires rewriting the entire ritual mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Origami figures with coordinates appear in setup (Sen proposes the method ~25%), development (Mara leaves first crane, Lysa arrives clutching it), and closure (strangers learn "the birds meant a climb toward breath"). The method shapes all turns: it externalizes Mara's intention, guides Lysa to the observatory, and seeds the line of strangers. Causal necessity high: without birds, no Lysa, no teaching moment, no closure image of meeting strangers. Cost: Mara must repeatedly leave birds "in more ruined places," a physical and emotional commitment. Specificity: origami with coordinates inside is more irreplaceable than generic notes. Minor: the coordinates' exact function (map? star chart reference?) remains slightly vague, but the tactile bird-folding ties to craft theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Timeless observatory constrains all choices: brass instruments guide ritual, stone floor grounds physicality, dome opens to rearranging constellations enabling the starbeam. Setup immediate (second sentence). Development: hanging cloths, control room lamp, telescope alignment—each spatial feature shapes Mara's tactics. Closure: "meeting them…showing each person how to stand within the curtains" depends on observatory's physical arrangement. Irreplaceable: removing the observatory dismantles the entire ritual mechanic and symbolic resonance (timeless = outside linear grief). Cost: Mara must climb spiral stairs ("hands that still shook"), physically enacting ascent from rock bottom. The setting is not postcard; every detail (curtains, dome, meteorite filings) enables action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "after she hit rock bottom" anchors Mara's starting state (shaking hands, oblivion-craving) and justifies her receptivity to Sen's method. Setup immediate (first sentence). Development: the phrase does not create a ticking clock, but "rock bottom" as a before-state makes her climb and teaching a visible after-shift. Closure: meeting strangers shows she has moved past rock bottom into "subdued ardor." Cost: carrying husband's ashes and shaking hands are residues of rock bottom, pressuring her choices. Time does not tighten tactics beat-to-beat (no urgency or deadline); instead it functions as a threshold crossed, supporting Earned Stasis closure. Not swappable: another crisis frame would lack the "climb" spatial metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to teach withering to bloom dramatized across beats: Mara admits lost faith, yet accepts Sen's method; performs ritual to coax basil sprout; begins leaving more birds; meets strangers to show them "how to stand…and set a small intention." Setup implicit in "lost all faith in purpose" and rock-bottom context. Development: each teaching moment (Lysa, line of strangers) enacts the motivation. Closure: "teaching by quiet repetition that even at the end of oneself there remained a direction, and that bloom was a craft." Friction: Mara's oblivion-craving conflicts with outward teaching, creating authentic tension. Cost: she must repeatedly engage strangers while carrying her husband's ashes, forgoing isolation. Label concern: "teach withering to bloom again" is stated only in narration, not Mara's explicit thought, keeping it subtextual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Subdued ardor coherent throughout: "muted glow," "whispered the coordinates," "the steady heat of a forge kept low," "quiet repetition." Tone modulates with pressure—opening shaking hands and oblivion-craving darken it; Lysa's sprout warms slightly; closure settles into "subdued ardor…showing each person." Setup early via diction (mourning, timeless, dust whispers). Development: tone tempers Sen's exposition and Mara's ritual actions, avoiding melodrama. Closure: "subdued ardor" names the tone explicitly, charging the final image with restrained intensity rather than catharsis. Not static: grief's heaviness lightens to craft's steadiness without erasure. Minor: naming the tone on-page risks self-consciousness, but it functions as a culminating self-awareness rather than label-only.</comment>
