<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat creates a concrete interior pressure and the protagonist's final choice—returning it to the boy—carries visible cost. However, interiority leans toward lyric abstraction ("panic could not fit inside the odd loan") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The painter remains more atmospheric presence than character with agency, and the sister exists entirely off-page, limiting relational crucible work. Motivation is clear but the peak choice feels more thematic than viscerally earned through prior micro-decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the protagonist returns the borrowed heartbeat, forecloses one path (keeping it/saving sister longer), and accepts the cost (boy lives, surgeons guided by "steadier hands" in a possibility-vision). The lens reads Situational-leaning-Hybrid: the painter's mirror and coded lullaby create pressure that forces stance crystallization; the final choice reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors arrive early (terrace, canal, spring, pre-bells timeframe). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror reveals the two rooms and the lullaby "asks consent," narrowing options to a binary with legible stakes. The metaphysical mechanics (mirage painter, borrowed heartbeat, possibility-mirrors) are taught but the surgeons being "guided" in the chosen room introduces a convenience that blurs whether the choice truly costs the sister or simply shifts the method of saving her, slightly weakening the closure's price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace, prism parapet, rainwater pooling as lenses, and market stairs below create coherent spatial choreography. Sensory detail—scent of new leaves and stone, rain sliding away, droplets as tiny lenses—is vivid and filtered through urgency. The prism parapet constrains and enables: it becomes the surface where the mirror is set and the raindrops multiply the glass, directly shaping the painter's method and the protagonist's access to the vision. The "dusky harmony before morning" and spring opening "the city like a wet book" are poetic but occasionally drift toward stock seasonal metaphor without strong POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: return the borrowed heartbeat with "a truth worth keeping" or it stops when bells ring; secondary is saving the sister. The mirror-vision sequence tightens options to a binary (keep heartbeat/sister lives a day but boy dies, or return it/boy lives and surgeons gain steadier hands). One meaningful reversal: the protagonist enters believing she needs a future where her sister survives, but the painter's mirror reveals the moral cost of that choice, forcing renunciation. The final act is protagonist-driven (pressing palm to mirror, letting the heartbeat go) with visible cost. However, the "guided the surgeons with steadier hands" clause introduces ambiguity—does the sister still survive via an alternate causal path?—which softens the price and pulls the escalation slightly toward convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grace as chosen sacrifice, possibilities chosen rather than kept—emerges organically from the mirror's binary rooms and the protagonist's renunciation. The borrowed heartbeat and coded lullaby "asking consent" create concrete metaphors that avoid didacticism. The final line, "possibilities must be chosen, not kept," risks overt statement but is earned by prior image work (corridor collapsing, painter stepping into mirror's glint). The elusive painter and mirage motif charge the ending without heavy symbolism. Subtext operates in the painter's calm refusal to waste emotion and the lullaby's coded second melody. No meta-commentary or moralizing intrudes on peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("panic could not fit inside the odd loan," "emotion was a pigment she refused to waste") that reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into writerly decoration under pressure. Perceptual signature is present: the protagonist notices rainlight, prism colors, coded patterns in the lullaby. However, the diction—"perceptively calm" (used twice identically), "dusky harmony," "as if emotion was a pigment"—leans toward stock poetic phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Dialogue is minimal (painter's two short lines) and functional. Filter verbs ("I saw," "I heard," "I felt") appear but do not stack heavily. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, the phrase "perceptively calm" appears identically twice (opening and painter's introduction), a loop that signals template reuse. "Dusky harmony" opens and closes the piece, a purposeful frame, but "dusky" as descriptor for emotional tone and light feels stock. Mixed metaphor: "the city like a wet book" then "dusky harmony" then "prism parapet" stack poetic vehicles without clear tonal unity. Some lines do double duty ("the borrowed heartbeat... asked its consent" merges world rule and emotional charge), but others ("I told her my name, my sister's name, and the hour the bells would announce") summarize rather than dramatize. Sentence openings vary; no major grammar errors. Information density is moderate; the middle beat (finding the painter, hearing the lullaby code) could compress slightly without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat, mirage painter who paints possibilities not memories, and coded lullabies as findable signature offer a fresh synthesis. The moral calculus—sacrificing one's own goal (sister's certainty) to honor a stranger (boy in the ward)—feels specific and non-obvious. However, the "elusive artist accessible only via secret signal" and "magic mirror showing alternate futures" are familiar fantasy tropes; the story transforms them through the heartbeat-loan constraint and the grace-as-choice theme but does not radically defamiliarize. The ending's "possibilities must be chosen, not kept" risks abstraction, though prior image work partially earns it. The spring-terrace-rain setting and dusky tone are evocative but not sharply individuated. Risk-taking in structure (single continuous scene, lyric register, metaphysical mechanics taught quickly) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirage painter appears mid-story, sets the mirror, hums the lullaby code that "asks consent," and watches the protagonist choose. Her action (flicking wrist to set the mirror, humming the second melody) enables the central vision. She does not make a choice that alters her own arc, remaining more facilitator than agent. Present in setup (rumored), middle (provides mirror), and payoff (smiles, steps into mirror). Two beats: appearing when protagonist stops trying to pin her down, and offering the mirror-vision. Causal pressure: her method (coded lullaby, consent-asking) shapes the protagonist's access and choice. Not easily swappable—her specific refusal to waste emotion and elusive nature color tone. However, her decisions do not drive turns; she observes and enables.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prism parapet is named in the opening ("prism parapet... left it glittering with broken colors"), returns when the painter appears ("a figure seemed to appear and vanish" near the parapet where rainwater pooled), and is the surface where the mirror is set ("she set a small mirror against the prism parapet after rain, and the droplets became tiny lenses that multiplied the glass"). Three beats: opening (establishes broken colors/prism effect), painter's arrival (rainwater pools there), mirror-setting (droplets as lenses). Causal: the prism effect and rain-lenses enable the painter's method. Payoff: "rainlight on the prism parapet dimmed to ordinary stone" marks closure, reweighting the magical moment as past. Irreplaceable: the prism optics and rain-lens mechanics are specific to this object. Cost: its transformation from glittering to ordinary signals the cost of choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced in paragraph one ("the odd loan I carried in my chest, a borrowed heartbeat that was not mine to waste"), constrains the protagonist's timeline (will stop when bells ring unless returned with truth), and is the object of the final choice ("I pressed my palm to the mirror and let the borrowed heartbeat go"). Setup early, development (the mirror reveals keeping it kills the boy), payoff (protagonist returns it, "my chest beat with my own honest rhythm again"). Three beats minimum: healer's warning, mirror's binary revelation, final return. Causal pressure: it creates the ticking clock and the moral trade-off. Closure: returning it is the decisive change that forecloses one path (saving sister longer) and pays visible cost (boy lives, protagonist loses the loan). Irreplaceable: no generic "magic item" could substitute without losing the life-debt and consent mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears identically twice as a descriptor (protagonist's state, painter's eyes) but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It labels emotional tone rather than shaping action. No on-page moment shows the trait forcing a trade-off or altering tactics. Present as atmosphere, not as driver. Swappable with "collected" or "still" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Grace is invoked when the protagonist asks the painter for it ("I asked for grace because I had none left") and the painter reframes it as choice ("the coded lullaby shifted, offering me the action of grace not as a gift from her hands, but as a choice from mine"). The final turn—returning the heartbeat—embodies grace as renunciation. Present in setup (ask), middle (reframed as choice), payoff (enacted by letting heartbeat go). Two beats: request and reframing; enactment. Causal: the reframing shifts the protagonist's understanding and enables the final choice. However, "grace" remains more thematic keyword than concrete action verb. The actual decisive action is "let the borrowed heartbeat go," which could be described as sacrifice or renunciation without invoking "grace." The term appears three times but its mechanics are abstract. Mid-band: shapes the conceptual charge but could be edited to "sacrifice" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are signaled early ("the painter spoke through coded lullabies in children's songs, so only those listening for more than comfort could find her"), the protagonist hears one and follows it to the painter, and the painter hums the lullaby again to activate the mirror ("She hummed the market lullaby, but under it ran a second melody like thread, and I felt the code pull at the borrowed heartbeat, asking its consent"). Setup (healer's warning), middle (protagonist follows melody to painter), payoff (lullaby activates consent-ask). Three beats. Causal: the method is the means of finding and the mechanism of the mirror's question. Irreplaceable: the dual-melody and consent-pull are specific. However, the "asking consent" mechanic is told more than shown—we don't see the protagonist decode or struggle with the lullaby's meaning; it simply "pull[s]" at the heartbeat. The final paragraph notes "the lullaby below returned to simple comfort," a reweighting. Strong integration but the mechanics remain slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is named in the opening, houses the prism parapet and market stairs, and provides the spatial frame for the entire encounter. "Echoing" recurs: "the terrace echoed my steps," "as if the terrace echo had traveled into the hospital." Spring is present in scent, new leaves, rain. Setup (first sentence), middle (protagonist walks terrace, hears lullaby from market stairs below), payoff (echo metaphor extends to hospital at closure). The terrace's acoustics (echoing) enable the protagonist to hear the coded lullaby from below, shaping discovery. The openness and elevation (above canal, overlooking market) allow the liminal meeting with the elusive painter. However, the terrace as physical space does not constrain a choice—the protagonist could meet the painter anywhere. The "echo traveling into the hospital" at closure is metaphorical, not a physical constraint. Three beats, causal role in discovery, charged reprise in final metaphor. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells ring" is announced in the opening and returns at closure ("When the bells finally rang"). The borrowed heartbeat will stop when bells ring, creating a ticking clock. Setup (opening: "I had come over the hush before bells ring"), middle ("the healer... warned that it would slow to a stop when the bells rang"), climax ("When the first bell began to breathe in the tower, still silent but gathering, I pressed my palm to the mirror"), payoff ("When the bells finally rang, my chest beat with my own honest rhythm again"). Four beats. Causal pressure: the timeframe forces urgency and shapes the protagonist's tactics (must find painter and decide before bells). Irreplaceable: the bells are the hard deadline tied to the heartbeat loan. Cost: returning the heartbeat before the bells removes the immediate death-threat but forecloses the path of keeping it. The "hush before bells" is vividly embodied and tracked across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The protagonist seeks "the elusive mirage painter rumored to... persuade mirrors to show possibilities, not memories" to find "a future in which my sister did not die on the operating table at noon." This desire drives the protagonist to the terrace and structures the request to the painter. However, the motivation is stated rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. The protagonist's internal friction—between wanting to save the sister and the moral cost of keeping the borrowed heartbeat—emerges only when the mirror reveals the binary, not earlier. Setup (stated in exposition), middle (request to painter), payoff (choice renounces the original desire in favor of the boy's life). Two beats. The final choice contradicts the opening desire, which creates thematic resonance, but the want is not tested with escalating costs until the single mirror-vision moment. The protagonist does not attempt alternate tactics or wrestle with competing methods. Functional but the desire remains more premise than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" opens the story ("In the dusky harmony before morning fully arrived") and closes it ("in the dusky harmony of that spring morning I understood"). The tone—calm, measured, lyric, tinged with melancholy—remains coherent through the encounter. Modulation is subtle: slight tension when the lullaby shifts and the mirror reveals the choice, then return to calm after the bells ring. The tone supports the elusive, possibility-laden concept and the protagonist's "perceptively calm" state. However, the tone does not sharpen under pressure; the crisis beat (mirror-vision, binary choice) maintains the same lyric register without tonal escalation or rupture. The final reprise reweights "dusky harmony" as acceptance and understanding, a purposeful bookend. Strong coherence but limited modulation; the tone charges the final image but does not intensify mid-story.</comment>
