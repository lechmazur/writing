<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior is vivid and embodied—"mulberry ache in my throat," green murmurs from plants—with consistent motivations: her childhood dream versus imperial demands. The plant telepathy trait shapes on-page choices (listening to figs, following their map through the vent), and her final choice to send the violin away forecloses a path with visible cost (blank report, envoy's threat). Minor slip: the envoy and Sorell remain functional rather than deeply contradictory presences, and the basil's "promise to keep quiet" feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (velvet observatory at midsummer, Liora as provenance researcher). The drive lens reads Causal: Liora's plant-telepathy insights → discovery of the vent map → decision to smuggle the violin → blank report and downstream cost. Closure lands on the page: she signs the indeterminate report "before the promise loses its glow," hears the violin played in the alleys, and knows "the empire would never plug all the holes"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost (lost position, threat from the envoy). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the figs' terror image and coffee-stain futures narrow her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is vivid and purposeful: violet drapes to stop stray light, frost-silk lining, service hatch shown by the figs. The setting constrains choice (vent shaft enables smuggling, dome's slit frames the intended performance) and charges the final image (terrace garden, festival alleys). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("every footstep sound like an apology"). The basil pots and fern house anchor micro-setting that alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: certify the relic versus protect the orchards from being cut for cannonwood. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figs pulse terror and Liora sees the burnt roots, forcing her to choose between imperial approval and living things propagating without permission. The coffee-stain futures (crown split by white gap, Sorell taking blame) narrow her options before the envoy arrives. Agency is decision with on-page cost: she tells the truth, opens the hatch, smuggles the violin, and leaves the report blank—forecloses the imperial path with visible threat. The price is legible in the envoy's curdled smile and Sorell's potential blame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and images: "perforated destiny" as holes where choices leak through, living things versus empire, songs belonging to whoever needs them. The final image—thin melody in the alleys, "bright as sap," and "the empire would never plug all the holes"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The recurring motifs (ice-crystal violin, plants' loyalty, propagation) reweight the premise at closure. The line "before the promise loses its glow" recurs purposefully, charging the ending. Minor slip: "destiny here was perforated" is slightly over-articulated mid-story, but the plants' sensations and the coffee grounds dramatize the concept rather than declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "green murmurs," "thirst and sap-rise," "mulberry ache." Diction remains character-particular ("velvet observatory breathed heat like a dark fruit," "careful bureaucratic language"). Free indirect blends smoothly ("everyone knew researchers read lies in documents"). The basil's sharp-sweet laugh and the figs' terror are embodied through sensation rather than explanation. Minor slip: "destiny here was perforated, full of little holes where choices leaked through" edges toward thematic summary, though it's anchored in the plants' sensations. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic: "the cloth made every footstep sound like an apology," "sung into shape by wind," "bright as sap." Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in the opening clause chains ("My job was to trace...which wars...which signatures") and the explanatory aside "because everyone knew researchers read lies in documents" interrupts momentum slightly. The final paragraph's "before the promise loses its glow" recurrence is purposeful. No loops or filter-verb stacks, but the expository backstory about the pollen spill and the invented lineage edges toward summary rather than dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—provenance researcher, plant telepathy, ice-crystal violin, perforated destiny, coffee-stain futures—is specific and non-obvious; the combination feels organic rather than checklist. The turn (smuggling via the vent the plants reveal, enlisting children with basil cuttings) grows from established particulars. "Propagate" as both literal (basil cuttings) and thematic (songs, living things) is a fresh inflection. The premise is uncommon enough to avoid template pitfalls, and the final image (thin melody in alleys, empire unable to plug all holes) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate: the elements are inventive, but the moral calculus (living things versus empire) is clear and does not court ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Provenance researcher: present by the opening line, constrains Liora's choices (she must certify the violin, faces the envoy's seal ring and parchment), and her final decision—leaving the report blank and signing it—is the story's hinge. The role shapes at least three beats: touching the violin, reading coffee stains, and confronting the envoy. Causally essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transparent ice-crystal violin: introduced early on the pedestal, handled when Liora touches it and "green murmurs" fill her mind, central to the smuggling beat (slid down the vent in frost-silk case), and its thin melody in the alleys charges the final image. Present across setup, middle, and closure; irreplaceable (no maker's mark, formed by wind in a glacier). The violin is the story's pressure point and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perforated destiny: introduced via the plants' sensation ("full of little holes where choices leaked through"), shapes Liora's understanding that she can "shift the scene" by accepting holes punched through her own life, and recurs at closure ("the empire would never plug all the holes"). Causal role in one major decision (smuggling the violin after seeing the coffee-stain futures). The concept is slightly over-articulated mid-story but reweights the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accidentally telepathic with plants: established early (laboratory pollen spill a year ago), enables two key beats (figs showing the vent map, basil promising to keep quiet), and constrains tactics (she must kneel among pots to listen). Visible tradeoff: the trait requires proximity and attention, and the plants' terror image forces her hand. Causal pressure across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Propagate: literal action (children cutting basil to root in water, carrying the violin case between pots "as if it were just another cutting"), thematic anchor (living things propagating without permission), and the story's hinge turn. Present in Liora's stated dream, the smuggling beat, and the final image. Irreplaceable; the dual meaning (botanical and ideological) drives closure. Causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reading the future in coffee stains: introduced when Sorell offers coffee, used in one beat (crown-shaped blot split by white gap, Sorell taking blame), and mentioned again ("new stains blooming as the coffee dried"). Shapes one middle choice (Liora sees the futures and decides to act). The mechanics are signaled but not deeply constraining; swappable with another divination method. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velvet observatory at midsummer: anchors early, supplies the vent shaft and service hatch (micro-setting that enables smuggling), and the dome's open slit frames the intended imperial performance Liora disrupts. Midsummer festival crowds hide her in the terrace garden. The setting pressures choices and provides the tactical resource (vent) that alters outcome. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Before the promise loses its glow: frames the opening ("weigh a dream against an empire before the promise loses its glow") and recurs in the final report signature. The timeframe is more tonal than tactical—it tightens urgency but does not impose a live clock that alters moves beat-by-beat. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake at closure, lifting it into the mid-6s despite limited mid-story use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To weigh a dream against an empire: stated early as Liora's private motive ("that living things could be allowed to propagate without permission"), dramatized in the choice to smuggle the violin despite the envoy's threat, and paid off in the blank report and final image (melody in alleys, empire unable to plug holes). The desire is conflicted (bureaucratic duty versus childhood dream) and the friction between wants and costs drives the climax.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mulberry ache: present in the opening line, coherent through the velvet-draped hush and frost-silk details, and charges the final image (melody "bright as sap" in the alleys contrasts the opening throat-ache). Tone modulates from the oppressive heat and institutional threat to the sharp-sweet basil laugh and thin, bright melody. Consistent and purposeful, elevating the ending without static repetition.</comment>
