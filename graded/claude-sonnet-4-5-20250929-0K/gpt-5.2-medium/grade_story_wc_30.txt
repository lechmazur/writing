<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through the titan-gear and neoprene gloves, with the creel-fishing ritual revealing values under pressure. The moon-phase memory mechanic creates genuine constraint and the final acceptance of forgotten identity feels earned. However, Captain Lio/Aunt Liora and the city's migrating identities remain largely external to the narrator's internal conflict; the protagonist observes and catalogs more than they wrestle with contradictory impulses in scene. The closing moment—receiving a new name and accepting dual identity—lands cleanly but the path there prioritizes atmospheric accumulation over sharp internal contradiction acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early with the tidal rhythm and moon-phase memory cycle, then deepens through the creel ritual and smelting practice. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts being "both the forgotten person and the librarian," a stance crystallized by the given name "Keeper of Small Miracles" with the visible cost of lost origin. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph. The "next full moon" return of Lio/Liora and the final titan-gear wade provide meaningful tightening and a charged final image. One deduction: the causality between smelting bookmarks and the city's renewed sense of surprise could be more concretely dramatized; the turn from "repetition" to "ritual" is told more than shown in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is rendered with purposeful specificity—grates, floodline, dry upper ring—and actively constrains the librarian's preservation work (titan-gear required, timing dictated by tides). The creel, furnace, and shelves function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the narrator wades through "waterlogged aisle" watching books "learning to migrate." Sensory detail (winter light on knuckles, river mud smell, sea breath) is filtered through the narrator's archival priorities. The moon as a temporal and memory anchor coheres with the setting's logic. Minor gap: spatial choreography during the creel-lowering and bookmark-distribution beats could be sharper; we lose exact positioning of the furnace relative to the atrium basin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine when tomorrow is absent—is signaled early and tightened through the smelting invention, which moves from problem (repetition souring) to ritual solution. The creel use evolves from relic to active fishing tool, and the climactic reading-aloud of Lio/Liora's contradictory lives dramatizes acceptance. The narrator's agency culminates in receiving a new name and continuing the wade, foreclosing the need to remember origin. Cost is visible: forgotten identity, sustained effort, and the acceptance of perpetual flux. However, the escalation is primarily additive (new practices layered in) rather than a sharpening conflict with clear tradeoffs; the city's participation feels cooperative rather than testing the narrator's method under opposing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder preserved through acceptance of contradiction and ritual in a world without tomorrows—emerges organically from the creel, smelting, and moon-phase mechanics without overt thesis. The final image of books "learning to migrate" and the narrator holding the "Keeper of Small Miracles" plate offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the narrator's trembling hands, the choice to catalog "wonders beside routines," and Lio/Liora's "single steady gaze" through contradiction. Minor slip: "the only method that kept peace was by accepting contradictions" edges toward direct statement where the creel ritual already dramatizes the insight, and "permission to be both" in the penultimate paragraph slightly over-articulates what the action has earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: archival metaphors ("watermarks rising on the mind"), the neoprene/bronze embodiment, and a reflective yet grounded register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the creel wade, broader when explaining city practices. The narrator's inference ("I learned") and future projections ("the moon would change again") stay within plausible knowledge. Compression in the smelting and ritual-building passage is purposeful and advances rather than stalls. One friction: the phrase "our recollections thinned with it" and similar collective-observer moments briefly widen lens without clear cue, though they recover quickly and the ending returns to intimate focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, ritual, or stance. Rhythm varies naturally with longer accumulative passages breathing into shorter beats ("They only nodded"). Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. However, several template cadences appear: "Some mornings the baker... and by dusk the diver... and the ledger accepts"; "a pressed kelp star, a hymn written on onion skin, and a fisherman's bamboo creel"; the triplet structure recurs in at least three passages, creating mild rhythmic predictability. Additionally, "He asked me to preserve wonder in routine, to make sure the city did not turn its shifting selves into mere paperwork" edges toward thesis articulation rather than trusting the image. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high. Deduction totals roughly −0.6 for template cadence and one instance of slightly elevated telling in a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal library, moon-phase memory, migrating identities, and smelted bookmarks feels specific and non-obvious; the creel repurposed as fishing net for lost names is a fresh inflection. The premise commits fully to its logic without retreat, and the narrator's role as both cataloger and participant avoids the safety middle. Emotional authenticity (trembling hands, forgotten origin accepted without melodrama) grounds the speculative frame. Minor limitation: the "after tomorrow disappears" setup and identity-migration mechanic recall workshop prompts and SFF template conceits; transformation arises more from accretion of lived detail than from a bold structural or perspectival risk. The piece executes its vision at a high level but does not radically surprise within the speculative-cozy subgenre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and makes key choices: begins using the creel to catch lost names, builds the furnace, smelts bookmarks, reads aloud Lio/Liora's versions, and accepts the new name. These decisions alter tactics (from passive cataloging to active ritual-making) and shape the ending. However, many beats observe city behavior or explain world rules rather than hinging on narrator action. Setup clear, middle development strong (creel and smelting), closure participation direct (receives name, continues wade). Causal pressure present but shared with setting and city; the librarian enables more than drives reversals. Two gates strong, closure linkage present, some swappability in role (another custodian could perform similar acts). Score reflects solid integration with meaningful but not indispensable causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bamboo creel is donated by Lio, serves as relic, then repurposed to catch lost names and promises, holds the blank bookmark that becomes the narrator's new name, and is carried in the final wade. Four distinct functional beats; meaning evolves from static donation to active retrieval tool to symbolic container. Setup early, middle development (name-fishing), closure participation (holds the name-plate, carried in final image). Causal pressure: the creel's use enables the ritual and the narrator's renamed identity. Specificity high (bamboo ribs, river mud smell). Cost connection present (the narrator's origin retrieved as blank plate). Only moderate replaceability (another container could function) and the creel does not constrain a difficult choice keeps it from highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Migrating identities frame the world, create the problem (repetition without future), and justify the bookmark ritual. The concept appears in multiple beats: baker/diver/judge examples, Lio/Liora's dual titles, the city's midday visits, and implicitly in the narrator's acceptance of dual self. It shapes the dominant stake (preserve wonder amid flux) and the ending (narrator becomes "Keeper of Small Miracles" while forgetting origin). Setup immediate, development consistent, closure participation clear. However, the concept operates more as setting rule and thematic backdrop than as a mechanic that narrows on-page options or forces a costly tradeoff in a single beat. The narrator accepts rather than wrestles with migrating identity. Strong integration across the text but modest causal pressure in key moments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moon-phase memory fluctuation is introduced early, explained (full moon = sharp childhood recall, new moon = signature amnesia), and drives the narrator's forgotten origin and the city's need for external anchors (creel, bookmarks). It appears in at least three beats: initial explanation, "when the moon thinned" triggers creel use, and "the next full moon" Lio returns. The trait enables the ritual solution and charges the final acceptance ("the moon would change again"). Setup strong, development present, closure participation via implication. However, the mechanic is told more than dramatized in a moment of visible cost; we do not witness the narrator losing a specific memory or making a choice constrained by moon phase on the page. Functional and thematic but not viscerally felt in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Smelting is introduced as solution to repetition, described in concrete detail (broken bolts, date-stamps, thin plates hammered into bookmarks), and enables the city's renewed surprise and the narrator's name-plate. It appears in one sustained middle beat and directly at closure (the blank plate written with new name). Setup second third (~40% mark), development within that beat, closure participation direct. Causal link solid: without smelting, no bookmarks, no ritual transformation, no name for narrator. Specificity high (furnace in dry upper ring, winter moon light). Only one functionally distinct beat and late setup keep it from higher band; the action is told in summary rather than dramatized across attempts. Still, it is indispensable to the resolution as executed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"By accepting contradictions" is articulated as learned method ("I learned the only method"), demonstrated through shelving all stories side by side, and enacted in the climactic scene where Lio/Liora's contradictory lives are read without correction, resulting in their "single steady gaze." The method also underwrites the narrator's final acceptance of dual identity. Appears in at least three moments: initial statement, Lio return, and closing self-application. Setup middle-early, development clear, closure participation direct (the method yields the name and permission). Causal pressure moderate: the method enables peace but does not constrain a difficult choice with visible tradeoff. One deduction: the method is told more than shown in micro-choices; we see result (acceptance) more than process (struggle, then acceptance).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium supplies the central constraint (twice-daily flood requires titan-gear), the rhythm that structures city life and memory, the physical space for the furnace and creel rituals, and the final image (wade through waterlogged aisle). It appears in every major beat and enables or pressures each key action. Setup immediate (first paragraph), development continuous, closure direct (the wade). Specificity high (grates, floodline, glass basin, dry upper ring). Causal pressure strong: without the tidal cycle, no preservation problem, no gear, no ritual structure. The atrium charges the final image and mirrors the theme (flux, breathing). Slight replaceability (another cyclical environment could serve) and the fact that it enables rather than opposes keep it just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is the inciting condition, mentioned in the opening line and underlying the entire stakes (no future, repetition risk). The timeframe creates urgency for the librarian's preservation work and justifies the city's migrating identities. It recurs implicitly in "without a next day" and "a city without tomorrows." Setup immediate, thematic presence throughout, closure linkage indirect (the perpetual today continues in final image). However, the timeframe is asserted rather than dramatically enforced in any beat; no on-page moment where a character attempts to plan tomorrow and cannot, or where the absence of future tightens a choice. It functions as world rule and premise more than active constraint. Present and coherent but largely ornamental in terms of beat-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is articulated by Lio, adopted by the narrator, and drives the creel use, smelting invention, and ritual-building across the piece. It shapes the dominant stake and the narrator's final acceptance of role. Appears in Lio's request, the narrator's reflection on repetition souring, and the closing permission to serve "a city without tomorrows." Setup early-middle, development across multiple beats, closure participation clear. Friction arises between wonder (surprise, migration) and routine (cataloging, tidal schedule), and the cost is sustained labor and forgotten origin. One gap: the desire is more often described than shown in a moment where the narrator must choose wonder over safety or efficiency with immediate price. The motivation is consistent and causal but less viscerally dramatized than ideal for top band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is established in the opening line and maintained through calm, reflective narration, measured pacing, and images like "winter light on their knuckles" and "calm permission." The tone modulates subtly with the problem of repetition but never breaks into urgency or distress, fitting the narrator's archival temperament and the story's accumulative design. It charges the final image (the quiet wade, moon's steady change). Setup immediate, consistent throughout, closure participation strong (the tone is the closure's texture). However, the tone is single-register; it does not shift meaningfully under pressure or provide contrast that would heighten a turn. Coherent and purposeful but static, which for tone at this length keeps it solidly mid-upper band rather than indispensable.</comment>
