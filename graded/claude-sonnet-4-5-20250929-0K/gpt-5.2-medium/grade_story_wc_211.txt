<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erem's interiority is vivid and particular—his reflex knowledge of dead languages, his third-grade field trip memory anchoring his nerves, his terror at "swearing the city into that failure." The final choice to broadcast the warning is motivated and foreclosed a passive path with visible cost: the Registry will demand "evidence and names" that he cannot provide. Minor tension: his emotional pattern archiving motivation is stated more than dramatized in micro-choices, though the wax-listening sequence embodies it well enough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Erem stores the ribbon, "hearing in the quiet not triumph but the soft unease of saved lives," a reconfiguration that forecloses the passive archive path with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he hears the prophecy and realizes listening may bind the city; his broadcast choice narrows options with on-page consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening ~120 words. Cost is visible: unease replaces triumph, and the city will demand proof he cannot offer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard garden atop the skyscraper constrains Erem's choice—he brings the shaving there explicitly because "silence has depth" and clerks won't watch. The stone table between pear trees and the hand-crank phonograph are tactile anchors. Spatial choreography (tower, garden, roof intercoms, stairwells) tracks cleanly. The glass windbreaks and gnarled trees charge the final image of the cedar box storage without over-symbolizing. One quibble: the orchard's altitude could pressure a decision more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: will Erem's act of listening/archiving bind the city to disaster? One meaningful tightening: the lullaby names the grid failure hour, and Erem fears "by listening he has sworn the city into that failure." His broadcast choice forecloses inaction with visible cost (unease, Registry scrutiny). The "emotional patterns suggest a loophole" moment pivots tactics under causal pressure. Minor gap: the grid crews' readiness feels slightly convenient; a line showing prior skepticism would sharpen the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—testimony as contract, prophecy archived loses teeth, "the truest contract is what we refuse to let happen"—emerges from the wax-listening and broadcast choice without moralizing. The final image (cedar box beside oath books, unease of saved lives) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether archive is passive or binding. Subtext operates through the third-grade memory and the guide's "solemn hope," refracting Erem's adult vocation. The lullaby's accidental prophecy braids grief, tenderness, and moral obligation without abstraction. Risks a bit of thematic echo in "the truest contract" line, but it remains particular to oath-scribe idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, single-focalizer third tracking Erem's perceptual signature: dead languages "as reflex," "emotional patterns that leak through words like sap through bark," the orchard scents braiding with phonograph rasp. Diction fits an oath scribe's register (vows, testimony, archive, cadence). Compression is purposeful: "dust of decades rose and he heard, impossibly, a heartbeat embedded in the wax." No head-hopping. Filter verbs (watches, hears, realizes) are voice-motivated and sparse. The final paragraph's syntax modulates pressure without obscuring clarity. One slip: "what we refuse to let happen" edges toward essayistic generalization, though it reads as Erem's profession-inflected thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; figurative language (sap through bark, wax curled like ribbon, bruise, velvet disquiet) is coherent and specific. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character memory, and causal stakes. Clarity holds through the phonograph sequence. Minor issues: "The voice recites... then slips into a lullaby" and "he is hearing not words but the shape of grief itself" edge toward summary-tell at a peak beat; showing the lullaby's cadence shift would sharpen immediacy. One near-paraphrase: "the orchard scents and the phonograph's rasp braid together" restates the immersion cue. No major loops, but density could tighten by ~5%.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—oath scribe, wax phonograph prophecy, dead-language broadcast as loophole—is specific and non-obvious. The third-grade Sound Museum memory seed that blooms at the climax feels earned in hindsight. Accidental prophecy (woman singing for sick child while recording for husband at sea, wax keeping "the pattern like a bruise") transforms the trope through historical-sensory specificity. The orchard-atop-skyscraper juxtaposition and emotional-pattern archive freshen familiar archive/prophecy material. Risk-taking (lyric compression, the prophecy as emotional bruise rather than oracle) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erem the oath scribe is present throughout, makes the key listening choice (fearfully recognizing he may have sworn the city into failure), and drives the broadcast resolution that empties elevators. His vocation (recording vows in dead languages, archiving emotional patterns) directly enables the loophole tactic. Two distinct beats: listening/realization and broadcast/aftermath. Closure shows him storing the ribbon with "soft unease," foregrounding his professional and moral stance. Cost is visible: Registry scrutiny, "only the record of feeling." Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wax shaving is handled in multiple beats: basement discovery with embedded heartbeat, stone-table placement between pear trees, stylus contact releasing the lullaby-prophecy, roof intercom broadcast, and final cedar-box storage beside oath books. It narrows options (the prophecy names the grid failure hour) and charges the final image (stored treasure vs. evidence demand). Specificity matters: the curl, smoke scent, softening under needle, and bruise-like pattern are irreplaceable. Early signal, beat involvement across three moments, closure linkage, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy shapes stakes and tactics: the lullaby's cadence "names... the exact hour the western power grid will fail," compelling Erem's broadcast intervention. The concept is dramatized (woman singing for sick child, wax preserving pattern), not merely thematic. It constrains his choice: fear that "by listening he has sworn the city into that failure" drives the broadcast tactic. Present in closure when "the prophecy, archived, loses its teeth." Early signal (phonograph discovery), middle choice (broadcast), closure payoff all met. Cost is felt: Erem's unease, the city's scrutiny.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erem's ability to speak dead languages enables the broadcast tactic: "he carries the shaving to the roof intercoms and speaks its warning aloud in the oldest vow tongue," which spreads "as a strange chant." The trait is signaled early ("his tongue can speak dead languages... as reflex") and constrains the middle choice (broadcast relies on this skill). Present in closure context (the message spreads). Visible cost: the warning is unintelligible to most, yet crews respond. Beat involvement: two moments (introduction, broadcast). Could score higher if a specific linguistic trade-off (e.g., risk of misinterpretation) were on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Immerse" appears twice with purposeful escalation: Erem "can immerse himself" in orchard silence, then "immerses himself deeper, letting the orchard scents and the phonograph's rasp braid together" to write emotional patterns and discover the loophole. The action enables the tactic shift from passive listening to broadcast. Present in middle beat and tied to closure choice. Early cue, middle development, causal pressure. Swappability risk: "focus" or "engage" could substitute with minor edits, which prevents higher score. Cost connection present (deeper immersion reveals the loophole).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory is seeded early ("To steady his hands, he returns to a curious third grade field trip memory") and reprised in closure context: the guide's "solemn hope, as if sound could become a moral record" refracts Erem's adult vocation and the final unease. The memory does not constrain a middle choice but charges thematic resonance. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (archive as moral act). Score ~6.1 for early seed and closure linkage without mid-scene causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient orchard garden atop the skyscraper pressures Erem's choice: he brings the shaving there because "the garden is the only place above the city where silence has depth, and where he can immerse himself without the Registry clerks watching." The stone table, pear trees, and glass windbreaks are tactile anchors. The roof intercoms provide the broadcast mechanism. Present in closure: cedar box storage "in the orchard garden atop the skyscraper." Setup, middle constraint (silence enables listening), closure participation all met. Specificity (gnarled apple, quince arches, dark soil) matters. Cost connection: isolation enables but later demands proof he cannot give.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the foghorn falls silent" anchors the opening atmosphere and recurs in "the velvet disquiet of the evening." The prophesied hour ("the exact hour the western power grid will fail") tightens urgency, and "when the hour arrives" confirms real-time stakes. Present in three moments (opening, prophecy, arrival). Legible but not dominant: the foghorn itself does not constrain a choice, and the clock's passage is implied rather than tracked beat-by-beat. Setup, middle reference, closure context met. Functional but somewhat atmospheric; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Erem's motivation "to archive emotional patterns that leak through words like sap through bark, so the city will remember what it felt" is stated early and dramatized in the listening sequence: "he begins to write in his ledger not events but the emotional patterns in the voice, fear, tenderness, resolve." The motivation creates friction when he fears listening has bound the city, forcing the broadcast choice. Present in closure: he offers "only the record of feeling." Setup, middle conflict (archive vs. intervention), closure payoff all met. Cost visible: unease, scrutiny, evidence gap. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is signaled early ("the velvet disquiet of the evening gathers in the leaves") and modulates with pressure: the shaving "should crumble," the voice "does not belong to any living throat," Erem is "terrified," and closure lands on "soft unease of saved lives." Tone coheres through turns (dusk calm, phonograph rasp, terror, broadcast urgency, final quiet unease) and charges the final image. Setup, middle modulation, closure charge all present. Consistent across beats without static mood. Could score higher if the tonal shifts were more explicitly tied to sensory or syntactic changes on the page.</comment>
