<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thalen's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("guarded druid...trained for war yet sworn to keep my voice calm as a drawn blade"), and the motivation to discover what mirrors hide drives the descent. However, the final choice to plant the seed and sing feels somewhat externalized—more enacted than internally conflicted. The twin's frozen apology and the conjurer's stage-trick backstory add depth, but Thalen's own stake in the confession remains slightly abstract. Embodied contradiction under pressure is present but muted at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: the conjurer's failed trick tightens the curse, the seed and twin's confession causally link, and Thalen's circle-reversal unbends the mirror-lid to free the twin. Closure lands on-page with cost—the vortex stops, the lake flattens, and Thalen stands between guards and conjurer. The cost is visible: years of ice paid, items returned in expanding circles, the conjurer speaks aloud without trick. One meaningful tightening (descent → discovery → reversal) is sufficient for this length. Minor orientation delay (the vortex and orchard mechanics take a beat to clarify) does not obscure the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex, ice coffin, and mirror-cage are vivid and purposeful, constraining Thalen's method of entry and shaping the unbending choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through druidic perception: "air smelled of apples that never ripened," "Cold seized my lungs." The lake's machinery—mirror shards, sprouting teeth, the twin's open mouth—charges the final image. Spatial choreography (boat anchored on roots, descent through rings, ice coffin wedged in silt) is clear and evolves causally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discover the frozen confession and break the curse. Pressure tightens when Thalen descends, finds the twin and the hungry plant, and must reverse the mirror-cage to free the apology. The choice to plant the second seed and sing the war-chant is causal and narrows options—no other path is offered. Cost is visible: the twin thaws, the vortex stops, and Thalen stands between guards with the confession paid for. One meaningful escalation under the Causal lens is sufficient; the lack of a second reversal or internal dilemma keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the wish to be seen without being known, the difference between reflection and truth—emerges from the conjurer's vanity-planted seed, the mirror-cage machinery, and Thalen's final realization that mirrors show only surface, not the dark water behind. The ending offers a resonant answer: the conjurer speaks his confession aloud "no trick, no glass, just breath," and the lake lies flat, honest at last. No stated moral; the image of floating shards showing "the dark water behind it" reweights prior material. The twin's frozen apology and the war-chant's calm destruction of hunger earn the thematic landing without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "I was Thalen, a guarded druid...They called me Finder because lost things drifted toward my steps." Psychic distance is controlled, and the conjurer's twin's apology arrives as bubbles-become-syllables, a clean free-indirect rendering. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the established register—"the wish to be seen without being known" reads slightly abstract for a reed-clan druid mid-crisis—but the overall idiom (reed staff, war-chant, warlike serenity) holds. The guards and conjurer are minimally on the page; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Brief filter-verb clusters ("I understood then," "I told them") are acceptable within the narrative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, conflict, or world logic. Rhythm varies appropriately, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and closure. However, several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "the curse on Lake Kestrel tightened" → "the curse's machinery"; "lost things drifted toward my steps" → "the lake was stealing them"; "mirrors were innocent tools" → "the real enemy was the wish to be seen without being known." The phrase "widening rings" recurs decoratively (twice in narration, once in the ending) without evolving pressure. Minor synonym churn ("swirling orchard vortex" → "spinning orchard" → "orchard branches circling") and a few abstract phrases ("warlike serenity," "the dark water behind it, honest at last") reduce immediacy in peak beats. No artifact touches the closure sentence itself, so caps do not apply, but cumulative drag lowers the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of druidic circles, mirror-cage curse, and flesh-eating plant is specific and non-obvious; the twin frozen mid-apology and the two seeds meeting to "chew each other into stillness" feels fresh. The Finder trait—lost things drifting toward Thalen—integrates causally with the lake's theft machinery. Risk is present: the calm war-chant during descent, the reversal of drawn circles to unbend glass, and the final stance between guards and conjurer. The piece avoids template fantasy beats. However, the "magic trick fails → hero quests → reverses curse" arc is recognizable, and the "mirrors hide truth" theme is familiar; transformation through the ice-coffin twin and the seed-vs.-seed resolution lifts it into solid originality without reaching rare territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thalen is present throughout, makes the key choices (row alone, trace circles, unbend mirror, plant seed, sing war-chant, stand between guards), and the "guarded druid" identity shapes tactics (calm voice, warlike serenity, old method of entry). Early setup, multiple beats, closure participation all present; visible cost in final stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seed appears in the opening beat (conjurer's gift), is recognized in the mirror-cage (twin planted the first seed in vanity, sprouting teeth feed on what mirrors hide), and Thalen plants the pouch-seed to let "two hungers meet" and chew each other into stillness—a causal act that stops the vortex. Three beats, closure linkage, irreplaceable mechanic; high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen confession is the core stake: Thalen descends to find it, discovers the twin frozen mid-apology in the ice coffin, unbends the mirror to free the apology (which pours out as bubbles/syllables), and the ending hinges on the conjurer speaking his own confession aloud to flatten the cursed lake. Setup, causal pressure across beats, and indispensable to closure; removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "Finder" trait is introduced early ("lost things drifted toward my steps"), and Thalen realizes the lake stole items to feed the plant, which causally links the trait to the curse machinery. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action—Thalen rows to the lake center and descends without the trait materially altering tactics. The ending returns lost items "in expanding circles of gratitude," a lyric reprise that reweights meaning but lacks mid-scene causal work. Two gates (setup, closure nod) met; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unbend" is the climactic action: Thalen must reverse the circles drawn to unbend the mirror-lid and free the frozen twin. The mechanic is specific (straightening bent glass by shrinking mental circles), causal (the twin's eyes move, apology pours out), and irreplaceable—no other method is offered. Setup in the mirror-lid description, executed at the crisis beat, and shapes closure (twin thaws, tide of lost things rises). High integration; not 8.5+ because the action itself is brief and the bulk of closure work falls to planting the seed and singing the chant.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Expanding circles are signaled early ("old method of entry"), demonstrated in the descent (Thalen traces rings with the reed staff, each larger, humming, until the vortex matches rhythm and opens a path), reversed to unbend the mirror, and echoed at closure when items are returned "in expanding circles of gratitude." The method is mechanically specific, enables the descent, solves the mirror problem, and charges the final image. Three beats, causal pressure, and irreplaceable; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vortex is introduced early (lake center, "swirling orchard vortex rose from the surface, branches circling in disciplined fury"), provides spatial pressure (Thalen anchors the boat on roots, descends through the spinning orchard), houses the mirror-cage and ice coffin, and its stopping signals closure ("orchard stopped swirling, cursed water lay flat"). Setup, multiple beats, closure participation, and the vortex's mechanics (spinning branches, mirror shards between them) constrain Thalen's descent method. Indispensable to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" frames the inciting incident and the timeframe advances from night (humiliation, moon) to dawn (Thalen rows alone). However, no live clock tightens decisions during the descent or mirror-unbending; the sequence unfolds without time pressure. The ending notes guards waiting on shore, but elapsed time is vague. Setup present, but the timeframe does not constrain tactics or escalate urgency; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thalen's desire "to discover what mirrors do not show: the face of the hand that holds them, and the bargain behind every reflection" is stated early and drives the descent. The discovery—mirrors are bait, the plant hungers for hidden flesh and memories, the twin planted the first seed in vanity—fulfills the motivation on the page. The ending literalizes it: Thalen sees "not my face, but the dark water behind it, honest at last." Setup, causal involvement, closure linkage; visible friction between the druidic duty and the personal quest for hidden truth. Solid integration; not 8.5+ because internal conflict around the want is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is introduced ("trained for war yet sworn to keep my voice calm as a drawn blade") and recurs ("breathed the warlike serenity my teachers drilled into me," "sang the druid war-chant in a calm voice," "serene as a shield wall"). The tone is consistent and modulates subtly—calm control during descent, focused chant during crisis, quiet stance at closure. However, the tone descriptor itself is slightly abstract and does not charge the final image beyond consistency. Setup and coherence present; closure participation is tonal rather than causal. Mid-high band; not 7.0+ because the tone does not intensify or break under peak pressure to reweight the ending.</comment>
