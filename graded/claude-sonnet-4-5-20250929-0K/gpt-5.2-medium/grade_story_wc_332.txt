<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mina's motivation is visceral and consistent: capturing the dream-absence that fled years ago. Her contradictory impulses—clutching memory versus releasing it—act simultaneously in the final beat when the figure tells her "You wrote me back" and she realizes she must photograph the absence, not the presence. The embodied detail of light "tingling like a lens" on her fingertip and the palette "throbbing like a heartbeat" grounds interiority concretely. Minor slip: the fishermen and widows who weep over the cipher sheets remain functional atmosphere rather than dramatized pressure, and the backstory of the runaway dream is told rather than anchored through a present cue that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mina photographs the empty space the figure leaves, finding "the beginning she could live" in chosen luminous absence. The cost is legible—she releases the clutched memory and accepts the figure's departure. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mina, Tideway Library, two a.m., archipelago). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through layered light-capture attempts until the doorway forms and the final image reweights all prior longing. One meaningful deepening: the realization that she "clutched it as memory, not as a future" transforms her method and enables release. Minor tension: the middle section loops through similar beats of capturing/painting light without a sharp tightening choice until the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archipelago's "cliffs whispered across narrow channels" and the library's back room where prints develop create spatial coherence. The watercolor palette and camera function as micro-setting tools that constrain Mina's method: she must capture sunrise at "the exact minute the sea turned to glass." The eastern watchtower and high library window structure her attempts spatially. The final beat uses the hanging cipher between stacks and the doorway of light to charge closure. Sensory detail is vivid—"salt-stiff hands," "luminous absence," light that "throbs like a heartbeat"—and filtered through Mina's obsessive focus. Minor gap: the "whispering" archipelago remains more lyric atmosphere than a constraint that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recapture the runaway dream before it dissolves. Pressure accumulates through repeated attempts—palette fills with dawn-color, prints yield "hints," then a silhouette appears on the horizon. One meaningful tightening: Mina scrapes the figure's light into "the deepest well" and feels it throb, escalating her method to "vitalize the cipher." The climax turn—photograph within photograph, doorway forms, figure speaks—is driven by her choice to aim the camera at the cipher during sunrise. Cost is visible: she must release the dream rather than possess it, photographing the "empty space it left." Minor friction: the middle beats (skimming light, developing prints, fishermen weeping) cycle without a sharp narrowing of options until the final sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: longing as luminous absence, memory as clutching versus future as release. The cipher sheets—light arranged "into loops and cuts like letters"—function as earned metaphor, not assertion. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: photographing the empty space the dream leaves becomes "the beginning she could live," reweighting all prior capture attempts. Subtext operates in the figure's line "You wrote me back" and Mina's realization that the dream "had been running because she had clutched it." The watercolor palette and sunrise photography integrate organically with the thematic question of how to hold what cannot be possessed. No thematic echo or prompt-speak in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through Mina's obsessive attention. Perceptual signature is consistent: light "skimmed off paper photographs," palette pans "filled with dawn-color," the dream as "luminous absence in the shape of someone she used to love." Diction matches the lyric-descriptive voice throughout—"hush of improbable beginnings," "wind languages no mainland ear could parse." The single dialogue line ("You wrote me back") fits the ethereal register and advances plot without breaking voice. Minor register drift: "vitalize the cipher" and "conceptual" feel slightly elevated against the more embodied texture of "salt-stiff hands" and "tingled like a lens," but remain within the narrator's idiom. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is purposeful and varied, with long accumulative sentences mirroring Mina's obsessive process. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character, or method. Figurative language—"luminous absence," "cipher of longing," light "throbbing like a heartbeat"—is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in the opening: "the docks of the whispering archipelago were still dark" and "paid in shells and silence" stack lyric description before grounding action. Paraphrase loop: "She called those sheets the cipher of longing, because the light arranged itself into loops and cuts like letters, and because anyone who stared long enough began to remember something they had lost" restates the cipher's effect across two clauses without added pressure. No template cadence or pronoun drift; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—painting with captured light to resurrect a dream—synthesizes photography, watercolor craft, and emotional longing in a fresh, specific way. The method (skimming light off photographs onto a palette, then onto paper without a brush) is concrete and non-obvious. The turn—that Mina must photograph absence rather than presence to find release—feels earned in hindsight and transforms the trope of chasing lost love. Risk-taking in structure: accumulative layering through repeated attempts rather than a single confrontation. Minor proximity concern: "luminous absence" and the dream-as-running-figure echo familiar lyric-fantasy templates, though the watercolor-palette specificity and the cipher's physicality (fishermen weeping, widows pressing foreheads) ground it in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mina (odd-hour librarian) makes the final choice to photograph the empty space the dream leaves, altering her method from capture to release. Present by the first sentence, shapes the middle attempts (developing prints, loading palette), and drives the climax decision. Two distinct beats: scraping the figure's light into the deepest well, then aiming the camera at the hanging cipher. Causal pressure: her realization that she "clutched it as memory, not as a future" narrows options and enables the closure turn. Cost tied to character: she must accept the dream's departure rather than possess it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Watercolor palette is introduced early ("beside the catalog ledger"), used in three beats: pans fill with dawn-color, she scrapes the figure's light into the deepest well (throbs "like a heartbeat"), and she sets it "on the floor like an offering" before the final photograph. The palette's mechanics (empty pans that fill when lifted toward a window) constrain her method and recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Specificity: the "deepest well" detail and the throbbing sensation make it irreplaceable. Minor gap: the palette is not directly visible in the final image; the camera and cipher dominate the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cipher of longing" is named explicitly and defines the light-sheets Mina creates. It shapes stakes (fishermen weep, widows press foreheads) and the final turn: the cipher "was asking her to release it." Present by mid-story, it constrains her method (she must "vitalize the cipher" to make the dream stop running) and participates in closure when the layered light forms a doorway. Causal role: the cipher's invitation to release rather than possess drives the final photograph. Minor swappability: "cipher" could be replaced with "inscription" or "message" with small edits; the longing is more thematic claim than unique property.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mina "paints with light, skimming it off paper photographs and onto the palette with a fingertip that tingled like a lens." Attribute is demonstrated in two beats: pulling "the brightest slivers" from developed prints, then scraping the figure's light into the deepest well. The method enables her attempts and constrains tactics (she can only paint at sunrise, must develop prints first). Cost: the trait isolates her work to "odd hours" and makes her dependent on the exact minute "the sea turned to glass." Specificity high: the fingertip "tingling like a lens" and the light as tactile substance make the attribute irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears once, mid-story: "If she could vitalize the cipher, she thought, the dream would stop running and become a person again." It frames her intent for the climax attempt but is not the named action at closure—she "aimed the camera" and "let the first rim of sunrise pour through," then "took the final photograph." The concept of making the cipher alive drives the layered-light attempt, but the verb itself is summary rather than on-page dramatization. Functional causal role but swappable with "animate" or "make real" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sunrise photography, taken at the exact minute the sea turned to glass" is signaled early (end of first third), constrains all middle attempts (she climbs the eastern watchtower each morning with a borrowed camera), and structures the climax: "let the first rim of sunrise pour through the high window, photograph within photograph." Mechanics matter: timing is specific, the developed prints are the source material for the palette, and the nested photograph (camera aimed at the cipher during sunrise) creates the doorway. Cost: the method limits her to a narrow daily window. Irreplaceable: the sunrise timing and glass-sea precision are unique to this method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "whispering archipelago" is named in the opening and provides atmospheric pressure: "islands so close that their cliffs whispered across narrow channels, trading rumors in wind languages." Mina "listened anyway" and the islands seem "built to hide such things," framing her search. The eastern watchtower and the library's placement enable her method. Minor role at closure: the figure walks "out through the library door toward the waking sea," but the archipelago itself does not constrain the final choice or alter tactics. Present early and thematically coherent, but more backdrop than active pressure. Lyric reprise (whispers frame the night she keeps the library open) reweights but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" appears only in the opening phrase and sets tone but does not return or tighten decisions. Mina's work is marked by "odd hours" and "two in the morning," and the climax occurs at sunrise, but the timeframe as a concept ("improbable beginnings") remains ornamental. The sunrise timing constrains method (Q9 F) but "improbable beginnings" itself does not track across beats or create a clock that narrows options. Present in title/frame but not developed causally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To capture that dream again before it dissolved into ordinary daylight" is Mina's stated motivation from the opening, dramatized through repeated attempts (developing prints, loading palette, scraping the figure's light). Conflicted in the climax: she realizes she "clutched it as memory, not as a future" and must release rather than capture. Cost is visible—she photographs the empty space the dream leaves, forfeiting possession. Friction between want (to hold the dream) and the dream's need (to be released) drives the final turn. Motivation is embodied (palette "throbbing like a heartbeat against her skin") and tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" recurs throughout: the dream leaves a "luminous absence in the shape of someone she used to love," the cipher sheets show "luminous absence," and Mina finds "the beginning she could live" in the "chosen luminous absence" of the final photograph. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—hushed and accumulative through the middle, then crystallized at closure when absence becomes choice. The phrase charges the final image by transforming from loss (the dream fled) to agency (she photographs the empty space). Specificity and irreplaceability high; the exact phrase reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
