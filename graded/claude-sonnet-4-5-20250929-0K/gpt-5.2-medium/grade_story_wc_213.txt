<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris is well-motivated through her reflection on village sirens wailing needlessly, and her desire to "favor listening over noise" drives the key switch choice at zero hour. Her "credibly curious" nature manifests in concrete micro-choices—tracking microclimate, tuning the vane—though the trait occasionally reads label-like rather than fully embodied under pressure. Internal conflict is present (Office demands vs. sanctuary peace) but could deepen further; the resolution feels earned by her patient data-gathering and final palm-on-rope decision. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("what people actually needed in a crisis") that slightly flattens interiority in a reflective beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (Maris, sanctuary, winter solstice, siren inspection task). The story operates under a Causal lens: Maris tracks microclimate → builds sensor array → rewires control box → makes the zero-hour choice, each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: she defies the dispatcher's demand, risking professional consequences, and her choice reconfigures the warning paradigm from "shrieking rotor" to "quiet vane." The bell-rope splice's drying provides a concrete timeline constraint that tightens the final beat. One small slip: the dispatcher's lawsuit fear and Maris's microclimate defense feel slightly expository rather than fully dramatized, but the core causal chain holds and the ending reweights prior stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is vividly anchored (stone arches, belfry, parapet, bell tower, lantern clock) and sensory detail is selective and purposeful (hail ticking on slate, glue smell, bell rope "hanging like a dark river"). Micro-setting elements—the siren housing, vane, control box—constrain Maris's tactical choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from steps to tower to parapet to radio desk. Minor gap: occupational detail (Weather Office protocols, sensor mechanics) is functional but never pressures a key choice; the setting enables rather than complicates. The final image of monks pulling the rope "not as an alarm but as gratitude" charges the ending, lifting the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: test the siren to prove readiness for the blue-front gale while respecting sanctuary peace and the glue-drying constraint. Pressure tightens through causal escalation: Office demands full siren at zero hour, Maris must choose between compliance and her new approach, and she waits until the splice cures to flip the switch—a decision with professional risk (dispatcher's anger). The escalation is earned by protagonist agency, and the cost is legible on-page (dispatcher demands explanation, Maris answers with data, risking censure). One visible trade-off: loud alarm vs. quiet vane that "invited hearing rather than fear." Minor deduction: the gale "arriving right on time" and "spent itself by dawn" feel slightly convenient, though Maris's prediction work justifies the timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: warning without drowning out the world, teaching people to listen rather than flinch, zero hour as a moment of choice rather than mere deadline. The bell rope recurs with reweighted meaning—first untouchable due to glue, then a tactile anchor for Maris's final choice, finally pulled "as gratitude" rather than alarm. Subtext operates in gesture (Maris's palm on the rope, Brother Ivo's shifting prayer beads) and the low vane note that "made everyone lean in." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sound that invites hearing rather than fear, demonstrated through the monks' quiet gratitude. No overt moralizing. Minor deduction: "humble" and "credibly curious" feel slightly prompt-like in the opening, though they integrate into action thereafter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maris; perceptual signature is clear (she reads vapor "like script," tracks microclimate with precise attention). Diction is mostly controlled and character-particular, though occasional elevated phrasing ("favor listening over noise," "made the sanctuary feel like a factory in the sky") reads slightly abstract for a storm siren tester's interiority. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Brother Ivo's confession and the dispatcher's demand both advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during sensor work, slightly wider during reflection). Minor slips: "credibly curious eyes" in the opening and "teaching people to listen and act instead of flinch" in the dispatcher exchange feel slightly authorial rather than fully character-voiced. No head-hopping, tense remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Strong sentences: "the sanctuary around her tense, as if even the clouds were holding their breath," "she realized the rope was not for pulling only but for choosing." Minor artifacts cluster in the middle: "the Office feared lawsuits more than silence" and "not a scream but a warning that made everyone lean in" lean toward tell rather than embodied show. Template cadence appears briefly ("she bolted sensors… she tuned the vane… she checked… she walked… she stared… she rewired") with four "she [verb]" stems across adjacent beats, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The final paragraph is propulsive and image-rich, with no loops. Figurative language ("bell rope hanging like a dark river") is coherent and purposeful. One paraphrase slip: "after the glue dries" appears in both the opening setup and later beats without added detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—storm siren tester rethinks warning systems at a sanctuary on the solstice—offers a fresh angle on the familiar "technology vs. tradition" template through specific microclimate tracking and the bell-rope constraint. Maris's choice to rewire the control box and use a quiet vane rather than the shrieking rotor feels earned and non-obvious. The solstice-hush tone and "blue-front gale" add atmospheric specificity. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear causal, the stakes are professional rather than life-threatening, and the resolution is tidy (gale spent, monks grateful, Maris satisfied). The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on this exact sanctuary, siren, and microclimate method. Minor deduction: "humble storm siren tester" and "credibly curious" echo prompt language without full transformation into lived detail in early beats, though they integrate later.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's humility is signaled early ("humble storm siren tester") and her choices drive all major turns: she proposes the vane, bolts sensors, rewires the control box, waits for glue to cure, and flips the switch at zero hour instead of pulling the rope or triggering the rotor. Her decision at closure directly opposes the Office's demand, risking professional cost. The character is indispensable; removing her agency collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bell rope appears in at least four beats: (1) opening setup (can't be pulled while glue cures), (2) Maris checks the splice multiple times, (3) zero hour ("she did not pull the rope but laid her palm on it"), (4) dawn ending (monks pull it "as gratitude"). It constrains Maris's tactics (can't use bell as warning) and returns with reweighted meaning (from forbidden alarm to tactile anchor to gratitude signal). Removing it would break the timeframe constraint and the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero hour is the story's temporal spine and thematic hinge. It's signaled early ("would arrive precisely at zero hour, midnight"), tightens tactics (Office demands test "at zero hour… no compromises"), and Maris waits until "the very instant the glue dried" to act "at zero hour." The concept reconfigures from mere deadline to a moment of choice: not pulling or blaring, but switching to the quiet vane. Cost is visible (dispatcher's anger, professional risk). Zero hour is irreplaceable; the entire escalation depends on this convergence of predicted gale, cured glue, and institutional demand.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is mentioned once in the opening ("her credibly curious eyes reading every swirl of vapor like script") and again mid-story ("Her credibly curious mind kept asking what people actually needed"). It motivates her microclimate tracking and question-asking, but the trait never constrains a choice with visible cost—it enables rather than complicates. The phrasing reads slightly label-like. Present across two beats with causal relevance, but replaceable with "attentive" or "questioning" without structural loss. Lyric reprise is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The switch action is set up early (Maris rewires the control box "with a simple switch that could send power either to the shrieking rotor or to her quiet vane"), executed at the climax ("at zero hour she… flipped her switch to the vane"), and defines the story's major turn. It redefines options (quiet warning vs. loud alarm), carries professional cost (dispatcher's demand ignored), and the final image depends on it (low note that made everyone lean in, monks' gratitude). Removing the switch collapses the closure. Irreplaceable and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tracking microclimate variations is signaled early ("began with tracking microclimate variations around the sanctuary"), shapes middle tactics (she "bolted sensors," "tuned the vane," notebook "filled with tight graphs"), and justifies the zero-hour choice (Maris "answered with the numbers she had gathered by tracking microclimate variations"). The method enables her to predict the gale and design the vane's threshold, constraining her approach. Removing it would undercut her credibility and the story's technical specificity. Present across three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is anchored early (stone arches, belfry, steps, parapet, bell tower) and supplies concrete resources (siren mount, control box, bell rope, lantern clock) that Maris uses. Its "above the clouds" isolation and Brother Ivo's concern ("made the sanctuary feel like a factory in the sky") pressure her choice toward a quieter solution. The setting is irreplaceable in establishing tone and stakes, though it enables more than it complicates. Spatial choreography is clear; the final image (monks pulling rope, hail on slate) charges closure. Strong integration across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the glue dries" is introduced early (monks won't let anyone pull the rope "until the splice… fully set, after the glue dries"), tracked across middle beats ("each time she touched the bell rope splice she checked that the glue was hardening"), and reaches payoff at zero hour ("she waited until the very instant the glue dried… then at zero hour"). It tightens Maris's options (can't use bell, must wait) and synchronizes with the gale's arrival and Office demand. The constraint is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the tactical pressure and the resonance of waiting "patient as stone." Live clock that alters moves and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "favor listening over noise" is dramatized early (Maris "wanted the opposite: to favor listening over noise, to warn without drowning out the world"), shaped by prior experience (village sirens that left "everyone shaken and deaf"), and drives the zero-hour choice (she flips the switch to the vane, creating "a warning that made everyone lean in" instead of a "sustained howl"). Friction is visible: Office demands loud siren, Maris risks professional cost to act on her belief. The final image ("sound that invited hearing rather than fear") reweights the motivation with felt consequence. Cost is legible (dispatcher's anger, defiance of orders). Indispensable to plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Solstice hush tone is established in the opening ("hush so clean it seemed to polish the stone arches") and modulates under pressure: deepens as evening advances, tenses when the Office demands the full siren ("as if even the clouds were holding their breath"), and reconfigures at closure (low vane note lets everyone hear "the first hail ticking on slate, the prayer beads shifting"). The tone charges the final image (monks' quiet gratitude, Maris packing "quietly"). Coherent through all turns and essential to thematic resonance, though it enables rather than constrains a choice. Strong lyric integration across setup and ending.</comment>
