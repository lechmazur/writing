<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's observational clarity and patient method come through, but her curator role remains largely decorative—the skill set never constrains a choice under pressure. The courtyard residents show embodied emotion in their confession moments (Hassan's dropped shoulders, the mother's layered fear-love), yet Mara herself operates more as facilitator than agent with her own contradictory impulses. The resolution—clasping the locket—feels too neat, a symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a mystery-investigation frame and delivers a mailbox-opening climax, but the closure effect is primarily revelatory rather than transformative: neighbors read letters aloud and feel lighter. The developer's truck idling at the gate gestures toward external stakes but never materializes as concrete pressure that Mara's choices must address. Cost is diffuse—communal catharsis—rather than a legible price paid by the protagonist. Orientation is clear; the causal lens holds through the search; the ending shifts tone but not options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dawn courtyard is vividly rendered with basil pots, pigeons, murals, and warm stone rim; sensory selection reflects urgency when the police siren intrudes. The brick seam and hidden keyhole provide a tactile puzzle that drives the search. The setting constrains action (the locked mailbox, the painted seam) and charges the final communal reading at the courtyard tables, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake emerges—solving the mailbox mystery to enable communal healing—but escalation is mild: Mara follows chalk arrows, gathers stories, finds a key, unlocks a panel. No meaningful tightening or trade-off appears; the developer's truck idles passively rather than forcing a live choice. The resolution arrives through discovery rather than agency under pressure, and no visible price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—listening as collective repair—emerges organically from the letters and neighborhood confessions rather than through assertion. The locket-as-key motif recurs purposefully, and the final line ("listening is a kind of key we can all carry") risks didacticism but stays image-anchored. The piece resists moralizing until that last beat, where the thematic claim is spoken aloud rather than left to resonate through the reading scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person present tense remains stable and Mara's curatorial voice is consistent: discerning, patient, alive to small sounds. The courtyard residents' dialogue feels natural and goal-driven (Hassan's brother admission, Mrs. Ibarra's regret). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is strong—"sandstorm calm," the clink inside the mailbox—though some phrasings skew slightly elevated ("braid together like windblown sand").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high throughout. Minor scaffold appears: "I realize the mailbox was locked not to hide the letters, but to delay them…" explains what the scene has already shown. A few stock metaphors ("voices braid together like windblown sand," "dry leaves") lack specificity. No loops or grammatical errors; information density is solid. The explain-everything moment in the penultimate paragraph costs a half-point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox premise and communal-apology letters offer a warm, recognizable template with modest freshness in the curator-as-detective angle and the chalk-arrow search. The "listening heals" theme is earnest but familiar, and the developer's truck feels like a stock gentrification nod without integration. The locket-key puzzle is competently executed but not startling. Emotional specificity (Hassan's brother, the mother's pills) elevates the material slightly above median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's curator eye is introduced early and mentioned throughout, but the skill itself—"trained to notice what others miss"—never constrains a choice or generates a meaningful turn. She notices the locket's hinge resistance and the brick seam, yet these observations are linear rather than pressured. Present in setup and closure (clasping the locket), but the trait is more label than lever. Swappable with "patient listener" or "amateur detective" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locket appears early (first third), contains the photo and key that drive the search, and returns at closure when Mara clasps it around her neck. It shapes two distinct beats: the initial discovery and the brick-seam solution. The spiral-of-dunes etching and "heavy as a pocket watch" detail give specificity. The final clasp feels symbolic rather than causally charged, limiting top-band eligibility. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mailbox is signaled in the opening paragraph, dominates the middle investigation (chalk arrows, brick seam, hidden lock), and provides the climax when opened. It shapes the neighborhood's dominant stake and the story's central mystery. The resolution—letters enabling confession—ties directly to the mailbox's purpose. Causal pressure is moderate; the mailbox is essential but not indispensable (a different locked container would function similarly). Three gates met, solid beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated ("the best way to lead is through following") and demonstrated when Mara follows chalk arrows and asks for stories rather than directing. The method enables the communal gathering at the end, but the trait itself never creates visible friction or cost—no moment where following risks losing control or forecloses a more direct path. Present in setup and development, with a lyric reprise at closure, but swappable with "patient inquiry" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hearing is introduced in the opening ("every small sound worth hearing"), drives the investigation (Mara hears stories, the mailbox's clink, the siren's intrusion), and anchors closure when neighbors read letters aloud and "hear" apologies. The action appears in at least four distinct beats and is irreplaceable—removing "hear" would collapse the thematic and tactical spine. The final line ("hear the new quiet settle") directly reweights prior material. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is introduced early (Mrs. Ibarra, Hassan, Lio) and drives the middle investigation as Mara gathers oral histories that "braid together." The method shapes two beats (the arrow-following and the map-of-memories assembly) and is present at closure when neighbors read aloud. However, the storytelling itself is more thematic texture than tactical constraint—Mara could have found the key through physical search alone. Present across all three gates but moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored at dawn in the opening line, provides tactile resources (fountain, brick seam, tables), and hosts the climactic reading. The setting constrains the search spatially (chalk arrows around the courtyard) and charges the final communal moment when the developer's truck idles outside. The "sandstorm calm" and sensory vividness (basil, pigeons, warm stone) deepen immersion. Essential across setup, development, and payoff; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is gestured at (drones, eviction notices, the blackout backstory, the developer's truck) but never tightens decisions on the page. The timeframe is present in setup (dawn courtyard, "before my shift") and mentioned at closure (truck idling), yet no live clock or escalating external pressure forces Mara to act faster or make a trade-off. The intrusion remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Two gates weakly met; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire "to prove that listening heals" is stated early ("my reason for curating is to prove that listening heals") and demonstrated throughout as Mara gathers stories and enables the letter-reading. The motivation drives the investigation and anchors closure. However, the proving itself is never dramatized as a conflicted choice—no moment where listening costs her something tangible or risks failure. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but the friction is minimal. Lyric reprise in the final line.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is introduced early ("the air holds a sandstorm calm") and recurs when the siren intrudes and again when Hassan speaks his brother's name "in the sandstorm calm." The tone modulates purposefully: hushed watchfulness during the search, collective breath-holding at the opening, brightness at closure. The phrase charges key beats and reweights the ending's "new quiet." Purposeful and integrated, though the metaphor itself ("sandstorm" for courtyard calm) reads slightly ornamental. Strong coherence across the arc.</comment>
