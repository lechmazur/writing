<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris is motivated by her sister's coerced pledge and acts with clear agency—unlocking the sanctuary through patience and bodily poem. Her interiority is specific ("alarming serenity was her shield") and embodied gestures reveal character under pressure (the hidden knot, the bow as new grammar). Internal contradiction appears in her performance of compliance while defying it, though the final renunciation could carry sharper visible cost. The governor remains functional pressure but one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Maris scatters the stored echoes, guests hear their buried doubts, and the governor's phrases come out hollow—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where conformity's lullaby breaks and the city meets itself with visible social cost. Drive lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid (her bodily breath unlocks the seal, her invitation releases echoes, guests pause and the orchestra falters). Orientation anchors early (House Lyr courtyard, winter gala, Maris waiting). One meaningful tightening: her untangling threads while the governor forms his wish narrows options and the release reweights the courtyard's power structure. Cost is legible in the governor's stripped authority and the city's fracture into "many melodies."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and snow anchor setting early and constrain Maris's approach (she must guide the governor under the arch without alarming him). The sanctuary's glass and starlight function as micro-setting that charges the closure image when echoes pour out "like startled birds." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (cloves, old breath in glass, light as calm knives). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (courtyard → arch → inside sanctuary → behind pedestal). The nine-thread knot is handled twice but does not constrain a later choice; the sanctuary itself does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing her sister and the city from coerced vows—is signaled early and tightens when Maris hears her sister's pledge while unlocking the seal. One on-page reversal: the governor expects the prism to sing his authority, it stays mute, and Maris gains control. Agency is clear: she brushed the lock earlier, untangles threads, speaks the invitation. The scattering of echoes forecloses the governor'sScript-based power with visible cost (his hollow phrases, the city's fracture). Pressure coheres under the Causal-Situational lens and the resolution is earned by her prior preparation and present action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—defiance of conformity through bodily autonomy and stored voice—emerges from Maris's refusal to surrender ("chaste courtesan"), her unlocking act, and the release of echoes that restore choice. The final image offers a resonant answer: "revolution, like untangled thread, must not snap" reweights her earlier patience and the city's fracture without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (her bow as "new grammar") and image (starlight emptied sanctuary). The "harvest of echoes" metaphor integrates causally and thematically. No moralizing in the final paragraph; the concept of alarming serenity charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Maris; psychic distance is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is consistent ("listened between sigh and smile," "posture and breath speak"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated with purposeful elevation ("bodily poem," "narrow interval where people let truth leak"). No head-hopping. Two slips: "the governor tried to speak, but his rehearsed phrases came out hollow" externalizes his interiority with unearned certainty; and the phrase "alarming serenity" recurs as a label rather than embodied perception in the final line. Filter verbs ("she felt") appear once, voice-motivated. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or plot). Clarity is strong except for one muddy metaphor: "light as calm knives" mixes threat and serenity without resolution. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "The governor approached... Maris took it... she guided him..." uses similar stems across three beats. One paraphrase loop: "her true work was to defy that lullaby, quietly, precisely, and forever" echoes the concept restated in the final line without added pressure. No pronoun drift or scaffold. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" premise is specific and non-obvious; the sanctuary that stores vows to shame citizens is a fresh angle on memory and compliance. Maris's method—bodily breath and patient thread-untangling—transforms the chaste-courtesan trope through grounded action. The ending's reconfiguration (echoes scattered, lullaby broken) arises from prior particulars and feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-textured prose and quiet rebellion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One proximity concern: "her true work" and "forever" echo prompt-speak slightly, but the synthesis of body, voice, and stored sound is memorable and integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris (chaste courtesan) is introduced in paragraph two, drives the unlocking sequence (middle), and closes the story with her bow and walk-out. Her chastity—making her body poetic without surrender—enables her to brush the lock with breath (a bodily poem that carries no pledge) and gain control of the sanctuary. Her choices create the key turn (unlocking) and the closure (scattering echoes, walking out without running). Her archetype constrains tactics (she must perform compliance to reach the sanctuary) and charges the ending (her bow as "new grammar" promising no surrender). Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in paragraph six (setup), is entered and handled in paragraphs 16–21 (development: governor places palm, Maris untangles threads behind pedestal, seal opens), and the prisms fill with swirling syllables that pour out in paragraph 27 (closure participation). Its mechanics matter: it stores echoes, Maris brushes the lock with her breath earlier, and its opening releases the vows. The sanctuary's glass and starlight charge the final image ("emptied for the first time in years"). Specific properties (cut glass, central prism, seal of braided light) are irreplaceable; swapping for a vault or archive would break the bodily-poem logic. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is named in paragraph seven, explained (vows stored and reaped to shame citizens), and drives Maris's stake ("unlock the sanctuary, stored vows could be scattered"). It shapes her tactics: she must reach the sanctuary and untangle the seal. The concept is actualized when echoes are released (paragraph 27) and guests hear their buried doubts, breaking conformity's lullaby. Removal would collapse the story's premise and closure. Present in all three gates with strong causal and thematic integration; the concept is both stake and mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is introduced in paragraph three ("learned to make her body poetic without surrendering it, to let posture and breath speak"). It constrains her approach (she must perform compliance) and enables the key action: she brushes the lock with "her own breath, a bodily poem that carries no pledge" (paragraph 18), which disables the governor's control. Her final bow is described as "a new grammar of the body, promising no surrender" (paragraph 30), reprising the trait with reweighted meaning. The attribute appears in setup, enables one causal beat, and charges closure. Moderate irreplaceability; "poetic body" or "embodied refusal" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unlock" is Maris's explicit goal (paragraph 11: "If Maris could unlock the sanctuary"), attempted on-page (paragraph 20: "Unlocking it required no key, only patience"), and completed (paragraph 25: "The seal opened with a soft click"). The unlocking is the story's major turn: it shifts control from the governor to Maris and enables the scattering of echoes. The action is irreplaceable; substituting "open" or "break" would diminish the thread-untangling mechanics and the patience motif. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is seeded in paragraph 13 (the nine-thread knot at her wrist), reappears in paragraph 20 ("she began by untangling threads with the same gentleness"), and paragraph 24 ("Maris pulled the final thread as if plucking it from his throat"). The method shapes her attempt (she must be patient and gentle) and is foregrounded during the unlocking sequence. The mechanics matter: each thread resists with a memory, and untangling them releases the voices. The final line reprises the image ("revolution, like untangled thread, must not snap"), charging closure. Present in all three gates with strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" is named in the opening line, frames the gala setting, and returns in paragraph 29 ("In the silver courtyard under snow, the city met itself"). Snow's quiet pressure supports tone but does not constrain a choice. The courtyard is the location where echoes scatter and guests pause, providing spatial coherence. The setting charges the final reprise (city meeting itself in the courtyard) but does not alter Maris's tactics. Lyric early–final reprise reweights the stake moderately; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears in paragraph five ("Maris listened between sigh and smile, the narrow interval where people let truth leak") and is reprised in paragraph 23 ("She remembered, between sigh and smile again, the moment her sister..."). The timeframe suggests micro-observation of brief human moments but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time during the unlocking sequence. The phrase functions more as perceptual signature than live clock. Moderate thematic resonance (truth in fleeting intervals) but weak causal pressure; swappable with "in brief pauses" or "in unguarded moments."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the lullaby of conformity" is named in paragraph nine ("her true work was to defy that lullaby, quietly, precisely, and forever"), drives her goal (unlock sanctuary, scatter vows), and is tested when she hears her sister's pledge (paragraph 23) but continues. The lullaby is actualized on-page: guests hum it (paragraph four), the governor embodies it (paragraph 12), and it breaks at closure (paragraph 29: "conformity's lullaby broke into many melodies"). The motivation shapes her choice to walk out without running (paragraph 31). Strong friction between her performed compliance and her defiant intent; visible cost in the city's fracture. Present in all three gates with high causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is introduced in paragraph two, reprised in paragraph 30 ("alarming serenity was her shield"), and coheres through turns (her calm while unlocking, her bow, her walk). Tone modulates subtly: serenity holds during preparation, intensifies during the unlocking ("voices rose like mist"), and charges the ending when she walks out without running because "revolution... must not snap." The oxymoron supports the paradox of quiet defiance. Moderate irreplaceability; "calm menace" or "poised threat" could substitute. Strong closure linkage and tonal coherence.</comment>
