<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inez is established with concrete traits (chalk artist, socially perceptive) and a clear goal. Her interiority is sometimes overwrought—"whimsical chalk artist who drew birds that looked ready to sing" reads as external labeling rather than interior contradiction. The closing choice to allow the boy to smudge the mandala demonstrates character through action, but the arc lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; her final statement about meaning "only lived while it was being touched" feels closer to aphorism than earned cost. Motivation is present but the stakes never sharpen into genuine dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes symbolic density (mist, tile flake, mandala, proverb fragments) and closes with a conceptual repricing—the mandala as "a map of shared doubt" reweights the unlearning from erasure into guided listening. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure effect is legible but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no on-page price is paid by Inez or the community for this shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tile flake refracts the proverb and the teacher's fear gives way to relief, but the transformation feels handed rather than forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (limestone walls "the color of watered lilacs," mist that makes footsteps sound distant) and recurs as both acoustic space and crucible. The tile flake and mandala function as micro-setting, constraining Inez's method and charging the final image when the boy smudges the outer ring. Spatial choreography (Inez kneeling on a flat stone, students in a circle, teacher watching) remains clear. The setting actively shapes choice: the grotto's echoes enable the proverb's fragmentation, and the mandala's rings organize the communal listening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess of forgetting—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative lens. Pressure deepens when the boy blurts a proverb and the circle freezes; Inez's tap of the tile flake refracts the fragments into "something gentler," easing the teacher's fear. But this turn lacks visible cost; no resource is spent, no path foreclosed. The resolution feels given by the tile flake's properties rather than won by Inez's choice under constraint. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the stakes never force a trade-off with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgetting as work rather than innocence, meaning as participatory and ephemeral. The mandala's rings as "a map of shared doubt" and the closing image of the boy's smudge—Inez laughing because "meaning…only lived while it was being touched"—reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the teacher's tightened jaw, the students' hesitations, and the "lilac unease" that spreads. The final line offers a resonant answer to the central question, though it borders on aphorism. No thematic echo contaminates the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Inez with a distinct perceptual signature: she "read sidewalks" and sees pauses between words. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at key beats. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"emergent hush," "lilac unease," "the socially perceptive part of Inez"—that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The boy's single line of dialogue is natural; Inez's closing speech ("it meant they were still capable of choosing what to keep") reads slightly formal for spoken thought. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no head-hopping occurs, but voice under peak pressure leans toward the poetic rather than the urgent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "mist pooled," "whispering grotto," "lilac unease," "emergent hush," "spirals…tightened," "residue lingered," "room inside sound." Many sentences carry metaphoric freight without clear payoff, creating a textural wash that occasionally obscures causality—how exactly does the tile flake "teach the echoes a new trick"? Template cadence appears in the opening: "Mist pooled…turning…making…" stacks participles. Paraphrase loop: "the grotto repeated what you said until it lost its sense" is restated as "echoes…bounce." Information density is moderate; some beats advance atmosphere more than plot. No scaffold loops, but the prose leans purple in high-pressure moments without sharpening clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a city erasing facts, a grotto where forgetting is practiced, an artist using a resonant tile flake and sand mandala to guide unlearning—is specific and fresh. The synthesis of acoustics, art, and social control feels original. The mandala as a map of communal doubt and the tile flake's ability to "make room inside sound" are non-obvious inflections. Risk-taking in the dense figurative texture and conceptual stakes heightens ambition. However, the resolution feels more illustrative than inevitable; the tile flake's properties solve the central problem without friction, and the boy's accidental proverb arrives conveniently. The ending reweights the premise, but the path there lacks surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Inez is present throughout and makes the key choice to tap the tile flake, refracting the proverb. Her observation drives the mandala's construction and her final statement to the boy articulates the thematic turn. However, her decisions feel more responsive than generative; the tile flake and grotto do much of the work. Early signal strong, two beats (mandala construction, tile tap, closing conversation), moderate causal pressure, closure linkage present but shared with objects.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tile flake is introduced early ("In her pocket lay a whispering gallery tile flake"), handled and described in multiple beats (held to ear, warmed "like a coin in a fever," tapped against stone), and its acoustic properties enable the key turn when it refracts the proverb into fragments. It recurs with reweighted meaning: first a relic, then "a tool for this new listening." Strong early signal, three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage. Specificity is high—its whispering-gallery origin and sound-bending mechanics are irreplaceable. One friction: its convenience as a solution reduces felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "emergent hush" is named explicitly and described as growing "in the spaces where the last syllables used to bounce." It thickens under the tile flake's influence and "translated" the proverb fragments. The concept shapes the grotto's acoustics and the communal response, altering tactics (people begin offering half-remembered lines). Present in setup, middle development, and closure image ("hush that belonged to everyone"). Moderate causal pressure; the hush is more atmosphere than constraint. Some specificity, but it operates passively rather than forcing choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Inez's social perceptiveness is stated early ("steady attention of someone socially perceptive enough to hear the pauses") and shown when she sees "the teacher's jaw tighten" and reads "fear give way to relief." It enables her to notice hesitations where meaning tries to surface. Present in setup and middle, but does not shape the final beat. One on-page action (noticing the teacher's fear and interjecting) is enabled, but no visible cost or trade-off. Functional but not irreplaceable; another artist might use a different sense.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The interjection is the story's hinge: "Before the teacher could scold him back into blankness, Inez interjected, not with a shout but by tapping the tile flake against the stone." It redefines the circle's crisis, refracts the proverb, and shifts the teacher's stance. Present in setup (foreshadowed by her watching), executed at the turn, and its consequences shape the ending (people offering their own lines). High causal pressure, strong closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability (the manner—tile tap—is specific, but the act of interjecting could be swapped). Two beats, good specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced early ("she knelt on a flat stone and poured a pouch of colored sand into her palm") and used to read moods ("the spirals she drew tightened whenever the teacher's voice grew brittle"). It catches proverb fragments "like grains settling into grooves" and becomes "a map of shared doubt" at closure. Present in setup, middle (twice), and ending. The method constrains her approach and charges the final image when the boy smudges it. Strong early signal, three beats, moderate causal pressure, high closure linkage. One friction: its mechanics—how patterns translate mood—remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is anchored immediately ("Mist pooled in the whispering grotto") and its acoustics are central: it "repeated what you said until it lost its sense," enabling the unlearning practice and later refracting the proverb. The mist and limestone walls supply atmosphere and the flat stone provides Inez's workspace. The grotto's properties constrain the community's tactics and enable the tile flake's effect. Present in setup, development (echoes, acoustics), and closure ("the cave were breathing with them"). High causal pressure, strong closure linkage, irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The unlearning is named in the opening lines ("During the unlearning, when the city had decided facts were a kind of violence") and establishes the social stakes. It frames why people come to the grotto and why the teacher leads students in chanting "I do not know." However, it operates as backdrop rather than live pressure; no on-page clock or decision is shaped by the unlearning's progression. Present in setup and thematic closure (the new listening as a response to the unlearning), but absent from middle development. Functional context, limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inez's desire "to discover meaning in the mess that forgetting made" is stated early and drives her presence in the grotto. It is dramatized through her construction of the mandala, her interjection, and her closing statement to the boy. The motivation faces friction when the teacher nearly scolds the boy and when Inez must choose whether to correct the smudge. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure realization. Moderate causal pressure; the desire is more observational than conflicted. One visible trade-off: she laughs instead of correcting, accepting ephemerality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is named explicitly and recurs: the mist turns walls "the color of watered lilacs," then "a lilac unease…made them glance at each other," and finally "the lilac unease loosen at the edges." Tone is coherent and modulates from ambient threat to communal relief. It charges the middle beat (the frozen circle) and softens at closure. Present across all three gates, moderate specificity, purposeful arc. One friction: "lilac" as descriptor feels ornamental in places, and the unease is more stated than embodied in sentence rhythm or sensory pressure.</comment>
