<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (recording the choir, asking each singer to name what they can give up, repairing the zither), and her past—unlearning her father's exclusionary lessons—credibly drives her present stakes. The secondary characters (miner, sisters, Niko) apply pressure but remain somewhat interchangeable in their function; their individual arcs are gestured at rather than fully dramatized. The final choice (letting silence sit as verdict) reads as earned renunciation with visible cost—she refuses to plead—but the council's sudden conversion ("even the most practical councilman looked down") feels convenient, undercutting the protagonist's agency at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mara in velvet library, autumn, pre-vote fundraiser) and accumulates pressure through rehearsal beats that subtract noise, building to a closure where sustained silence becomes verdict. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the choir's earned quiet sits as implicit argument, and the councilman's response signals a shift. Cost is legible—Mara risks the fundraiser's failure by refusing to plead—but the councilman's capitulation arrives too easily, reducing the felt price and undercutting the earned nature of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (cold windows, warm rugs, traveled stillness), and the zither's repaired rosette constrains Mara's choice to include it in the performance, charging the final image with its "lace of shadow." Sensory selection reflects urgency (chaos of first rehearsal vs. stillness of final concert), and micro-setting (the library after hours, drapes, chalkboard) shapes the choir's transformation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's particularity—velvet, old instruments, stamped ledgers—filters through Mara's professional and emotional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (saving the arts wing) is signaled early and tightens through the fundraiser's approach. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara records the chaos and asks each singer to subtract one noise, narrowing their tactics and raising the performance's stakes. However, the final turn—the councilman's decision to keep the arts wing—arrives off-page in his internal reaction rather than through a dramatized negotiation or visible tradeoff, reducing agency and felt cost. The method ("subtracting noise") constrains rehearsal choices with visible progress, but the resolution feels granted rather than won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (erasure as quiet violence, harmony through subtraction) emerges organically from the zither's repaired rosette, the roll call of lost classes, and the method of subtracting noise rather than adding volume. The final image—silence as verdict—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Mara's arc (unlearning her father's exclusion, braiding voices until they cannot be pulled apart) integrates with the thematic question. One weakness: the phrase "crossing that long bridge of unlearning hatred" in the councilman's moment risks thematic echo by surfacing the story's thesis too explicitly in the final paragraph, though it remains tied to scene perception rather than detached commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("windows breathed cold," "echoes remember what people practiced"), elevated diction that fits Mara's choir-teacher idiom, and purposeful metaphor (rosette as eye, braid as unity). POV remains stable in third-limited, with no head-hopping; the councilman's interiority in the final beat is narrated as external observation ("looked down, as if") rather than true access. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("We will find the song by subtracting noise"); the roll call and sustained notes function as performative speech that advances plot. One minor slip: "practiced there" in "echoes remember what people practiced there" briefly wobbles between literal and figurative, but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (most lines do double work: world-building + character or theme + image). However, several long sentences—especially the opening and Mara's reflection on her father—approach syntactic overload, stacking clauses without clear propulsion and risking reader fatigue. The phrase "the vanishing arts were quieter casualties, erased not by flames but by memos that arrived like dust on shelves" is vivid but stretches the metaphor chain (flames/memos/dust) without anchoring in concrete action. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt expectantly resigned," "seemed to sing along") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold detected, and the final image (silence as verdict) propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—saving arts education through a choir that literally practices subtraction rather than addition—offers a fresh angle on the familiar "community rallies to save a program" template. The zither rosette as framing device (beauty needs air to pass, not walls) and the roll call of lost classes as performative grief are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (underdog teacher wins over skeptical council through a moving performance) follows a well-worn path, and the councilman's conversion lacks the specificity or moral calculus that would transform the trope. The method ("subtracting noise") is the story's most original inflection, but its thematic echo in the final paragraph nudges toward articulated thesis rather than earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (harmonious choir teacher) drives at least three beats: setting up the fundraiser, developing the subtraction method during rehearsals, and choosing to let silence sit as verdict rather than pleading at the end. Her professional identity (coaxing diverse voices into harmony) directly shapes her tactics (recording chaos, asking singers to subtract noise, repairing the zither). Her past (unlearning her father's exclusionary church) motivates her present stance and is linked to a micro-choice (braiding voices until they cannot be pulled apart). The closure hinges on her decision to withhold speech, a renunciation with visible cost—she risks the council's indifference—though the councilman's conversion somewhat diffuses her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears early (Mara sees it when she opens the instrument case), is handled in a middle beat (she repairs it with glue and patience, observing that "beauty needs a place for air to pass"), and charges the final image (Niko plays it, its "lace of shadow" falls on the sheet music, and the thin sound braids with the choir). The rosette's specific property—its carved vines worn smooth, its dark hole framing air—constrains Mara's choice to include it in the performance and reweights the story's central metaphor (subtraction, openness). Removing this exact object would weaken the thematic coherence and reduce the final image's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vanishing arts (the core concept) shapes the dominant stake from the opening (council vote to close the arts wing) through the middle (fundraiser rehearsals) to closure (the arts wing stays). It alters tactics on the page: Mara borrows old instruments, invites a patchwork choir, names lost classes as "vanishing species," and uses the concert to argue implicitly for continuation. The concept is not merely thematic backdrop but the engine of conflict—budget cuts as quiet violence—and the resolution directly addresses it. Cost is visible: Mara risks her credibility and the choir's cohesion on an unconventional performance strategy.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" (the attribute) is signaled early ("she felt expectantly resigned, knowing the council would soon vote to close the arts wing") and constrains her opening stance—she prepares for loss while still working toward rescue, a paradox that shapes her choice to let silence speak rather than plead at the end. However, the trait is more label than dramatized contradiction; we see her preparing and teaching, but the internal tension between expectation and resignation is summarized rather than embodied in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The attribute surfaces again at closure (her refusal to plead reads as resignation with agency), but the cost tied specifically to this trait remains implicit rather than sharply legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Denote" (the action) appears twice with distinct meaning: Mara lets the zither's emptiness "denote what the council called progress" (a private recognition of loss) and writes each singer's subtraction choices on the chalkboard "as if to denote a map out of old habits" (a teaching act that structures the rehearsal method). The chalkboard moment is causally active—it guides the choir's transformation—and the rosette's denoting function primes the final metaphor (air, openness). However, the action is somewhat swappable with "signify" or "mark" without breaking the story's structure. It threads through the piece but does not redefine options as decisively as a fully indispensable hinge action would.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" (the method) is signaled early (Mara plays back the chaotic rehearsal and says, "We will find the song by subtracting noise"), structures the middle beats (she asks each singer to name one sound they can give up; the miner drops sarcasm, the sisters drop guarded silence, Niko drops his reflex to shout), and is implicit in the closure (the "quiet, newly earned by subtracting noise" sits as verdict). The method's mechanics matter: each rehearsal removes a layer, and the final sustained notes and thin zither sound demonstrate the result. Removing this exact method would collapse the story's causal spine and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is present by the first sentence, constrains choices (Mara borrows it for after-hours rehearsals, the drapes and space allow "traveled stillness" to build, the setting's formality pressures the council members in the front row), and charges the final image ("the room itself seemed to sing along" as the silence sits). The library's particularity—velvet, cold windows, warm rugs, old instruments in a case—filters through Mara's perception and shapes the choir's transformation from chaos to harmony. Autumn's temporal marker anchors the urgency (pre-vote season). Removing this setting would weaken the story's atmospheric cohesion and reduce the final moment's environmental resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" (the timeframe) is invoked once as backstory ("She had spent years, across unlearning hatred, untangling the lessons that came with hymns sung through clenched teeth") and echoed at closure ("as if he too were crossing that long bridge of unlearning hatred"). It provides thematic depth—Mara's personal history motivates her present work—but does not tighten present-tense decisions or function as a live clock. The timeframe is more reflective than operational; no rehearsal deadline or countdown pressures tactics on the page. The phrase recurs with symbolic weight but does not alter moves or escalate stakes within the story's present window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation (to braid diverse voices into harmony until the braid cannot be pulled apart without tearing everyone) is dramatized early (Mara's reputation for coaxing shy baritones and sharp-tongued sopranos), structures middle beats (she invites a patchwork choir, records their chaos, guides subtraction, repairs the zither to enable Niko's contribution), and is tested at closure (the braided vowels and consonants in the final chord become the implicit argument that persuades the council). Friction between want and cost is visible: Mara risks the fundraiser's failure by refusing conventional fundraising rhetoric and trusting silence. The desire is not merely told but enacted through specific, irreversible choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" (the tone) is seeded early ("the hush as if it were a pilgrim returning"), develops through rehearsals ("the library took on traveled stillness, the kind you feel in a station after the last train, when echoes remember what people practiced there"), and charges the final image ("the quiet, newly earned by subtracting noise, sit in the velvet library like a verdict"). The tone modulates with pressure—chaos gives way to stillness—and the metaphor (pilgrim, station, echoes) coheres across beats. However, "traveled stillness" as a coined phrase risks opacity; its meaning (stillness that has journeyed, or stillness found in transit spaces) must be inferred from context. The tone is purposeful and integral, but slightly less immediate than a more transparent descriptor would be.</comment>
