<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("circuitously sincere, arriving by side roads of jokes and questions"), and her contradictory impulses—wanting intimacy "in theory but not in skin"—act simultaneously on the page. The metamorphosis is earned through prior causality (touching the leaf, resisting, then releasing control), with visible cost (darkened nails, altered senses). Minor slip: the boy's nod "as if he understood more than she did" edges toward convenience, but the rest of the characterization is embodied and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the leaf triggers a pattern of changing perception, resistance through lists and scrubbing, then a cadence shift to releasing control that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (Mara, nursery, storm season) land cleanly by line three. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara becomes "a better witness," no longer chasing certainty but recording what vines choose, with the leaf pressed in her journal as visible cost of her transformation. One persistent constraint (her changing body) shapes tactics (scrubbing, then yielding to plants' choices) throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis constrains a key choice (rebuild by releasing control vs. forcing vines back) and charges the final image (sitting under the rebuilt trellis, tasting the leaf). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara's professional lens: "roots angled toward runoff," "vines... straining for a different path," "scent of wet mint." Storm season and the trellis's collapse create immediate spatial pressure. The linden leaf as micro-object anchors the transformation and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's boundary between observer and subject) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the metamorphosis forces her to choose between resisting (lists, scrubbing) and yielding (letting vines choose their path). The trellis reconstruction becomes the on-page test where agency (releasing control) forecloses her prior method with visible cost ("felt like failure"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the plants' steadier growth proves the stakes. Minor: the university mailing at the end feels like a light add-on rather than a charged final move, though the pressed leaf carries thematic weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (witness vs. control, transformation through yielding) emerges from concrete particulars: the trellis split, darkened nails, vines choosing their own rise. The linden leaf as recurring motif constrains choice (each touch branches her thoughts) and charges closure (pressed in journal, tasted for bitterness, carrying "images of distant streets"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"turning her into a better witness"—without stating a moral, and the transformation reweights prior material (her tidy notebooks, forced boundaries). No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual signature consistent: "circuitously sincere," notices "how roots angled toward runoff," feels "each potted fern breathe." Diction remains character-specific ("reluctantly, like bark taking rain") and modulates under pressure (short bursts during metamorphosis, longer cadence at closure). The boy's brief dialogue feels natural and advances plot (Mara's roundabout explanation about listening). Minor: "transforming her into a better witness" in the penultimate sentence edges toward summary, though it's concretely anchored in the prior beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (most lines advance character and atmosphere), and figurative language is controlled ("bark taking rain," "thoughts branched"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "the careful boundaries she kept between observer and subject began to soften, reluctantly, like bark taking rain" is a touch overwritten for a high-pressure beat, and "by releasing control" + "letting the strongest stems choose" is near-synonym pairing within two lines. Closure beats are clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical observation and reluctant metamorphosis through a single leaf is specific and non-obvious. The transformation avoids stock body-horror or wish-fulfillment paths; instead, Mara's resistance (scrubbing, lists) and eventual yielding feel particular to her professional identity. The trellis reconstruction as dramatized choice (releasing control vs. forcing vines back) transforms a familiar "letting go" trope into occupational specificity. Minor: the storm-blown message premise is familiar territory, and the university mailing at the end is a conventional gesture that doesn't add fresh insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create key turns: she picks up the leaf (inciting), resists metamorphosis through lists and scrubbing (middle), then chooses to release control when rebuilding the trellis (climax). Her decision to let vines choose their path rather than force them back alters tactics and earns the closure image. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The linden leaf appears in setup (stuck to trellis, glassine envelope), development (each touch branches thoughts, triggers metamorphosis), and payoff (tasted on tongue, pressed in journal). It constrains choice (touching it deepens transformation), enables tactics (understanding why seeds wait or rush), and charges the final image with visible cost. Irreplaceable: the story hinges on this exact object's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis shapes stakes (boundary between observer and subject) and tactics on the page: Mara resists (scrubbing, lists), then yields (releasing control). The transformation alters options (from commanding plants to letting them choose) and drives the trellis reconstruction. Present in setup (tremor through fingers), development (nails darken, senses shift), and payoff (pressed leaf, "quietly remade"). Cost is visible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circuitously sincere constrains one visible action with cost: Mara speaks to customers "in her roundabout way, asking what their gardens wanted" and answers the boy's question "with a story about listening" rather than direct explanation. Signaled early ("arriving by side roads of jokes and questions"), the trait appears in dialogue and shapes her voice. Missing strong middle development or closure payoff; mid-band appropriate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reconstruct defines the major turn: Mara must choose between forcing vines back (old method) or releasing control (new method). The action is dramatized on the page ("she tried a method that felt like failure, by releasing control"), alters tactics (setting posts within reach vs. commanding growth), and produces visible outcome (steadier growth). Present in setup (trellis splits), development (choice crystallizes), and payoff (trellis stands thick with new shoots). Swapping this action would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>By releasing control is signaled early ("careful boundaries... began to soften"), its mechanics matter (Mara stops scrubbing/forcing, lets stems choose), and it shapes the climactic attempt (trellis reconstruction). The method's cost ("felt like failure") and payoff (plants respond with steadier growth) are on the page. Present in setup (resistance hints at alternative), development (choice crystallizes), and payoff (closure image: sitting under rebuilt trellis, thanking vines). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mossy trellis after rain pressures the central choice (how to rebuild) and supplies the resource that affects outcome (vines' strain shows their desired path). It appears in setup (Mara walks there "because the vines... reacted fastest"), inciting incident (trellis splits), development (she studies vines' strain), and payoff (sits under rebuilt trellis at closure). The setting's specific properties (post-rain reactivity, visible strain) constrain tactics and charge the final image. Irreplaceable micro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Storm season tightens decisions by providing the inciting event (wind splits trellis), atmospheric pressure (clouds, thunder rolling), and temporal frame ("weeks at a time," "finally loosened its grip"). Present in setup and payoff, but middle development is vague—no live clock tracks storm progression or forces time-constrained choices during the trellis reconstruction. Functional but not indispensable; a stronger beat-by-beat storm escalation would raise the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To study plant behaviors is dramatized early (Mara notes "how roots angled toward runoff," keeps "tidy notebooks") and generates friction: she wanted intimacy "in theory but not in skin." The motivation drives her initial choice (collect leaf as evidence) and conflicts with her resistance to metamorphosis. Present in setup, development (desire vs. cost), and payoff (becomes "a better witness," records what vines choose). Cost is visible; causal pressure is strong. Missing one additional middle beat where the motivation forces a harder trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sustaining transformation is coherent through turns: lyric and patient in setup (Mara's careful observation), compressed and embodied during metamorphosis (nails darken, senses shift), then returns to calm purposefulness at closure (sitting under trellis, thanking vines). Tone modulates with pressure without breaking—no false comedy or sentiment—and charges the final image ("quietly remade," leaf pressed in journal). The accumulative cadence supports the Textural lens and reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
