<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction—burning bridges as ritual yet responding to Lio's shadow—is embodied through her physical interaction with scars and threshold, not merely asserted. The trait "burns bridges carefully" is demonstrated through concrete action (letting phone go dark, tracing scars) but the peak choice to help Lio feels slightly under-motivated given the established pattern of severance; the shift from isolation to connection needs one more micro-choice showing internal friction. Emotions are mostly embodied (breath as "thin, mean thread," panic in wood grain) though "loaded emptiness" flirts with label-only phrasing. The final acceptance that "some contact must be cut so that others can breathe" earns the stance shift but could use sharper internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (chapel), and when (after cutting contact, then "coldest night") by the second paragraph, meeting the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through metaphoric layering (darkness folded like cloth, grief as wet ash, threshold as seam) and lands closure through a cadence shift—the final dawn image reweights the opening isolation with "no longer poison" and "waited for the next ring." Cost is legible: Mara rebuilds one bridge while accepting ongoing solitude, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio's choking shadow forces her to extend her scarring method outward. Minor slip: the mechanics of "shadow shaped like Lio" crossing without crossing could be clearer—slightly relies on metaphor to carry causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ashen chapel, warm doorknocker rings, and charcoal-rubbed walls anchor setting early and recur purposefully. The doorknocker constrains choice: its rattle signals Lio's arrival and its final strike reinforces the threshold, directly affecting the closure beat. Starlight spilling "like water into a sinking boat" modulates sensory detail under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara at door, Lio kneeling in ash outside, scars between them). The "fading threshold" micro-setting functions as both boundary and mechanism, altering tactics when grief encroaches. Minor gap: the exact geography of "where the city ended and the sky began" remains slightly abstract; one concrete anchor (a visible landmark, distance cue) would lift specificity without bloating the count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining the sanctuary's threshold against encroaching grief—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lio's panic threatens to flood it. One meaningful escalation: Mara must extend her private method (tracing scars) to another person, a renunciation of total isolation with visible cost ("accepting that some contact must be cut so that others can breathe"). The doorknocker strike and Lio's exhale mark the turn; the resolution is earned by Mara's agency (opening the door, guiding his hands) under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt: she remains alone at dawn but no longer calls the emptiness poison, a Charged Poise moment. No luck solves; coincidence (Lio's shadow-crossing) complicates but Mara's ritual choice resolves. Pressure coheres and deepens once, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—how deliberate severance can be both survival and poison, and when reconnection becomes necessary—emerges through concrete ritual (bridge burning, scar tracing) and the doorknocker's warm-skin memory rather than statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: Mara's solitude shifts from punishment to chosen vigil ("waited for the next ring to ask for air"), reweighting the opening isolation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the phone-going-dark beat and the inversion of "teaching suffocating to breathe" as an act of naming pain rather than offering comfort. Minor thematic echo risk: "loaded emptiness...no longer poison" borders on articulating the thesis, but it remains imagistic and tied to the sanctuary's physical state. The scar-linking motif constrains choice and charges the closure, avoiding token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance is controlled (perceptions filtered through her ritual lens: "darkness could be folded like cloth"). Diction remains voice-consistent—elevated but anchored in tactile metaphor (soot, ash, grain, ridges). Psychic certainty stays modest: Mara realizes it's Lio, she infers his panic through the ring and grain, she does not read his mind. The prose has distinct texture: sentence rhythm modulates (short bursts at the rattling ring, longer cadences in reflection). Minor slip: "breathless shadow shaped like Lio" introduces slight ambiguity—is it metaphor or literal spirit-form?—and the narration does not clarify Mara's interpretation quickly enough. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (door opening, guiding hands) syntax tightens appropriately without voice drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most sentences advance character, world, or pressure). Figurative language is dense throughout—threshold as seam, shadows restless and hungry, grief as wet ash, breath as thread—and while the metaphors cohere thematically, several beats layer two or three images in quick succession without pause, risking overwriting in a high-pressure window (e.g., "starlight spilled into the chapel like water into a sinking boat" immediately after "chimed like a bell underwater"). Template-cadence check: "She knelt, turned up her sleeves, and placed..."; "She told him how she had learned...how she had made..." shows mild stem repetition but stays legible. No paraphrase loops or pronoun confusion. Sentence openings vary. One minor clarity gap: "To teach suffocating to breathe" as infinitive purpose reads slightly abstract mid-crisis; a concrete anchor (e.g., "To pull air back into him") would sharpen immediacy. Overall strong craft with figurative density approaching but not breaching penalty threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of isolation-as-ritual, tactile memory in metal, and teaching breath through scar-tracing offers a specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The inversion of "burns bridges carefully" from destructive impulse to protective craft, then to conditional reconnection, transforms a familiar self-isolation arc. The shadow-crossing and threshold mechanics borrow from liminal fantasy but integrate them as psychological metaphor rather than world-building exposition, a purposeful choice. Risk distinction: using scars as both past wound and present teaching tool, and closing on solitude reframed rather than resolved, elevates the piece. Minor derivative element: the "burned chapel rebuilt" and "tender keeper" frame echo common sanctuary-after-trauma templates; the specific charcoal-and-ash materiality and the doorknocker-as-memory innovation provide enough freshness to avoid heavy penalty but not enough for top-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara makes three on-page decisions: maintaining the sanctuary by tracing scars (early), opening the door to Lio's shadow (midpoint turn), and guiding his hands to her scars while naming her history (closure beat). Each choice narrows options—opening the door risks the threshold, sharing scars forecloses total isolation. The final acceptance ("some contact must be cut so that others can breathe") crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she remains alone but vigilant rather than sealed. Early signal present (paragraph one: "tender shadow keeper"). Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. No swappability: remove "tender shadow keeper" and the ritual maintenance and teaching mechanics collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in four beats: introduced as warm-as-skin memory holders (early), rattles to signal Lio's arrival (inciting incident), Mara presses forehead to door feeling panic through it (middle), and both strike it once to reinforce the threshold (closure action). The object's warmth and memory-holding properties are specific and irreplaceable—generic bell or knocker would not carry the bridge-burning/severance theme. Causal pressure: the rattle forces Mara's choice to open; the final strike seals the threshold repair. Cost connection: striking it means she has added Lio to the memory-rings, a visible tradeoff. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff; beats are functionally distinct.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fading threshold shapes stakes (maintains sanctuary vs. encroaching grief), tactics (mending by tracing scars when it thins, opening door when it fades fast), and the closure mechanism (reinforcing it via the doorknocker strike and scar-linking). Introduced early (paragraph two: "seam between...world that forgot and...world that begged to be remembered"). The concept is not merely thematic—it creates the problem (threshold fading lets Lio's shadow cross) and the solution framework (linking through scars stitches the seam). Specificity high: "fading threshold" as both boundary and wound is irreplaceable. Two frictions: the mechanics of how linking scars repairs a cosmic seam are asserted more than demonstrated, relying on metaphoric logic; and the concept could be more tightly bound to the scar attribute (why scars specifically mend thresholds is implied but not causal).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is demonstrated in three beats: the opening summary of her method ("cutting threads clean so...would not fray"), the phone-going-dark flashback (let Lio's call go unanswered after his mother died), and the peak confession to Lio ("how she had learned to sever people before they could leave her"). The trait constrains her initial impulse to stay sealed and enables the final turn—because she burned bridges as ritual, not rage, she can now teach that precision to Lio and selectively rebuild one bridge. Cost is visible: helping Lio reopens the contact she had cut. Early signal present. Two frictions: the phone-going-dark beat is told in summary rather than shown as a dramatized choice, reducing immediacy (−0.4); and "burns bridges carefully" as phrase is close to label-only in the opening, though later beats dramatize it (−0.2). Strong thematic and causal role rescues mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears twice: grief encroaches when the threshold thins (setup, paragraph two) and shadows become "restless and hungry" (same beat). The encroachment creates the problem that drives Mara's nightly mending ritual and sets up the crisis when Lio's panic encroaches acutely. Middle development: the encroachment forces her to open the door. Closure: after the ritual, "outside grief receded"—the encroachment is reversed. Causal role clear; beats are setup, complication, and resolution. Two frictions: "encroach" as mechanism is asserted (grief presses "like wet ash through cracks") rather than shown in specific sensory change that alters Mara's perception or movement (−0.4); and the action is easily paraphrasable to "intrude" or "press in" without major structural loss, reducing irreplaceability (−0.3). Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced (paragraph two: "mend the threshold only by linking through scars, tracing healed lines...naming the moments"), demonstrated as Mara's solo method (early), then extended to Lio at the climax ("placed his shadow hands on her scars...As his fingertips traced the ridges, memories rose"). The method is the story's core mechanism: it teaches Lio the rhythm of naming pain and taking breath, which enables his exhale and the threshold repair. Specificity high: scars as both wound-history and teaching surface are irreplaceable. The method shapes three beats (nightly mending, the teaching moment, the final strike) and the closure depends on it—without scar-linking, the threshold cannot be mended. Cost: sharing scars means revealing her history and rebuilding a bridge. One minor friction: the exact causal link between tracing scars and repairing a cosmic seam is metaphoric assertion rather than mechanics, but the story signals this is symbolic logic from the start, so no penalty for genre consistency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is introduced in the opening line, anchors all action (Mara tends it, Lio's shadow appears at its door, starlight spills in when the threshold fails, dawn closes the scene). The setting provides resources (walls that hold threshold-reinforcing sound, doorknocker rings, the step where Lio kneels) and pressures choices (starlight spilling forces Mara to act quickly). The ash motif recurs with purpose: chapel "rebuilt from soot," Lio's knees leave "clean imprint...in ash." Micro-setting detail (body, scars, hands on wood) charges the final image. Two frictions: "where the city ended and the sky began" is evocative but remains abstract—no concrete landmark or distance cue (−0.2); and while the sanctuary frames the action, one beat where the environment's layout alters a tactic (e.g., doorway width, wall proximity) would deepen constraint (−0.3). Strong atmospheric and thematic integration; solid causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" timeframe is signaled in the opening line and establishes the story's present as a long isolation punctuated by Lio's return. The phone-going-dark flashback ("after his mother died") anchors the severance causally. The "coldest night of the year" marks the inciting incident. Dawn closes the window. The timeframe tightens decisions: Mara's isolation is durable (years of tending), Lio's arrival is acute (one night), and the closure at dawn forecloses the contact window—he fades, she returns to solitude. Two frictions: internal elapsed time during the teaching scene (tracing scars, whispering stories, Lio drawing breaths) is compressed without clear duration cues, making it hard to gauge whether minutes or hours pass (−0.4); and "after cutting off all contact" as phrase is setup-only—once established, the timeframe does not apply visible pressure during the peak beats, though it primes the stakes (−0.3). Functional but mid-replaceable; a ticking element (e.g., starlight fading faster, threshold thinning visibly) would raise urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is the stated motivation when Mara opens the door and guides the teaching scene. It is dramatized through concrete action: she places his hands on her scars, whispers stories, and models the rhythm "pain named, breath taken, pain named again" until Lio draws full exhale. The desire faces friction—she must violate her isolation and share painful history—creating visible cost at closure (bridge rebuilt, but she remains alone). Early signal: implicit in the opening ritual (she tends light by shaping dark), explicit at the inciting beat. Causal pressure: the motivation drives the climax choice. One friction: the infinitive phrase "to teach suffocating to breathe" appears mid-paragraph as narrator summary rather than emerging from Mara's interiority, reading slightly abstract and tells the reader the goal before showing her discover it in action (−0.5). The teaching scene itself is embodied and specific, rescuing strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is introduced in paragraph one ("loaded emptiness in her chest") and returns at closure ("loaded emptiness still present but no longer poison"). The tone permeates: silence as both survival and punishment, rituals as weight-bearing structures, the heaviness of memory-filled rings, breath as struggle. The prose modulates with pressure—longer, layered syntax in the ritual description, shorter bursts at the rattling ring, compressed rhythm during the teaching scene. The final image reweights the tone: "loaded emptiness" shifts from toxic isolation to chosen vigil, charging the closure without resolving into easy comfort. The tone is coherent across turns and integral to theme. One friction: "loaded emptiness" as phrase borders on label-only and appears twice in nearly identical form, risking repetition without reweighting (−0.3). The tonal modulation through rhythm and image is strong enough to keep high-band eligibility.</comment>
