<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rovan's character is grounded in concrete choices—zigzag walking to break rhythm, voicing silence, releasing the spike—that arise from established traits (cool-headed, respectful of patterns). His final renunciation is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost (empty hands, echo sealed away). Minor slip: Mera's gift is vividly described but her interiority remains thin, operating more as functional support than a fully contradictory presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Rovan releases the spike to seal the warning-echo, forecloses the goddess-prize path, and carries the lullaby internally with felt cost (empty hands, quieted garden). Escalation builds through density increase (overlapping harmonics, figure of static) and pattern break (constellations stumble, garden erupts) that reweights the stake from prize to protection. One meaningful tightening is present and cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains multiple choices: zigzag walking to avoid constellation-matching, reeds that howl softer with rhythm breaks, pool that answers his voiced silence. The rail spike's metallic memory and Mera's inked page function as micro-setting tools that enable and charge the final act. The Wave Arbor and trellis guide spatial movement and the final image (spike falling into pool) uses environment to seal the closure effect with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: catch Sileth's echo. Pressure tightens through protagonist agency—voicing silence tightens the line, choosing the quietest harmonic narrows options, and the final release forecloses the prize path with visible cost (empty hands, echo sealed). The trade-off between possession and protection emerges through his own realization and action. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—patterns that break themselves to resist prediction—emerges organically from zigzag walking, sleepwalking constellations, and the feral lullaby with teeth. The closure image (spike sealed, constellations easing) offers a non-literal answer: protection through unpredictability, renunciation over capture. Subtext operates through gesture (voicing silence, letting the spike fall) and the echo's song "without sound." No explicit moralizing; the final cost (empty hands, internal lullaby) reweights prior material with conceptual and felt pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Rovan; perceptual signature is consistent (metallic memory, measured calm, respect for storms). Diction remains character-particular ("cool-headed," "zigzag," "feral lullaby") with strong rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift: "transliterates emotions into marks" and "half asleep" occasionally elevate beyond the established idiom. Mera's brief dialogue ("Do it by voicing silence, or the echo will bite you back") carries subtext and advances plot cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high with purposeful compression ("reeds of glass hummed," "ponds rose in ripples shaped like staff lines"). Rhythm varies naturally and propels through the final beat. Minor template-cadence pattern: "He did not hum; he opened his mouth... The pool answered... and in the sky one constellation stumbled" uses balanced clause structure across three beats. No loops or paraphrase; figurative language (sleepwalking constellations, feral lullaby) remains coherent and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound-based ecology, sleepwalking constellations as tide-drivers, emotion-to-notation as bait, goddess-echo as warning rather than prize—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend entirely on these particulars. Risk-taking (voicing silence, zigzag anti-rhythm, lullaby with teeth) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final renunciation grows inevitably from prior specifics and defies the expected capture-story arc with earned moral complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rovan's cool-headed trait drives key choices: zigzag walking (narrows options), voicing silence (enables the line), choosing the quietest harmonic (shapes tactics), and releasing the spike (closure act with visible cost). Present early, developed across multiple beats, and indispensable to the final image. Removing this trait would collapse story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rail spike appears early (carried at belt), used in three distinct beats (struck against stone to ring, pinned with Mera's page, lowered into pool), and its defining property (metal remembers straight tracks) matters causally in a place that curves sound. Final act—letting it fall to seal runes and echo—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations shape stakes (change the tide of sound below), constrain tactics (Rovan zigzags to avoid matching their steps), and participate in closure (one stumbles when snagged, they ease into gentler drift after the spike is sealed). Present early, causally active across beats, and reweighted in the final image. Removing them would break escalation and the ending's resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mera's transliteration enables the core tactic: her inked longing becomes bait that translates into sound and tugs Rovan forward. The trait's mechanics matter (fear = sharp angles, hope = curves; marks flare into runes on the spike). Used in two beats (page pressed into palm, marks flaring on spike) and contributes to closure cost. Specific but slightly less indispensable than other elements—another form of bait might substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zigzag action is signaled early (path responds to footsteps), constrains multiple beats (breaking rhythm to avoid constellation-matching, making reeds howl softer, choosing quietest path again at the far edge), and its logic (break patterns to keep unpredictable) directly serves the thematic closure. Causally essential; removing it would collapse both escalation and the ending's conceptual foundation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voicing silence is seeded in Mera's instruction, becomes the pivotal tactic at the Wave Arbor (shapes absence of hum, air turns dense, pool answers with resonance), and its mechanics matter to the closure (thickens into static figure, song pours into spike). Present in setup and development, causally active in the peak beat, and charges the final transformation. Swapping for another incantation would require substantial rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is established immediately and pressures every choice: sand path responds to footsteps (forces zigzag), reeds howl and ponds quiver with non-human chords (guide navigation), Wave Arbor broods with oldest melodies (destination), trellis vibrates like a throat (frames final encounter), pool accepts the spike (closure vessel). Setting is indispensable to story logic, stakes, tactics, and the final sealing act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "when patterns break themselves" is named early by elders, drives the urgency (Sileth's echo appears in broken patterns, this is the season of hunger), and manifests on the page when the garden erupts into overlapping harmonics. The concept shapes Rovan's belief and enables the closure logic (breaking patterns keeps the garden safe from tyrants). Temporal pressure is conceptual rather than clock-driven but causally integral to stakes and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation to catch Sileth's echo is stated early, tested through tactical choices (selecting quietest harmonic, following the thread with respect rather than marching straight), and conflicted at closure when Rovan realizes the echo is warning, not prize. The final renunciation (letting spike fall, sealing echo) dramatizes the friction between want (capture) and discovered cost (protection through unpredictability). Removing this motivation would dissolve the arc's tension and the ending's weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Feral lullaby tone is seeded early (reeds "howl softer, like wolves trying to remember a lullaby") and charges the final image ("lullaby with teeth," "feral lullaby inside his ribs"). The paradox—soothing yet predatory—modulates coherently through pressure (overlapping harmonics, static figure singing without sound) and the ending's quiet menace (garden quiet as held breath). Tone is specific, consistent, and reweights the closure with undeniable texture.</comment>
