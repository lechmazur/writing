<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is vivid and her dancer's perceptual signature (reading currents with ankles, noticing gaps) distinguishes her viewpoint. The anchoring sequence shows embodied reaction—panic flaring, then dancer sense noticing rhythm—and her choice to keep the speck rather than gain release demonstrates contradictory impulses in scene. However, the motivation remains largely contemplative; her final turn toward "other banned gardens" reads as resolved intent rather than a choice under competing pressure, and the embodied cost of staying anchored dissolves too neatly when the keeper releases her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when within the opening and builds pressure through layered images (moonstone dust → anchoring → garden keeper → tattooing) that reweight the dominant stake (preserving nostalgia against censorship). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira rises, understands her next action as "fledge," and commits to a network of inscribed verses. The cost is visible—exile deepens, body becomes text, future tactics narrow—and the final image of her dancing while the garden keeps time behind her recharges prior material. One micro-tension: the keeper's bargain is dramatized but resolved swiftly, limiting the felt friction at that pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden is anchored early with blackleaf spirals, brine-language fountains, and dew-wet paths. The moonstone speck and fountain brine become literal ink, constraining her choice to stay anchored and shaping the tattoo's silver-cold quality. The garden's rhythmic anchoring forces her to dance seated, altering her method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (stone bench, hedge edges, heron's nest) remains clear. The setting participates directly in closure: the keeper touches the bench to release her, and the garden "keeps time behind her" as she departs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving nostalgia by inscribing it on the body so censors cannot erase it without drawing blood. The keeper's bargain—give up the speck or stay anchored and learn—tightens options in scene, and Mira's choice to keep it narrows her path. The anchoring shifts from restraint to fulcrum, enabling the tattoo that forecloses return to passive exile. Cost is legible: her body becomes the page, and she commits to a fugitive network. One visible trade-off dilutes high-band entry: the anchoring releases too easily once the lesson concludes, softening the price paid for transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—longing transmuted into light rather than surrendered—emerges from the particulars: the city sealing archives, nostalgia condensed into contraband minerals, the tattoo's permanence. The final image (Mira wrapping her arm, planning to visit other gardens, bodies inscribed with star-measures) answers the central question without stating a moral. The keeper's line "exile is safest when chosen" and Mira's realization that "the ban had not destroyed nostalgia; it had condensed it" resonate without overt philosophizing. One slip: "longing could be transmuted into light rather than surrendered" inches toward thematic echo in the antepenultimate paragraph, though it remains integrated within her act of writing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Mira's perceptual signature—tide-dancer idiom, reading gaps, feeling currents—controlling diction and focus. The keeper's mist-voice ("wet stone") and dialogue ("Exile is safest when chosen") feel distinct. Under peak stress (panic, then seated dance), syntax tightens without losing texture: "At first panic flared, then her dancer sense noticed that the anchoring had a rhythm." One recurring pattern: several mid-pressure beats open with "She [verb]" constructions (She sat, She tried, She realized, She rose), creating minor template cadence that doesn't obscure but lacks full rhythmic variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, interiority, or image. Figurative language (moonstone "like a trapped tide," obsidian grace, constellations as line breaks) remains coherent and purpose-driven. No paraphrase loops. One text-artifact cluster in the middle third: "Mira showed her palm… She realized the ban had not destroyed nostalgia… The keeper offered a bargain… Mira thought of wardens…" cycles through summary-adjacent exposition rather than embodied action, losing momentum briefly. The closure paragraph regains propulsion and the final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—memory-ban × exile × tattoo-as-verse × moonstone-as-compressed-nostalgia—feels specific and internally consistent. The garden's anchoring as pedagogy and the notion of a fugitive network inscribed with star-measures offer fresh angles on censorship-and-resistance material. The tide-dancer lens and "observing gaps" method add texture. However, the "authoritarian regime banning memory/art" premise and the "exile who preserves forbidden knowledge on the body" arc follow well-worn templates; transformation is partial. The risk (anchoring, literal ink from contraband mineral) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting mid-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's tide-dancer skill is signaled early (salt docks, reading currents with ankles) and reappears when she dances seated under anchoring, her shoulders and wrists tracing crescents. The method constrains her response to the garden's rhythm and enables the tattooing by steadying her hands. The skill also frames her final action—dancing once more as "tide dancer and poet." Present in setup, middle choice (seated dance), and closure image, with causal pressure shaping her adaptation to anchoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonstone speck is introduced early (fell from a smuggler's jewel, "glittered like a trapped tide"), pressed into her palm where it warms and triggers the anchoring, dissolves into the ink mixture turning it silver and cold, and its pulsing projects forbidden images. It participates in three distinct beats: arrival/warming, the keeper's diagnosis ("city shard that binds you to its grief"), and the tattoo itself. The speck's properties (warmth, projection, dissolution) are irreplaceable and the anchoring would not occur without it. Closure linkage is indirect—tattoo exists because of the speck—but the final image does not foreground it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elective exile frames the entire premise: Mira "chose elective exile rather than let wardens edit her mind," walks out the west gate, and the closing beats extend exile into a "network, not of rebels with flags, but of bodies inscribed." The concept shapes her dominant stake (preserving memory outside state control) and the final choice to visit other banned gardens. Present in setup, middle (keeper's line "Exile is safest when chosen"), and closure where it reweights as collective rather than solitary. Causal but somewhat broad; the story would largely hold if reframed as internal exile or fugitive status.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" is introduced at the story's center when the moonstone warms and Mira becomes "anchored to the bench as if to an unseen mooring." The trait constrains her immediately—she cannot stand, panic flares—and forces adaptation: seated dance that traces crescents while legs stay pinned. The anchoring shifts from restraint to fulcrum, steadying her hands for the tattoo. It is resolved when the keeper touches the bench and gravity slackens, enabling her to rise and fledge. Present in two beats (anchoring onset, release) with visible cost and tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fledge" appears near the end when Mira watches the heron wobble and "understood her own next action: fledge, not back toward the city, but onward." The action crystallizes her choice to move beyond static exile into network-building, charging the closure image. It redefines options but arrives late (~85% through) and is articulated as metaphor rather than physical act. The metaphor is earned by the heron image and the earlier anchoring/release sequence, but swapping "fledge" for "depart" or "venture onward" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled early: "she needed a different method, by observing gaps. Between constellations, between the fountain drops, between her own breaths." The method reappears when the keeper guides her attention "to the spaces between stars" and again in the penultimate paragraph: "By observing gaps in patrol schedules and in people's guarded speech." It shapes her tattoo's design (gaps as syllables) and her future tactics. Present in setup, middle (closure of tattoo scene), and final network plan, with specificity that matters to execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden is anchored early ("old twilight garden under stars, a place the ban did not reach because it held no names") and pressures every major choice: blackleaf hedges and brine-language fountains provide the language she reads, the garden keeper emerges from the water to offer the bargain, the dew-wet path tests her first step after release, and the garden "kept time behind her" in the final image. The setting enables the tattoo (fountain brine as ink), constrains movement (anchoring), and participates in closure. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban" frames the inciting pressure (city sealed archives, wardens edit minds, elective exile) and justifies the condensed-mineral conceit and Mira's commitment to inscribed verse. The timeframe is present in setup and ending (planning to visit other banned gardens, offering verses others can wear), shaping stakes throughout. However, it functions more as premise-context than a live clock; no ticking deadline or time-constrained tactic appears. Functional across beats but does not tighten decisions in scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, so no censor could erase it without drawing blood"—is stated early and dramatized in the tattoo sequence: she pricks her forearm in a spiral, mixes ink with brine and moonstone dust, writes motions rather than names. The vow shapes her choice to keep the speck despite anchoring and reappears in the final plan to offer verses to others. Cost is visible (body becomes page, future narrowed to fugitive network). Present in setup, middle action, and closure plan with friction between permanence and exile's isolation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears explicitly once—"Night deepened, obsidian grace settling over leaves"—and implicitly colors diction throughout: "blackleaf spirals," "silver and slightly cold" ink, the keeper's "wet stone" voice, the measured pacing. Tone remains coherent through turns, modulating from initial resolve to panic to seated dance to quiet determination. The phrase reweights the closure image slightly (darkness as protective rather than oppressive) but is not load-bearing; removing "obsidian grace" would leave tone intact. Lyric reprise is modest.</comment>
