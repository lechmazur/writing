<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—her empirical yet intuitive nature shapes her choice at the fork, weighed "like paper in her hands." The final climb is motivated by prior pattern (following ants, trusting experiments) and forecloses the dry passage with visible cost. Ellis's backstory exposition feels slightly inert, but Mara's contradictory pull (anger versus loneliness) acts simultaneously in the cavern scene, and her renunciation of the chip/promise is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal-Situational hybrid; the coordinates→cavern→fork sequence narrows options cleanly, and the rising creek compounds pressure. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change (wet passage chosen, trail erased) with visible cost (inheritance refused, isolation accepted). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, shop, morning). Ellis's expository turn ("every choice is typeset") slows momentum slightly, but the final climb reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sinkhole, cavern bloom, rising pools, and ants function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mara kneels unsure until the ant-line reveals the entrance, and water climbing through ceiling holes forces the fork. The creek-road silt, ferns, wet-iron smell, and compositor's-grid slab charge the final image. Minor: the shop's cedar-and-dust opening does not return, limiting closure linkage for that anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the doorway and choose a future. One meaningful tightening: the rising creek narrows the window, and Ellis's fork (dry/wet) crystallizes the trade-off between inheritance-plus-debt versus clean escape. The wet-passage choice forecloses the dry path with visible cost (Ellis, the presswork, the note surrendered). Coincidence (printer's delivery) complicates but does not resolve; Mara's agency drives the climb.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the doorway is not stone but the moment of stepping through, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The chip, note, and ants recur with shifted meaning; the final image (ants still marching, unafraid) offers a non-literal answer to chosen versus inherited paths. Ellis's "every choice is typeset, but the form can still be changed" risks Thematic Echo but is immediately undercut by Mara's refusal, limiting the slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (empirically intuitive, trusting measurements and small patterns) is specific and consistent. Diction stays controlled—"contours," "futures like paper"—without register drift. Ellis's dialogue ("every choice is typeset") feels slightly expository, and the final narrator claim ("understood the doorway…was the moment she stepped through") edges toward over-articulation, but the prior embodied climb earns it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no scaffold loops. Information density is high (chip glimmers→coordinates→cavern in compressed sequence). Minor figurative density: "like continents," "like lilies," "like paper" cluster without becoming muddy. The phrase "as if listening" (blooms folding) and "unafraid" (ants) trend slightly generic, but clarity and propulsion hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The matrix-chip-as-map twist is fresh, and the ant-following method transforms a childish impulse into experimental proof. The compositor's-grid slab and "typeset choice" conceit risk derivative metaphor (printing-as-destiny is familiar), but Mara's refusal of the inheritance and the wet-passage/erasure reversal feel earned rather than clever-for-clever. Tone and world cohere; no template echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from line one; her empirical-intuitive trait shapes the coordinate decoding, ant-following, and final fork decision. The lonely detail ("listening to customers leave with routes they never needed") seeds the ending choice to go alone. She drives all three beats (shop→ridge→cavern) and the closure turn (wet passage, trail erased).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (tin box morning); used in three beats: loupe study (coordinates discovered), recess match (panel opens), and implicitly left behind when Mara climbs wet (she presses the note, not the chip, to Ellis). The glimmer enables the quest and the slab unlocks Ellis, making it indispensable to structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The note's promise frames the quest from the tin-box beat and returns at closure when Mara tells Ellis "the promise had brought her here, not to keep her." It shapes the dominant stake (find the doorway) and her refusal of Ellis's inheritance reweights the promise into a catalyst rather than a bond. Causal across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("empirically intuitive, trusting measurements but also the small patterns that repeated") and enacted twice: comparing chip marks to catalog pages (measurement) and following the ant-line (pattern). The trait enables the coordinate solve and the entrance discovery, though the final fork choice is less explicitly tied to this duality—she weighs futures but does not frame the decision as empirical versus intuitive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The silver crescent glimmers twice: under lamplight (coordinates revealed) and in the cavern recess (panel opens). Both beats are pivotal—without the first, no quest; without the second, no Ellis. The glimmer is specific (crescent shape, lamplight trigger) and irreplaceable; a generic shine would not carry the same charged recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present in one extended middle beat: Mara notices the ant-line, clears soil, follows them into the tunnel. The method feels "childish, yet…an experiment," aligning with her empirical-intuitive trait. It solves the entrance problem and seeds the final image (ants still marching), but does not constrain the fork choice itself—she could have found the cavern another way with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern's blooming fungi, sun shafts, trembling pools, and ceiling holes supply the rising-water pressure that forces the fork. The setting's midsummer bloom contrasts the crisis and charges the final climb ("blooms folded as if listening"). The compositor's-grid slab integrates the chip and enables the Ellis reveal. Environment shapes every closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Creek rises across three beats: swollen watershed at dawn, debris lines by noon, water pattering through cavern holes at the fork. The timeframe tightens the window, makes the wet-passage decision urgent (water licking her calves as she climbs), and ensures the trail erases behind her. The clock is live, tracked, and alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to find the doorway drives the quest from the note's discovery through the ridge hike. Conflict emerges when Ellis offers the dry path (inheritance + debt) versus wet (daylight, erasure). The motivation is dramatized in the choice—she presses the note back, choosing clean over inherited—but the lonely/anger friction could have been sharpened earlier to deepen the want-versus-fear calculus.</comment>
