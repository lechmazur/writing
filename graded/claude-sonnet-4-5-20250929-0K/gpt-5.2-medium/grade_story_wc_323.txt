<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical handling of the chain link and her request for surface ascent. Her "balanced curiosity" manifests in concrete micro-choices—comparing the probe's lattice, teaching edge geometry—though the trait itself leans toward label. The mourning divers and council tension create pressure, but secondary characters (Jae, guards, students) remain functional supports without autonomous stakes. Internal contradiction is minimal; Mara's arc follows a steady discovery path with only modest friction between curiosity and communal grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Mara decodes the probe → develops edge geometry → tests it on the surface → rewrites curriculum. Orientation anchors (benthic city, post-discovery year, navigation instructor) land early. The closure—Mara rewriting curriculum to prepare children for "unfolded horizons"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (world opened, responsibility accepted) with felt cost ("grief and wonder braided together"). One minor gap: the council's shift from "uneasy but desperate" to granting ascent lacks on-page negotiation, relying on summary permission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The benthic city is vividly realized—basalt towers, biolamps, silt storms, pressure doors—and its constraints (sonar navigation, quarantine bay, elevator pod through kilometers of dark water) actively shape Mara's tactics. The chain link functions as micro-setting object, its curve and angles constraining her method and charging the final act when she holds it against the stars. Spatial choreography (classroom dome, quarantine bay, surface) remains coherent across transitions. The surface moment—"horizon that did not curve away into black"—delivers charged specificity that reconfigures prior subterranean enclosure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning starlight navigation before the next alien signal—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's request for ascent. The surface test constitutes a meaningful escalation: she fixes position without a beacon, foreclosing reliance on sonar. Cost is visible ("grief and wonder braided together," the risk of one tide window) but remains modest in consequence; the council grants permission readily, and no live option is permanently lost. The piece deepens understanding more than it narrows choices, fitting an accumulative-textural mode with a single decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chain link's recurring presence: a single connection expanding into coordinate nets, edges readable when "nothing else held steady," directions multiplying into "responsibility." The "unfolded horizons" concept avoids abstraction by anchoring in Mara's physical sight-work (aligning metal edge with sea-sky line, marking stars). The ending—"every edge can be read and every direction can expand into responsibility"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The aliens' absence of threat (starfields, not weapons) reweights first contact from menace to pedagogical gift, charged by the mourned divers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Mara's navigation expertise ("sonar echoes that died in silt storms," "chord on the wall," "radii"). Diction is controlled and specific ("basalt," "lattice of light," "petal arcs"), though occasional elevation ("balancedly curious," "foreclosing a path") nudges above natural register for crisis thought. No dialogue appears; Jae remains silent on the surface, a missed opportunity for voice distinction. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for the classroom demonstration and accelerating through the ascent. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices angles, curves, and geometric relationships.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, stakes, or method. Minor template cadence appears in the opening third: "was the year," "was balancedly curious," "was humble and fierce" cluster filter constructions without clear voice motivation. The phrase "hunting for matching radii" and "stitched into arcs that unfolded and overlapped like petals" show strong figurative control. One paraphrase loop: "expand a plain circle into a coordinate net" closely echoes "cartographer might expand a globe into a flat chart without tearing it" within two sentences. Propulsion is steady, though the summary of Jae's role and the council's decision compresses pivotal negotiation into transit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater city + alien first contact + practical navigation pedagogy feels specific and non-obvious. "Edge geometry" as method—reading angles off a rusted chain link to decode alien starfield lattices—demonstrates ingenuity rooted in character expertise rather than convenient invention. The mourning divers and council quarantine add stakes beyond discovery plot. Risk: the benthic setting and post-contact frame lean on familiar SFF templates (enclosed humanity, enigmatic probe), but Mara's pedagogical motive and the chain link's physical centrality transform stock elements into grounded choice. The "unfolded horizons" coinage borders on prompt-echo but earns its keep through repeated geometric application.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (navigation instructor) drives all key beats: develops edge geometry, compares probe lattice, requests ascent, tests method on surface, rewrites curriculum. Her role is not merely observational; each decision narrows options (one tide window, one companion) and alters tactics (replacing sonar with starlight). The closure—rewriting curriculum—directly enacts her professional identity with visible cost (responsibility for "our children"). Setup early, causally active across middle demonstrations, and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The boat anchor chain link appears in four distinct beats: classroom demonstration (shining lamp, measuring chord), quarantine comparison (matching radii to probe), surface ascent (aligning inner edge with horizon, marking stars), and implicit presence in the closing decision to teach edge geometry. Its physical properties (rusted, curved, with measurable angles) enable the method and charge the final realization. Removing the chain link would break the story's central mechanism; no generic measuring tool could replace its symbolic and practical integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" names Mara's concept early and structures the aliens' navigation method (edges sliding against "the true line of night," petals that overlap). It shapes stakes (learning to navigate by this principle before the next signal) and constrains her test (expanding measurements into petal arcs). The phrase recurs at closure ("prepare our children for unfolded horizons"), reweighting the opening's single mention with pedagogical responsibility. However, the concept remains partly thematic label; its mechanics (how edges "unfold" vs. simply expand) are asserted more than dramatized through choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is introduced as a trait label in the opening and manifests once in Mara's restraint ("never the kind to pry at a wound") versus her persistent questioning. It does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost; Mara's curiosity drives her forward without evident tradeoff or friction. The guards' silent observation gestures toward communal tension ("even curiosity felt like disrespect"), but Mara proceeds without dramatized resistance or sacrifice tied to this specific balance. Present and somewhat functional, but closer to character sketch than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Expand" anchors the method: Mara expands a plain circle into coordinate net, expands measurements into petal arcs, and the aliens "expand the horizon itself." The classroom demonstration (chord on wall → coordinate net) and the surface test (sight → alien arcs) both hinge on this action. The curriculum rewrite extends expansion into future responsibility. The action is mechanically specific and causally central, though "expand" as verb is common enough that moderate synonym replacement (e.g., "project," "extrapolate") might survive minor edits. Still, its recurrence charges the conceptual frame and drives the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is named early, demonstrated in the classroom (lamp across chain link, measuring chord against dome curve), applied at the quarantine bay (comparing link curve to probe lattice), and enacted on the surface (aligning link's inner edge with horizon, marking stars). The method's mechanics matter: angles readable when "nothing else held steady," edges that slide and turn into position. Removing edge geometry would collapse the story's causal spine; Mara's success depends on this exact technique. Setup, development across two teaching/testing beats, and payoff in the surface ascent all present with cost (one tide window, visible risk).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The benthic city supplies concrete constraints: no starlight (sonar navigation), pressure doors sealing the probe, kilometers of dark water to traverse, and "silt storms" that kill sonar echoes. These details pressure Mara's motive and make the surface ascent stakes legible (one tide window, rare access). The elevator pod and quarantine bay serve as functional stages. The city's mourning tone (lost divers, dim halls) colors Mara's careful approach but does not directly alter a tactical choice. Setting shapes why the problem exists and what the test costs, landing solidly in the essential range without becoming indispensable to micro-tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"The year after we discovered aliens" frames urgency (next signal expected, council "desperate to understand") and justifies the quarantine bay's existence. The "single tide window" tightens the surface test into a one-shot constraint. However, the timeframe remains broad; no live countdown or escalating deadline alters Mara's choices beat-to-beat. The piece uses aftermath rather than ticking clock, so time supplies context and stakes but does not narrow tactics within scenes. Present in setup, relevant to escalation, and implicit at closure (curriculum for future arrivals), but not a driving pressure within the action window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to learn to navigate by starlight" is dramatized across all major beats: she develops edge geometry to replace sonar, decodes the probe to find the aliens' star-navigation method, requests the surface ascent to test it, and succeeds in fixing position without a beacon. The motive is conflicted with visible cost—"grief and wonder braided together," the communal mourning that makes curiosity "feel like disrespect," and the final acceptance of responsibility for teaching the next generation. Setup early, tested through middle choices (comparing lattice, requesting ascent), and resolved at closure with the curriculum rewrite. The friction between individual learning and communal trauma adds depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" coheres throughout: mourning the lost divers, the probe sitting "like a broken pearl," guards watching "in silence," yet wonder at biolamps "like deep stars," the aliens' non-threatening starfields, and the surface moment where "stars were painfully bright." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet in the quarantine bay, breathless at the surface, reflective in the closing decision—without breaking into incongruent registers. The closing phrase "grief and wonder braided together" explicitly names the tonal duality and charges the final image. Tone supports the conceptual frame and deepens the ending without static repetition.</comment>
