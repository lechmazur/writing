<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature—reality gripped loosely, time folding—is vivid and embodied through concrete micro-choices (the bone tip as probe, hand rising "before I decided"). Internal contradiction shows in the ridiculous study of endings pursued through disaster work, and Signe's presence forces a micro-turn where the narrator's stance shifts from chasing "loud finales" to recognizing weather-like approach. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (stopping the chase), though the interiority occasionally drifts into lyric register that abstracts the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator stops chasing endings, taught by Signe's counsel and the storm sequence, with visible cost (foreclosing the tourist pursuit). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through storm, parasol tip, ice-sound motif—and holds through the final image where "endings approach like weather" reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~150 words and remain stable. One meaningful deepening (storm rescue crystallizes the learning) is sufficient at this length; the cost is legible in the parting instruction and narrator's acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains choices (pontoon crawl, net-cutting) and charges the final image (ice pops as interval). The bone parasol tip functions as micro-setting, a recurring tool that shapes action (tapping ice, cutting net) and carries symbolic weight without becoming ornamental. Sensory detail—metal taste, wind tireless, ice needles—is filtered through the narrator's sensitivity to endings and modulates with pressure (calm sorting vs. storm chaos). Spatial choreography (pontoons, boathouse, sled departure) tracks cleanly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings—is signaled early and tightens through the storm rescue (bone tip finds the knot, engine coughs "like a patient deciding to stay alive") and Signe's challenge to "stop chasing loud finales." Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: the narrator's hand rises to escort Signe, then accepts her parting instruction, foreclosing the euthanasia-tourist pursuit. One meaningful tightening (storm forces embodied choice) and the final trade-off (stop chasing vs. let them pass) are sufficient at this length. Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—bone tip, ice resonance, Signe's breath metaphor—without thesis statement. The final image ("endings approach like weather: you trawl for signs, then let them pass") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question, reweighting the parasol tip and fold-in-patience motif with earned cost. Signe's wisdom is earned through concrete experience (smoke, storm, ice pops) rather than platitude, and the narrator's arc (from chasing to listening) is inextricable from the thematic question. No moralizing; the ending invites reflection through image and renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "my thoughts slid away as if my skull had lost its latch," "patience had a fold in it now." Diction remains consistent with the narrator's sensitivity (lyric but grounded), though occasional elevated register ("deliberate goodbyes," "borrowed tool") tests the upper edge of the voice under pressure. Signe's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot by reframing the narrator's pursuit. No head-hopping; focalization is stable. The final paragraph's compression ("windborne solace," "fold of my patience") is purposeful and taught by prior imagery, though it approaches the threshold of lyric density for this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs except one brief cluster ("The tip was..."; "Each tap taught..."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure—but two minor paraphrase moments ("endings announce themselves softly" near "rehearsing its last note") and one filter-verb stack ("heard under their voices the same tremor I heard") slightly dull immediacy. The metaphor "lungs were closing like wet paper" is vivid; "trawl for signs" pays off the debris-trawling action. No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language is dense but coherent; the final image ("endings approach like weather") lands clearly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism + disaster relief + heirloom tool—feels specific and non-obvious, grounded in the narrator's fold-in-patience and embodied through ice-tapping and storm rescue. The parasol tip transforms a familiar mourning object into an active probe, and the closure (stop chasing loud finales) grows organically from prior particulars rather than a late twist. The frame avoids the safety middle: the narrator's sensitivity is a genuine liability (grips reality loosely) without hedged redemption. The storm rescue and Signe's challenge offer fresh inflections on the learning-to-let-go arc, elevated by micro-setting and tool specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist role frames the opening and motivates the escort choice (hand rises), shaping two key turns: arriving at the marina and accepting Signe's parting instruction. Present by end of first third, constrains the middle choice (escorting Signe), and participates in closure (stops chasing). However, the role is more observational frame than active decision driver; the storm rescue and bone-tip use carry more causal weight. Eligible for mid-6s: two gates plus one causal beat, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parasol tip is handled in three distinct beats: tapping ice edges, cutting the net (clenched between teeth, finds knot by feel), and witnessed by Signe who asks about it. Early signal (first third), drives two action beats under pressure, and its origin story ("the last thing she did was hand me its handle as smoke thickened") charges Signe's breath metaphor and the final weather lesson. Irreplaceable: the bone point's tactile coolness and probing function align with the narrator's sensitivity to endings. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fold in patience is introduced early ("my patience had a fold in it now, a crease where time caught and doubled back") and shapes on-page perception: a day feels like a minute, a minute like a year. It enables the narrator's hyper-attentiveness to endings (hearing tremor in voices, ice resonance) and constrains normal momentum—every word treated "like a borrowed tool." Returns in the final line ("into the fold of my patience") where it absorbs Signe's teaching, reweighting the concept with cost. Setup, middle enabling, and closure reprise all present; causal pressure moderate (shapes perception more than action).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is present from the opening ("slid away as if my skull had lost its latch") and enables the narrator's sensitivity to "where things end," motivating the tourist pursuit and ice-tapping method. It constrains normal clarity—the fold in time, hearing under voices—but does not drive a decisive turn with visible cost on the page. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is oblique (the loose grip persists but is not visibly reweighted). Functional but replaceable with "heightened sensitivity" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Trawling appears in two distinct beats: shoreline debris work (hauling nets, splintered timber) and the storm rescue (crawling out to cut a net from the propeller). The action frames the narrator's method of learning (trawl for signs) and pays off in the final image ("you trawl for signs, then let them pass"). Early signal, causal pressure in the storm beat (net-cutting enables the skiff's survival), and closure linkage. Specific mechanics (debris nets vs. mooring net) matter and could not be swapped without losing the metaphor's weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early (coordinator in Reykjavik, signed on, supply cutter north) and enables the narrator's presence at the marina, where the storm and Signe encounter occur. The method matters: the work (sorting salvage, trawling debris) provides the narrator with the parasol tip's use-case and positions them to escort Signe. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is structural (the volunteer role makes the ending possible) but not foregrounded in the final image. Essential to logistics but not irreplaceable in concept—another transient role could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is signaled early (first third), pressures multiple choices (pontoon stability during the storm, net-cutting access, ice-edge tapping), and charges the final image (ice pops as Signe's interval, harbor settling). The floating pontoons and mooring lines create the storm stakes; the ice sheets provide the resonance metaphor that threads through to closure. Spatial details (boathouse shelter, sled departure across the fjord) are handled on the page and their mechanics affect tactics. Indispensable: the setting's unique properties (drift ice, makeshift harbor) drive both metaphor and action. Causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and irreplaceability all demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after I woke up changed" is present in the opening line and frames all subsequent events as post-transformation, but the exact moment is not dramatized and does not tighten on-page decisions. The fold in time (a day like a minute, a minute like a year) alters perception but does not create a live clock that narrows options in the storm or Signe escort. Setup present; middle and closure participation are thematic (the changed state persists) rather than causal. Functional frame but replaceable with "after the event" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to learn the sound of approaching endings is signaled early (opening paragraph), drives the narrator's choices (signing on for relief work, hand rising to escort Signe, tapping ice with the parasol tip), and is directly challenged and reweighted at closure (Signe's instruction to stop chasing loud finales, narrator accepts). Friction between the want (to learn) and the cost (chasing distances the narrator from others, treats words as borrowed tools) is visible on the page. Setup, middle involvement (escort choice), and closure transformation all present. Irreplaceable: the motivation shapes both metaphor system and final renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Windborne solace is introduced early ("Wind moved constantly there, not hostile, just tireless, and it carried a solace that made my ribs expand") and modulates with pressure: calm sorting contrasts with storm chaos (wind flinging ice needles), then returns in the final beat ("the wind carried her parting words into the fold of my patience"). The tone is coherent through turns and charges the ending image, though the single adjective "solace" recurs without evolving. Setup, atmospheric consistency, and closure linkage present; the tone supports but does not independently drive a turn. Strong reprise that reweights the opening mood with cost.</comment>
