<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kestrel's habit of borrowing personalities is established early and drives the central conflict, creating vivid internal contradiction ("borrowed selves crowded, arguing in different tenses"). The final choice to pour borrowed personalities into the paper and return to her own center is earned through prior accumulation. However, the interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("empathy was not a gift but a transformation") that reads more thematic than embodied, and the stranger's emotions swapping lacks specific physical grounding in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern-teaching: eachprint job deepens Kestrel's understanding of the transposed-empathy mechanism until the final blank broadside resolves her fragmentation. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (pouring out borrowed selves, returning to center) and the equation framework holds throughout. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, cosmic instability). One friction: the Council auditors subplot introduces a secondary pressure that diffuses focus slightly before the final turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under vanishing stars creates a coherent micro-setting where starlight quality affects her work and the cosmic instability mirrors her internal fragmentation. The halo fragment's physical properties (hummed, honey-gold sheen, edges filed to fit the forme) constrain her process and charge the final image. The recurring star-vanishing motif tracks through the narrative and tightens at "the darkest interval" when she prints the blank sheet, then releases as stars reappear—environment and internal state interweave without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Kestrel's coherence threatened by borrowed personalities) is signaled early and escalates through each print job: first the stranger's fear swap, then the auditors' mass disorientation, finally her own crisis at "the darkest interval." The equation E(x,y)=S(x)−S(y) provides a conceptual constraint that shapes tactics. The final act—printing the blank sheet, pouring out borrowed selves—is protagonist-driven with visible cost (loss of all borrowed voices to recover her own). One meaningful tightening occurs when "every transfer cost her a little coherence," making the price unmistakable before the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of transposed empathy as arithmetic rather than mysticism, building through the equation, the typesetting metaphor, and Kestrel's incremental realization. The blank broadside ending avoids moralizing: townspeople's sorrows "aligned, as if someone had solved for them" while Kestrel writes "new symbols for gratitude, regret, and love...as ratios." The story resists tidy resolution—she understands empathy as transformation, not gift, but the cost of that understanding (fragmentation, then recovery) remains ambiguous and resonant. The halo fragment and equation motifs charge the closure without becoming allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice sustains a distinct lyric-fabulist register with purposeful compression ("between the vanishing stars, when the sky forgot whole constellations") and maintains psychic distance throughout. Kestrel's perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-tuned (borrowed personalities "like misregistered prints," the workshop "like a stone in deep water"). The stranger's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; the brief exchange ("asking for a broadside...deliberate ambiguity") advances plot without exposition. One slip: "lucid turbulence" appears as a phrase-object rather than enacted rhythm in the fear-swap beat, slightly undercutting the claimed tonal effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences doing double work (the equation wrapper both describes and prefigures mechanism). Rhythm modulates effectively from compressed opening ("between the vanishing stars") to the slowed final ledger image. Two frictions lower the score: near-synonym loops appear in the middle section ("disorient...disoriented...disorienting" across three sentences; "borrowed personalities" recurs without reweighting), and the phrase "transposed empathy" itself feels like a prompt-label rather than discovered language. The closure beat remains clean, so the accumulation cap holds deductions to −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, transposed-empathy mathematics, and fragmented identity offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The equation E(x,y)=S(x)−S(y) grounds emotional exchange in tangible process rather than mysticism, and the halo fragment as "vector" that "rotates feeling" transforms familiar empathy tropes through the typesetting lens. The blank broadside resolution—emotion as ratio, empathy as transformation—feels earned in hindsight. One hedge: the vanishing-stars frame, while atmospheric, edges toward ornamental backdrop rather than causal driver until the final interval.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kestrel's role as cryptic letterpress operator is established immediately, shapes every major beat (setting type, printing proofs, locking the fragment into the forme, pulling the final blank sheet), and her specific craft knowledge (chase, sort, vellum, forme) alters tactics throughout. The occupation is indispensable to the closure: without letterpress mechanics, the transposed-empathy mechanism collapses. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (courier delivery), is handled and modified on-page (filed, locked into forme, inked black), and its unique properties (hummed, remembered prayers, vector function) enable the empathy-swap mechanism. It drives at least three beats: the initial discovery, the stranger's proof, and the final blank printing. The fragment is causally active at closure and irreplaceable—no generic object could function as "a key that could rotate feeling." Earns high score for beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is introduced via the equation wrapper, demonstrated in the stranger's fear-swap scene, scaled up with the Council auditors, and articulated at closure ("empathy was not a gift but a transformation"). The concept shapes Kestrel's tactics (how she prints, what she learns from each proof) and drives the resolution (pouring borrowed selves into paper to recover coherence). It constrains choices throughout and is integral to the final image of writing emotions "as ratios." Strong across all three gates with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kestrel's habit of borrowing personalities is established in paragraph two, creates the central problem (crowded selves, misregistered thoughts), and is paid off when she "pour[s] every borrowed personality into the paper while her own returned." The trait constrains her emotional state and enables her empathy-transfer work. However, the mechanism by which she borrows (catching a voice, wearing it) remains somewhat abstract; we don't see the borrowing choice in a single beat with visible trade-off, only its accumulated cost. Functional across gates but mid-band for specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Disorient is the explicit goal ("broadside that would disorient the Council auditors"), the method Kestrel employs (headlines that mean Welcome or Warning depending on eye-start, riddles with multiple meanings), and the cost she pays ("every transfer...disoriented herself"). The action drives the auditors subplot, shapes her printing tactics, and accumulates as a problem that the blank broadside must solve. Present across beats and essential to escalation; removing it would collapse the Council pressure and the mechanics of her craft. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is introduced early (stranger requests it), enacted on-page ("headline that could mean either Welcome or Warning depending on where the eye began"), and becomes the repeated method (riddles that let readers choose meaning, posters that make auditors argue over interpretations). It shapes tactics throughout and charges the final blank broadside, which holds "deliberate ambiguity of arcs" that allows townspeople's sorrows to align. The method is indispensable to both the craft mechanics and the thematic resolution. Strong across all three gates with high causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored immediately and recurs (topaz dust turns the fragment honey-gold, the workshop "felt like a stone in deep water" at the darkest interval, the press cooling at the end). The setting provides atmospheric constraint and mirrors Kestrel's internal state, but does not supply a resource or physical obstacle that alters a tactical choice on-page. The stars vanishing and reappearing track with her crisis, but the workshop itself remains more backdrop than active pressure. Functional across gates with lyric reprise but mid-band for causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "between the vanishing stars" is established in the opening line, recurs at key beats ("north star blinked out for the first time," "night after night," "the darkest interval"), and tightens to crisis when "almost all stars vanished" before resolving as "stars began to reappear." The cosmic clock adds urgency and mirrors escalation, though it does not create a live on-page deadline that forces a specific choice within a window. The frame charges atmosphere and paces the accumulation but remains more metaphorical timer than tactical constraint. Present across gates with strong thematic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kestrel's desire to understand emotion's mathematics is dramatized through her incremental realization ("she saw the equation...as more than decoration," "if she could measure each inked line as weight...then perhaps emotion had arithmetic"), shapes her experiments ("night after night...she experimented"), and pays off in the ledger notation of "new symbols for gratitude, regret, and love...as ratios." The motivation drives the escalation and is integral to the closure insight. One friction: the want itself is never tested against a conflicting cost or fear on-page; we see its pursuit and fulfillment but not a moment where pursuing it costs her something she values. Strong thematic presence but mid-high for friction between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lucid turbulence is enacted in the fear-swap scene ("both of them staggered, laughing at the wrong moment") and modulates with pressure: compressed lyricism in crisis ("workshop felt like a stone in deep water"), rhythmic calm at resolution ("listened to the press cooling"). The phrase itself appears once on-page, anchoring the stranger's experience. Tone remains coherent through turns and charges the final image of quiet, methodical notation after emotional storm. However, "lucid" and "turbulence" occasionally work against each other in the prose—some beats feel overly controlled for turbulence, others too abstract for lucidity. Functional with minor tonal drift under peak pressure.</comment>
