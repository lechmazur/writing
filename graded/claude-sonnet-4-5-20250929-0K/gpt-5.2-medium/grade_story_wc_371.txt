<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—keeping the hardened loaf, tracking incremental erasures, signing the complaint that she later regrets. Her internal contradiction (helpless witness vs. complicit participant) drives the arc toward kneeling in dirt to plant wheat. The confession scene avoids therapy-speak and lands with genuine cost. Sada's "heuristically gentle" voice remains consistent but slightly abstract in early beats; minor register drift when she articulates theme ("altars everywhere...we spend our lives choosing") nudges the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Mina, post-bird-migration city, walking to work). The story accumulates pressure through small erasures (bakery bricked over, missing statue, patrols with new badges) and tightens when Mina plants wheat in the fountain—a reversal from passive witness to active participant. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the sprout through mortar reweights the premise (individual acts of memory resist state erasure) with conceptual and social cost legible on the page. One micro turn (tea house invitation) feeds the final beat without fragmenting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard constrains action (lantern light among fig trees, planters hidden behind marble, fountain bowl) and charges the closure image. The bricked bakery and the sprout through mortar form a purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the dominant stake. Sensory selection is filtered through Mina's noticing: "the faintest sweetness," "lantern light trembling," "water that no longer ran smelled clean anyway." Minor dip: the transition from Alder Row to palace courtyard could anchor spatial distance more concretely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resist incremental erasure of memory and community. Pressure tightens when Mina confesses her complicity (signing the complaint), which forecloses the path of passive observation with visible emotional cost. The tea house invitation and guerrilla gardening method escalate from solitary preservation (keeping the loaf) to collective micro-resistance. Sada's offer of "tenuous absolution" and the act of planting wheat constitute agency with consequence. One clear tightening and one deepening choice suffice at this length; the sprout through mortar at the end confirms the stakes remain live.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hard loaf as "proof that memory could be edible," wheat seeds as "small green arguments against forgetting," the sprout through mortar as embodied resistance. The confession scene avoids moralizing; Sada's "tenuous absolution, not a clean pardon" rejects false resolution. The final image (Mina bows to the sprout) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. Minor deduction: "altars everywhere...we spend our lives choosing what to uncloak" drifts toward thematic statement, though it remains character-voiced and embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mina; psychic distance tightens during the confession and planting beats. Perceptual signature is consistent: "creeping normality noticer" guides selective attention (streetlights shifted, patrols gained new badges). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You see what changes by inches...that makes you useful here"). Minor slip: "heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work" reads as authorial diagnosis rather than Mina's perception. Diction stays within Mina's register except for one line ("altars...uncloak") where the vocabulary elevates without clear internal anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully ("She was a creeping normality noticer" vs. the shorter beats during planting). Opening and closing images charge each other (bricked bakery / sprout through mortar). Minor deductions: "heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work" is a scaffold phrase that tells rather than shows; "small green arguments against forgetting" borders on purple without undermining clarity. One paraphrase loop ("the ordinary was edited away" / "one more erasure") in early paragraphs. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of authoritarian creep + guerrilla gardening + edible memory (the hardened loaf) feels specific and non-obvious. The sprout through bricked mortar avoids the obvious statue-unveiling or bakery-reopening conclusion. Sada's "tenuous absolution" complicates the easy forgiveness arc. Minor familiarity: the "secret resistance meeting in a decayed public space" and "complicit bystander seeks redemption" are recognizable templates; the story transforms them through the loaf and wheat motifs, but the synthesis does not reach the high-risk or irreplaceable threshold of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina's role as "creeping normality noticer" is signaled early, shapes multiple beats (tracking erasures, keeping the loaf, confessing the complaint), and drives the key turn (planting wheat). The trait enables her recruitment by Sada and constrains the final choice (she bows to the sprout because noticing is her method). Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bread appears in three distinct beats: Mina keeps it as proof, unwraps it at the tea house (silence, then Sada breaks off a piece), and Sada dips it in tea as "tenuous absolution." Its hardness and faint sweetness are handled concretely. The loaf charges the confession scene and the transition to planting. High irreplaceability: removing the bread would collapse the tangible link between memory, complicity, and repair.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is spoken by Sada and directly shapes the planting action: "not a clean pardon, but a chance to repair what your hands can reach tonight." The concept constrains tactics (no grand forgiveness, only incremental repair) and charges the final image (bowing to the sprout is an act of tenuous repair). Present in middle and closure with visible cost. Slightly abstract as a phrase, but dramatized through the bread-dipping and wheat-planting sequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is attributed to Sada early ("her voice heuristically gentle, always testing what kindness might work") and informs her behavior (offering tea before questions, listening without flinching during the confession, dipping the bread instead of lecturing). The trait enables Mina's disclosure but remains partly label-only; the "testing what kindness might work" mechanism is told rather than shown through varied attempts. Present in setup and middle; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: Sada says "we spend our lives choosing what to uncloak" and they pull back the tarp to reveal the fountain. The action is dramatized and leads to planting the wheat. Decent causal work, but the metaphor is more thematic than tactical; the fountain's unveiling could be replaced with a simpler discovery. Present in middle and linked to closure, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (Sada reveals packets of seeds, explains the method), shapes the middle beat (planting wheat in the fountain), and is echoed in the closure (sprout through mortar). The method is specific and irreplaceable: removing it would gut the resistance mechanism. "Flowers can occupy a space before laws do" and "each week someone in uniform has to decide whether to uproot them" establish the tactic's logic and cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The secret tea house in the palace courtyard is introduced early, provides the physical resources (planters, fountain, tarp), and enables the confession and planting. The setting's decay (overgrown, collapsed arcade, missing statue) mirrors the theme of incremental erasure. The courtyard "breathe[s] as if it remembered harvests" at the planting beat. The setting constrains choice (hiding behind broken marble, working at night) and charges the final image. High integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the birds flew south" anchors the opening and establishes seasonal context (cold evening, winter tightens). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions; no countdown or deadline forces urgency. The phrase reappears implicitly in "as winter tightened" near the end, offering modest thematic resonance. Functional but replaceable; any seasonal marker would serve similar purposes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary before the ordinary was edited away" is stated early and dramatized through keeping the loaf, tracking erasures, and planting wheat. Mina's actions embody the desire with friction: she confesses her complicity (signing the complaint) before being allowed to plant, adding genuine cost. The motivation shapes the arc and is present in setup, middle, and closure with visible tradeoffs.</comment>
