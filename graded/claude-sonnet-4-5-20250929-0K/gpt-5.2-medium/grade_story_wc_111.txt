<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is consistently grounded in his pragmatic character and layered history of deception and repair. The past fraud and secret replanting provide meaningful internal conflict that shapes his ritual with Mera. Embodied emotion appears in "his thumb ached" and "back shook," though some interiority ("an old shame in him") leans toward summary. The final choice to leave one marble and name each cultivar "like a witness" feels earned by prior causality, though the stakes could press harder on a present cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The core closure—Elias confessing to the hedges and the meter detecting alignment—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Causal confession moment). Cost is present but somewhat abstract: "the physiology of someone finally aligned with his work" tells more than it shows. The ending image of leaving one marble and the line "proof had to be tended like any garden" reprices the stakes, but the meter's green-to-climbing reading feels more like validation than a path foreclosed with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The maze setting actively constrains choices: lanterns along hedges, marbles in niches, the spiral on grass. Micro-setting details—yew gate, jasmine scent, rosemary and rot—are filtered through Elias's horticultural lens and matter to his tactics. The final spiral "that also looked like a dying vine curling back on itself" charges the closure image with tension between bloom and decay. Spatial choreography (corridors, center, archways) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias wants "something stricter than forgiveness" and asks to prove "gardens know their gardeners." The night ritual deepens pressure by forcing public confession to the roots, and the meter's climb provides a meaningful tightening. Agency is present in the confessional act and in naming each cultivar. However, the resolution feels more like external validation (Mera's screen) than a trade-off with felt cost; the cost is his vulnerability, but the payoff (rising score) arrives too neatly without a visible price paid after the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between measured luck and unmeasurable care: "choices were what luck was measuring now." The marbles, lanterns, and spiral recur with shifting weight, and the final image of leaving one marble under the oldest vine reprices the opening premise without stating a moral. Elias's confession and midnight replanting ground the thematic question in specific acts. The line "proof had to be tended like any garden" risks light sermonizing but stays rooted in his pragmatic idiom and prior labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "saved string, reused nails," "polished them with a scrap of chamois," "wisely pragmatic" reflects Elias's lexicon throughout. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mera's brief dialogue ("what he expected from glass and chalk") contrasts with Elias's more embedded syntax. Some filter verbs ("told Mera," "asked what") are acceptable within voice but cluster in the final third. Under peak stress (the confession), diction compresses appropriately without losing the narrator's horticultural particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. However, several beats repeat content: "the marbles were not charms, not anymore, but reminders" closely echoes "collection of marbles, cracked...now his private ledger." The phrase "because in a measurable world" and "because the meter detected" recur as template stems. Mixed metaphor: a spiral "blooming pattern that also looked like a dying vine curling back" conflates two vehicles. Density is generally high, but these loops and the stacked filter verbs in the final third ("told Mera," "asked," "said") dull immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—quantified luck meeting intimate labor—is fresh and well-grounded in horticultural specificity (cultivar names, pruning, blight recovery). The marbles-as-ledger and lantern-labeling rituals feel particular to Elias. The confession-to-roots angle transforms the expected "confess to authorities" beat. Risk-taking is moderate: the luck-meter frame is high-concept but safely resolved (score climbs, validation granted). Emotional truth in the past fraud and secret replanting adds depth, though the ending leans toward affirmation rather than costly discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's choice to request the night, confess to the hedges, and leave one marble drives the final beats and alters his stance from shame-carrier to aligned gardener. Present in setup, middle confession, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marbles appear in opening (polishing), middle (placed in niches, spiral), and ending (one left under vine). Each use reweights meaning: from "not charms" to "reminders" to "quiet marker." The cracked property matters symbolically but could be more causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mended deception shapes backstory (faking reports, then secret planting) and motivates the confession. It narrows Elias's tactics—he must confess to prove alignment. Present in setup and payoff but summarized in the middle rather than pressuring a live choice in real time.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is shown through saving string, reusing nails, planning for browning, and the final line "proof had to be tended like any garden." It constrains his approach (no grand gestures, only small rituals) and appears in setup, middle labor, and closure idiom with visible tradeoffs in scale.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Polishing appears in opening (marbles until fractures catch sun), implicitly in the ritual preparation, and explicitly in the center ("polished the last one until his thumb ached"). The act redefines his relationship to past shame and charges the spiral. Not easily swappable; the friction and glint are specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories drives the marble-placing, date-chalking, ribbon-tying in early beats, the labeled lanterns, and the final spiral. The method is signaled early, shapes middle tactics (how he marks wins), and articulates his proof at closure. Mechanics matter: each jar and marble corresponds to a triumph.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maze provides yew gate, archways, hedges, center, and corridors that organize Elias's labor and ritual. It supplies the roots as witness, the spatial structure for lantern placement, and the final vine under which the marble is left. Micro-setting (jasmine, rosemary, compost rot) alters tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" frames the premise and justifies the Bureau and wrist meters. It appears in opening context and implicitly in Mera's device. The timeframe enables the conflict but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; no live clock pressure within the night ritual.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to prove "gardens know their gardeners" is stated explicitly, dramatized through the confession and naming of cultivars, and tested by Mera's meter. Friction exists between his need for validation and the risk of exposing past fraud. It drives the night request and shapes the spiral ritual with visible cost (vulnerability).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone oscillates between bloom and decay throughout: "bloom deserved a plan for its inevitable browning," "fractures caught the sun like spider silk," "the maze seem to bloom and wither at once." The tone modulates with pressure (shame, labor, confession) and charges the final image of the spiral and the one marble left. Coherent and purposeful across all beats.</comment>
