<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rian's trait of warmly attentive care is consistently embodied through physical actions (straightening shells, mending nets, wrapping the drake's foot), and his aesthetic philosophy drives concrete choices. Internal contradiction appears when he values incompleteness yet repeatedly repairs things, though this tension isn't fully dramatized as struggle. The poet role allows access to reflective interiority, but several key moments—especially the net-mending—rely on summary rather than showing how his attention constrains tactical choices under pressure. Embodiment is strong in object-handling but thins during the brothers' argument, where "listened for the rhythm of their anger" tells more than shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: objects (string, feather, net, kite) gather meaning through repetition and reweighting at closure when the drake returns and Rian offers both care and apology. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the final act of returning the feather and tending the injured drake crystallizes his aesthetic practice with visible cost—he relinquishes the found object that sparked his sequence. The connective tissue between beats (lagoon → shed → shallows → lagoon) relies on spatial proximity rather than causal necessity, and the brothers' conflict resolves too smoothly without friction that might test Rian's method. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's worry forces Rian to demonstrate repair as pedagogy, narrowing his practice from solitary collection to communal teaching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon is vividly established with "ink thinned with milk" and "burnished hush," and tactile details (sand on cuffs, soaked paper, mangrove roots) ground action. The setting supplies materials (kite string, feather, net, warm stone) that enable each repair sequence, and the drake's emergence from reeds charges the final image by linking environment to thematic closure. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental; "palm stumps" and "fishermen's shed" serve as anchors without adding pressure. The final beat uses the lagoon's lap of water to pace Rian's breath, meeting the micro-setting constraint test for 7.0+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving beauty lives in the incomplete—is signaled early and tested across three repair sequences (net, kite, drake). Each act narrows Rian's options by requiring him to invest time and materials, and the final choice to return the feather forecloses keeping the "proof" he initially sought, a visible cost scaled to this length. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens as each repair deepens his commitment, but escalation is gentle; the brothers' quarrel and the child's worry introduce external complications without forcing Rian to choose between competing goods or risk failure. The drake's injury provides the peak tightening, yet resolution arrives without visible struggle—his method succeeds in every application.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: mending torn fabric, stitching rips into sunrise patterns, wrapping an injured foot. The "Woven Dawns" title and Rian's aesthetic philosophy (beauty in the incomplete, courage to leave seams showing) are articulated but then demonstrated through material choices rather than asserted. The final image—returning the feather as apology while the notebook "finally held, imperfect and shining"—answers the thematic question without stating a moral, and the drake's ragged tail + bruised foot embody cost without symbolic overreach. One small slip: "harmonizing discord" appears as both method and thematic claim, edging toward echo, though the on-page repair actions keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third with consistent perceptual filters (Rian notices small flaws, attends to texture). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("barbules caught on the string like a hand trying to hold on") with purposeful compression that matches a poet's idiom. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue ("what breaks can still belong if you give it a task") reads as Rian's voice rather than authorial intrusion. One friction: the opening sentence runs long with nested subordinate clauses that slightly obscure the anchor, and "burnished hush that made even the reeds seem to listen" edges toward precious without clear payoff until the final callback to breath and lap of water.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high with multi-tasking lines (e.g., feather + string interaction advances both theme and object collection). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the kite rescue and breathing in the final drake scene. Two notable artifacts lower the score: the opening 63-word sentence front-loads orientation but tangles syntax with "after the last shower, the cobalt lagoon after rain," creating echo within the clause. Template stems recur in the middle ("he listened," "he asked," "he showed") across the net and kite sequences, flattening momentum during key teaching beats. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors, and the final lines achieve clarity with "imperfect and shining in the burnished hush" reprising the opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of repair-as-aesthetic-practice and found-object pedagogy offers a fresh angle on the "artist seeks inspiration" template. Specific details (net knots meeting in the middle, kite scars arranged as sunrise, drake's bruised foot wrapped in twine) transform familiar material through tactile particulars. Risk is modest: every repair succeeds without complication, and the lagoon "offers" materials on cue, which reads as convenient rather than earned discovery. The "quiet shoreline poet" + "beauty in the incomplete" premise echoes literary templates (wounded healer, kintsugi), and while execution is competent, the lack of a single failed attempt or moment when Rian's method proves insufficient keeps the piece in the capable-but-safe zone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rian appears early, drives all three repair sequences (net, kite, drake), and his choices—asking to see the tear, showing the boy how to stitch, wrapping the foot—alter tactics in each beat. His decision to return the feather at closure reweights the opening collection impulse with visible cost (relinquishing proof). The character is essential across beats but swappable in role: a craftsperson, teacher, or healer could perform identical actions with minor lexical edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The feather appears in beat one (found beside string), beat two (tucked behind ear as ornament that draws laughter), and closure (returned to water as apology), meeting the ≥2 beat test. Its "barbules caught on the string like a hand trying to hold on" generates the "incomplete gesture" insight that frames Rian's project. Returning it charges the final image by converting a kept token into a sacrificial gift, tied to the drake's injury. Strong causal role and closure linkage; one friction keeps it below 8.5: the feather's unique properties (green-black shimmer, barbule texture) don't constrain middle choices—Rian tucks it behind his ear without it affecting the net or kite repairs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Woven Dawns" is named early, explained as a poetic sequence braiding "every off note of morning," and literalized when Rian shows the boy "how to stitch the rips... so the seams made a sunrise pattern, a literal woven dawn." This lyric reprise reweights the abstract title with concrete action at closure. The concept shapes the dominant stake (proving incompleteness is beautiful) but does not constrain tactics—Rian's repair methods would function identically if his poem were titled differently. Solid setup-payoff arc; mid-band because it remains thematic overlay rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is demonstrated early (straightening shells, tending tide pools) and enables on-page actions: listening to the brothers' anger rhythm, showing the child patience, speaking softly to the drake. The trait constrains one choice with cost: Rian invests time in others' problems rather than advancing his own writing, and "stayed by the cobalt water" after the boy runs off suggests a delay. The attribute is visible across beats but could be replaced with "patient" or "careful" without structural change, limiting irreplaceability to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tend" appears in the opening (tide pool wall), drives all three major beats (mending net, repairing kite, wrapping drake's foot), and the final lines state "taught him again to tend the world," crystallizing the action as method and theme. Removing "tend" and substituting "repair" or "help" would require rewriting the thematic frame and the specific care-based tactics (arranging seams, wrapping with twine vs. more clinical fixes). The action is indispensable to closure and shapes every key choice, meeting high irreplaceability and causal-pressure tests.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By harmonizing discord" is introduced at the net-mending ("he listened for the rhythm of their anger, then began to mend... by harmonizing discord, letting each brother pull... until the knots met in the middle") and reprised at closure ("taught him again to tend the world by harmonizing discord"). The method is signaled and shapes one beat's tactics (using the brothers' opposed pulls as repair mechanics). However, the kite and drake sequences don't employ this method—straightforward stitching and bandaging occur without harmonizing opposing forces—so it functions primarily in one beat and as thematic echo rather than shaping all attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lagoon supplies all materials (string and feather land at Rian's feet, kite snags on mangrove roots, drake paddles from reeds, warm stone aids drying) and the setting's spatial layout (rim → shed → shallows → reeds) sequences the encounters. The "cobalt... ink thinned with milk" and "burnished hush" appear in the opening and closing paragraphs, framing and charging the final image. The setting enables rather than pressures; Rian moves freely without environmental constraint forcing tactical adaptation. Strong setup, development, and closure participation; edges toward 8.0 but lacks the friction (storm, rising tide, failing light) that would force hard choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kite-string snap occurs early and provides the inciting event (string and feather land at Rian's feet), anchoring the sequence's trigger. Time remains vague thereafter—"for weeks he had been writing" is backstory, and "near dusk" loosely places the kite rescue, but no clock tightens decisions. The snap itself is vivid but does not constrain later moves; Rian's pace is leisurely across all beats. Setup gate met, but no middle or closure time-pressure; the element functions as event rather than live constraint, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is articulated early ("He believed beauty lived in the incomplete... proof that it was not laziness... but courage") and drives Rian's collection and repair choices across all beats. Friction appears when he must relinquish the feather (concrete proof) to tend the drake, a trade-off between keeping evidence and enacting the principle. The desire is dramatized through action but not deeply conflicted—every repair succeeds, and no moment tests whether incomplete beauty might justify leaving something broken. Solid causality and closure linkage; lacks the internal contradiction or cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" opens and closes the piece, establishing and sustaining a contemplative, textured quiet. Tone modulates gently: the brothers' quarrel introduces discord without breaking the hush (their voices "softened," laughter had "edges smoothed by rain"), and the child's worry adds urgency within the calm frame. The final image—Rian's breath matching the lap of water, the notebook holding "imperfect and shining in the burnished hush"—charges closure by returning to the opening tone with accumulated weight. Coherent through turns and purposeful at the end; strong but not indispensable, as a different tonal palette (e.g., "crackling brightness") could support the same beats with edits.</comment>
