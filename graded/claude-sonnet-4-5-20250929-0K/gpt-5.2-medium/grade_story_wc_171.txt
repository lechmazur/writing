<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sera's interiority shows layered contradictions—"operatively gentle" yet haunted by the doomed corridor, patience disciplined into ritual yet carrying unhealed guilt. The final move (burning her own map) forecloses redemption-as-absolution and crystallizes a choice to pay daily labor instead. Minor slip: the girl and some envoys remain gestural; their micro-choices don't complicate Sera's arc. Motivation is clear and embodied through the scars, the clipboard weight, and the ritual design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis / Conceptual Repricing: Sera understands peace is "not forgiveness, only the daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for"—a renunciation of absolution with visible cost (her map burns, the memory of the corridor remains). Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). Drive lens is Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: ritual pressure and vows force stance crystallization; the bowl, oath, and celestial framing cohere to reweight the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maro and Odran each surrender cherished orders, narrowing their options and forcing the vows. Cost is legible on the page in the burned objects and Sera's final realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace mosaics, solstice line, bowl, and candles constrain the ritual choreography and charge the final image ("ash drifted over the terrace … the celestial bodies continued their indifferent waltz"). Micro-setting details—cracked mosaics, lantern smoke, ridge where the sun touches—filter through Sera's professional attention and pressure the delegations' willingness to perform. Spatial choreography is clean (opposite stairways, mosaic circle, low altar). The setting shapes the ritual's gravity and thus the treaty's legitimacy; removal would flatten the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: achieve a treaty that binds through ritual sacrifice, not paper alone. One meaningful tightening: Maro and Odran hesitate, then surrender directive and medal, narrowing their exits and forcing public vows. Agency is Sera's design of the ritual and her own map-burning, which forecloses redemption-as-absolution and commits her to daily labor. The ritual "cornered them into arguing details instead of denying the humanity"—a clear tactic shift with visible cost (lost orders, lost medals, voiced vows). No explicit antagonist; pressure is the Forever War inertia and mutual distrust, coherent under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (the price of redemption, ritual vs. paper authority, peace as labor) emerges through the burned objects, the solstice oath mechanics, and Sera's final realization that forgiveness is separate from daily work. The ending offers a non-literal answer: ash and indifferent stars hold the tension between human cost and cosmic scale without moralizing. Subtext operates in Maro's shaking fingers, Odran's longer hesitation, the girl's drifting gaze at star mosaics. Minor note: "operatively gentle" appears twice as a label, once in backstory and once near the end, risking slight echo; still, it connects to the visible tradeoff (patience that invites but refuses to let shame turn to rage).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Sera is stable; perceptual signature ("lantern smoke curl," "the terrace tilt as if the sky itself judged her") is character-specific. Diction elevates purposefully ("flawed beauty," "indifferent waltz") and remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Maro's snort, Odran's skeptical question, and the vows advance stakes and reveal status. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" is used as a phrase twice, once in narration and once as near-repetition; while voice-motivated, the echo risks filter-verb stacking in peak beats. No head-hopping; no unmotivated register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. Pattern-artifact penalty applies: multiple sentences open with similar stems ("Sera had…," "Sera mustered…," "Sera read…," "Sera invited…"), creating mild template cadence across the piece. "Operatively gentle" appears twice as a phrase, risking decorative repetition. "The girl" recurs as a label without added specificity in later mentions. Figurative language ("lantern smoke curl into the violet air," "the terrace tilt") is vivid but clusters in the opening and closing, trending toward slight overwriting at the edges. No causality breaks or pronoun confusion; prose is mostly clean. Non-closure artifacts prevent entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ritual-framed treaty negotiation offers a fresh synthesis of Forever War tropes and the specifics (ebony clipboard, bowl for ashes, solstice oath, burned directive/medal/map) feel particular. The emotional calculus—peace as daily labor rather than forgiveness—resists tidy resolution. Minor derivative note: the weary negotiator archetype and the ritual-as-binding device are familiar; transformation comes through the burned personal objects and Sera's self-indictment. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is moderate (the ritual structure is clear but not radical); no bold perspectival leap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera (forever war peace negotiator) is present throughout, frames the ritual, adds her own map to the bowl, and delivers the final realization that peace is daily labor. Her choices (choosing the terrace, designing the bowl sacrifice, refusing to let shame turn to rage) create the key turns and enable the vows. Removal would collapse the story's agency and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ebony clipboard appears in beat one ("in her hands … heavier tonight than any weapon") and beat four ("Sera read the treaty from the clipboard") and beat six ("clipped the signed pages together"). It recurs with evolving function (weight → reading → finalization) but does not constrain a middle choice or charge the closure image; the bowl and burned objects carry that weight. Functional but somewhat replaceable with another treaty-holding object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The price of redemption shapes stakes from the opening ("every treaty felt like a chance at redemption, and every chance carried a price") through the bowl ritual ("the price of redemption for leaders who had made killing normal") to the closure ("peace was not forgiveness, only the daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for"). It alters tactics (demanding sacrifices, not just signatures) and is visible in the burned map. Removal would gut the thematic and tactical spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is defined early ("a patience trained into discipline, but gentleness did not mean softness about consequences") and constrains one on-page action: "her operatively gentle gaze held them there, refusing to let shame turn into rage." The trait enables the ritual's pressure without collapse. Present in the setup and at a peak beat, but not in the closure image; somewhat swappable with "disciplined patience" or similar. Visible tradeoff (patience that corners rather than coerces) lifts it above decorative, but not to essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muster" appears once: "Sera mustered her voice, not loud but steady, and invited them to stand on the mosaic circle." It initiates the ritual sequence and signals vocal control under pressure. The action is dramatized and necessary to start the ceremony, but no major turn traces uniquely to "muster" versus another verb of vocal effort. Swappable with "summoned" or "gathered" without structural loss; the ritual mechanics and bowl sacrifice drive the turns more than this single verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled in the setup ("chosen this place because ritual significance could do what threats could not"), shapes middle tactics (bowl for ashes, solstice oath, burning directive/medal/map), and charges the closure ("the flames threw flawed beauty onto their faces, making them look briefly like people who could start over"). The ritual constrains both delegations' moves and alters the treaty's binding force from paper to enacted sacrifice. Removal would reduce the story to conventional negotiation. The mechanics (circle, altar, bowl, candles, vows) are legible and cost-bearing throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is present in setup, provides the mosaic circle and solstice line that organize the ritual choreography, and recurs in the closure ("ash drifted over the terrace"). Its age and celestial alignment pressure the delegations to honor a shared past and cosmic timing. The setting supplies the ritual's spatial logic and charges the final image. Specific details (cracked mosaics, opposite stairways, low altar) constrain staging. Removal would eliminate the ritual's grounding and symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("during the slow dance of celestial bodies," "the treaty would be read aloud while the sun sank and the first planet rose," "When the sun touched the far ridge … Venus brightened and the moon climbed") is signaled early and tracks the ritual's progression. It tightens the ceremony's window and adds cosmic indifference to the closure image. Not a ticking-clock pressure, but the celestial timing shapes the solstice oath's legitimacy and the pacing. Swappable with another liminal moment (dawn, equinox) without full collapse, but the deliberate slow/indifferent framing charges theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sera's motivation ("to anchor ideals in practice") is stated early and dramatized through her design of the bowl sacrifice and her refusal to accept "a paper that would be burned by the next commander." Friction appears in Maro's and Odran's objections and the cost of her own map-burning. The motivation drives the ritual method and the final understanding that anchoring requires daily labor, not forgiveness. Visible in setup, middle conflict, and closure realization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone (flawed beauty) is coherent throughout: "lantern smoke curl into the violet air," "cracked mosaics," "the flames threw flawed beauty onto their faces," "ash drifted … and the celestial bodies continued their indifferent waltz." The tone modulates under pressure (Maro's snort, Odran's scars) and charges the final image where imperfection and transcendence coexist. Removal of this tonal layer would flatten the piece into procedural negotiation. The tone shapes perception and stakes without becoming static.</comment>
