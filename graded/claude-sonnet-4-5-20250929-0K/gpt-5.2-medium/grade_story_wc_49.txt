<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marn's motivation—restoring the harvest through forgotten song—is signaled early and drives the final actions, but his interiority remains thin; we see him imagine, believe, and smile without embodied contradiction or visible internal cost. The keepers' shame and returning memory create some pressure, but the protagonist's arc feels more like facilitator than transformed agent. The ending choice (handing over the crank) closes a loop without foreclosing a live path or revealing a hierarchy of values under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marn builds a device, the keepers add breath and memory, the arbor responds. Closure arrives when the youngest keeper receives the crank and the rite is "restored," but the cost remains abstract—Marn walks away "lighter," yet no specific forfeiture or trade-off is dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test is met (who/where/when by the opening), and the pattern coheres, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the resolution feels declared rather than earned through visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The verdant arbor, harvest moon, lightning scar, and dawn dew are vividly rendered and anchor the setting throughout. The vine tendril threaded through the trunk scar becomes a micro-setting that constrains Marn's method (he must use *this* tendril in *this* wound), and the alignment of moonlight and dew shapes the timing. The arbor's response—sap rising, fruit dropping—charges the final beats, lifting Q3 into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the forgotten harvest rite—is clear from the summons and drives each beat. Marn's device fails until the keepers offer honest breath, creating one meaningful turn that narrows options. However, the escalation lacks a visible price: no tool breaks, no keeper refuses, no alternate path is foreclosed with felt cost. The coincidental alignment ("when everything aligns") complicates rather than resolves, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the final success feels gifted by the moment rather than earned through protagonist trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sacred practices require people, not machines; memory and breath restore what gears cannot. The golden threads and vine-stitch imagery accumulate without overt moralizing, and the final image (the crank passing to the youngest keeper) offers a resonant answer to "how does a grove stay holy?" Yet the thematic climax arrives through a stated lesson ("because that is when the grove stays holy") rather than dramatized realization, nudging the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The third-person POV remains stable and the voice carries a lyric, fabulist register ("patient breath," "golden stories," "sap rose like applause") that fits the whimsical-tinkerer frame. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marn notices vine quivers, listens to wood, imagines living wires—but the prose occasionally drifts into committee voice ("the truest tools begin") and elevated abstractions ("dreams were where") that feel authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops and template constructions appear: "not to entertain, but to remember" / "not with words at first, but with..."; "stories they sang" / "the restored rite"; "listening to wood" / "listen for the moment." The final third carries mild register drift ("sacred practices are not machines that work without people" reads thesis-like). These artifacts dull momentum in mid-beats but do not obscure the closure image, so penalties remain within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The whimsical-tinkerer premise is familiar (magical artisan restores lost rite), and the core turn—machines cannot work without people—is a well-worn folk-tale moral. The vine-as-harp device and the alignment window add texture, but the emotional arc (summoned expert succeeds and departs) follows a template path. No bold risk elevates the design; the piece reads competent but derivative within its genre niche.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marn (whimsical tinkerer) drives two key beats: building the harp-frame and asking the keepers for honest breath. His final choice—handing the crank to the youngest keeper—alters the arbor's future by anchoring the rite in the community. Early signal (opening line), middle development (the device fails until he shifts tactics), and closure participation (the handoff) are all present. Causal pressure is moderate; swapping him for another artisan would require only minor edits. Cost is implied (lighter pockets, departure) but not dramatized as a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in three distinct beats: threaded through the lightning scar (setup), fitted into the frame and cranked (middle), and woven into the trunk scar to close the wound (closure). Its quivering, tightening, and humming constrain Marn's method—he cannot use brass alone, he must integrate the living tendril. The element is irreplaceable within the story's logic (no other vine or wire would carry the arbor's lost note) and charges the final image when the scar closes and sap rises.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The harvest moon is present in the opening ("still hung pale in the west") and departs at closure ("slipped below the horizon at last"), framing the alignment window. The timeframe depends on its presence—moonlight touching dew—so it enables the remedy. However, it does not constrain a mid-scene choice or reweight meaning beyond marking the ritual window. A lyric seed-to-reprise that shapes stakes but lacks beat-level causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is mentioned once ("he began to spin golden stories, not to entertain, but to remember") and translated into action (he stitches patterns into vines). The attribute enables the remedy method but does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—Marn spins as many stories as needed without limit or consequence. Late first appearance (mid-story), minimal beat involvement, and no cost connection keep the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The remedy action structures the entire arc: Marn is summoned to provide it, builds the device, invites the keepers' breath, weaves threads into the scar, and the arbor responds. The remedy fails as a solo machine (beat one), succeeds when combined with community participation (beat two), and is anchored in the handoff (closure). Two major turns trace to this action, and removing it would collapse the plot. Specificity (weaving memory-threads through a vine-stitched scar) elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is signaled in the setup ("the keepers… whispered that the sacred practices… had been forgotten"), developed when Marn asks for honest breath and the keepers follow with "remembered sway… syllables returned," and paid off at closure when "the stories they sang" anchor the rite. The method constrains tactics—he cannot use gears alone, must recover the songs—and two beats depend on it. Strong causal role, though the mechanics (how songs become golden threads) remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn provides the alignment window (moonlight touches dew), houses the lightning-scarred trunk, and responds to the remedy (sap rises, fruit drops). It pressures the timing and supplies the vine tendril resource. Early setup, middle involvement (circle of stones, canopy), and closure participation (trees answer across the arbor) are all present. The setting enables rather than constrains, so it remains in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" is signaled in the opening ("This was the morning the keepers called when everything aligns") and governs the remedy window—moonlight, dew, and the old calendar must coincide. The timeframe tightens the decision (act now or wait a season) and is reprised at closure ("the alignment had clicked a hidden latch"). However, the clock is not tracked beat-to-beat; no countdown or missed moment creates tactical friction. A lyric frame that shapes stakes without constraining mid-scene choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marn's motivation—to restore sacred practices—drives the summons, the device-building, and the handoff. The keepers' shame dramatizes the forgotten rite, and Marn's realization ("practices are not machines that work without people") shifts his approach from solo tinkering to collaborative song. Two beats depend on this motivation, and it is resolved at closure. Cost is implied (the rite now belongs to the community, not the tinkerer) but not sharply dramatized. Early signal, middle friction, closure participation present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" opens the story ("a gathering hush held the leaves") and recurs when the keepers inhale ("the hush deepened"). The tone modulates slightly from waiting silence to exhaled song, supporting the shift from individual effort to collective memory. However, the hush does not constrain choices or charge the final image in a specific way; it provides atmospheric cohesion without causal pressure. Present in setup and middle, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>
