<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's goal (learn repair rhythm, mend father's clock) is clear and intensifies through her choices at the iced table. The reflection on her father's decline is substantial (~15% of the text) but anchors concretely in the gear assortment and tilts her present decision to craft rather than take. Internal contradiction appears when she chooses three gears despite the warning, then resolves it by making a new gear—this earns the final renunciation. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "saltwood") that reads slightly above a locksmith's natural idiom under stress, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, frozen library, eclipse locksmith). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and lyric cadence build to the final deepening when Mara grasps "Return by making, not by taking" and files her own gear, reweighting the repair concept with visible craft cost. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she exits with the finished gear and originals untouched, crystallizing the alignment principle without a decisive confrontation. One causality question: the hall of mirrors "rearranges reflections" to show her father's bench with no clear rule or cost, reading slightly convenient, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly anchored (frost-lace doors, air "ground into powder," iced table) and the clockmaker's gear assortment constrains her final choice—she cannot simply take, so she files her own. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's locksmith focus (oil traced along the slit, teeth counting heartbeats). The hall of mirrors supplies spatial pressure and the iced table enforces the return rule, both shaping tactics. Micro-setting (the gear against her pulse) charges the climax, meeting the 9+ gate threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn repair, mend father's clock without stealing) is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the note warns "Take only what you can return" and deepens when the second scrap instructs "Return by making, not by taking," forcing Mara to file a new gear instead of taking the originals. This meaningful tightening forecloses the easier path with on-page craft cost (time, skill, locksmith picks traded). Agency is clear, but the hall-of-mirrors showing her father's bench feels slightly convenient—coincidence complicating rather than resolving—holding the score below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (repair as alignment, not speed or theft) emerges from concrete particulars: the prophecy scraps, the gear teeth counting heartbeats, the final act of making. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Mara carries "new timing" and the original parts remain, embodying the repair ethic without stating it. No overt moralizing. The final image ("driftwood nostalgia and a new timing") reweights prior material. One slip: "the rhythm of repair was not speed but alignment" borders on thematic echo, though it remains internalized rather than sermonized, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (locksmith focus: "tools clinking," "smallest click," "teeth count her heartbeats"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond a locksmith's natural register under pressure—"hauntingly bright," "driftwood nostalgia," "saltwood"—creating slight register drift that distances from embodied voice. No dialogue to evaluate. The lyric compression is purposeful and legible, taught early, but the elevated vocabulary in peak beats (the gear-filing climax) prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; many lines advance multiple jobs (sensory detail, world rule, motive). Two micro-loops: "she wanted to understand, and understanding required parts" restates the want without added pressure; "she carried driftwood nostalgia and a new timing" in the final line re-uses "driftwood" from paragraph one without clear reweighting. Figurative density is heavy throughout (frost-lace, sunlight ground into powder, cliffs of shelves) and some metaphors border on mixed (driftwood as patience, then as nostalgia). Template cadence in one passage: "She could pick any lock, but she could not pick time." These artifacts prevent 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis (eclipse locksmith in a sky library learning repair via prophecy and craft) is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "taking vs. making" resists the easier treasure-hunt frame and commits to the repair ethic through the gear-filing choice. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring the causal chain. Diction choices (frost-lace, saltwood, driftwood) occasionally feel ornamental rather than inevitable, and the hall-of-mirrors mechanic (showing father's bench) reads slightly convenient, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (lunar-eclipse locksmith) is present throughout and her choices create all major turns: unlocking the door (~10%), reading prophecy (~50%), choosing gears and filing her own (~75%), exiting with the finished gear (closure). Her eclipse-born trait enables door-reading and her locksmith skill trades picks for gears. The final decision (make, don't take) alters tactics with visible craft cost. Setup, middle choice, and closure participation all present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clockmaker's gear assortment appears at the iced table (~40%), is handled when Mara chooses three gears (~75%), and its return rule shapes her final choice to file her own gear (closure). The note "Take only what you can return" constrains tactics and the prophecy ratios guide her work. Setup, development (two beats: choosing and filing), and closure linkage all present; causal pressure and cost connection strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hall of mirrors is vividly described (~35%) and rearranges reflections to show father's bench (~55%), enabling prophecy interpretation. It supplies spatial pressure and multiplies Mara's image, but its mechanics (why it shows the bench, how it responds to her breath) are vague. Setup and middle use present; closure participation weak—it "ceased multiplication" before the gear-filing climax, signaling satisfaction but not actively shaping the final choice. Swappable with "magic window" or similar device.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" air is anchored early (~25%: "sunlight ground into powder") and causes rime on Mara's eyelashes, a concrete sensory effect. It modulates when the library dims "to a gentler glow as if satisfied" after she begins filing (~80%), signaling environmental response to her choice. Setup and closure modulation present; middle constraint weak—the brightness does not block or enable a specific tactic. Cost connection indirect (environmental approval rather than obstacle overcome).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncap" (a vial of warmed oil) appears early (~15%) and enables door entry, the inciting turn that grants access to the library. Without this action, the story cannot begin. Setup strong, but middle and closure participation absent—once inside, the vial is not mentioned again and other elements (prophecy, gears) drive later beats. Causal role in one beat (entry), irreplaceability moderate (heated oil specific to frost-lock), but no reprise or reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is signaled (~45%), Mara follows music to find them, reads aloud to trigger the hall's response, and uses their ratios to file her gear (~75% onward). The method shapes two beats (discovery, application) and its instruction ("Return by making") directly enables closure. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; mechanics legible (read → image → ratios → craft); causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is anchored immediately (title moment, ~5%) and supplies multiple resources: frost-lace doors test her eclipse skill, the iced table enforces the return rule, the corner hides prophecy scraps, and the hall of mirrors responds to her breath. Each location feature alters tactics (oil to open, picks to trade, ratios to copy). Setup, development (multiple beats), and closure participation (she "stepped out above the cloud sea") all strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" opens the story and sets a contemplative tone, but time remains vague throughout—no clock pressure, no sense of hours passing or urgency tied to dawn/dusk. The library journey reads timeless; Mara's actions could span minutes or hours with no on-page consequence. Setup present (title moment), but middle and closure participation absent. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; swappable with "twilight" or "noon" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is Mara's stated goal (~10%), dramatized in her choice of gears (~75%) when she realizes "the rhythm of repair was not speed but alignment," and fulfilled in the closure when she carries "new timing" home. The desire is in friction with temptation (taking is easier than making) and guilt (father's unused tools, "saltwood" mornings). Setup, middle choice (filing her own gear with visible craft cost), and closure participation all present; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Driftwood appears twice: "tools clinking with the tired patience of driftwood washed ashore" (~8%) and "driftwood nostalgia" in the final line (closure). The tone is elegiac and wistful throughout, modulating slightly when the library dims "as if satisfied" after her choice (~80%). Setup and closure reprise present; the return reweights the opening patience motif with earned nostalgia. Middle modulation weak—tone remains static through middle beats. Coherent but not deeply charged by pressure, preventing higher scores.</comment>
