<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies organically: curiosity about the watchers drives her search through the city's pattern language. Her micro-choices (testing the whistle, working the seam, composing the gate answer) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is mostly concrete ("question that burns in her throat," "sunwashed dread"), though "quietly driven" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The final choice to step through the gate is earned by her pattern-reading and feels inevitable, with visible cost (leaving Kel Varo, entering the unknown mirrored city).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pattern accumulates through spiral/crack/whistle mechanics, each beat adding density until the gate splits. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira stands at the threshold seeing the mirrored city and waiting expedition, options crystallized, cost felt (stepping into the unknown to join those who vanished). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when journal spirals map onto city streets, reweighting the watchers from external threat to built-in code. Cost is legible in the final image: she must leave her city to reach the expedition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vivid and purposeful: spiral seams guide her search, the crack constrains her route, the cistern hides the journal. Micro-setting (gate rivets stamped with watcher motifs, shell grooves) charges the final image and alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira's cartographic lens (salt light, reef-like rust, dust leaping from seams). The mirrored city at closure transforms the setting from bowl-and-rim to recursive threshold, deepening the conceptual space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the watchers' nature) is signaled early and tightens through Lira's pattern-reading. One meaningful deepening: realizing the watchers are built into the gate, not outside it. The journal's account of the expedition adds pressure and narrows her options to replicating their approach. Agency is clear: she composes the whistle-rhythm answer that opens the gate. Cost is felt at closure (stepping through forecloses return to unmapped safety). The expedition's prior failure and the gate's resistance provide escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication through pattern languages, the recursiveness of exploration (the city itself is code, the watchers are gate-rivets). The final image (mirrored city, silent expedition) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "who are the watchers" without moralizing—they are reflections, or the city speaking back. Motifs (spiral, crack, whistle) recur with reweighted meaning and constrain choice. Subtext operates in the expedition's silence and the gate as "mouth clamped shut." No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Lira's perceptual signature (cartographic pattern-reading, "spiral-shell cartographer" idiom). Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring clarity: "salt light," "bowl and rim," "burnt petals." Psychic distance tightens at closure. One register slip: "sunwashed dread" in the penultimate sentence reads slightly elevated for peak pressure, though it fits the established tone. No head-hopping, no dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean; narrative certainty matches Lira's inference ("realizes," "understands") without overreach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most sentences advance setting, character, or discovery. Minor pattern issues: "quietly driven" repeats verbatim across two paragraphs without transformation (opening and late middle), and "the watchers" recurs frequently in similar syntactic slots. Figurative language (gate as mouth, rust as reef) is coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and reconfigure the horizon image effectively. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cartography-as-language, recursive city-worlds, and the expedition-as-threshold in a non-obvious way. The transformation of "watchers" from external threat to self-referential architecture feels fresh and earned. Specific detail (reed whistle pitch, rivets stamped with motifs, compass spinning in sand spirals) grounds the speculative. The mirrored city at closure is bold and risks confusion but lands cleanly. Risk-taking (single long breath of a story, pattern-language mechanics) heightens stakes without gimmickry. One proximity note: the "gate as mouth" and recursive-city motifs echo genre templates, but specificity (turtle shells, salt light, reed whistle) transforms them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira drives all key turns: traces the crack, works the seam, tests the whistle, maps the journal spirals, composes the gate answer, and steps through. Her cartographic lens shapes every beat. Present in setup, development (journal mapping), and closure (chalking symbols, stepping through). Choices alter tactics and foreclose safety. Causal pressure is high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reed whistle appears in three beats: retrieved from Guildhall, tested against shell grooves (reveals seam), and used to compose rhythm at gate (splits lock). Early signal, middle mechanics, closure participation. Evolving use; the whistle's pitch becomes a key. Solid causal pressure, though the mechanics of "pitch against grooves" and "rhythm" are slightly abstract. Cost tied to expedition loss (their whistle, her inheritance).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lost expedition frames stakes (they never returned) and supplies the journal that teaches Lira the pattern-language answer. Present in setup (ledger, whistle, their route), development (journal spirals), and closure (they stand waiting in mirrored city). Shapes two beats and primes closure. Causal role clear but somewhat background; the expedition is more condition than active pressure. Cost connection: Lira follows their path, risking their fate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated twice (opening, late middle) but functions more as label than enacted constraint. On-page actions reflect determination (works seam, maps spirals, climbs gatehouse, composes answer) but no trade-off between quiet restraint and loud assertion is dramatized. Early signal, implied in development, not visibly tested at closure. Swappable with "determined" or "obsessive" without structural loss. Cost not tied to this specific trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Crack" appears in four beats: hairline fracture traced on shell, seam that gives with "soft crack," lock splits with "final crack," and the gate opening. Early signal (crack as warning in old maps), middle mechanics (opens cistern stairwell), closure participation (lock splits). Causal pressure high; irreplaceable. The crack is the path through. Specificity: each crack reweights the prior (warning → passage → opening). Cost: following the crack forecloses the sealed gate's safety.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pattern language is introduced early (teacher's craft: scallop/water, spiral/shelter, crack/warning), applied in middle beats (maps journal spirals onto city streets, realizes gate rivets match watchers), and executed at closure (composes answer with spirals and scallops). Shapes three beats. Mechanics matter: pattern-reading enables discovery and gate-opening. Specificity high. Cost: the method's success pulls her through. Strong causal pressure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Turtle-shell city present in every beat: streets curve like nautilus seams, shells beneath feet are pages, oldest turtle shell holds the crack, cistern is sealed within shell structure, city as "single enormous code," gate in seawall. Early signal, middle development (crack and cistern constraint), closure (city mirrors across threshold). Supplies resources (hidden stairwell, journal) and constrains route (sealed cistern, rusted gate). Irreplaceable; the city's recursive architecture *is* the puzzle. High causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the gate rusts shut" frames the entire situation: seven years sealed, city as bowl, no caravans. Present in setup (gate shut, hinges crusted), development (Lira searches within city because gate is closed), and closure (gate opens only after pattern-work). Timeframe creates the constraint that drives plot. Not a ticking clock, but a static condition that Lira must overcome. Causal role solid; removing it would require alternate reason for her internal search. Cost: seven years of isolation, expedition lost in that span.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's desire to question the watchers is stated early ("burns in her throat") and pursued in every beat: searches city for way through, follows crack/journal clues, realizes watchers are gate-rivets, climbs to see alignment, composes answer. Friction: her curiosity vs. the expedition's fate (they never returned). Cost dramatized: she steps through despite the risk. Setup, development (each discovery narrows path to gate), closure (she steps through to meet them). Strong causal pressure; desire drives all tactics. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is coherent across beats: "salt light," "sun that bleaches even fear," "sunwashed dread" at realization, "haze" at mirrored city. Tone modulates with pressure: quiet determination early, mounting unease at journal (shadows made compass spin), dread at realization (gate as throat), charged poise at closure (expedition waiting, eyes bright). Early signal, sustained through development, charges final image. Specificity: heat and light imagery tied to desert/salt setting. Cost felt in the dread that accompanies discovery.</comment>
