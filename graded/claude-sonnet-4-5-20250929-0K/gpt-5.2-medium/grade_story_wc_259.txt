<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's curiosity is present and drives the descent, but interior contradiction remains thin: the pull toward forbidden knowledge versus safety is declared rather than dramatized in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("my joy at nearing it hurt like a pulled tooth"), yet peak beats lean on abstract claims ("atoms of nostalgia") rather than visceral sensation. The final choice to teach in spirals feels asserted without visible cost that forecloses a prior path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early; time is signaled ("twilight," "dawn") but the window remains vague. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (prism, light corridors, council scenes) and the closure reweights nostalgia itself via the teaching choice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pagoda reveals the council's trap, narrowing the historian's understanding. Cost is felt in the tears and the veil "as if it were a confession," though the teaching resolution lacks a visible forfeiture that makes before/after stakes sharply legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive setting (copper air, bronze door, violet windows) is vivid and mood-driven. The bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting, constraining the purification method through its rotating facets and light corridors. Spatial choreography is coherent (descent, vault, upper halls return). However, the pagoda's mechanics remain abstract; we see light and scent but not tactile resistance or physical consequence that pressures the historian's body or tool-use in a high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden Keth knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the historian learns the archives are traps. One reversal occurs: the purification intended to cleanse instead reveals the contagion and its cure. Agency is present in the choice to rotate the pagoda irregularly and to copy the formula, but the final teaching decision feels like an add-on rather than a forced trade-off with visible loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, yet the escalation lacks a moment where the historian must sacrifice a live option to gain the formula.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as weapon, nostalgia as contagion, purification through disorder—emerges organically from the pagoda's mechanics and the council's trap. The final image of teaching "in spirals and leaps" reweights the purification method without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the veil reading and the stolen tears. However, the formula's revelation ("separating a life from its memories") introduces a late concept not primed by prior beats, slightly diluting the thematic through-line earned by the pagoda and atoms of nostalgia.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: saffron veil, dust, copper taste, light corridors. Diction is elevated and lyric ("steadily unpredictable," "atoms of nostalgia cling to ink, bone, and breath"), fitting the archival world. No head-hopping. However, register drifts toward abstract exposition in mid-passage ("memory is a story we tell ourselves," "purification by avoiding patterns had purified me") without POV-specific idiom anchoring those insights to the historian's lived experience in the vault.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("bronze prism pagoda," "light corridors thickened," "flower of metal"). Clarity holds in most beats. Yet paraphrase loops appear: "my curiosity was steadily unpredictable" / "the sort that either finds truth or burns a library down" restates risk without added detail. Template cadence: "I knew from fragments... But the instructions were missing, and my teachers had warned..." stacks clausal stems. Filter verbs ("I understood," "I felt," "I saw") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure third, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-as-palimpsest, nostalgia-as-material-property, and purification-via-irregularity is fresh and internally coherent. The pagoda's rotating prisms and the avoidance-of-pattern mechanic feel specific to this world. The council's weaponization of memory offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and conceptual density heightens stakes. Minor deduction: the late formula revelation (life/memory separation) introduces a concept not primed earlier, slightly reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The historian's choices drive key turns: stealing the key, descending, rotating the pagoda irregularly, copying the formula, and teaching in spirals. Present by paragraph one; active across three beats (descent, purification, teaching); shapes the closure directly. However, the teaching choice feels like a coda rather than a high-cost decision forced by prior escalation, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda is handled in multiple beats: the historian rotates it ("a quarter, then a seventh, then not at all"), observes light corridors, and watches it "open like a flower of metal." Present early, reappears with evolving function (description → purifier → revealer → container), and charges the closure by housing the formula. Specificity (bronze, prisms, twilight facets) and causal pressure (its mechanics shape the purification method) make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia are introduced early ("atoms... cling to ink, bone, and breath") and shape stakes: they make archivists weep, explain the Purge contagion, and motivate the purification. They appear in three beats (introduction, folio scent, council trap explanation). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than tactile; the historian does not manipulate or evade atoms directly, limiting causal pressure. The concept charges theme but does not narrow on-page tactical options as sharply as the pagoda's rotation does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is attributed to the historian's curiosity in paragraph one and echoed in the pagoda's light ("never repeating the same beam twice") and the final teaching method ("spirals and leaps"). Present early, linked to two beats (curiosity driving descent, purification method). However, it functions more as descriptive label than a trait that visibly constrains or enables a choice with cost. The avoidance-of-patterns action carries the causal weight; the attribute modifies rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Purification drives the central sequence: the historian descends to purify, rotates the pagoda to avoid patterns, witnesses the council's trap through purification, and copies the formula revealed by the purified archive. Present by paragraph two, active across four beats, and essential to closure (the teaching method extends purification's logic). Removing purification would collapse the plot. Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method "by avoiding patterns" is signaled early ("purification failed if done in a pattern"), demonstrated through the pagoda rotation ("a quarter, then a seventh, then not at all"), and paid off in the closure teaching ("spirals and leaps, so our new archive would hold knowledge without trapping us in nostalgia's bright cages"). Present in three beats, shapes the purification mechanics, and charges the final image with thematic cost. The method is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is introduced immediately, provides sensory texture (copper air, bronze door, violet windows), and houses the pagoda. Present early, active across the descent and return, and supplies the resource (Keth shelves, pagoda, formula slate) that shapes outcome. However, the archive does not pressure a choice: the historian moves freely without spatial obstacles or archive-imposed constraints. It functions as container rather than crucible, capping integration below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" frames the title and first line, and the historian reflects on a "younger self, still innocent" in the climax. Twilight and dawn mark elapsed time. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; the historian purifies at leisure. The phrase enriches theme (innocence lost through forbidden knowledge) but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Present in two moments (frame, reflection) without causal force, placing it in mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is dramatized early ("my real motivation"), drives the key-stealing and descent, and creates friction when the historian discovers the archives are traps ("I should have stopped, but..."). Present across three beats, the desire conflicts with inherited dread and the elders' warnings, generating cost in the tears and the veil-reading. The final teaching choice extends the motivation's logic. Felt cost and multi-beat involvement push this into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Anguished joy is named once ("I felt anguished joy because my people had inherited both the sickness and the cure") and implied in "my joy at nearing it hurt like a pulled tooth" and the weeping at the formula. Tone modulates from curiosity to dread to bittersweet revelation. However, the explicit labeling and single peak mention reduce its pervasiveness; the ending teaching leans resolute rather than tonally charged. Present in two beats, contributes to closure mood, but the label-dependence and limited modulation cap the score below 7.0.</comment>
