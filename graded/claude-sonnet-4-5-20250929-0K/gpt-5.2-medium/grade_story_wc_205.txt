<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Len's motivation is clearly established—he clings to the Diggers' dream to reimagine civilization beyond slogans—and the peak confession to Yara deepens his internal contradiction between his defunct revolutionary past and present curatorial impulse. Yara's backstory (lost sister to Len's revolution) adds relational friction and her desire for restoration versus his reimagining creates on-page tension. However, the final choice (devising a third act exhibition) feels more narrated than dramatized; the decision is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the scene. The renunciation of both Academy claim and Diggers' weapon is legible but arrives through summary rather than an embodied micro-choice with visible hesitation or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (Len on Palimpsest, visible time, museum quarter). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered description, the storm triggers mirror visions, and the final exhibition reweights the archaeological dispute by staging the map through visible time strata. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the exhibition projects the map with blurred borders, Len reads his poem naming factions as necessary fragments, and people leave "arguing differently"—a crystallization of new terms with conceptual cost (neither side wins). The cost is legible in the phrase "the vase becomes more honest when broken," which reconfigures the shard's meaning. One deduction: the transition from alcove discovery to devising the exhibition is compressed and slightly elided; the reader must infer the planning rather than see a moment where Len and Yara negotiate the risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful: gilded buttresses, iron craters, visible time pooling in corridors that can be "tripped over," and the Mirror Gallery with glass panels and carved cherubs all constrain the final choice. The method of covering mirrors is spatially grounded (velvet drops, reopening one mirror to view the alcove) and directly enables the climactic discovery of the star-routes map. The open crater plaza during the storm, with covered mirrors and projections through time strata, functions as the stage for closure. Micro-setting detail—Len carrying the shard in his pocket, the crystal vase on a table beside the map—charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong: visible time "striking the mirrors like thrown coins," the storm "scraping the asteroid's hull like a bow on tarnished brass." The setting does more than describe; it shapes Len's tactic and the exhibition's form.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is legible: control of the narrative around the buried court (Academy emblem vs. Diggers' reimagining). The dispute escalates when the storm reveals the alcove with the intact vase and star-routes map, forcing a choice between Yara's publication (imperial claim) and the Diggers hiding it (weaponization). Len's agency drives the resolution—he and Yara devise the third act exhibition—but the tightening arrives late and is compressed. The cost is conceptual (both factions lose certainty, the vase's ritual breaking is validated) rather than immediately visceral. One micro turn is present (covering the mirrors stops the branching futures, creating the hush for confession), but the final turn (staging the exhibition) is told in summary rather than shown as a difficult negotiation with visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shard's ritual breaking: "choosing many futures over one" rather than a single monument or weapon. The poem Len reads—"naming every faction as a necessary fragment"—delivers thematic closure without moralizing; it's an earned stance rooted in his failed revolution and Yara's loss. The final image of people "arguing differently" and "the civilization inside the shard begin to live" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning persists through contested plurality rather than imposed consensus. Subtext operates in the storm's violence mirroring factional conflict, and in Len's "burnished sorrow" softening into resolve. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution—both sides still argue—embracing complexity without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Len is stable and voice is consistent: "poet's habit of naming shadows," "burnished sorrow," perceptual signature evident in how he reads "a different cadence, a poem of exile" in the shard's cut edges. Dialogue between Len and Yara carries subtext (careful courtesy hiding grief) and advances plot (negotiating shard for seal). Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the storm and confession. One penalty: register occasionally drifts elevated ("baroque," "nave," "strata") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, though this could be Len's poetic idiom. Yara's brief interior moment ("surprised by the gentleness") is clean free indirect. No head-hopping, tense is stable, perceptual filter holds. The phrase "defunct relic of that failed fire" reads slightly over-written but stays within a poet's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: "visible time draped the void in thin, colored strata" establishes concept and sensory texture simultaneously. However, several sentences exhibit template cadence and figurative overload. "Len Orest, once a revolutionary who had tried to topple the old Consortium and now lived as a defunct relic of that failed fire, walked the museum quarter with a poet's habit of naming shadows" stacks three descriptive layers before the verb, slowing momentum. The phrase "the civilization both of them had never met" is syntactically awkward. Stock metaphors appear: "striking the mirrors like thrown coins," "like a bow on tarnished brass." Paraphrase loop in the confession exchange: Len's motive is stated, then Yara's counter-motive, then the collaborative solution—each a separate sentence restating what could compress. One clarity issue: "the old mistake would repeat" is vague; which mistake? Apply −0.6 for template stems and figurative density in non-peak beats, −0.3 for paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—visible time as archaeological medium, a baroque asteroid as palimpsest, and ritual shard-breaking as theme—is specific and non-obvious. The exhibition staged through time strata rather than static display is a fresh inflection. Len as defunct revolutionary turned curator avoids the stock "reluctant hero" template by embedding political failure and grief. The mirror-covering method (learned in prison to resist interrogation) and its repurposing for collaborative discovery adds earned backstory. One deduction: the "archaeological dispute splits scholars into warring salons" setup leans toward familiar academic-conflict tropes, and the resolution (both sides argue but differently) is conceptually strong but mechanically similar to many mediation narratives. The piece transforms through specificity of world and voice rather than premise alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Len (defunct revolutionary) drives key choices: he carries the shard as evidence/bait, joins the Diggers for their longing, covers mirrors during the storm (a method from his prison days), confesses his motive to Yara, and co-devises the exhibition. His revolutionary past shapes his tactics (mirror-covering, reimagining vs. weaponizing) and his final stance (naming factions as fragments). The character appears in setup, middle (confession and alcove discovery), and drives the closure (staging the exhibition, reading the poem). Cost is visible: his "burnished sorrow" softens into resolve, foreclosing both the Diggers' weapon path and passive curatorship. The element is signaled early, causally linked across beats, and indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in Len's pocket (setup), is debated as evidence/bait (middle pressure), examined for its cadence ("poem of exile"), and its ritual breaking is realized during the alcove vision. At closure, Len reads the shard's breaking as "choosing many futures over one," and the final image credits "the civilization inside the shard begin to live." The object is handled across three beats and its meaning reweights at the end. One gap: the shard is not physically present or manipulated during the final exhibition scene—it remains in Len's pocket while the projected map takes center stage—so closure linkage is thematic rather than tactile. Still, the element is indispensable to the thematic turn and causally tied to the dispute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (Academy restoration vs. Diggers' reimagining) is the dominant stake throughout. It frames Len and Yara's meeting, drives their negotiation (shard for seal), escalates when the storm reveals the star-routes map (proof of meeting ground, not outpost), and the final exhibition is explicitly designed to prevent either faction from claiming sole ownership. The dispute shapes tactics on every page: Yara's catalog argument, Len's exile reading, the choice to cover mirrors, and the decision to project the map with blurred borders. Removing this element would collapse the entire narrative arc. It passes all three gates (setup, middle pressure, closure linkage) with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Len's poetic inclination is signaled early ("poet's habit of naming shadows"), shown in his reading of the shard's "cadence, a poem of exile," and enacted at closure when he reads a poem naming factions as fragments. The trait constrains his method (he interprets artifacts lyrically rather than cataloging them) and enables the exhibition's form (poetic address rather than academic lecture). However, the trait functions more as voice coloring than a visible trade-off with cost. If "poetically inclined" were replaced with "philosophically inclined," the beats would remain largely unchanged. The element reaches mid-band for consistent presence and thematic fit, but does not drive a choice with felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in three contexts: Len devised a mirror-covering method in prison (backstory enabling middle tactic), he and Yara "devised a third act" exhibition (the resolution turn), and the overall framing of Len as someone trying to "devise" a reimagining of civilization. The final exhibition is the story's major turn, tracing directly to this action. Without the collaborative devising, the story defaults to either Academy claim or Diggers' weapon. The action is signaled mid-story (not setup) and drives closure, but the exhibition itself is told in summary rather than shown beat-by-beat, so the mechanics of devising remain slightly abstract. The element is essential but not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is introduced in the middle beat: Len "had devised a method for such nights from his days in prison" and covers the gallery mirrors with velvet drops, creating the hush that enables confession and the discovery via one reopened mirror. The method is then expanded at closure: "all mirrors in the district covered so no one could steal certainty from the branching visions." The mechanics matter—covered mirrors prevent factional claiming of singular futures—and the method is both enabled by backstory and enacted twice. However, the method is not signaled in setup (late first appearance) and the closure use is narrated rather than shown in action. Cap at mid-6s for strong middle and closure linkage but missing early signal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid (Palimpsest) supplies vivid details—gilded buttresses, iron craters, visible time pooling in corridors, the Mirror Gallery, the sealed alcove, the open crater plaza—that pressure choices throughout. The Mirror Gallery's storm-struck mirrors create the branching-futures problem that Len solves by covering them. The crater plaza becomes the stage for the exhibition, with "all mirrors in the district" integral to the tactic. Visible time as a physical phenomenon unique to this setting enables the projection method ("projected the map through layers of visible time itself, letting the strata blur its borders"). The setting is indispensable; no generic location could support the closure tactic. Strong setup, middle constraint, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After time became visible" is the story's opening frame and provides the conceptual ground: visible time as strata that can be tripped over, pooled in alcoves as preservative, and later projected to blur map borders. The timeframe enables the archaeological discovery (time preserved the vase and map) and the exhibition method. However, the element functions more as world rule than active pressure. There is no ticking clock or temporal constraint that tightens Len's decisions; "after" is a static backdrop rather than a dynamic force. The element is present in setup and closure and causally necessary for the projection tactic, but does not escalate or narrow options mid-story. Mid-band for conceptual necessity without beat-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Len's motivation—to reimagine an entire civilization—is stated explicitly in his confession to Yara and drives his joining the Diggers, his refusal to let the shard be cataloged or weaponized, and his co-design of the exhibition. The desire is dramatized through friction: Yara counters that "chaos had already stolen too much," and Len's realization that "the old mistake would repeat" if either side claims the map. The final exhibition enacts the reimagining by staging the map with blurred borders and naming factions as fragments. Cost is visible: Len foregoes both revolutionary vindication (Diggers' weapon) and curatorial safety (Academy catalog). The element is signaled early (implicit in his joining the Diggers), deepened mid-story (confession), and shapes closure. Strong integration with one minor gap: the motivation is more told than shown in contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is introduced mid-story when Len's "burnished sorrow for his failed uprising softened into resolve." The tone is coherent through the confession and discovery beats, modulating from grief (both characters mourning "the civilization both of them had never met") to collaborative determination. The final image—people arguing differently, Len feeling "the civilization inside the shard begin to live"—carries a muted hopefulness that evolves from sorrow without erasing it. However, "burnished sorrow" as a phrase is more poetic label than embodied texture; the story shows grief and resolve but does not consistently ground the specific burnished quality in sensory or syntactic rhythm. The tone charges the ending but is not pervasive enough or rhythmically distinct enough to reach high-band. Mid-6s for coherent modulation and thematic fit.</comment>
