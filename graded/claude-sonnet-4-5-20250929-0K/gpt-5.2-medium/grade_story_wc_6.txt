<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between familial legacy and redemptive purpose is clearly drawn, with embodied detail in moments like holding the coin and practicing "unyielding compassion." The rescue sequence demonstrates competence under pressure, but the field graft feels technically implausible (skin grafting under fire without anesthesia or sterile conditions) and the sister's one-scream acceptance strains credibility. The final choice to leave the coin at the lagoon is motivated by the copycat discovery, but the shift from fear to compassion happens too smoothly without visible internal friction. Minor backstory density (father's arson, mother's abandonment, burn scar) is anchored in present choices but occasionally tilts toward exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (coast, boardwalk, firefighter protagonist), and the piece moves from dispatch call through rescue to hospital to lagoon in a causal chain. The closure—leaving the coin as a message of compassion—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The copycat coin discovery is a micro-turn that reframes the protagonist's fear, yet the final act feels more symbolic gesture than decisive choice with stakes. The ellipsis from shack fire to "later at the burn unit" compresses key aftermath (e.g., how the sister was extracted, transport logistics) in ways that flatten escalation. Closure participates under an Accumulative/Situational lens but lacks the sharp tightening or visible price the 7+ band typically requires.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The volcanic beach, obsidian lagoon, kelp, and black sand are vivid and purposefully recurrent, with the sand used twice (judging wind/moisture, then as a jar gift) and the lagoon's calm contrasting the fire. Spatial choreography is mostly clean (boardwalk, dunes, shack, lagoon edge, burn unit), though the shack's exact position beneath the dunes is slightly vague. The black sand and kelp-drift peace charge the final image when the protagonist returns to the lagoon, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge closure. Minor slip: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" is poeticized to the point where physical plausibility (a lagoon beneath dunes, not behind or within) becomes unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can heal rather than condemn—is signaled early and tested in the rescue, but pressure plateaus after the extraction rather than tightening. The copycat coin discovery is a complication, not a true reversal driven by protagonist agency; it arrives via the investigator rather than her own choice. The field graft is a high-cost action, yet its aftermath (the girl's fear, the protagonist's counsel) is summarized rather than dramatized, losing escalation potential. The final act (leaving the coin) is a symbolic gesture of compassion but does not foreclose a live path or force a trade-off with visible consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (rescue → counsel → symbolic offering), satisfying the 600–800 word floor, but cost legibility at closure is oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—scars as song, compassion as answer to burning—emerges organically from the protagonist's history and profession, with the black sand metaphor ("each grain was a note") grounding the abstraction. The final image (coin left at the lagoon as a message) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing, meeting the 9+ quick test. The burn/healing motif accumulates purposefully (father's arson, protagonist's scar, girl's raw leg, graft as literal repair). One slip: the phrase "unyielding compassion" appears twice as a near-prompt echo, and the protagonist's explanation to the girl ("we answer burning with saving") borders on thematic statement rather than implication. Overall, theme is tightly braided with action and image, only occasionally foregrounding itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's trained attention to smoke, wind, tremors in voice). Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice carries occupational idiom ("dispatch," "engine," "packs and shovels," "trauma shears") without Wikipedia intrusion. Two slips reduce the score: (1) The phrase "gracefully alert in every gust" in paragraph two reads as external rather than self-perception, an elevated register the narrator would not naturally apply to herself mid-crisis. (2) Filter verbs ("I saw my father in his face," "I told her") are acceptable but cluster in the rescue sequence without voice-motivated purpose. The dialogue with the girl is brief and goal-driven, though her question "how a scar sings" is slightly too articulate for someone in acute pain. No head-hopping or tense drift; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and most lines advance story or character, but several artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "I dragged the boy out, then went back, because compassion is not a feeling that waits for permission" → "In the back room I found the sister…and as flames chewed the doorway I braced the beam" restates the rescue stakes without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" in the rescue sequence without purposeful effect. Stock metaphor: "flames chewed the doorway" and "kelp drifted in lazy ribbons" are serviceable but not fresh. The final paragraph's "we answer burning with saving" and "even the worst family fire can be grafted into light" edge toward thematic summary rather than image. Information density is generally high, and spatial choreography tracks, but scaffold phrases ("Later at the burn unit," "The next morning") compress key transitions flatly. These issues cluster but do not obscure closure; capping at mid-6s per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist's daughter becomes firefighter, confronts copycat using her family's charm—offers a specific synthesis of legacy, profession, and moral calculus. The field graft (skin-to-skin repair under fire) is a bold, visceral choice that elevates the rescue beyond standard heroics. The black sand as metaphor and the coin as both talisman and evidence show thoughtful layering. However, the core emotional arc (guilt → compassion, proving scars heal) follows a familiar redemption template without a sharp non-obvious turn. The copycat twist is clever but arrives via investigator rather than protagonist discovery, reducing its ingenuity. The kelp-drift peace and volcanic beach are evocative but not transformed; the lagoon functions more as backdrop than active agent. Risk-taking is present (the graft, the symbolic coin-leaving) but does not fundamentally subvert expectations. Solid mid-range originality; no proximity to famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is present throughout, makes key decisions (enter the shack, perform the graft, counsel the girl, leave the coin), and her choices drive the rescue and thematic closure. Early signal (paragraph 1–2), beats (dispatch response, rescue, hospital counsel, lagoon return), and closure linkage are all strong. Her professional skill and family legacy constrain tactics and charge the final image. Cost is visible in the physical risk and the symbolic renunciation (leaving the coin). High irreplaceability: her exact history (arsonist's daughter) makes the copycat coin discovery and her response inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: (1) scooped to judge wind/moisture at the lagoon, (2) described as shining after the rescue, (3) given in a jar to the girl as metaphor ("each grain was a note"). Early signal (paragraph 6), functional middle use (wind test), and thematic reprise in the hospital scene meet two gates. However, the sand does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it functions as sensory detail and symbol rather than causal agent. The jar gift is lyric resonance but not closure participation; the coin, not the sand, shapes the ending. Swappable with similar volcanic material (ash, obsidian chips) without structural loss. Cap at 6.4 for two-gate lyric use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unyielding compassion is stated twice (paragraph 4, final paragraph) and demonstrated in the protagonist's refusal to obey the radio order and her return for the sister. It shapes the rescue stakes and the final symbolic act (leaving the coin as a compassionate message). Early signal (paragraph 4), middle dramatization (rescue under fire), and closure linkage (the coin as compassion embodied) meet all three gates. However, the concept is label-heavy rather than implicit; the protagonist names it rather than letting action alone convey it. The phrase "unyielding compassion" reads as prompt echo, reducing specificity. Cost is tied to physical risk but the compassion itself does not create visible friction (e.g., a trade-off between saving one person vs. another). Functional across beats but not irreplaceable; "mercy," "duty," or "refusal to abandon" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Gracefully alert appears once in paragraph 2 ("gracefully alert in every gust, trained to read smoke and also the small tremors in a voice"). The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated; no on-page moment shows grace under pressure or alertness constraining/enabling a choice. The rescue sequence demonstrates competence and speed but does not hinge on this specific attribute. Missing middle development and closure participation; the trait does not reappear or shape the ending. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff or cost. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup + middle gates; further reduced for ornamental use and swappability with "vigilant" or "trained."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The field graft (skin from unburned thigh to cover exposed muscle) is the story's boldest action, viscerally unique and central to the rescue's stakes. Early signal (not by name, but medical competence is established), beats (the graft itself, aftermath in hospital, counsel to the girl about scars), and closure linkage (proving scars can heal) are all strong. The graft defines the rescue's cost and moral calculus: the protagonist inflicts pain to save, embodying the "unyielding compassion" theme. High irreplaceability: no standard first aid or extraction method would create the same visceral and thematic charge. Specificity and cost are both visible. Minor slip: the medical plausibility is strained (field grafting without anesthesia or sterile conditions), which slightly reduces credibility but does not break story logic within the established world.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coin appears in four beats: (1) introduced as the mother's gift and talisman (paragraph 3), (2) shown to the sister during rescue to calm her (paragraph 12), (3) found as copycat evidence by the investigator (paragraph 18), and (4) left at the lagoon as symbolic message (final paragraph). Early signal, middle use (calming tool), twist (evidence), and closure participation (the coin shapes the ending choice) meet all three gates. Mechanics matter: the drilled hole and red thread are described, and the burr-mark difference creates the investigator twist. The coin constrains the protagonist's fear (of inheriting her father's legacy) and enables the final compassionate gesture. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is conceptual (renouncing the protective charm) rather than physical, but the final image is charged by the coin's presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in five beats: (1) mentioned in dispatch context (paragraph 5), (2) described at arrival with kelp and mirrored clouds (paragraph 7), (3) contrasted with the shack fire (paragraph 13), (4) returned to at dusk for the final act (paragraphs 20–21). Early signal, middle atmosphere (the lagoon's calm pressures the protagonist's perception of the fire's violence), and closure linkage (the rescue post where the coin is tied) meet all three gates. The lagoon provides spatial coherence and thematic contrast (peace vs. burning) but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter the rescue. The "kelp-drift peace" tone charges the final image, pushing the lagoon's role slightly beyond postcard description. Swappable with another coastal feature (tide pool, inlet) without major structural loss, though the obsidian + volcanic + black sand cluster would be weakened.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Migration of clouds appears in the opening line and final paragraph but does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics. No clock is tracked; elapsed time from dispatch to lagoon return is vague. The phrase functions as atmospheric flourish and seasonal marker rather than temporal pressure. Missing middle development and any causal involvement. The timeframe does not shape the rescue, the investigator's arrival timing, or the protagonist's final choice. Ornamental use; cap at 4.6 for missing gates, further reduced for swappability with any seasonal or weather marker ("storm season," "drought," "fog"). Late reprise in the final paragraph does not reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove that scars can sing—is stated explicitly in paragraph 15 and demonstrated throughout: the protagonist's choice to become a firefighter despite her father's crime, the rescue that risks her own body, and the counsel to the girl about scars as rhythm rather than silence. Early signal (implicit in paragraphs 2–4, explicit in 15), middle dramatization (graft and rescue), and closure linkage (the coin as final proof that fire can be answered with light) meet all three gates. The motivation drives the protagonist's refusal to obey the radio and her return for the sister, creating visible cost (physical risk, disobedience). However, friction between want and cost is muted; the protagonist's compassion does not conflict with a competing desire (e.g., safety, reputation). The motivation is told more than shown in the hospital scene, where the protagonist explains rather than embodies the lesson. High beat involvement and closure linkage; reduced slightly for label-reliance and low internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kelp-drift peace appears in three beats: (1) paragraph 7 ("kelp drifted in lazy ribbons and the water mirrored the moving clouds"), (2) paragraph 13 ("the lagoon looked impossibly calm, kelp drifting"), and (3) implicit in the final lagoon return (paragraph 20, "kelp-drift peace softened the world"). The tone is coherent and contrasts purposefully with the fire's violence, modulating from initial observation to post-rescue wonder to final symbolic offering. Early signal, middle reprise, and closure linkage meet all three gates. The tone charges the final image by framing the protagonist's compassionate gesture within the lagoon's calm. However, the tone is static rather than evolving; "kelp-drift peace" does not deepen or twist under pressure, remaining a stable backdrop. Functional lyric reprise but not indispensable; a different calming image (tide, fog, dusk light) could substitute without breaking the closure. Score at 5.9 for three-gate lyric coherence with modest closure charge but low irreplaceability.</comment>
