<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is vivid and particular—the geode as both calibration tool and memorial, the embodied "unfiltered awakening" driving sensor-like perception. However, the decisive final choice ("I fed the pool into the guidance net, forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy") arrives without dramatized cost or visible obstacle overcome in the moment; the act reads more as wish-fulfillment than earned agency under pressure. Interiority is dense and voice-specific, but the climactic move lacks contradictory impulses or trade-offs that would show genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (floating observatory, ash sea, survivor narrator). The story follows a causal arc: overload → cooling breakers impose a twelve-minute window → protagonist uses geode and perturbation math to map a gradient of "unused potential" → feeds that data into the guidance net. Yet the closure—"forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy"—lacks on-page proof of cost or consequence; we see the action declared but not its price or immediate friction. The lens reads Causal, but the ending substitutes assertion for dramatized closure, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is more than backdrop: the cracked waveguide, manual thrusters, and twelve-minute battery window all constrain tactics and shape choices on the page. The geode functions as micro-setting (calibration reference, scattering microwaves in a known pattern) and recurs meaningfully at the gradient's edge, where it "rang faintly." Sensory detail (groaning balloon skin, hot portable screen, relays ticking "like teeth") is selective and tied to urgency. The ash-colored sea and bruise-like clouds underscore tone without halting momentum, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and seizing "unused potential" pooled in algorithmic pauses to cancel future strikes—is signaled early and guides every move. The twelve-minute window and manual thruster adjustments create tactical pressure, and the gradient hunt narrows options as the protagonist steers toward the pool's edge. However, the final act lacks a visible price or on-page resistance: "I fed the pool into the guidance net" reads as a button-press solution rather than a turn earned through sacrifice or irreversible trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (the overload trip revealing the signature), but closure cost remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core question—where does unused potential pool, and who controls it—emerges organically from the protagonist's history and drives every technical move. The geode shifts from wedding relic to calibration standard to quasi-mystical chime at the gradient's edge, reweighting memory with present utility. "Bleak exhilaration, like laughter in a morgue" captures moral complexity without sermonizing, and the final image ("forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy") reframes algorithmic choice as an ethical hinge. The story avoids explicit thesis statements, letting the wedding courtyard vision and the perturbation calculus carry thematic weight through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is dense, technical, and haunted—"intangibly tangible, like holding smoke that still weighs your palm"—with a perceptual signature (sensor metaphors, physics diction) that feels integral to the traumatized engineer narrator. POV remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is tight, filtering the observatory's machinery and the geode's facets through grief and precision. However, some phrases ("the agencies that built the drones later hired me for my refusal to look away") lean toward exposition that tells rather than showing the hiring through a dramatized beat, and occasional constructions ("letting the disturbance teach me") edge toward abstraction rather than lived perception under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances the technical hunt or deepens the backstory's pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during thruster burns, longer spirals during reflection). Yet the prose carries minor overwriting: "graduate ruins" is a strained metaphor, and some phrasing loops conceptually ("unused potential… the pauses between triggers… the same slack in reality") without adding new detail. The closure sentence is clear but slightly abstract ("forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy"), missing the concrete image that would crystallize cost. No major artifacts, but figurative density occasionally blurs immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike trauma, perturbation theory as both method and metaphor, and a floating observatory hunting algorithmic mercy is specific and non-obvious. The geode as calibration tool rather than mere symbol transforms a familiar motif, and the premise (mapping gradients of decision-potential in electromagnetic noise) feels original in execution. However, the final move—feeding the pool into the guidance net to "force" mercy—arrives without visible friction or cost, which blunts the ingenuity of the setup. The story commits fully to its premise and follows through with technical rigor, but the climax reads as wish-fulfillment rather than the inevitable-in-hindsight reversal that the rest of the architecture promises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The survivor character drives every beat: his "unfiltered awakening" shapes perception, his wedding loss motivates the hunt, and his final choice to feed the pool into the guidance net constitutes the story's climactic action. He is introduced immediately, his decisions (using the geode, steering thrusters, computing corrections) create tactical turns, and the closure depends entirely on his agency. The element is indispensable to logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The geode appears in the opening paragraph as wedding relic and recurs as calibration reference (set in the waveguide, pulsed with the coil) and sensory marker (rings faintly at the gradient's edge). It bridges memory and method, and its facets' known scattering pattern anchor the hunt when instruments fail. However, its role in the ending is implied rather than dramatized; the geode enables the discovery but does not visibly constrain or charge the final sentence. Present in setup, middle, and closure participation, but the payoff is understated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named explicitly ("a condition as much moral as neurological") and governs the narrator's hyper-perceptive interiority, shaping his ability to see "raw truth, unsoftened by hope." It motivates his hiring and his sensor-like reading of the gradient. However, it functions more as backstory trait than on-page constraint; no scene dramatizes a choice where filtering versus not-filtering creates a visible trade-off or cost. The concept colors voice and stakes but does not alter tactics in the main action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is articulated twice: first as abstract descriptor ("like holding smoke that still weighs your palm") and again when the protagonist lays hands on the wedding-courtyard vision's "hinge." The phrase adds lyric texture and thematic coherence, but it does not constrain a concrete choice or enable a distinct action with cost. It remains largely metaphorical, enriching voice without mechanical consequence. Setup and thematic reprise are present, but middle development and causal pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire plot: the protagonist hunts for the signature of unused potential, steers the observatory toward the gradient's steepest part, and uses manual thrusters and perturbation equations to map the pool. Every major turn—overload revealing the signature, crossing the pool's edge, seeing the courtyard vision—traces to this action. The final beat ("I began the hunt in earnest") explicitly frames the climax. The hunt is irreplaceable; swapping it would require a full rewrite of goals and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named early ("my compass now") and its mechanics appear on the page: the protagonist computes first- and second-order corrections, folds thruster perturbations into equations, and maps a gradient by comparing interference drift to the geode's baseline. The method shapes the hunt and enables the discovery. However, its presence in the closure is implicit—the final act of feeding the pool into the net does not show perturbation math at work in that moment. Setup and development are strong; closure linkage is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory supplies every tactical resource and constraint: the overload snaps breakers, the twelve-minute battery window creates urgency, the cracked waveguide requires the geode workaround, and manual thrusters let the protagonist steer toward the gradient. The setting is not postcard but workshop and perch, its machinery integral to method and stakes. The balloon's groaning skin and the portable screen running hot add embodied texture. The observatory's accidental drift "into" the pool triggers the discovery. Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The twelve-minute cooling window is announced ("I had twelve minutes before the backup batteries dipped and the balloon valves froze") and creates urgency for the initial geode work. However, once the breakers click their warning ("almost cool enough to reset"), the clock disappears; the hunt and final act occur without further time-pressure cues. The timeframe tightens the opening third but does not track or constrain the climax. Setup and partial development are present; closure participation is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The question "where does unused potential pool, and who controls it" is stated as the protagonist's obsessive driver and governs every choice: using the geode to map the field, steering toward the gradient, interpreting the signature. The motivation is tied to grief and moral imperative ("the same slack… that let a missile choose my bride could also be seized to cancel the next choice"), creating friction between discovery and intervention. The final act—feeding the pool into the guidance net—directly answers the motivation with visible agency. Desire is dramatized through action and reflection, and cost is implied though not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration, like laughter in a morgue" is named mid-story and captures the dual affect: grief-driven precision and the grim hope of intervention. The tone coheres across beats—technical rigor laced with trauma, the geode's wedding origin haunting the hunt—and modulates with pressure (the faint ring at the gradient's edge, the courtyard vision as "live branch"). The final sentence ("forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy") lands with bleak resolve. However, the closure could sharpen the exhilaration with a more visceral image; the current phrasing is declarative rather than charged. Tone is consistent and purposeful, but the ending does not fully crystallize the duality.</comment>
