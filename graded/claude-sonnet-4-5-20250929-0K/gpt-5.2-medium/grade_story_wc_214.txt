<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's internal landscape is concretely rendered through embodied grief and selective attention (the yellow glass, charcoal tracings). The progression from armored mourning to porous vulnerability is earned through the meteor-tracing ritual and the logbook discovery. Minor slip: the technicians' sudden appearance and shoulder-softening feels summary-gestural rather than individually dramatized. The final stance—standing within breaking—credibly forecloses the path of isolation with visible cost (reopening the dome, inviting others).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through repeated tracing acts, the logbook discovery, and the communal ritual. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final meteor fragments are marked and laughed at softly, reweighting vulnerability as nourishment rather than failure. Orientation anchors (Lio, station, first clear night) arrive within opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the converging meteor paths lead to the tunnel and the director's parallel grief. Cost is felt in the shift from solitary janitor to communal guide, and the station's "inhale" reconfigures stillness as active holding rather than neglect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The basalt ridge, decommissioned tunnel, and tracking dome constrain Lio's movements and choices. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, filtering perception and charging the final communal scene. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's priorities: dust on lenses, generators ticking like bones, green meteor flare. The collapsed tunnel's pumice and oilcloth logbook are tactile discoveries that alter present stance. The station itself acts as vessel-constraint, its "forgotten generators" and "old astronomers' practice" shaping the tracing ritual that drives closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding strength in vulnerability by letting grief breathe rather than armoring it. Escalation is textural: from solitary mopping to charcoal tracing to tunnel discovery to communal ritual. The converging meteor paths narrow options, forcing Lio to follow and uncover the director's parallel loss. Agency is clear: Lio chooses to reopen the dome and invite others, forecloses solitary endurance. The final meteor breaking apart is marked collectively, and their laughter is earned renunciation of the demand for wholeness. Visible cost: reopening the dome risks exposing his grief to others, a departure from the "cold corridors where nobody demanded he be healed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as vessel rather than weakness—emerges organically from the yellow glass ("even light needed a vessel, even strength needed a crack to enter"), the meteor-tracing ritual, and the director's logbook. The final image (marking fragments, soft laughter, "standing within its breaking") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the logbook's parallel loss and Lio's renaming of hurt as "a kind of cleaning." The station transforms from abandoned neglect to "flourishing stillness...alive as lichen." Minor note: "primal elegance" and "porous" risk thematic echo, but remain embodied in wrist steadiness and the body's "honest salute to loss."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Lio's perceptual signature: he notices dust, charcoal arcs, generators ticking. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts the way others bowed before saints"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the tracing ritual and the logbook discovery. Minor slip: "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, though they remain legible within the contemplative frame. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean. The prose texture reflects Lio's contemplative stance, with rhythm modulating from slow opening to compressed final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or thematic charge. Minor overwriting: "spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts the way others bowed before saints" and "flourishing stillness, the kind that grew when nothing insisted on being loud" carry slight metaphoric density in the opening third without pattern-teaching. A few near-loops: "not because the world was fixed, but because they had found a way to stand within its breaking" echoes prior vulnerability-as-strength phrasing. Clarity remains high; no major scaffolding or template cadence. Figurative language (light needing a vessel, tide of grief) is coherent and grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of meteor-tracing, grief ritual, and cosmic janitor is specific and non-obvious. The logbook discovery—another grieving founder using the same practice—reweights Lio's solitary act as part of a lineage rather than isolation. The yellow lantern glass as filtering lens is particular and organic. Risk: the extended opening anchors contemplative tone but delays concrete conflict; the payoff justifies the choice. Transformation test passed: the arc depends on this exact station, this practice, this glass. Minor proximity concern: "standing within its breaking" risks Zen-koan phrasing, though earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio appears in opening and drives all key beats: mopping in silence, tracing meteors, following convergent paths, reopening the dome, inviting technicians. His choices (to trace, to excavate, to invite) create turns. Observation of meteor convergence leads to decision to follow at dawn. The final choice to reopen and share the ritual forecloses solitary endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears in opening (rescued from beacon, held to eye), in the tracking scene (set over lamp to soften glare), and in the communal ritual (set "like a small sunrise"). It filters perception in beat one, enables the tracing work in beat two, and charges the final image. Reweighted meaning: from solitary comfort object to communal beacon. Slight cap: its mechanics (how it softens glare, why that matters for charcoal tracing) remain under-explained.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Flourishing stillness is named early and shapes Lio's choice to stay at the station. It reappears in the final paragraph ("flourishing stillness spread among them, alive as lichen") and charges the closure image. The concept constrains his preference for "cold corridors where nobody demanded he be healed." Middle involvement is thematic rather than tactical; it does not alter a specific mid-beat choice. Closure linkage is strong: the station "seemed to inhale, its silence no longer neglect but nourishment."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Spiritually curious is labeled in the opening ("spiritually curious enough to bow before meteor charts") and motivates the tracing practice. It enables the choice to follow meteor convergence and to interpret the logbook as invitation rather than coincidence. Trade-off: his curiosity keeps him at the isolated station rather than returning to the city. Slight cap: the trait is more enabler than constraint; no on-page moment where curiosity costs him a competing option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Empathize drives the core ritual: Lio traces meteors "to empathize, because he suspected each streak was a traveler burning up on purpose." The action structures the tracking scene, the discovery (converging paths indicate the tunnel), and the communal ending (he "empathized with the tremor in their hands"). Major turn: his empathic practice leads to the logbook and reframes vulnerability. The final group tracing is the action's culmination. Not easily swappable: the story hinges on empathic attention to meteor paths.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tracing meteor paths with charcoal on vellum is signaled as "a practice for calibrating trackers" in the setup, executed in the tracking dome scene (marks arcs, wrist steady), and shapes the discovery (converging tracks point to the tunnel). Mechanics matter: the vellum records reveal the hidden seam. The method is repeated in the communal ending, where each person traces and their "shoulders soften." It is causally indispensable: without the charcoal tracings, the tunnel remains hidden.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shooting star tracking station supplies the domes, consoles, telescopes, vellum, and antenna array. The collapsed service tunnel is station infrastructure that hides the logbook. The station's "forgotten generators ticking like bones" and "old astronomers' practice" pressure Lio's choices. Reopening the dome is the final action. The station functions as container and enabler; it does not block or force a specific tactic. Slightly under 8.5: the station is essential setting but does not materially constrain Lio's options—he could leave, could refuse to trace—so it trends high within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hush of an overlooked era is established in the opening and implies a period of low activity and institutional neglect. It motivates the station's emptiness and Lio's solitude. The "first clear night of winter" signals seasonal shift. Time does not tighten urgency: no countdown, no deadline pressure. The era is atmospheric but does not alter tactics. Mid-band: present and coherent, but it does not drive a turn or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To find strength in vulnerability is stated early ("He wanted to find strength in vulnerability, not by armoring his grief") and dramatized through the tracing ritual, the logbook's parallel loss, and the communal ending. Friction: Lio's desire to let grief breathe conflicts with city condolences and the pull to armor himself. Trade-off cost: staying at the station foregoes human connection until he chooses to reopen. The final stance—inviting others to trace—enacts the motivation with visible risk. Strong causal role in closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Primal elegance appears explicitly ("he felt a primal elegance in the way his body answered the sky without words") and coheres through the contemplative, elevated diction and rhythmic control. Tone modulates appropriately: quiet in the mopping, tightens during the meteor stream, softens at the communal ending. The final image ("they marked its brief fragments and laughed softly") sustains the tone. Slight cap for 8+: "primal elegance" risks thematic label-speak in a peak beat, and tone remains somewhat static—more a sustained mood than a charged shift.</comment>
