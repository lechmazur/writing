<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life shows purpose—"exchanging certainty for curiosity"—and her micro-choices (listening instead of answering, tapping the nickel four times) reveal a hierarchy of values. The nested awakenings, however, blur motivation: each loop resets agency rather than compounding it, so the final "I do not know yet" feels more like label than earned renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in the held breath and quiet laugh, but the recursive structure dilutes the felt cost of choosing uncertainty. The trait "methodically playful" is named but not dramatized as a constraint that forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture folding into a situational crystallization) and delivers a Charged Poise closure: Mara's "I do not know yet" reconfigures her stance toward certainty with the room staying "bright with possibilities." The cost is conceptual—foregoing the safety of a fixed answer—and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first third. The nested awakenings create meaningful layering but risk opacity: the second "woke again" loop ("holding a brush already wet") does not clearly narrow options on the page, reading more as atmospheric recursion than causal tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden (sine hedges, tuned stones, comma pools) is vivid and functionally integrated: the reflected echo guides Mara's strokes, and the coin-in-pool splash returns her name as a question. The garden constrains her approach (she steps between stones to find the long echo) and charges the final image with bright possibility. Spatial choreography remains clear across the amphitheater, garden, and wall. The hobo nickel as micro-setting also qualifies: its fit into the pinhole and tapped response drive pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to cling to certainty or trust curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through the nested loops: each awakening tests Mara's willingness to let answers dissolve. Her agency crystallizes in the renunciation of mid-stroke certainty (stopping to listen) and the final reply, which forecloses the path of declarative knowing. The cost is felt as vulnerability: saying "I do not know yet" leaves her exposed to Tomas's judgment. One meaningful deepening (the realization that "the wall was not resisting; it was testing") narrows her tactics and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—trading certainty for curiosity, embracing the pause as a room of possibilities—emerges organically from Mara's actions (listening for silence, letting solvent soften only the false) and the garden's acoustic metaphor. The final image offers a non-literal answer: uncertainty as method, not failure. The nested awakenings and the mirror-eyed singers create resonance without spelling out a moral. The line "what if the last layer is you?" risks abstraction but lands as a precise joke the world tells when it trusts, and the ending resists tidy resolution while leaving thematic charge intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the awakenings, slightly wider when describing the garden). The perceptual signature—noticing echoes as maps, timing brushstrokes to sound—is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Tomas's question frames the story, and Mara's final reply drives closure. The prose carries distinct texture ("the world tells when it trusts you"), though under peak pressure (the nested loops) some sentences drift toward elevated register ("dolls of attention") that tests the restorer's lexicon. No head-hopping; the elision of Tomas's interiority is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or concept), and rhythm varies purposefully. The nested structure creates intentional recursion, not loop: each awakening reweights prior beats. However, figurative language clusters heavily in the second half ("echo folded," "dolls of attention," "rooms" in the pause) without consistent pattern-teaching, and some phrases verge on opacity ("bewitching the mural" is named but its mechanics remain atmospheric). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Grammar and sequencing are clean, but the density of metaphor in peak beats (the third awakening onward) occasionally blurs propulsion rather than sharpening it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of restoration craft, acoustic reflection, and nested consciousness is specific and non-obvious; the hobo nickel carved with "an ear and a ripple" is a fresh detail that earns its symbolic weight. The nested awakenings transform a familiar "was it real?" trope into a purposeful test of epistemic humility. The sound wave garden and the unpainted-mirror eyes offer memorable images that grow from prior particulars. Risk is present (the recursive structure could have collapsed into gimmick) and pays off in the earned final stance, though the piece does not radically subvert genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's choices (listening for silence, stopping mid-stroke, tapping the nickel four times, saying "I do not know yet") create the key turns. Setup clear, middle beats involve her observation and micro-decisions, closure hinges on her reply. The nested loops dilute agency somewhat—each awakening resets rather than compounds—but the final choice forecloses the path of certainty with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in three distinct beats: (1) described as a charm in her pocket, (2) pressed over the pinhole circle with a tapped echo that answers, (3) flicked into the comma pool producing the whisper of her name, (4) placed back and tapped four times to soften the false layer. Its carved ear and ripple are irreplaceable (the fit "as if the coin had been cut from that wall"), and it drives the acoustic discovery that charges the middle and ending. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nested awakenings structure the entire middle: Mara wakes standing in the garden, then wakes again holding the brush, then sees herself waking "smaller each time, like dolls of attention." The concept is not merely thematic—it alters her tactics (she realizes the pause has rooms, tests whether she will cling to being right) and shapes the closure (the smallest awakening allows her final reply). Indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is named early ("she liked her work the way a child likes puzzles") and echoed in her counting echoes and stepping between stones, but the tradeoff between method and play is not dramatized as a constraint that costs her. The trait informs her approach but does not narrow options or force a visible sacrifice. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears twice: "in that fold she felt herself bewitching the mural" and "letting the reflected sound bewitch her hands." The word names the turning point (color seeping through, singers' mouths opening) but the mechanics remain atmospheric—sound affects perception and solvent action, but the exact link is poetic rather than causal. The element enables the major turn but could be paraphrased (e.g., "transforming," "unlocking") with minor edits. Mid-high range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled early (garden echoes return in clean loops matching cracks), shapes middle tactics (timing brushstrokes to echo, stepping to find the long reflection), and charges the closure (the splash rings as a bell, whisper returns as question). The method is irreplaceable: removing acoustic reflection would break the story's logic. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden supplies the resources (hedges, stones, comma pool) that Mara uses to solve the wall's resistance. Its curved hedges return echoes that match cracks; stepping between tuned stones locates the reflection point; the comma pool produces the whispered question. The garden is not postcard description—it actively pressures and enables her choices, and its design (sine curves, tuned stones) is irreplaceable. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pause between Tomas's question and Mara's reply frames the entire story: the nested awakenings occur within that pause ("the awakening had nested inside the pause, as if the pause had rooms"), and her decision to stop mid-stroke and listen happens "at the smallest awakening, no bigger than the pause itself." Time is not vague—it is a conceptual container that tightens her decision and charges the ending ("the room stayed bright with possibilities as his reply began"). The timeframe is indispensable to the story's closure and logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is named early ("she had begun to practice") and dramatized through friction: her methodical habits pull toward declaring removal of the layer, but the nested tests push her to dissolve each answer and look deeper. The final "I do not know yet" enacts the exchange with visible cost (foregoing professional certainty). The desire shapes two key beats (stopping mid-stroke, the final reply) and connects to closure. Strong causal role.</comment>
