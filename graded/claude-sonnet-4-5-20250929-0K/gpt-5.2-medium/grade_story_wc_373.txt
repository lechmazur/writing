<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her steadfastness reading as "habit" rather than courage, the watch-fob trick learned from her father's engine diagnostics. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "comforting unease" and her plan "settling into place" amid danger. The embodied emotions (swallowing frustration, ribs tightening, crawling on her belly) avoid label-speak. Minor slip: her father's moonshine-running backstory and the broader cast (Strake, Lorne, quartermaster) receive minimal pressure-testing on the page, leaving secondary relationships more functional than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (pirate market, Mara, her goal). The closure—Mara triggering chaos, planting the fob, and securing her father's safety—lands on the page with visible cost (blood on the boards, staying hidden until sunrise). The three failed attempts create escalation, but the final reversal (knocking over tin cups to expose Lorne) feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; the quartermaster's loyalty is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is legible but the convenience dent prevents higher reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier with tar-sweating pilings, lantern-light, brine-soaked splinters, and mussel shells grounds the action throughout. The watch fob's wax is ruined by brine, then warmed between fingers—micro-setting details that constrain Mara's tactics. The fishmonger's scale pan becomes the delivery mechanism at closure. Spatial choreography (barrel, pilings, chain, skiff, ladder) tracks cleanly. The setting's sensory density (tide licking nails, crab dragging the fob, gulls at sunrise) reflects Mara's focused urgency and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing proof to thwart the Strake-Lorne deal—is signaled early and tightens through three failed attempts that narrow Mara's options (wax ruined, drunk rigger, groaning pier). The final tightening (knocking over cups to expose Lorne) escalates pressure and forces a choice with visible cost (blood, hiding until dawn). However, the resolution relies on luck (the quartermaster's loyalty, the chaos allowing her to plant the fob unnoticed) rather than a fully earned reversal driven by Mara's prior choices. Coincidence complicates but also solves, preventing 8+ reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—trust's fragility and the cost of survival in a hushed, lawless economy—emerges through concrete particulars: the truce of hush, Strake's ring-tap rhythm spelling certainty, Lorne's "quiet oath that turned friendly into final." The watch fob as inherited tool embodies intergenerational pragmatism. The ending image (tide rinsing blood, Mara retrieving the fob, "knowing the captured break would keep her father alive for another night") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "comforting unease" as a phrase occasionally edges toward thematic announcement rather than full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is character-specific (she notices engine-knock analogies, the drunk rigger's flirtation as opportunity, Strake's ring-tap as signal). Diction modulates with pressure: syntax compresses during the crawl among mussel shells, then expands at sunrise. The prose carries a distinct rhythmic texture ("lips moving but voices swallowed," "letting the tide rinse blood from the boards"). No head-hopping. Elision of the quartermaster's loyalty feels purposeful but borders on withholding for suspense. Strong control with minimal slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and syntactic variety. Information density is high (most lines advance character, goal, or atmosphere). Minor template cadence in the false-starts section: "Her first false start… Second false start… Near midnight she found…" reads slightly mechanical. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The figurative language ("lanterns rocked like tired fireflies," "thunder through a bedpost") is coherent and voice-consistent. Closure image is clear. Deduction for the template cadence in the middle third prevents 8+ reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination—antique wax-impression tech, pirate market's truce of hush, moonshine runner's daughter—feels specific and non-obvious. The false-starts structure and sensory espionage (vibrations through wood into wax) transform familiar underworld-deal material. The final turn (knocking over cups to violate the truce) grows organically from the established constraint. Minor deduction: the "pirate market beneath a pier" and "corrupt sheriff trading routes" elements draw on familiar genre templates, though the wax-fob mechanic and the hush constraint provide fresh inflection. Risk-taking in pacing and sensory detail elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all key turns: resetting wax after the crab incident, pressing the fob to the chain, knocking over cups to expose Lorne, and planting the fob in the scale pan. Her agency shapes the closure directly. Setup early, development across three failed attempts, and payoff at the ending satisfy all three gates. Causal pressure is strong and cost (hiding until sunrise, blood on boards) is legible. High score warranted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in setup (inherited tool, wax mechanism explained), development (three distinct failed attempts with wax ruined and reset), and payoff (planted in scale pan to deliver proof). Its unique properties—wax capturing vibrations—matter causally; no generic recorder would fit the pier's constraints. Beats: crab-dragging-into-puddle, warming-wax-between-fingers, pressing-to-chain, planting-in-scale. Irreplaceable and closure-linked. Indispensable territory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The truce of hush shapes tactics throughout: Mara cannot shout warning, must rely on non-verbal cues (hands, glances, coin clinks), and the final turn (knocking over cups to violate the truce) depends on the constraint. Setup in opening paragraph, development across the espionage attempts, and payoff when she breaks the hush to expose Lorne. The concept narrows options and enables the climax. Strong integration across all three gates and causal pressure elevate this well into the 6+ range, approaching 7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is labeled early and referenced twice ("her steadfastness felt less like bravery and more like habit"; "letting the market's lanterns rock" as she resets). It enables her persistence through false starts with visible cost (crawling on her belly, staying hidden until sunrise). Setup and development present; closure linkage is oblique (the trait allows her to wait out the violence). Functional but not indispensable—another trait (patience, resolve) could serve with minor edits. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the story's spine: Mara's goal is to thwart the Strake-Lorne bargain, and all major turns trace to this action—setting the fob, the false starts, knocking over cups, planting proof. The thwarting succeeds on the page when "the bargain died without a word" and Lorne flees. Setup, development, and payoff all hinge on this exact action. Cost is visible (blood, hiding). Removing "thwart" collapses the plot. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>False starts structure the entire middle: crab drags fob into puddle, drunk rigger interrupts, pier groans and fob skitters loose. The method is signaled early ("Her first false start…"), shapes three distinct attempts with escalating difficulty, and charges the final success with earned weight. Each failure forces Mara to adapt tactics (warming wax, changing angle, pressing to chain). The method is irreplaceable—without it, the stakes and closure lack accumulation. High integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier supplies the truce of hush (the central constraint), the physical obstacles (pilings, brine, mussel shells) that ruin Mara's attempts, and the scale pan that becomes the delivery mechanism. Setup immediate, development across all beats (spatial choreography: barrel, chain, skiff, ladder), and payoff (scale pan, blood rinsing from boards). The setting pressures choices and alters tactics throughout. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled early ("before dawn"), tracked at intervals ("Near midnight," "until sunrise"), and shapes the final image ("when the first gull cried she retrieved the fob"). The clock tightens urgency but does not visibly alter mid-scene tactics; Mara's moves are driven more by spatial obstacles than elapsed time. Setup, mild development, and payoff present. The constraint is functional but not indispensable—removing precise time would not collapse causality. Solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is dramatized through the watch-fob mechanic, the three failed attempts, and the final success when she traps "route names, dates, and Lorne's soft laugh of agreement." The desire conflicts with cost (crawling among splinters, staying hidden until sunrise). Setup early, development across espionage beats, and payoff when "the captured break would keep her father alive." The motivation drives choices and closure directly. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone—comforting unease—is coherent: "comforting unease of her plan settling into place" explicit; the hush creates ambient dread while Mara's methodical patience anchors calm. The tone modulates with pressure (sensory compression during the crawl, lyric expansion at sunrise). The final image ("letting the tide rinse blood") charges the tone with cost. Setup, development, and payoff present. The phrase "comforting unease" occasionally reads as label rather than fully embodied texture, preventing higher reach. Strong mid-to-upper band.</comment>
