<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marin's empathetic trait is consistently embodied through his listening and breath control, and his choice to guide Lysa rather than reject her shows agency under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he "hid behind the folio shelf, not from cowardice but from kindness," though the moment reads more as authorial interpretation than dramatized conflict. The backstory about his sister's death arrives late (~40% mark) and feels imposed to explain rather than complicate present choices. Lysa's panic is told more than shown, reducing the relational pressure that might elevate the final offer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens: Marin's empathetic observation of Lysa's error, their joint discovery of the cipher test, and the Archivist's acceptance create a coherent pressure arc. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marin writes "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy," reweighting his solitude with visible cost—he remains alone but steadied, having offered sanctuary without curing his own isolation. The orientation is clear by the second paragraph, and the invitation's flawed address becomes a nested paradox that pays off when the Archivist sees the torn halves reunited. One meaningful deepening occurs when fear and care are shown as "both impulses belonged to the same loyal hand."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret library constrains Marin's choice to reveal himself and charges the closure: the hinged panel and the stacks labeled "Silence Speaks" and "Departure Returns" ground the nested-paradox premise in tactile space. The folio shelf enables his hide-then-reveal tactic, and the reading desk becomes the site where mistake is reframed. Lamplight "pooled like honey" and the scratch of shoes anchor sensory perception without catalog excess. The museum above and the library below create a micro-setting that enforces the "staying while leaving" duality, though the city outside remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Lysa's mistake will be punished or reframed—is signaled early and tightens when Marin places the torn invitation halves together, a concrete act that forecloses accusation and opens acceptance. The Archivist's arrival escalates pressure, and Marin's non-argument response (showing the seam) narrows options with visible cost: he risks the Society's secrecy to extend mercy. The final note to himself, "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy," reconfigures the opening stake (unearth wisdom in a mistake) and closes with felt cost—solitude steadied but not cured. One micro turn (Lysa's accidental test-passing) deepens the premise without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—errors as lanterns—emerges organically from the invitation's wrong address, the cipher test, and the Archivist's acceptance of the torn seam. The final note, "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy," reweights prior material without moralizing: Marin's solitude persists as cost, not cure. The library's creed of "nestled paradoxes" structures the world and choice logic, and the aisle labels ("Silence Speaks," "Departure Returns") echo the theme through concrete setting rather than assertion. The piece resists tidy redemption; Marin offers sanctuary but remains "steadied by" rather than freed from his seclusion, and the closing image charges ambiguity without resolving it into simple wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marin as focalizer throughout, and the narration filters sensory detail through his empathetic lens ("a cough sound like a confession"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately when he "could map the stranger's panic." However, elevated diction—"enlarge tranquility," "Index of Unfinished Things," "nested paradoxes"—drifts into a formal register that clashes with the intimacy of his grief and solitude, especially in the opening and closing. Lysa's single line of dialogue ("she had tried to deliver it… and now the others would think she had betrayed them") reads as summary rather than natural speech. The perceptual signature (breath, listening, mapping emotion) is consistent, but the prose occasionally prioritizes concept over embodied voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, and the piece moves without stalling. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he found a crumpled invitation shoved under his door, the paper creased as if someone had tried to hide it" repeats the idea of concealment, and "the Index of Unfinished Things, yet the address was simply 'Gallery Three, open hours,' a mistake so obvious" restates the error without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through several paragraphs: "He had chosen… The invitation's wrong… Marin hid… A young docent… His empathy…" with identical [Subject] [past verb] openings. Figurative language clusters in the opening ("empathy… like a confession," "lamplight pooled like honey") without clear payoff at closure. The final note avoids these patterns and lands cleanly, but earlier beats accumulate −0.8 in non-closure artifact debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The nested-paradox premise (a secret library where mistakes are reframed) offers a fresh angle, and the invitation's wrong address as accidental test is a non-obvious turn. The specific detail of the hinged panel in the wall label rack and the aisle labels ("Silence Speaks") ground the concept in particulars. However, the compassionate-recluse-librarian and the young frightened initiate are familiar archetypes, and the arc—mistake leads to acceptance—follows a predictable emotional template. The Archivist's immediate validation and Lysa's ready recruitment soften stakes rather than heighten them, and the story's moral calculus (mercy over punishment) resolves without meaningful resistance or cost that would transform the trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marin's recluse status frames his empathetic observation, drives his decision to hide then reveal himself to Lysa, and shapes his offer of sanctuary at closure. His choice to guide rather than expose her alters the arc, and the final note reweights his solitude as steadied cost. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The invitation is introduced early, its crumpled state signals concealment, and Lysa's torn corner and Marin's half reunite at the climax to demonstrate "fear… and care… belonged to the same loyal hand," enabling the Archivist's acceptance. However, the object does not constrain middle choices; it is handled twice (discovery, reunion) but does not evolve tactically between beats. Strong setup and closure participation, weaker middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nestled paradoxes structure the library's creed, the invitation's wrong-address test, and Marin's "staying while leaving" duality. The concept drives the Archivist's acceptance (seeing fear and care in one hand) and charges the final image (solitude as cost and steadying). The aisle labels embody the concept in setting, and the premise that "errors could contain their own lanterns" shapes tactics on the page. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marin's empathy is demonstrated when he listens to map Lysa's panic and steps out slowly "so his presence would land gently," but the trait does not impose visible cost or constraint; it enables kindness without friction. The opening describes "enlarged tranquility" and "breathing slow" as coping mechanisms, yet these are not tested under pressure. The attribute is present and consistent but does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Marin hides behind the folio shelf "not from cowardice but from kindness" and uses the pause to map Lysa's fear before revealing himself. The action enables one beat (the gentle reveal) but is easily swappable—he could simply have waited or observed from another vantage. It does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain later choices. Functional middle use, no closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" is introduced early as Marin's "true self crossed into the Society's stacks" while his clerk identity remains in the museum. The duality returns when he "chose to stay in the library as himself while leaving the world his name belonged to," directly shaping his offer to Lysa and the Archivist scene. The method is signaled, demonstrated, and charged at closure as the paradox that lets him reconcile solitude with connection. Present across all three gates with strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library hidden behind the hinged panel supplies the space where the central action unfolds, the folio shelf enables Marin's hiding tactic, and the aisle labels ("Silence Speaks," "Departure Returns") embody the nested-paradox premise. The setting constrains access (Lysa's mangled directions signal she does not know the panel exists) and charges closure (the Archivist arrives at the central table). The library's dual nature (ordinary museum / secret Society) mirrors the staying-while-leaving method and shapes the final offer. Strong setup, tactical middle use, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "within arm's reach of midnight" anchors the opening, and "the Society's bell began its midnight toll" marks the Archivist's arrival, but the clock does not tighten decisions or tactics between those points. The passage from discovery to resolution feels untimed, and no action is accelerated or foreclosed by the approaching hour. Setup and minor closure marker present; no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marin's desire to "unearth wisdom in a mistake" drives his decision to follow the flawed invitation and guides his choice to reframe Lysa's error rather than report it. The motivation is dramatized when he tells her "a mistake is only a door if you push it" and shapes the final note. However, the motivation does not face meaningful friction—no competing impulse (safety, protocol) tests his commitment. Present across gates with moderate causal pressure but minimal cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Enlarged tranquility" is described in the opening ("breathing slow until other people's urgencies softened") and modulates when Marin hides then reveals himself with deliberate gentleness. The tone supports the empathetic lens and the library's paradoxical calm, but it does not shift under peak pressure (the Archivist's arrival) or charge the final image, which maintains the same reflective register. Coherent and stable, but static rather than dynamically responsive to turns.</comment>
