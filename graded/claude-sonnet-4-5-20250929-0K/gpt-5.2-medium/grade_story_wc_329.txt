<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is dramatized through micro-choices: hiding his bow, using the locust shell, matching his pulse to the tree's rhythm. Internal contradictions register when "his violin hand shake[s] with the same anger that once made his father trade songs for factory wages"—personal wound driving choice. The final decision to lead the tree into the city with violin raised crystallizes his values with visible cost (statue seizure, struggle). Minor: the statues' transformation at closure lacks sufficient on-page causality; their "faces softened by pear-scented dust" feels asserted rather than earned by prior contradictory impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens reads Causal with Accumulative texturing: Lio's rhythmic signaling → statues pause → tree uproots → struggle → dawn procession. Orientation anchors quickly (sky-bridge, Gearford, orchard edge). The closure—tree walking toward the city, statues following—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options reweighted, the orchard "stood open," cost visible in the struggle and the tree's chains cracked. One meaningful tightening when the tree's roots wrap the statues' ankles. Cost proof: "the tree's roots wrapped their ankles, pulling the patrol line into the soil." Slight fuzziness in how the statues shift allegiance so quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard's sap-over-coal smell, bolted tree with PROPERTY tags, and statue joints that "rasped like gears in sand" are sensory and purposeful. The locust shell in bark notch and chains quivering "like guilty teeth" constrain Lio's method. Spatial choreography is clear: gate → trees → center → trunk. The final image—tree walking, statues following—charges the space with transformed meaning. No reach for 9+ band because setting supplies resources but doesn't decisively narrow a live choice beyond enabling the method already planned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. mechanical control—signals early and tightens when Lio finds the tree chained. One meaningful escalation: matching pulse to tree → amplified drone → tree uproots → struggle with statues. Agency is clear: Lio's knocking patterns and heartbeat trigger the tree's response. Cost is legible: "Stone hands seized Lio, yet the statues could not hold both him and the moving trunk." The price of confrontation alters the final image—statues now follow rather than police. Minor: the statues' shift from antagonist to follower reads swift; a beat showing their internal friction would have sharpened the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—reshaping the world "rhythm by rhythm, until even stone learned to sway"—emerges from enacted beats: heart rhythms, tree's pulse, statues' stuttered steps. The PROPERTY tags and Lio's father trading "songs for factory wages" anchor the thematic question in concrete cost. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tree walks toward the city, beauty no longer fenced, statues transformed into "a new kind of guard." No overt moral; the image reweights prior material. Slight: "breaking free was not a leap away from the world, but a reshaping of it" borders on authorial summary, though grounded in the struggle just enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lio; perceptual signature is distinct ("notes came out resonantly soft, as if velvet could file metal without sparks"). Diction remains consistent: "tarnished wonder," "guilty teeth," "hesitant, human stutter." No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("Lio felt his violin hand shake"). Rhythmic control evident in longer constructions that breathe with scene momentum. No dialogue to assess. Minor: "in the gap between knowing and understanding, when fear has a name but not yet a weight" reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, a brief register lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene needs. High information density: "sap overlaid by coal," "eroded into polite expressions," "roots chained like a prisoner." No paraphrase loops. The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges motifs (violin, tree, statues). Minor artifacts: "the city listened best when it could not quite reach him" and "breaking free was not a leap away from the world, but a reshaping of it" edge toward scaffold-phrasing—neat epigrams that slightly externalize the POV. Filter-verb count is low. Propulsion is strong, but two moments of near-summary ("he understood what he had only known") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Core synthesis—violinist using pulse-signaling via locust shell to free a chained tree guarded by living statues—is specific and non-obvious. The orchard as cataloged beauty ("PROPERTY" tags) and the father's factory-wage backstory ground the stakes in lived detail. The final image (tree walking, statues following) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: the statues' transformation and the tree's agency stretch credibility but remain coherent within the mechanical-world frame. Slight proximity to steampunk tropes (clockwork trams, riveted poles); transformation through Lio's particular method and the father-wound anchor prevents derivative feel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio's choices drive all major turns: hiding bow, using locust shell, matching pulse, knocking patterns, leading the tree with violin raised. Present from the opening beat, shapes middle development (pulse-matching, knocking), and decisively active at closure. Irreplaceable: no other character could provide this causal chain. Visible cost tied to his actions (seized by statues, struggle).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Locust shell introduced early (window ledge find), used twice on the page: pressed to throat at gate, set in bark notch at tree center. Its "tiny vibrations" enable the pulse-signaling method and amplify contact into the drone that triggers the tree. Shapes two beats and contributes to closure. Cap at sub-8.5 because the shell's reappearance in the final image is absent—no charged reprise or reweighted meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes stakes from the opening motive and alters tactics: Lio must free the tree, not just play near it. The uprooting act and the struggle enact the concept on the page. The realization—"breaking free was not a leap away from the world, but a reshaping of it"—makes the concept explicit and reweights it. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure). Slight: the articulation is slightly summary-flavored, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" describes Lio's violin tone in the opening and the drone from the locust shell ("resonantly soft drone"). Frames the sensory signature and enables the tree's response. Present in setup and middle development. Cap below 7.0 because it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it characterizes sound but doesn't impose a tradeoff or limit. Swappable with similar acoustic descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The uprooting is the story's major turn: tree reacts → sap surges → crack → iron cradle dragged apart → roots wrap statues. Directly shapes the climax struggle and the dawn procession. Impossible to swap; the entire closure depends on this exact action. Visible cost: Lio seized, statues pulled into soil. Present in middle and closure with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Heart-rhythm signaling seeded early (mechanic's advice, Lio's practice of listening "to heartbeats through wood"), dramatized at the gate (tapping shell in pulse time), and again at tree center (matching pulse to tree's throb). Shapes two beats and enables the uprooting. Mechanics matter: statues pause, steps fall out of sync, drone travels down chains. Specificity high; method is irreplaceable. Minor: could signal even earlier for full 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard pressures every choice: statues bar entry, chained tree at center supplies the object of rescue, roots wrap statues' ankles in the struggle. Setting introduced early, structures the middle (gate, trees, center), and active at closure (orchard "stood open"). The PROPERTY tags and iron cradle are physical constraints that Lio must overcome. High irreplaceability; the orchard's dual nature (beauty + cataloging) is the story's central tension.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In the gap between knowing and understanding, when fear has a name but not yet a weight" is signaled at the moment Lio decides to go. It frames his psychological state and subtly tightens the decision (he acts before fear calcifies). Lyric reprise quality: early → thematic charge. But it does not track time or constrain mid-scene tactics. Cap in mid-5s because the timeframe is metaphorical, not a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized in the opening ("to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world") and tested when Lio sees the chained tree and "felt his violin hand shake with the same anger that once made his father trade songs for factory wages." Drives the choice to free the tree and the final procession toward the city. Friction between desire (beauty) and cost (struggle, seizure) is visible. Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone coheres from the opening ("velvet could file metal without sparks") through "sap overlaid by coal, a kind of tarnished wonder" and the statues' "eroded…polite expressions." Modulates with pressure: wonder dims when Lio sees PROPERTY tags, lifts at closure with "pear-scented dust" softening statues' faces. Charges the final image: the tree walking, beauty no longer pristine but moving forward. Strong throughout; minor: one or two moments edge toward over-articulation.</comment>
