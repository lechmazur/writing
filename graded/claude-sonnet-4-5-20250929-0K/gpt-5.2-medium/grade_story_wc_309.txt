<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Davin's motivation is embodied through concrete choices (unstrapping the harness, mist walking, arranging frost-petals) that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. His interiority—"failures, softened by vapor, no longer felt like proof of worthlessness"—is specific and avoids therapy-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the keystone in place) forecloses a path with visible cost and reads as earned. Minor weaknesses: the automaton's threat remains abstract, reducing the felt weight of Davin's refusal, and some introspective passages ("the sacred had been misfiled into a ledger") edge toward label-only claims.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and recurring luminance imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Davin leaves the keystone and walks past the automaton. Orientation anchors (Davin, spire, dusk departure) land clearly within the first 120 words. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—his gesture "outlast[s] the automated age"—and the lens holds. One deduction: the automaton's mid-climb appearance introduces a causal fork (the machine "offer[s] to generate a prayer") that deflates immediately without material consequence, creating a brief pressure wobble before the terrace payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire and terrace garden constrain Davin's path and charge the final image: "frozen roses shaped from hoarfrost," the "plain limestone with a thumbprint of quartz," and the folly's silence when the automaton enters all pressure the closure choice. The spire's "accommodated impossibilities" (stairs that "argue with geometry") function as micro-setting that alters tactics (Davin stops trying to understand and lets the spire carry him). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Davin's priorities—"silver dark where lanterns became halos"—and the folly's "low, brilliant dimness" anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding sacred meaning beyond automation) is signaled early and tightens once: unstrapping the harness mid-climb is a visible forfeit that narrows options and forces trust in mist walking. The terrace confrontation with the automaton deepens pressure by forcing a stance crystallization (leaving the keystone versus retrieving it), and Davin's final action forecloses the path of possession with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a cadence shift from ascent to confrontation to renunciation. One issue: the automaton's mid-stair prayer offer is a micro-reversal that dissipates without compounding, slightly diluting the final turn's inevitability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (sacred as unquantified presence) emerges through concrete particulars: the "lingering luminance" that "would not resolve into data," the child's pattern of frost-petals, and the folly's silence before calculation. The ending offers a non-literal answer—light that "outlast[s] the automated age"—without moralizing. The automaton's confusion ("sensors confused by light") dramatizes conceptual repricing rather than declaring it. Minor slip: "a doorway for whoever came with empty hands" edges toward explication in the penultimate beat, though the final image (Davin walking past "without hostility") recovers with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Davin notices "inkless fingers," "brilliant dimness," and the "thumbprint of quartz" in character-specific ways. Diction modulates with pressure—short clauses during the harness drop, slower syntax in the terrace garden—and voice remains coherent under stress. No head-hopping. One friction: elevated register occasionally intrudes ("the sacred had been misfiled into a ledger," "the folly answered with silence, as if it recognized theft even in polite arithmetic") where plainer diction would sharpen immediacy, though these remain voice-plausible for a trained mage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: "Below, the automaton reached the terrace door and began calculating angles to pry the stone free, but the folly answered with silence" balances clauses for emphasis. Zero paraphrase loops. One cluster of figurative overwriting in the opening third—"silver dark," "halos," "impossibilities," "accommodated impossibilities," "brilliant dimness"—packs four metaphoric constructs within ~150 words without full payoff until the terrace, creating minor density drag. The closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis (artisan refusal vs. automation, embodied through a folly and mist walking) feels specific and non-obvious. The final image—Davin leaving the keystone so "the simple ritual could outlast the automated age"—transforms familiar tropes (luddite mage, sacred object) through the on-page cost of renunciation and the spire's impossible geometry. The three-petal arrangement (a child's memory) is a fresh inflection that earns the ending's resonance. Slight deduction: the framing ("when creativity got automated") edges toward prompt-template idiom rather than fully inhabited world-building, though the closure transcends it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Davin's choices—mist walking, unstrapping, arranging petals, leaving the keystone—create all key turns. His decision at closure (walking past the automaton without taking the stone) alters the story's final meaning and forecloses possession with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keystone appears in three beats: Director's mention, Davin's touch ("lingering luminance seeped into his skin"), and the petal arrangement that deepens its glow. Its "thumbprint of quartz" specificity and the folly's silence when the automaton enters charge the closure. Removing it would collapse the story's final image and thematic pivot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" shapes stakes (the promise "that light could remain without being measured") and tactics (Davin carries the keystone, arranges petals to deepen the glow). The automaton's sensors "confused by light that would not resolve into data" dramatizes the concept's cost. Present in closure image with reweighted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spire's "accommodated impossibilities" (stairs that switch direction, carrying Davin "the way a lullaby carries a child") enable one on-page action with visible cost: Davin stops trying to understand and trusts the illogic. The terrace garden's "impossible summer" extends the trait but does not constrain a second distinct choice. Early signal, mid-use, closure presence elevate but lack compounding causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Unstrapping the harness mid-climb is the pivot: it narrows Davin's options (he must trust mist walking), defines the automaton contrast (gear vs. empty hands), and sets up the thematic payoff ("whoever came with empty hands"). Swapping it for a different forfeit would require extensive structural rework. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mist walking is signaled early ("stepped into a spill of river fog and began mist walking") and used twice: to reach the spire undetected and to drift through the wall-crack the automaton cannot perceive. Its mechanics (moving "where [a body] could not quite exist") matter to both beats. Moderate causal pressure, clear setup and development, present at a key turn but not in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spire provides continuous constraint: impossible stairs force Davin to surrender control; the wall-crack enables evasion; the terrace's warmth and the folly's silence pressure the closure choice. Spatial particulars (needle of blue ice, terrace door, miniature arch) shape tactics and charge the ending. Strong beat involvement, early signal, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Automation frames the premise ("the city of guilds turned quiet, lit by screens") and the automaton's presence dramatizes the timeframe conflict. The pressure is conceptual rather than temporal—no live clock tightens decisions—but the contrast between automated efficiency and Davin's slow ritual choice shapes the dominant stake. Functional setup, thematic presence, limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to "find the sacred in the simple" drives Davin's departure, his harness forfeit (choosing empty hands), and the three-petal arrangement (a child's pattern versus grand wards). Friction appears in the contrast between wants (automated perfection) and cost (renouncing possession). Dramatized across beats, present at closure with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" modulates coherently: the "silver dark where lanterns became halos" in the fog, the keystone's "low, brilliant dimness" in the folly, and the automaton's confusion by unresolvable light. The tone charges the final image (light outlasting measurement) and reflects pressure throughout. Strong rhythmic control, early establishment, closure integration.</comment>
