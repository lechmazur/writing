<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is consistently motivated by his mother's legacy and teaching silence how to comfort; his decision to show the meter and slow the gondola are micro-choices under pressure. Mara's grief is embodied through swollen eyes and map-twisting, and her shift to counting creaks shows earned traction. The interiority leans slightly elevated ("fluidly logical as the terrace's shifting colored panes") but remains character-particular. No unmotivated leaps; the final stance is earned by the cable-creak pedagogy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (Elias, prism terrace, train yards). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mara steps out "steady" having learned to "look for pauses the way you look for lanterns," and the vaulting hush now comforts rather than threatens—visible stance shift with felt cost (grief held, not erased). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias slows the car against the storm glass warning and teaches counting, reweighting silence from threat to corridor. Cost is legible in Mara's swallowed pulse-fear and Elias's vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial constrain action: prismatic stripes paint Mara, the vial's clumping forces Elias to slow the car, and the cables' creaking becomes the pedagogical tool. The body (collar meter, storm glass in palm) and the gondola roof-tap are micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (catwalk, bay three, far platform). No occupation-level depth demanded at this length, and the yards' "dark geometry" supports tone without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teaching silence to comfort Mara through the crossing. One meaningful tightening when the storm glass clumps and Elias slows the car to prevent cable singing, then instructs Mara to count pauses—agency that narrows her panic into method. The final cost is Mara's acceptance of quiet with her pulse audible, forgoing the distraction she had chased. No antagonist required; wind pressure and Mara's grief cohere. Elias's brake-lever vigilance and roof-tap are tactical choices under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as furnished corridor, not emptiness—emerges from Elias's meter-checking, his mother's night-nurse method, and Mara's shift from fear to lantern-seeking. The final image (Mara standing in vaulting hush) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The storm glass and cable creaks accumulate into a non-literal proof that quiet can carry grief. One line nears thematic echo ("silence was not emptiness but a corridor in transit") but remains in Elias's philosophical idiom and primes the closure rather than repeating at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (noise meter, storm glass, inherited pedagogy). Diction is elevated and patterned ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical") but voice-motivated as a gondola operator who philosophizes about silence. One dialogue exchange with Mara reads natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. The long sentences and lyric compression are taught early and remain legible. Minor deduction: the phrase "accept movement while deciding what kind of movement it would be" leans abstractly mid-beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no obvious loops. Information density is high. Two subtractions: "fluidly logical as the terrace's shifting colored panes" is a strained vehicle (logic ≠ colored panes), and the sentence "Elias spoke softly, not to fill the space but to give it edges" employs a filter-adjacent hedge that slightly flattens a peak teaching moment. The opening and closing images are strong. Paraphrase-loop check passes; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of noise monitoring + grief pedagogy + transit as metaphor feels specific and non-obvious. The storm glass as atmospheric barometer shaping tactics is fresh. The mother's night-nurse legacy transforms a familiar mentor-figure trope into lived occupational logic. Risk: extended lyric diction and philosophical interiority could obscure, but here they cohere with the gondola operator's voice. Derivative premise guardrail does not apply; the transit-as-comfort premise is anchored in verifiable detail (decibel meter, cable mechanics). Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact setting and method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias decides to show the meter, slow the gondola when the storm glass clumps, tap the roof, and teach Mara to count creaks—four distinct on-page choices that narrow her panic and enable the closure stance. Setup early, development mid-crossing, payoff in Mara's steady exit. Causal pressure and specificity are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Storm glass vial appears in three beats: opening forecast (milky needles), midpoint clumping that triggers the slowdown, and the cold signal before the gust. Each use alters tactics. Charged reprise: the vial's changing states map escalation and Elias's responsive pedagogy, shaping the closure by preventing cable scream that would have broken Mara's traction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"In transit" is both literal (gondola crossing) and thematic (grief in passage). It shapes stakes: Elias's job is to manage the crossing's emotional tone, and Mara must decide whether to let transit comfort or terrify her. The concept constrains on-page action (brake control, cable timing) and charges the final image ("carry her onward"). Setup, development, payoff all present; cost is Mara's acceptance of movement with audible pulse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is attributed to Elias's belief system in the opening and motivates his showing the meter to Mara (logic as comfort tool). It enables one key choice but does not recur with visible cost later. Setup present, development weak, no payoff. The trait is more label than constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Catalyze calm" is explicitly named and demonstrated when Elias eases the brake to thin the car's complaining note and taps the roof. This action shapes two beats (brake adjustment, roof signal) and contributes to Mara's shift. Not indispensable—other verbs could describe the same moves—but it aligns with his meter-based method and charges the crossing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is Elias's method: the collar meter is shown to Mara, consulted mentally, and grounds his promise ("below forty"). The mechanics matter: he watches the meter while operating the brake, and the method enables his teaching Mara to count cable creaks. Setup, development (brake modulation keyed to sound), and payoff (Mara's trained listening) all present. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace supplies the cables (which creak and teach), the prismatic light painting Mara, and the catwalk for Elias's vigilance. It shapes one key choice (slowing the car to prevent cable singing). Setup and development solid; payoff is Mara's exit onto the far platform, but the terrace itself does not charge that image—its role is enabling rather than indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is poetic and atmospheric but does not tighten decisions. The crossing is a vague span ("halfway across"). The whistle echo bookends tonally but does not create a ticking clock. Setup present (opening anchor), weak development, lyric reprise at end. The timeframe colors mood but is swappable for any quiet window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is dramatized in his showing the meter, instructing Mara to count creaks, and revealing his mother's night-nurse legacy. Friction: Mara's skepticism ("frowned at the idea of numbers for quiet") and his risk that she might reject the method. Cost: his vigilance and the emotional labor of channeling grief pedagogy. Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff in Mara's acceptance. Desire is embodied, not told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" recurs three times, modulating from physical description (train whistle aftermath) to metaphor (the gap as vaulted chamber) to Mara's internalized state at closure. Tone is coherent through turns, supporting accumulative pressure. The final use charges the ending image by naming the lesson Elias taught. Strong lyric integration and closure linkage.</comment>
