<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is consistent and distinct—methodical, observational, grounded in the habits of storm recording. Motivation is clear throughout: nurturing integrity drives the lateral-progress escape and the data-copying choice. The decision to free Mara and release the logs carries visible cost (risk of capture, reliance on fragile pigeon delivery), and the final stance—integrity as company rather than cage—feels earned. Minor deduction: the follower remains a silhouette without internalized threat assessment that would deepen the protagonist's embodied fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The inciting pigeon message triggers a because/therefore chain: warning → lateral evasion → warehouse infiltration → log copying → pigeon release → escape. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist writes down "the truth I had learned, promising myself that solitude would remain a choice, not a cage"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (permanent exposure risk, reliance on fragile data transmission). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line four. One minor slip: the follower's misdirection at the end feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior tactical setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard's jasmine and rain barrels, the warehouse's chlorine-and-grain smell, and the riverwalk reeds are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear: courtyard → inner passage → neighbor walls → rooftops → barricade waterline → loft → riverwalk → courtyard return. The notebook and pigeon function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices (copying logs, message tube). The "dusk" lighting recurs at closure to charge the final image. Minor gap: the bureau coats and generator hum are vivid but don't alter a tactical choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect integrity and avoid detention/false-report conscription. The warning message tightens options; the protagonist chooses lateral progress over direct bureau confrontation, a decision with clear trade-off (slower, riskier route). The warehouse discovery escalates stakes (fever-culture dumping, emergency-power plot), and the notebook-copying/pigeon-release choice forecloses the hero's-spectacle path with visible cost (reliance on airborne data, no guarantee of safety). The escape completes the pressure arc. No convenience: each turn flows from prior causality and protagonist agency under the inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—integrity as both solitude and company, data truth vs. institutional fraud—emerges through concrete choices: refusing the bureau, copying discharge logs, trusting "honest data, once airborne." The jasmine/courtyard motif recurs with shifted weight: initial solitude → final "integrity had company." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: solitude becomes choice rather than cage, and the unlatched gate misdirects the watcher. No overt moralizing; the thematic question is answered through image and action. The committee/edited-data premise and the rogue-quarantine cover integrate tightly with the integrity question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; psychic distance is controlled and the narrator's perceptual signature—storm-recorder habits, reading "wind shifts" and "people"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches the protagonist's methodical, observational idiom. No dialogue on the page; Mara's whispered exposition is brief and functional. One friction: a few constructions edge toward elevated register ("cadence of their steps," "tranquility that tried to pass as safety") that, while legible, occasionally drift from the grounded voice established in the opening. Compression under stress is appropriate and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, choice, or pressure. The opening and closing images are strong. One significant friction: runs of template cadence in the middle ("I found Mara in a locked loft... her wrists rubbed raw, and she whispered that...") and a paraphrase loop around "layered tranquility" (courtyard hush, warehouse "tranquility that tried to pass as safety"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 in this category. No loops touch the final image, so closure remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-recorder protagonist who applies meteorological observation habits to political evasion is a fresh synthesis. The lateral-progress method and pigeon-as-counter-surveillance are specific and non-obvious. The rogue-quarantine cover for fever-culture dumping avoids stock conspiracy beats through the discharge-log detail and the institutional-committee framing. Minor deduction: the follower-misdirection and unlatched-gate tactic, while clever, feel slightly familiar from espionage templates. Risk-taking (rooftop travel, waterline entry, pigeon trust) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The meticulous storm recorder trait shapes the protagonist's choices: applying observation habits to evasion ("read wind shifts... read people"), copying discharge logs with notebook precision, and trusting data integrity. Present in opening setup, drives the middle infiltration and log-copying beat, and frames the final journal entry. The trait enables the lateral-progress method and charges the closure promise ("I wrote down the evening pressure and the truth I had learned"). Cost: reliance on fragile documentation. Swappability is low; removing "storm recorder" would require rewriting the observation logic and notebook centrality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The message tube appears in three beats: courtyard arrival (delivers warning), loft (protagonist copies logs into it), and implicit closure (data airborne). Early signal, causal role (the warning triggers evasion; the tube enables the counter-surveillance tactic), and closure linkage (the escape depends on the pigeon carrying evidence). The tube's reuse with the protagonist's own data is a charged reprise. Cost: the plan's success hinges on the pigeon's flight. Minor gap: the tube's physical handling in the loft beat is summarized rather than dramatized in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone is the core concept and shapes every major beat: the warning (it exists outside legal order, protagonist's name is on a list), the avoidance choice (lateral progress instead of bureau confrontation), the warehouse infiltration (discovering the cover-up), and the escape stakes (sirens, barricades). It is introduced early, drives the middle discovery, and the closure hinges on escaping its perimeter while trusting data to "outpace any fence." The concept is irreplaceable; the story's logic and pressure collapse without it. Cost: permanent exposure risk and reliance on fragile pigeon delivery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Credibly curious by nature" is mentioned in the opening but functions primarily as a label that rationalizes the protagonist's investigative drive. It does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible trade-off; the lateral-progress and infiltration decisions trace more directly to the integrity motive and storm-recorder habits. The trait is present and consistent but replaceable with "integrity" or "methodical" without structural loss. No clear cost unique to curiosity; the protagonist's choices flow from the storm-recorder trait and the warning's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" is signaled early ("intuit the truth by progressing laterally") and frames the method: reading wind shifts, reading people, reading patrolmen's avoidance patterns to infer the quarantine's true purpose. The intuition drives the warehouse-infiltration beat and the choice to copy logs rather than confront directly. It recurs implicitly in the final "I wrote down... the truth I had learned." The action is specific to the storm-recorder idiom and not easily swappable. Minor gap: the intuition feels more like observation than a distinct cognitive leap; the beats could be reframed as "deduce" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is introduced early as the protagonist's chosen method and shapes every spatial beat: inner passage → neighbor walls → laundry lines → rooftops → alley corners → waterline gap → riverwalk → reeds and service tunnels. The method enables evasion, infiltration, and escape, and the closure recaps it ("moving laterally again"). The mechanics matter: the protagonist avoids direct bureau confrontation and barricade entry, instead using edges and gaps. The method is irreplaceable; removing it would require rewriting the entire tactical sequence. Cost: slower, riskier route with no guarantee of success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet courtyard at dusk bookends the story: opening setup (jasmine, rain barrels, "hush so complete") and closing return ("the jasmine still held its calm"). The courtyard supplies the pigeon perch and anchors the follower's misdirection (unlatched gate). The setting charges the final image (dusk deepened, jasmine calm, integrity finding company). However, the courtyard does not constrain a middle choice; the rooftops, barricades, and warehouse do more causal work. The reprise reweights solitude but does not alter tactics. Swappability is moderate; another quiet, enclosed space could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After being followed home" establishes the inciting pressure and recurs at closure (the follower still waits, misdirected). The timeframe is dusk throughout, creating a single continuous window. However, the "after" does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; the protagonist moves at observational pace without urgent deadline. The follower's presence adds tension but does not accelerate choices or force time-based trade-offs. The timeframe is functional but replaceable; "during an evening walk" or "at twilight" would serve with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is introduced early ("I had come here to nurture integrity in solitude, away from the committee that edited other people's data") and drives the refusal to go to the bureau, the choice to copy honest logs, and the trust in airborne data. The motivation is dramatized in the peak choice (freeing Mara "without a hero's spectacle") and the closure reconfiguration ("integrity had company... solitude would remain a choice, not a cage"). Friction between solitude (initial want) and company (final state) creates the thematic cost. The motive is irreplaceable and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is signaled early (courtyard "hush so complete," jasmine and rain barrels) and recurs with ironic reweighting in the warehouse ("layered tranquility that tried to pass as safety while my stomach measured it as fraud"). The tone modulates under pressure: courtyard calm → tense evasion → warehouse false calm → escape urgency → closing calm with new charge ("the jasmine still held its calm"). The tone charges the final image by reweighting tranquility as earned rather than imposed. However, the tone is somewhat static in the middle rooftop/alley beats; urgency does not fully disrupt the measured cadence until the warehouse.</comment>
