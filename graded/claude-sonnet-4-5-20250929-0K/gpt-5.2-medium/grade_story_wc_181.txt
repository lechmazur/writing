<comment>Mara's interiority is present but remains abstract—she "inquires" of the cameo, "suspects" nonlinear inheritance, and "realizes" the trap without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final acceptance ("accepting that the simplest way…") reads as epiphany declared rather than earned through scene-level agency; no visible foreclosure of a live option with felt cost. Motivation is conceptually coherent but lacks the sensory particularity and internal friction that would anchor her stakes in the body and choice.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—nonlinear events and reordered logbook pages layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is present (curator, asteroid, orchard) by the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing: Mara writes an accession note to her younger self and accepts her role as ancestor-archivist. However, the cost is told rather than shown—"accepting" is a declaration, and the specific trade-off (what path is foreclosed, what she loses by becoming the ancestor) remains implicit. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful reweighting is sufficient, but the final image does not charge prior material with undeniable pressure; the cameo's return and the logbook loop feel illustrative rather than decisive.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The astral orchard, station mirrors, and greenhouse walkway are vivid and anchor the setting early. The cameo blank and logbook are handled across multiple beats, creating micro-setting texture. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice or charge the final image—Mara walks the orchard, leans over sinks, and opens the logbook without spatial friction or resource pressure altering her tactics. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping the category at 8.8; present execution stays in mid-band due to lack of causal pressure from setting elements.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—whether to carve the cameo and steer timelines—is signaled early and accumulates detail. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or reweighting that narrows options; here, Mara discovers facts (tags dated next year, the cameo already carved) without her agency driving the pressure. The final moment ("she had already carved the face, in a future that had inherited her curiosity") is a realization of fait accompli rather than a choice under duress. No on-page reversal or deepening driven by protagonist decision with visible cost; coincidence (the cameo's disappearance and reappearance) complicates but does not test commitment.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—nonlinear inheritance and the ethics of erasing guilt—emerges from concrete particulars (the blank cameo, reordered logbook, star-fruit falling upward). The final sentence attempts thematic closure: "the simplest way to keep history honest was to keep it complicated." This lands as an articulated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer earned by image. The piece invites reflection, but the closing aphorism pulls focus from scene pressure to authorial thesis, and the cost of Mara's acceptance remains conceptual rather than felt. The 9+ test (ending reweights without stating a moral) is not met.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—she notices tags, hears a child's laugh, sees herself as "both child and old woman"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated, quasi-academic register ("nonlinear inheritance," "philosophical breakthroughs," "accession note") that feels imposed rather than character-particular under pressure. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("accepting that…") flattens voice at the closure beat. Distinct rhythmic control and purposeful compression are evident in the opening and orchard sequences, but the bathroom-epiphany motif is told more than shown, reducing perceptual specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Opening and orchard sequences show strong figurative density and rhythm ("constellations like fruit," "star-fruit fall upward"). However, the piece exhibits multiple line-level artifacts: paraphrase loops ("she would discover a tag… then later find the measurement"), synonym churn for "realize/understand/suspect," and template cadence in the bathroom and logbook beats. The final third stacks filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the knowledge was forbidden not because it was evil, but because it was too clean") that dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("she understood the trap… accepting that…"), triggering cumulative penalties in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is uneven; some beats do double work, others loop conceptually without advancing pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—nonlinear inheritance + astral orchard + bathroom epiphanies + time-looping logbook—is ambitious and specific. The premise (curator cataloging an orchard that is her family's archive planted by descendants) offers a fresh angle on temporal paradox and archival ethics. However, the bathroom motif and the blank-cameo-as-drawer-label conceit feel more illustrative than inevitable; the story could function with different anchors for epiphany and temporal control. The final turn (Mara has already carved the face in a future) is hinted but not fully earned in hindsight—prior beats show discovery rather than choice-driven inevitability. The piece commits to its concept but does not transform familiar time-loop mechanics through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The bewildered curator (Mara Keene) is named and present throughout, framing the POV. She makes several micro-choices: keeping the blank in a glass case, inquiring of it, walking among trees, rushing to the bathroom, placing the finished cameo back. However, none of these choices creates a key turn or alters tactics under pressure—she observes, discovers, and accepts rather than deciding between live options with cost. The final "accepting" is a stance crystallization but is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Setup and development are present; closure participation is conceptual rather than action-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank is signaled early (paragraph one) and appears in at least four beats: kept in a glass case, inquired of each morning, found missing, and returned as a finished cameo showing her grandmother. It anchors the temporal paradox and charges the realization that Mara has already carved the face in a future. However, it does not constrain a present choice—Mara does not decide whether to carve it; the carving is revealed as fait accompli. The object is causally central and shapes the ending image, but swappability is moderate (any temporal artifact could serve a similar role with edits). Closure linkage is strong, beat involvement is solid, but lack of on-page agency tied to the object prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Nonlinear inheritance is the conceptual spine: Mara suspects it, the orchard embodies it (tags dated next year, trees dying as if harvested centuries ago), the logbook pages reorder, and the closure hinges on Mara becoming the ancestor who hides the knowledge. The concept shapes stakes (deciding which ancestor receives which memory) and tactics (writing an accession note to her younger self). It is not merely thematic—it drives the plot structure and the final reconfiguration. However, the mechanics remain illustrative rather than tested: Mara does not use nonlinear inheritance to solve a problem on the page; she discovers she is already part of the loop. High causal pressure and closure linkage, but protagonist agency under the concept is limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"Simply complicated" is applied to the sequence of events ("a simply complicated sequence of events that refused to stay in order") and echoed in the final line ("the simplest way to keep history honest was to keep it complicated"). It functions as a thematic label and structural descriptor but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The attribute is present and coherent with the nonlinear design, but it remains ornamental—removing it would not alter plot logic or character tactics. No visible tradeoff tied to this trait; it reads as a conceptual flourish rather than a causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Inquire" appears explicitly: "each morning, she would inquire of it as if it were a colleague." The action establishes Mara's relationship with the cameo and her curatorial method. However, the inquiry itself does not generate a major turn—the reply "never came in words" but in discovered facts (tags, measurements). The final turn traces to her realization in the bathroom and the pre-carved cameo, not to a decision driven by her inquiries. The action is signaled and thematically consistent, but it is replaceable with "examine," "question," or "study" without structural impact. One-beat involvement, no closure pressure, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The method is signaled early and distinctly: "her strangest habit, having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms, because only there did the station mirrors show her as both child and old woman at once." It recurs when Mara "rushed to the bathroom, because that room was where conclusions happened," and the final understanding occurs "on the damp tile." The method is taught and used twice, shaping where epiphanies land. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not see how the mirror's doubling enables the breakthrough, only that it does. The method does not constrain attempts (she could think anywhere) but does concentrate key realizations. Present in setup, middle, and ending; functional but somewhat arbitrary—another location with a symbolic prop could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The astral orchard is central to the premise and vividly described: trees wearing constellations, star-fruit falling upward, greenhouse walkway, labels dated next year. It is present in setup and middle beats and referenced at closure ("the orchard was not a discovery… it was her family's archive"). However, the orchard does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Mara walks among the trees and observes, but the setting does not constrain her tactics or alter the final decision. The orchard functions as symbolic backdrop and thematic anchor rather than spatial crucible. Strong atmospheric presence and thematic integration, but lacks the causal or tactical role required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "between the first and last page" is invoked in the opening line and the penultimate sentence ("So she opened the logbook to its last page, wrote an accession note to her younger self on the first"). It frames the narrative recursion and the logbook's reordering. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—it is a structural metaphor rather than a live clock. Mara does not race against time or make choices under temporal pressure; the nonlinear loop is revealed rather than navigated. Present in setup and closure as a conceptual bracket, but it does not function as a constraint that shapes on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The motivation—to pursue forbidden knowledge—is signaled early: Mara came "to pursue forbidden knowledge whispered in footnotes, the rumor that an heirloom could pass backward as well as forward through a bloodline." It drives her curatorial work and her inquiry into the cameo. The final acceptance hinges on understanding that the knowledge is "forbidden not because it was evil, but because it was too clean." The motivation is dramatized in her nightly walks, her bathroom realizations, and her decision to place the cameo back. However, the friction between want and cost is told rather than tested—she does not face a concrete on-page choice to abandon or pursue the knowledge with visible consequence. Present across beats and at closure, but the conflict between desire and price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"Brightened disquiet" is invoked early: "the silence around the domes held a brightened disquiet that never quite let her breathe." The tone recurs in descriptions of the orchard's "radiant petals," the child's laugh from the compost pit, and the mirrors showing her as "both child and old woman." The tone is coherent through turns—wonder mixed with unease—and modulates appropriately as Mara moves from discovery to realization. The final image (placing the cameo back, accepting the role) carries a quiet, resigned charge that fits the brightened-disquiet register. The tone charges the final image without overwhelming it, maintaining the paradoxical blend of illumination and dread. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation, but the tone does not pivot sharply to heighten closure; it sustains a consistent atmosphere.</comment>
