<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sava's motivation is consistent and her sensory/perceptual signature (ripple-marks, harmonic awareness) remains distinct throughout. The choice to place the echo chamber stone and conjure the bloom of hush demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The resolution feels more like competent problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early and builds pressure through layered sensory accumulation (metallic cave ringing, ice fractures, crystal cavities). Closure arrives on-page as Sava establishes a pact with the energy beings and updates her living map, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. The cost is felt in the ongoing obligation ("whenever the storms rose") and the transformation of the caves into a shared sanctuary. One tightening suffices at this length, though the escalation reads more as competent execution than agonized choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered through shifting sound textures (water to struck iron, crystal honeycomb amplifying heartbeats) and constrain Sava's path through acoustic pressure. The ice-crack patterns function as micro-setting that guides her navigation, and the echo chamber stone acts as both tool and spatial anchor. The Forge of Listening charges the final image by becoming the sanctuary that houses the pact. Sensory detail is filtered through Sava's professional lens (mapkeeper perceiving through harmonics) and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding quiet in the storm to protect people and restore the caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as Sava follows the tremor downstream, discovers the Forge, and deploys the echo chamber stone to slow the energy beings. The climactic conjuring represents one meaningful tightening where her intervention redirects the beings' hunger, altering the tactical landscape. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the resolution reads as competent problem-solving without agonized trade-off or visible sacrifice that would charge the final image more intensely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between violence and restraint, the caves' need to "remember their old songs," and the refugees seeking "a rhythm to inhabit." The bloom of hush functions as a recurring image that shifts from aspiration to enacted sanctuary, reweighting prior material without overt moralizing. The final image of strangers warming at the Forge offers resonance, though it tilts slightly abstract ("hammered repose spread through strangers") rather than anchoring in a single concrete particular that crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout; Sava's perceptual signature (ripple-marks, harmonic sensitivity) colors all observation. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush," "braided pale arcs"), though the lexicon occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction that tests the boundary of a mapkeeper's working idiom. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing are legible and serve the accumulative lens. No dialogue appears on the page, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraph's rhythm supports closure without narrative distance slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing setting, character insight, or plot. However, several phrases lean into stock lyricism: "bloom of hush, a living field that could hold sound softly the way moss holds rain" stacks figurative language without earned specificity, and "hammered repose" recurs as a thematic label rather than evolving through concrete embodiment. The ice-crack/pressure-reading mechanism is vivid, but the climactic conjuring sequence abstracts into "weaving those echoes into a net" without grounding the gesture in tactical micro-choices. Minimal loops or scaffold, but the figurative density in peak beats (conjuring, pact) reduces propulsion by ~−0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The harmonic-cave mapkeeper premise and the ice-crack navigation method offer fresh angles on portal-fantasy/refuge tropes. The energy beings as vibration-drinking refugees rather than outright antagonists provides a non-obvious moral calculus, and the pact resolution avoids combat cliché. The "bloom of hush" as tactical tool rather than mere metaphor shows conceptual commitment. However, the core emotional arc—competent specialist solves crisis through professional skill—fits a familiar template, and the final sanctuary image, while resonant, does not surprise in hindsight. Synthesis is coherent and specific; transformation is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sava appears in setup (listening to shifted harmonics), drives middle beats (following pressure downstream, placing the stone, conjuring), and completes the closure pact. Her mapkeeper role and ripple-mark trait shape perception and tactics. Two distinct choices: deploying the echo chamber stone and offering the refugees a path. Causal pressure is clear, and the final map-update reinforces her agency. Irreplaceability is high; the story hinges on her harmonic expertise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone is signaled early ("gently luminous even when wrapped in cloth"), used in the conjuring beat to redirect the beings' hunger, and reappears in the pact scene ("turned it so its inner chamber caught the harshest ringing"). It constrains Sava's tactics (she must find the right amplifying chamber) and charges the closure by sealing the bargain. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity (stores/releases sound without losing shape) is functional and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Bloom of hush" is invoked at the conjuring beat ("she began to conjure… a bloom of hush, a living field that could hold sound softly") and recurs at closure ("locations where the bloom of hush could be renewed"). It shapes the stake (finding quiet) and the tactical solution (conjuring restraint rather than silence-as-absence). However, it functions more as thematic label than a rule or mechanism with visible costs; the narrative would survive if renamed to "zone of calm" with minor edits. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake but does not impose unique constraints.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" is attributed to the echo chamber stone early and mentioned again at the pact scene ("lifted the gently luminous stone"). It signals the stone's presence but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Sava would deploy the stone whether it glowed or not. The glow aids recognition but remains ornamental; swapping it for "warm" or "humming" would not alter tactics. Two-beat presence and closure linkage push it above mid-band, but lack of causal necessity caps it at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Conjure" is signaled at the climactic beat ("with the steady will of someone used to drawing order from resonance, she began to conjure") and defines the turning action that slows the energy beings and enables the pact. The narrative hinges on this act; removing it would collapse the resolution. It appears in one extended beat and charges the closure by establishing the repeatable sanctuary ritual ("she would stand at the Forge, conjure again"). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ice-crack examination is introduced early ("knelt and began examining crack patterns in ice, because fractures recorded pressures") and drives the middle beat by guiding Sava downstream toward the Forge. The method constrains her navigation (she must interpret physical traces rather than guess) and enables the discovery of the amplifying chamber. It does not reappear at closure, limiting final-image charge, but its causal role in enabling the key turn and its irreplaceable specificity (no other navigation method is plausible) justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are signaled in the opening line, evolve across beats (stopped sounding like water, started ringing like struck iron; crystal honeycomb amplifies heartbeats), and supply the Forge of Listening—the spatial lynchpin of the closure pact. The setting constrains Sava's tactics (she must navigate by sound and find the right chamber) and charges the final image (the Forge becomes the recurring sanctuary). Three gates met; causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is established in the opening and frames the entire crisis: the caves' harmonics shifted, forcing Sava to find a solution. It tightens decisions (miners and pilgrims beg for routes; pressure is immediate) and persists to closure ("Days later, after the energy beings had settled"). However, the narrative does not track a live countdown or escalating temporal pressure within the single mission; the frame is stable rather than dynamically constricting. Two gates (setup, closure mention) and moderate causal shaping justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find the quiet in the storm" is articulated early ("her own motivation was narrower and deeper: to find the quiet in the storm"), drives her choice to seek the Forge rather than flee, and is fulfilled at closure when she establishes the bloom of hush and updates the living map. The motivation is dramatized through her trek and conjuring, though internal friction (e.g., fear vs. duty) is underdeveloped. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all present; the narrative arc hinges on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" recurs three times (opening, Forge sanctuary, final paragraph) and coheres with the story's restrained, accumulative texture. The tone modulates subtly (urgency in the trek, focused calm during conjuring, shared warmth at closure) without fracturing. However, the phrase itself trends toward thematic label rather than embodied mood; the final image ("hammered repose spread through strangers the way warmth spreads from a shared fire") abstracts rather than grounds the tonal charge. Coherence across turns and closure reprise justify mid-6s, but lack of visceral embodiment in peak beats caps it below 7.0.</comment>
