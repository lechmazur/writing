<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and distinct—her spatial imagination maps emotions to coordinates, and her search for unused love drives tactile choices (warming the can, threading the strip). The psychometry vision of Eli is embodied through grease-pencil stains and hushed voice, though the vision itself risks summary. Her final act—reading her own letters into the light—earns a stance shift with visible cost (tearing up prior letters, then committing to "deliver"). Minor: Lena remains abstract, known only through Eli's longing, but at this length secondary figuration is acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, projection booth, after-hours) land by line three. The piece accumulates pressure through lyric recursion—lyrics loop, letters tear, the film strip "incubates"—and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final act: Mara reads her letters into projected light, the lyrics find their tune via sprockets and rain, and she labels the can "deliver." Cost is felt (years of tearing letters, the booth "expanding" to release Lena's smile) and the cadence shift from searching to releasing reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with purposeful detail: projector as shrine, lamp housing incubates the can, beam path and rewind table hold imagined emotions, sprocket clatter provides the tune. Micro-setting (the strip, the light rectangle on the wall) constrains Mara's ritual and charges the closure image. Sensory selection—velvet-folding rain, underground thunder, quivering light—filters through Mara's spatial imagination and intensifies at peak beats. The booth's "hidden chambers" open in her mind at closure, making environment inseparable from the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to find where unused love is stored) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: looping lyrics, torn letters, the film strip's blankness as vault. The psychometry vision deepens stakes by revealing Eli's parallel struggle, and Mara's choice to project nothing and read aloud forecloses her prior method (tearing to teach song) with visible cost. Agency is renunciation and ritual completion. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful turn—projecting emptiness, speaking into it—suffices; the cost (years of silence, "brave enough to finish the goodbye") is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (unused love stored in unfinished rituals) emerges from concrete particulars—ticket stubs, locked cans, blank leader, torn letters—without thesis statement. The final image (rewinding the strip, labeling it "deliver," lyrics resting "like thunder that has learned to whisper") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: love is released by finishing the goodbye. Subtext operates in Mara's spatial imagination, Eli's hushed apology, and the quivering light as open envelope. The ending reweights prior material (tearing versus delivering) with conceptual cost (bravery to complete ritual) and avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens during the vision and the projection ritual. Voice is distinct—lyric compression ("burglar of light," "shame itself had archived it"), metaphor-dense but purposeful, and rhythm modulates with pressure (short clauses at closure: "not farewell but deliver"). Filter verbs ("wondered," "realized," "understood") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; Mara's perceptual signature (spatial imagination, mapping emotions to coordinates) is consistent. Diction remains within the focalizer's idiom; elevated register suits the lyric mode and is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the booth made her feel like a burglar of light, stealing frames from dust" establishes voice, setting, and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual texture. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("crystal gazer," "burglar of light," "shame itself") risks overwriting but coheres under the lyric lens. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One template risk: "she saw," "she imagined," "she understood" recur but stay within psychometry frame. Propulsion is strong through the vision and projection beats; the final paragraph breathes appropriately after peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—psychometry + projection booth + goodbye letters finding tune via film sprockets—is specific and non-obvious. The framing (unused love stored in spaces built to avoid speaking) transforms familiar material through embodied ritual and spatial imagination. The turn (projecting nothing, reading into emptiness) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression, vision within vision, songs cut from soundtracks) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the core emotional arc (unfinished goodbye completed through ritual) is recognizable, but the particulars (grease pencil, leader strip, clatter as melody) are fresh and earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal gazer Mara is present throughout, framing the psychometry reading and making the final choice to project emptiness and read her letters aloud, then label the can "deliver." Her profession shapes method (psychometry as pressure, not vision) and the climactic ritual. Two beats: touching the strip (vision), threading and projecting (ritual). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Film strip is handled in multiple beats: warming on the lamp housing (incubate), touching the leader (vision trigger), threading and projecting onto the wall (ritual vessel). Its blankness functions as container/vault, reweighted at closure when Mara labels the can "deliver." The strip's sprocket clatter provides the forgotten tune. Essential across beats and ending; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape stakes (Mara's nightly ritual of writing and tearing) and tactics (reading them aloud into projected light to complete the ritual Eli began). The concept drives both the psychometry vision (Eli's letters on ticket stubs) and the closure choice (Mara's letters land in the emptiness where Eli stored his). Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all strong; cost is tied to the concept (bravery to finish).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spatially imaginative is signaled early ("mapped the room as if it were a small universe") and enables the vision (imagining emotions with coordinates) and the closure moment (the booth expanding to reveal hidden chambers where Lena receives letters). The trait constrains perception and ritual, shaping how Mara searches and finds. One key beat (closure reconfiguration) with clear causal link; not merely label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Incubate appears once: Mara sets the cold film can on the projector lamp housing "to incubate, letting gentle heat wake whatever memory clung to celluloid." This action precedes and arguably enables the psychometry vision, but the causal link is implied rather than dramatized—she touches the strip afterward, and the vision follows. Setup and development present; closure participation is indirect (the strip she incubated is threaded). Functional but not indispensable; another warming method could serve.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early (manager wanted her psychometry reading), its mechanics are explained ("not vision exactly, but pressure"), and it drives the vision of Eli and Lena. The method shapes the middle beat (touching the strip with bare fingers, receiving the hush and weight) and primes the closure ritual (understanding blankness as container). Two beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage present; cost tied to the reading (realizing unused love is stored in unfinished rituals).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vintage movie palace projection booth is present throughout, anchoring all action. The booth's particulars—projector, lamp housing, beam path, rewind table, wall, sprockets—constrain and enable every key choice: incubating the can, threading the strip, projecting onto the wall, the clatter providing the tune. The booth functions as shrine and ritual space, and its "hidden chambers" open at closure. Indispensable; the setting is inseparable from the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" is embedded in Mara's ongoing struggle (weeks of looping lyrics, nightly letter-writing) and resolved at closure when "the forgotten lyrics found their tune" via sprockets and rain. The timeframe shapes the dominant stake and brackets the entire arc. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical clock; no moment-to-moment urgency tightens decisions. Setup, development (weeks of searching), and payoff (tune found) are all present; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is Mara's "true motive" stated early, dramatized through her nightly ritual (writing and tearing letters), and the psychometry reading. It drives the middle vision (seeing Eli's stored love) and the closure realization ("unused love is stored in unfinished rituals"). The final action (labeling the can "deliver") enacts the answer. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are strong; cost is tied to the motivation (bravery to finish the goodbye).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "hushed thunder" appears explicitly ("hush rolled through her," "his voice was a hushed thunder," "thunder that has learned to whisper") and is sustained through the accumulative texture: velvet-folding rain, underground rumble, quivering light, steady clatter. The tone modulates with pressure—quiet anticipation in the booth, the vision's intensity, the projection ritual's charge—and culminates in the final image ("thunder that has learned to whisper"). Coherent through turns and charges the closure; strong integration.</comment>
