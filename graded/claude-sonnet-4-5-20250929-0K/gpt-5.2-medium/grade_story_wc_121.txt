<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's interiority is consistently embodied through her gravity-defying physicality and her pattern of drifting away from commitment. The maze of self-avoidance is concrete and drives her final choice to stay in one timeline. However, the younger-self encounters feel more symbolic than dramatically earned, and the decision at the kneeling moment arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between contradictory impulses in that beat itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression; the tablet generates fractured timelines that accumulate until Lysa chooses one strand and the others fold. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise transitioning to Earned Stasis—where pressing the tablet to her chest and choosing to stay forecloses the drifting pattern with visible cost (heavier, one timeline). The cost is legible and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is vivid and purposeful: wet glass tiles, river below, maintenance hatch, and the water-bead moment all ground the action. The tablet's warmth and the shifting runes provide tactile, micro-setting detail. The viaduct's reflective tiles and the branching paths they create directly constrain Lysa's movement choices and charge the final kneeling image on the shining tile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self by facing avoided versions—is signaled early and tightens when the tablet teaches that fear produces the widest branching. Lysa's testing of the maze (stepping left then right, watching timelines collapse) is on-page agency that narrows options. The final choice to stay in one timeline rather than float away forecloses the evasion pattern with visible cost (she rises heavier). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—self-avoidance as labyrinth, love versus drift, the price of gravity—emerges organically from the tablet's procedural generation and Lysa's repeated floating away from commitment. The runes that rearrange, the branching timelines built from fear, and the younger self as waiting memory are concrete particulars. The final image of pressing the tablet to her chest and choosing one timeline offers a resonant, non-literal answer: accepting weight means accepting limits and cost. No thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric cadence ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") that matches Lysa's gravity-defying trade and reflective nature. Psychic distance is consistent. However, filter phrases ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") cluster in key beats and dull immediacy slightly. The perceptual signature—noticing water beads, tile splits, rune pulses—is character-specific and holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are strong: "boots ringing on wet glass tiles," "darkening brightness," "pages closing." Information density is high. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops—"fractured timelines that ran side by side" restates prior branching descriptions, and "the labyrinth of self" recurs with synonym churn ("private maze of fears," "self maze"). Template cadence in the middle third ("In one strand... in another... in a third") is purposeful parallelism but borders on mechanical. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gravity defier as occupation, ancient runes generating procedural timelines, and "periodically eternal" micro-pauses synthesize into a coherent speculative premise. The labyrinth-of-self metaphor made literal through branching paths is fresh. The ending—choosing weight, asking for help—transforms the drift trope through cost (heavier, one timeline). The combination feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids template resolutions.</comment>
