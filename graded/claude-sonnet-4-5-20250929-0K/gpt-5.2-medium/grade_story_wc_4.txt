<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's arc from observer to community facilitator reads through her micro-choices (scanning table, placement rules, lighting candles), with embodied calm shown via "letting the scent soften the metallic taste." Internal contradiction emerges when her secret motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is told rather than enacted in conflicted choices; the cost of her labor appears only in the final line's relief. The town's shift from "your loss" to "our hurt" is asserted rather than dramatized through individual struggles. Mr. Gant's single photo contribution and quiet amazement sketch a secondary character under minimal pressure, leaving Mara's isolation and potential failure unexplored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (Mara, Briarwick, lavender field behind factory ruins, "by the time vines began climbing"). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through community participation, the acetate fence accrues arcs, and the final walk-through collage reconfigures collective identity from fragmented grief to "our hurt." The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the masterpiece "finished only because everyone had made it") with conceptual cost legible in the collective labor and Mr. Gant's final ladder climb. Cost proof: the sentence "her masterpiece finished only because everyone had made it" delivers conceptual cost by reweighting Mara's initial solo ambition into communal authorship. One tightening occurs when the storm forces neighbors to hold sheets steady, shifting from passive reception to active guardianship, and the constraint of the anniversary date and storm narrows the emotional frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory create a coherent pressure site: scent softens metallic memory, vines climb through windows as time passes, and the acetate fence constrains Mara's curatorial method. The micro-setting of the overturned pallet scanning table and tea-candle halos during the power outage both enable her work and charge the final image with moving frames. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (fence, rows, broken section, vine-thick wall), and sensory detail (lavender scent, rattling rain, flicker) modulates with scene urgency. The setting's dual role—memorial site and collaborative workspace—directly shapes the choice to widen the path and hang acetate like curtains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transmuting communal pain into a navigable archive. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anniversary storm forces participants to hold acetate steady, converting passive viewers into co-authors. Agency reads through Mara's placement rules (hard diagonal for anger, soft bend for guilt) and the town's decision to widen the path and hang sheets. The resolution is earned by collective labor with visible cost in the time spent and emotional exposure ("looking hurt"), but individual prices—what anyone sacrificed or risked—remain offstage. The shift from "your loss" to "our hurt" is asserted rather than dramatized through a specific choice under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges from the acetate arcs aligning strangers' gestures, the storm scene's communal prayer, and the final sentence reweighting solo artistry into shared authorship. The lavender field functions as both literal and thematic ground, its scent a recurring motif that softens industrial trauma. Subtext operates in Mr. Gant's question "memorial or trap for ghosts" and Mara's answer "a doorway," suggesting the archive as threshold rather than monument. The final image—"her masterpiece finished only because everyone had made it"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral, though the move from isolation to communion trends toward tidy resolution without counterweight or ambiguity about what was lost in the making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and Mara's perceptual signature: noticing "which hands shook and which jokes tried to cover the shaking," filtering the boiler memory through imagined metallic taste, and reading arcs as "the town's real map." Voice carries a lyric compression ("word traveled the way lavender scent travels") and purposeful diction (e.g., "earnest whimsy," "acid-free boxes") that remains character-appropriate. Mr. Gant's brief dialogue distinguishes his cadence ("memorial or trap") from Mara's softer phrasing. Narrative certainty stays within Mara's knowledge except for the brief omniscient claim "people came after supper… because looking hurt," which reads as inference rather than leak. Under peak stress (storm scene), syntax tightens without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the piece; opening and storm beats propel while reflective passages breathe. Information density is high in the acetate-placement beats, but paraphrase loops appear: "let the scent soften" echoes "lingered among the purple rows," and "arcs were the town's real map" is restated as "she believed those arcs." Template cadence surfaces in the storm paragraph: "nobody ran; they held… and laughed… as if rescuing…" chains actions without varied stems. Stock metaphor "the factory stood like a bad riddle" and elevated diction "transmute pain into a masterpiece" drift from Mara's established voice during peak beats. Opening and final lines anchor effectively (vines climbing, masterpiece finished), and the acetate-fence image recurs with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—curating communal grief through visual arcs in photographs aligned on acetate—offers a fresh synthesis of memorial practice and puzzle logic. The acetate fence as walk-through collage transforms the archive trope into immersive experience, and the rule system (hard diagonal for anger, soft bend for guilt) particularizes Mara's method beyond generic memorial curation. The vines-climbing timeframe and lavender-field setting avoid generic grief-narrative backdrops. Risk lies in the accumulative structure and quiet closure; both succeed without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on acetate arcs, the fence site, and Mara's specific listening skill, not merely on template healing-through-art beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's character is signaled early (puzzle archivist, listening skill) and drives key beats: taping photos, scanning at the pallet, lighting candles, and telling the town her plan to create a walk-through collage. Her decision to align photos by arcs rather than faces constrains the method, and her listening prompts others to talk to one another. Closure references her in the final sentence ("her masterpiece finished only because everyone had made it"), but the shift to collective authorship reduces her individual agency at the ending. The trait "subtle" and "perceptively calm" is label-only in early beats; the cost of her labor—physical or emotional—remains offstage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dove gray map case is introduced early and handled once when Mara carries and unwraps photographs from it. After that beat it disappears; she does not return to it during scanning, storm, or closure. The case frames her as archivist but does not constrain a choice or reappear with reweighted meaning. Swappable with any container (envelope, box) without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Collective healing is signaled in Mara's motivation sentence and operationalized through the scanning table, shared photo placement, storm cooperation, and final walk-through exhibit that shifts vocabulary from "your loss" to "our hurt." The concept shapes middle beats (neighbors begin talking to one another) and the ending (masterpiece finished by everyone). It constrains Mara's method (listening, aligning arcs, widening the path) and drives the resolution. The ending lands cleanly under this concept with conceptual cost (solo authorship relinquished). Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is introduced early in a telling phrase ("the girl who could listen… and stay perceptively calm") and shown when Mara notices hands shaking and jokes covering grief. It enables her placement-rule choices (asking for diagonal, searching for soft bend) and her role during the storm (lighting candles, steady presence). The trait does not constrain or create visible cost; no beat shows her calm faltering or costing her a connection. Swappable with "patient" or "attentive" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Linger" is introduced early ("Mara went there at dusk and lingered among the purple rows") and recurs when she "lingered alone afterward" at closure. The action enables her to soften trauma memory and frames her ritual presence at the site, but does not drive a major turn. The final linger reweights the gesture from solitary grief management to post-collective reflection, charging the closure image. Essential to tone and closure participation, though replaceable with "remain" or "stay" in most beats without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("aligning them not by faces but via the arcs") and operationalized across beats: acetate placement, alignment rules (diagonal/soft bend), and the walk-through curtain structure. The arcs create the discovery system (child's swing matching hose loop, widow's profile joining coworker's fist) and drive the escalation when neighbors widen the path and hang acetate. Closure depends on the arc logic ("collective healing" realized through visual alignments). The method constrains every major choice and charges the final walk-through image. Irreplaceable; removing arc alignment collapses the story's mechanics and thematic structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lavender field is introduced early, anchors every scene, and supplies resources: scent softens metallic memory, rows provide spatial structure for candle placement and walking paths, and proximity to the factory ruins creates the emotional pressure site. The field constrains Mara's work (fence location, overturned pallet site) and charges the ending ("the field breathing with collective healing"). The setting's dual role—sensory balm and memorial workspace—is essential to stakes and closure. Removing the lavender field and substituting a generic outdoor space would flatten the scent motif and weaken the contrast between industrial ruin and living growth.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "as vines climb" is introduced in the opening line and recurs at key transitions (summer deepens, vines climb through windows, anniversary storm). It signals slow accumulation and natural reclamation, paralleling the community's healing pace. The anniversary date creates urgency for the storm beat, and the final night marks closure. Time does not tighten decisions in a live-clock sense but provides a coherent seasonal arc that reweights the ruin from static scar to living site. The element contributes to atmosphere and structure but does not constrain tactical choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is told in paragraph one and operationalized through her placement rules, scanning table, and walk-through plan. It drives her middle beats (asking for photos, aligning arcs) and the ending reweights it by shifting authorship from solo to collective. The motivation creates friction when the town takes ownership, forcing Mara to relinquish control—though this cost is implied rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice on the page. The element shapes stakes and closure with conceptual cost legible in the final sentence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy is signaled early in Mara's smile and answer to Mr. Gant ("A doorway, if the town wants one") and maintained through lyric diction ("word traveled the way lavender scent travels"), tea-candle halos, and the image of rescuing paper as prayer. Tone modulates during the storm (urgency tightens syntax) and softens at closure (field breathing, collective healing). The tone charges the final image by framing communal labor as both serious and playful. Coherent across turns without flattening into static mood; the whimsy balances grief without trivializing it, supporting the theme of transformation.</comment>
