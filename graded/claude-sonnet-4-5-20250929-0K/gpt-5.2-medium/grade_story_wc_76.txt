<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin's grief-driven obsession is embodied through clockmaking craft and specific micro-choices (framing the yoyo, waiting for the stone's hungriest moment). The final renunciation—letting the moment pass unaltered—is earned by his realization that the stone feeds on certainty and his need to force time is fate's true lock. Interior contradiction is visible: he can rewind the day but realizes forcing change perpetuates the trap. Minor deduction: the sister's drowning remains abstract backstory rather than viscerally anchored in present sensation, though the turn itself lands with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Orin, island, low tide). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Orin surrenders the forced rescue, the stone steadies, and he rows away knowing he initiated "a life beyond its blueprint"—visible cost in forsaking the sister-rescue and accepting the original timeline. One meaningful tightening occurs when the yoyo puzzle unlocks the stone's radiance and the drowned day rewinds, then Orin's refusal to intervene reconfigures his stance from compulsion to acceptance. Cost is legible in the act of letting the moment pass and the shift from "ravenous" hunger stone to "quiet."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rocky island, barnacled flats, spiral stairs, and cracked lenses create spatial pressure and reflect Orin's griefscape. The tide's withdrawal supplies a live time constraint that tightens his window. The hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting objects that constrain the final choice: the stone's appetite measures his shadows and the yoyo's copper circuit must close to initiate. The lighthouse lantern room charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-smeared gloom, kelp, gulls). Minor slip: the mainland shop is mentioned but never grounds the reader in prior spatial habit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue the sister by breaking fate's lock. Escalation: Orin maps the yoyo puzzle, spins it backward, and the stone rewinds the drowned day—offering the chance to call his sister from the pier. The peak turn is his refusal to intervene, recognizing the stone's hunger for certainty and his own need to force outcomes as the true lock. This choice forecloses the rescue path with visible cost (he leaves the past unchanged) and reconfigures his goal from control to acceptance. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme: control versus surrender, the seduction of reversing grief versus accepting its cost. The hunger stone and yoyo embody the premise without stating it; the stone's appetite and the yoyo's counter-clockwise motion literalize Orin's backward obsession. The ending reweights the setup: initiating the light means not rescuing the past but "a life beyond its blueprint." Subtext operates in the stone's pulsing question and Orin's silent renunciation. No moralizing; the final image (rowing away with the quiet stone) offers a resonant non-literal answer. Minor deduction: "fate's design had a lock he could not pick" is slightly on-the-nose early, though the story complicates it by revealing the lock is his own need.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable and consistent. Perceptual signature is precise and character-specific: clockmaker vocabulary ("escapements," "gear key"), counter-clockwise obsession filtering perception. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("weed-dark water," "bleak exhilaration"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the puzzle-solving and the stone's activation. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deduction: "he understood that meant when the light was lowest" slightly over-explains what the prior line already implies, reducing trust in dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Final line recharges "initiate" and "design" motifs with new weight. Figurative language is vivid and coherent ("teeth of stone," "appetite," "breathing" seam of light). Minor deductions: "counter clockwise clock maker, neatly inventive with brass and grief" is slightly ornamental in the opening and "bleak exhilaration" is repeated verbatim from the first paragraph. Template cadence risk: "He placed... threaded... and waited" in one long sentence could tighten. Overall propulsion is strong, no major loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-driven time reversal, hunger stone, and yoyo puzzle feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the lighthouse-keeper trope (using a toy to initiate the light) and the twist that the stone feeds on certainty rather than darkness elevate familiar material. The ending reconfigures the rescue-the-past premise into acceptance with cost. Minor deduction: the grief-clockmaker reversing time to save a drowned loved one is a recognizable template; the story transforms it through the hunger-stone logic and the renunciation turn, but the core arc remains familiar. Risk-taking in the bleak ending and the stone's appetite mechanic adds freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin is present throughout and his choices drive all key turns: he rows to the island (setup), reverse-engineers the yoyo puzzle (development), and crucially refuses to alter the drowned day (closure). His clockmaker identity constrains his approach (counter-clockwise logic) and enables the puzzle solution. Visible cost: he forsakes the sister-rescue and accepts the original timeline. Three beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunger stone appears in three beats: Orin reaches for it and feels its cold appetite (setup), the journal warns it stays latent until the yoyo puzzle is solved (development), and he places it in the lantern's cradle where it drinks shadows and flares into radiance, then steadies when he surrenders (closure). Its properties—measuring shadows, feeding on certainty—constrain the final choice. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" shapes stakes: Orin seeks it to power his clocks and "step beyond fate's design." The journal specifies the radiance stays latent until the yoyo puzzle is solved, framing the middle task. At closure, the radiance "poured not outward but inward" into his memories, rewinding the drowned day and forcing the choice. It alters options by offering the sister-rescue, then reconfigures when Orin realizes the stone feeds on certainty. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal role solid; cost connection visible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is signaled in the first paragraph and demonstrated in one on-page beat: Orin assembles a frame, clips the yoyo string, and uses a gear key to spin the yoyo backward—reverse-engineering the puzzle. This enables the stone's activation. Minor cost: the trait constrains his method to counter-clockwise logic, limiting his approach. Present in setup and development; one beat of visible action; closure indirect. Swappable with "mechanically skilled" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Initiate" is the story's hinge: the sailor says the keeper used the yoyo to initiate the light (setup); the journal's last line says "Initiate at the moment the stone is hungriest" (development); Orin spins the yoyo backward and the stone initiates, flaring into radiance and rewinding the drowned day (climax); the final line redefines initiate as "not a rescue of the past, but a life beyond its blueprint" (closure). Three beats; causal pressure high; closure reweights the term; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The yoyo puzzle is signaled early (sailor's clue, "Lighthouse Toy"), framed as the key method in the journal, and executed on-page: Orin maps knots, counts turns, notes the copper circuit, assembles a frame, and spins the yoyo backward until "the copper sang." This action unlocks the stone's radiance and rewinds the drowned day. Present in setup, development (extended middle beat), and closure trigger. Causal pressure solid; cost connection indirect (enables the choice but does not itself carry price). Specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse on the rocky island frames all action: Orin rows there (setup), climbs spiral stairs to the lantern room where the hunger stone and journal sit (development), and the lighthouse lens ignites at closure, "casting a beam that traced the retreating sea and then the returning tide." The setting supplies the hunger stone, the journal, and the lantern cradle—resources that enable the plot. The rocky flats and kelp anchor the tide's withdrawal, tightening the time window. Present across all three gates; causal role strong; closure image charges the beam's new function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Low tide is signaled in the opening line and tracked: the sea pulls back from stone, Orin crosses "barnacled flats," and "the tide kept withdrawing with that long, exhausted breath, giving him a narrow window before the sea returned." The journal specifies "Initiate at the moment the stone is hungriest... when the light was lowest, just before the water turned." At closure, "waves began to climb the rocks" as Orin rows away. Present in setup, middle constraint, and closure beat. Time pressure is visible but does not dramatically narrow his choices on the page; he completes the puzzle before the tide turns without visible scramble or forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated early and dramatized: Orin believes coaxing the hunger stone's radiance into his clocks will "give one moment a different ending." The stone rewinds the drowned day, offering the chance to call his sister from the pier—but Orin realizes "the stone fed on certainty, and that fate's true lock was not time but his need to force it." He lets the moment pass unaltered, surrendering the rescue. Desire is clear, conflicted in the peak choice (rescue versus acceptance), and the final line reweights the goal as "a life beyond its blueprint" rather than altering the past. Three beats; causal pressure and cost high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice and embodied throughout: grief-soaked imagery (drowned sister, salt-smeared gloom, exhausted breath of tide) paired with inventive hope (brass craft, spinning the yoyo backward, "heart racing"). The tone modulates under pressure: clinical focus during puzzle-solving, then emotional weight when the stone rewinds the day, and quiet resolve at closure ("rowed away knowing"). The final image balances bleak acceptance (sister still drowned) with exhilaration (lighthouse ignited, "life beyond its blueprint"). Coherent across turns; charges the ending.</comment>
