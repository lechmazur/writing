<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between selling fakes and wanting to help is well-embodied through her actions—charging static, running fingers near sleeves, letting her own shame flow into the petal. The professional detachment versus emerging empathy drives her choices at the closure when she takes payment "as a boundary" yet writes the brother's name on the case. Minor slip: Orin's touching his chest "as if checking a cracked compass" edges toward convenient metaphor rather than earned character detail, and his emotional arc—from numbness to tears—resolves cleanly without the messier irrationality that high-pressure grief typically carries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line ("amber grotto at dusk…Mira Voss, a counterfeit emotion dealer"). The causal lens holds: Mira's static-electricity appraisal reveals Orin's buried guilt, she chooses bitter courage over absolution, the petal's scent triggers his transformation and genuine tears—each beat narrows options and the closure lands with visible cost (she takes payment, writes the brother's name, commits to offering "something real"). One meaningful tightening is present and the cost is legible on the page. The piece does not attempt multiple reversals; pressure accumulates through the appraisal sequence and pays off in the final image of Orin walking "as if he carried a lantern under his ribs" while Mira feels "the static fade…but the insight stayed, braided with a new tenderness."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto's resinous air and amber seeping "like syrup" constrain the ritual: Mira holds the blotter over the pool to let it drink fumes, and the transformation itself depends on the space. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional focus—static crackle, scent notes, the glow of the ledge—filtered through her dealer's lens. The final image of miners watching from the path and the sky "the color of cooled embers" charges the ending. Minor gap: spatial choreography of Orin cross-legged on warm stone versus Mira's case on a ledge versus the pool's location is slightly fuzzy, though it doesn't break clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: Mira must decide whether to sell absolution or honesty as Orin's transformation completes. The appraisal tightens when static reveals the unspoken sentence—"he had pushed his brother away"—narrowing her options from bright counterfeit to bitter courage. The choice forecloses the easier path (manufactured comfort) with visible cost: she gives him guilt alongside courage, takes payment as a boundary, and writes the brother's name to resist her own half-truths. One meaningful deepening driven by protagonist agency; the cost is legible in the final lines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus counterfeit emerges through concrete particulars: vials of distilled smiles, the blotter petal that drinks meaning, Orin's "half truths in every denial," and Mira's own "long stored and unnamed" shame. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: Mira writes the brother's name "so I would not let the moment shrink into another half truth I told myself about being untouchable," and recognizes her counterfeits as "training wheels for the day I could offer something real." The piece resists tidy resolution—Orin's tears are "earned" but his guilt remains, and Mira's boundary (taking payment) coexists with her new tenderness. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—professional appraisal vocabulary ("distilled smiles," "rehearsed grief," "sugary notes"), static-electricity metaphors, and the affectionate-detachment stance filter every line. Dialogue (one brief exchange: "Tell me what you remember") feels natural and advances the appraisal. Minor register drift: "fuse insight with empathy" and "absurdly for a woman who sold fakes" edge toward essayistic phrasing that slightly breaks the tactile immediacy elsewhere sustained. The final paragraph modulates distance effectively, tightening on Mira's internal shift without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances appraisal, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully: long, layered sentences during setup compress to shorter beats at the transformation ("his coughs turned to a clear exhale, his eyes filled"). Two craft slips lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop—"amber seams" / "the mine had started" / "dust to amber" recycles the amber-transformation concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "lantern under his ribs" is vivid but leans on a familiar image rather than inventing one specific to this world. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; no opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of emotion-dealer premise, static-electricity appraisal method, and the amber-transformation constraint feels purposeful and non-obvious. The grotto setting, the blotter petal, and the half-truth motif interlock organically. Minor derivative note: the "paid to feel for others" setup and the final realization that she can offer "something real" echo familiar therapy/healer-archetype arcs, though the static-electricity specificity and the amber-lung transformation add fresh texture. Risk-taking is modest but coherent; no bold structural choices or perspectival surprises beyond the solid execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira (counterfeit emotion dealer) is present throughout, makes the key choice to give bitter courage instead of absolution, and that decision drives the closure. Early signal, causal pressure in the appraisal beat, and closure linkage (takes payment, writes the name) all strong. High irreplaceability: her profession and method define the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blotter petal appears in setup (in the case), is used in the middle beat (held over the pool to drink fumes, charged with Mira's shame), and reappears at closure when Orin inhales its scent and the transformation finishes. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the petal carries the emotion that changes Orin), and closure linkage. Specific properties (thirsty for meaning, drinks fumes) matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Half truths" frames the story: Orin's denials are half truths, his story comes in "careful fragments, each one a half truth," the unspoken sentence (pushing his brother) is the withheld truth, and Mira's self-knowledge about being "untouchable" is another half truth. The concept shapes stakes (will Mira sell a lie or force truth?) and tactics (she uses static to detect the hidden guilt). Closure explicitly references it ("so I would not let the moment shrink into another half truth"). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is signaled in the opening ("I had learned to be professionally thorough, not from ethics but from survival") and enacted when Mira runs her fingers near Orin's sleeves to map his pulse before offering comfort. The trait enables the appraisal and constrains her from taking the easy path. Visible cost at closure: she maintains the professional boundary (takes payment) even as she offers something real. Early signal, one key beat, and closure link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears once in a pivotal sentence: Mira lets her own shame "subsume the sugary notes I usually used, creating a bitter courage that matched his guilt." This action defines the major turn—she chooses honesty over absolution—and the resulting emotion triggers Orin's transformation and tears. Causal pressure is strong, closure linkage clear, and the word is irreplaceable (she could dilute, mix, or overlay, but "subsume" captures the replacement of false sweetness with bitter truth). Single beat but decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Static electricity is signaled early ("I did my appraisals by sensing through static electricity as much as by scent or speech"), used in the middle beat ("I ran my fingers an inch from his sleeves, letting tiny sparks map the salt of his skin and the tremor of his pulse…Static made truth loud"), and returns at closure when "the static fade[s] from my fingertips, but the insight stayed." The method enables Mira to detect Orin's buried guilt and shapes her choice. Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto is anchored in the opening line and its properties matter: the resinous air "could finish what the mine had started," the pool where amber seeps supplies the fumes the blotter drinks, and the warm stone where Orin sits and the dusk bleeding violet through the cave mouth charge the atmosphere. The setting enables the transformation ritual and constrains the timing (dusk → night). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage (miners watch from outside as Orin walks). The grotto is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" is signaled early ("the foreman claimed the grotto's resinous air could finish what the mine had started…he needed a feeling to carry him through the last breath") and the live clock tightens throughout: "the amber climbed his breath," "his coughs turned to a clear exhale," and the transformation finishes when he inhales the petal's scent. The timeframe creates urgency and narrows Mira's window to choose. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The desire "to fuse insight with empathy" is dramatized in the line "I wanted, absurdly for a woman who sold fakes, to fuse insight with empathy until my knowledge of him became something that could actually help." This want conflicts with her professional detachment and drives her choice to give bitter courage instead of absolution. The friction between wanting to help and maintaining boundaries plays out at closure (takes payment, writes the name). Early signal, one key beat, closure linkage, and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named in the opening line and sustained throughout: "gentle as a nurse and distant as a clerk," taking payment "as a boundary, a reminder that my affection could not become possession." The tone modulates under pressure—Mira's own shame enters the petal, and at closure she feels "a new tenderness"—but the detachment persists (she still takes the coins). The tone charges the final image: professional boundaries coexist with emerging empathy. Early signal, coherent modulation, and closure linkage.</comment>
