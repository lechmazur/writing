<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lian's core motivation—to transpose life into a new key—is embodied in her shift from passive predictor to active orchestrator, and the final choice to burn the fortunes shows agency with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction is somewhat thin: the piece tells us she wants to "stop being the woman who predicted other people's minutes" but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats. Mara's interiority remains opaque, functioning more as guide than pressure source, and the courier is a prop. The prophetic gift feels more like a convenient plot device than a flaw that drives inevitable mistakes under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lian burns the coded fortunes and writes an uncoded message, foreclosing the spycraft path with visible cost (the destruction of her intelligence-gathering channel). The causal lens holds: her earlier coded cookies reach the wrong hands, triggering the patrol boat, forcing the lens change and courier escape. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (Golden Lotus, Lian, fortune writer, microdot specs). One meaningful tightening occurs when the searchlights arrive and Lian must redirect the beam, narrowing her options and raising the stakes for both herself and the courier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse as setting constrains choice: Mara explains the beam orchestrates ferry and supply routes, and Lian uses the Fresnel lens shutters to misdirect the patrol boat, a tool-driven micro-setting moment that alters tactics under pressure. The rocky island's west-steps cleft functions as a resource that affects outcome—without it, the courier has no escape. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "cooling conveyor tick like a metronome," "kelp," "salt," though some elements (the Golden Lotus interior, the ferry crossing) receive postcard-level treatment without lived-in texture. The spatial choreography of the lighthouse (lantern room, kitchen below, exterior cleft) remains coherent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lian's desire to transpose life and escape passive prophecy—is signaled early and converges with survival pressure when the patrol boat arrives. One meaningful tightening occurs: the searchlights force Lian to push the courier into the cleft and redirect the beam, a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost (exposure risk, abandonment of the coded-cookie channel). The resolution is earned by her decision to burn the fortunes, foreclosing the spycraft path. However, the storm arriving "exactly as her own earlier fortune had promised" introduces a coincidence that complicates but borders on resolving tactical problems (Mara uses it to signal "come tonight" vs. "stay home"), weakening agency slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of open secrets—"everyone pretended not to know to keep peace"—emerges organically from the Golden Lotus whispers, the harbor's jokes about the lighthouse, and Lian's realization that "the real secret was not that the island traded in secrets, but that everyone pretended not to know." The final message, "In a new key, even silence has notes," offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: Mara "did not look surprised" and the ledger already contains tomorrow's weather in Lian's script, implying foreknowledge without explanation. The fortune-cookie motif constrains choice (coded strips become the intelligence channel, their destruction the cost) and charges the closure image, earning credit for integration rather than token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lian with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "the universe kept checking her spelling," "swept the water," and the professional bias toward phrasing and text. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional register drift toward academic phrasing ("orchestrate the rest simply by directing flow") slightly exceeds Lian's established idiom. The dialogue between Lian and the courier ("why it said, 'You will leave by the west steps after the second flash,' when there were no west steps on the map") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through subtext (the fortune as both warning and instruction). Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot—and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "she was the shop's cryptic fortune cookie writer, paid by the line, yet her fortunes had started coming true" immediately followed by "The manager called it marketing magic, but the people who ordered extra dumplings...knew it was an open secret" restates the prophetic premise without adding pressure. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third: "the light swept the water, the ferries followed the beam, the supply boats followed the ferries, and messages followed the supply boats" uses mechanical parallelism without voice motivation. The final paragraph compresses strongly ("opened the lighthouse pantry and burned every old fortune strip") but earlier bloat ("She was the shop's cryptic fortune cookie writer, paid by the line") could tighten. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in Q7; given spread into mid-section, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, spycraft microdots, and lighthouse-as-signal-control offers a specific, non-obvious angle on espionage material. The "open secrets" concept and the prophetic gift create thematic coherence. However, the premise leans on a familiar trope (accidental oracle forced into spy tradecraft) without fully transforming it through lived occupational detail or surprising moral calculus; Lian's choice to burn the fortunes feels inevitable from the setup rather than earned through conflicted values. The "transpose life into a new key" metaphor is extended but borders on ornamental rather than driving fresh insight. Risk-taking is present in the mosaic structure (Golden Lotus → ferry → lighthouse → closure) but the execution remains within safe conventions of the genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lian makes two key choices: redirecting the lighthouse beam to misdirect the patrol boat and burning the fortune strips to close the spycraft channel. Both are decision-driven beats that alter tactics and foreclose paths. She is present across all three structural shards (Golden Lotus, ferry/arrival, lighthouse crisis and closure) and her occupation (fortune writer) directly enables the coded-cookie mechanism. Swappability is low—remove her cryptic-writer role and the microdot-in-fortunes channel collapses. However, much of the middle section is observational (Mara explains the island's job; the storm arrives as foretold) rather than Lian making contested choices under pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The microdot film specs appear in two beats: Lian packs them in the opening and later uses them to mark "every seventh letter" in the coded fortunes shipped to the mainland cafe. The specs enable the intelligence channel and are causally linked to the patrol boat's arrival (the coded cookies "reached the wrong hands"). However, the specs themselves are never handled on the page in a tactile, pressure-laden moment—they are described in the drawer, mentioned as packed, and then summarized in use. The payoff is conceptual (destruction of the system) rather than a charged physical reprise of the object. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect (the fortunes, not the specs, are burned).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "open secrets" concept shapes stakes and tactics on the page: the Golden Lotus customers whisper but never report; fishermen joke about the lighthouse while steering clear; Mara lets Lian in "without asking her name, because names were another open secret here." Lian's realization mid-crisis ("the real secret was not that the island traded in secrets, but that everyone pretended not to know to keep peace") directly informs her final choice to burn the fortunes and write an uncoded message, altering tactics. The concept is not merely thematic echo—it changes options by establishing the social rule that enables the intelligence trade and the cost of breaking it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prophetic attribute constrains and enables on-page action: it drives the coded-fortune mechanism (customers order "extra dumplings because a slip said 'You will need seconds'"), and Lian's own fortune about the storm arriving early is used by Mara to signal the courier. The final fortune ("You will leave by the west steps after the second flash") functions as both prophecy and warning, enabling the escape. However, the trait itself is told more than dramatized under pressure—we see outcomes (storm arrives, fortunes come true) but not Lian wrestling with or second-guessing her predictions in a contested beat. The cost is conceptual (the gift becomes a curse unless she learns "to write what could be") rather than a visible tradeoff in a single high-stakes moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Orchestration is the method for two major turns: Mara explains that "whoever controlled the light could orchestrate the rest simply by directing flow," and Lian enacts this by changing the lens shutters to misdirect the patrol boat, a protagonist-driven escalation. The final image—Lian writing "In a new key, even silence has notes"—echoes the musical metaphor of orchestration and transposes it to her new uncoded stance. The action is not easily swappable; remove the lighthouse-beam mechanism and the tactical choice collapses. However, the word "orchestrate" itself appears only once in exposition and once in metaphor, with the mechanics (lens shutters, beam pattern) doing the causal work; the term is more thematic label than on-page verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "by directing flow" is signaled early (Mara's explanation: "the light swept the water, the ferries followed the beam...whoever controlled the light could orchestrate the rest simply by directing flow") and its mechanics matter in the climax—Lian adjusts the Fresnel lens shutters to redirect the beam inland, forcing the patrol boat to "chase a phantom channel." The means shapes the protagonist's attempt and is causally linked to the courier's escape. However, the phrase "directing flow" is summary rather than embodied action; the piece does better with "changed the lens shutters" and "adjusted the Fresnel lens" as the tactile verbs. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect (the beam returns to steady sweep after the crisis).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting pressures choices and supplies resources that affect outcome: the Fresnel lens enables Lian to misdirect the patrol boat; the west-steps cleft (an unmarked path locals use) provides the courier's escape route; the radio and lantern room establish the intelligence-relay infrastructure. The lighthouse is "a meeting place for things that did not want to be met," which the harbor's familiarity makes "a familiar enigma"—the setting embodies the open-secrets concept. The rocky island's isolation tightens the stakes (no other escape), and the storm timing (foretold by Lian's fortune) adds environmental pressure. The lighthouse is not postcard description—it is the tactical crucible that constrains and enables the final acts.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after last orders" anchors the opening beat at the Golden Lotus and establishes a nocturnal rhythm (midnight ferry, dawn fortune-writing, storm arrival, patrol boat at night). However, elapsed time is vague—phrases like "months ago," "at dawn," "when the patrol boat finally circled" lack a live clock that tightens decisions. The piece does not track minutes or hours in a way that alters moves; the storm could arrive "early" or late without changing Lian's tactical options materially. The timeframe is setup flavor rather than a constraint that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lian's motivation "to transpose life into a new key, to stop being the woman who predicted other people's minutes and start composing her own" is stated early and dramatized in the final choice: she burns the coded fortunes and writes an uncoded message, foreclosing the spycraft path with visible cost. The desire to escape passive prophecy is in friction with the intelligence work (the customer who "told her, calmly, to learn how to hide information in plain sweetness"), and the patrol-boat crisis forces her to choose between continuing the espionage channel and self-determination. However, the motivation is summarized more than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—Lian does not hesitate or second-guess on the page; the choice reads as inevitable from the setup rather than fought-for in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "familiar enigma" is coherent through turns: the Golden Lotus "open secret," the lighthouse that "everyone in the harbor knew...was a meeting place for things that did not want to be met, and that familiarity made it stranger," and Lian's realization that "the real secret was not that the island traded in secrets, but that everyone pretended not to know to keep peace." The tone modulates with pressure—calm in the opening (conveyor ticking "like a metronome"), tense when the searchlights sweep, contemplative at closure ("the honest smell of salt"). The final image ("In a new key, even silence has notes") charges the familiar-enigma tone by recasting silence as legible music rather than void, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
