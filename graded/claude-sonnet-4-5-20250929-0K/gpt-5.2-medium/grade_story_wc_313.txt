<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is consistently rooted in observation and duty, with concrete micro-choices ("I took it because our office had once cataloged…"). Her discovery sequence is causally linked to incremental photograph matching, showing investigative focus rather than epiphany. The final choice—photographing evidence and speaking at the town meeting—forecloses the path of silence with visible cost to her father's legacy. Minor issue: the phrase "precisely humane" and some reflective passages lean toward label-speak ("the lie we lived in") without full embodiment, though her actions ground the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by paragraph two (Mara, Reservoir Six, twilight ridgeway). The causal chain is tight: chime silence → drought drop → exposed Bellford → label clue → photo trail → boot print → decision to speak publicly. The closure—setting photos in the library, hanging the label, letting the chime sing—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost: breaking the institutional silence her father imposed. One small friction: the emotional arc from discovery to public disclosure feels slightly compressed in the final two paragraphs, though the decision itself is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ridgeway corkboard, exposed rooflines, bar counter, and boot print in mud are vivid and purpose-driven. The wind chime functions as micro-setting that charges both opening and closure. Spatial choreography is clear across the levee station, ridgeway, and bar doorway. Minor gap: the reservoir's physical mechanics (seep meters, weak banks) are mentioned but not shown constraining a choice on the page, remaining atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—truth versus institutional expungement—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph trail. The boot print discovery is a clear micro-reversal that narrows options: Mara can no longer deny the evacuation was incomplete. Her final decision to display evidence forecloses the silence her father maintained, with visible cost to his reputation and her inherited role. The escalation is meaningful but relatively smooth; the piece would benefit from one additional on-page moment of hesitation or friction before the town meeting decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus institutional silence, memory as audit—emerges through concrete particulars: the chime, the label, the boot print, the redacted report. The sapphire-hued label and wind chime recur with shifted meaning at closure, reweighting the opening premise without moralizing. The phrase "mirrored hush" operates as both tone and thematic mirror. The line "Listen, Mara, and then telling me to never listen again" is direct but earned by the surrounding images. The ending avoids summary and lands on action (letting the chime sing) that answers the central question through resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature—cataloging, matching angles "like stitching," vigilant warden diction—is consistent and specific. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("the mirrored hush the valley keeps at dusk"). Two frictions lower the score: (1) the phrase "precisely humane" feels elevated beyond Mara's working register, and (2) some reflective beats lean toward expository summary ("That was the lie we lived in") rather than letting image carry the weight. Still, the prose voice is controlled and the final cadence is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the photograph-matching sequence is clear and propulsive. Two notable artifacts: "I followed the clue the way my predecessor taught me, by a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory" is scaffolding that could be tightened, and "each shingle reflecting the same pale, judgmental sky" stacks metaphor without grounding. The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("One image showed… then in… then in…") but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—personal wind chime linked to institutional cover-up via drowned town artifacts—feels specific and non-obvious. The sapphire-hued label as material clue is fresh. The piece avoids template "dark family secret" resolution by grounding discovery in procedural photograph-matching and ending on public disclosure rather than private catharsis. Risk: interweaving family guilt with professional duty under drought pressure. One hedge: the "precisely humane" framing in the opening feels like prompt service rather than organic characterization, slightly weakening the sense of singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive key turns: taking the label, matching photographs, returning to the bar, photographing evidence, and speaking at the town meeting. Each decision alters tactics and forecloses paths. Present in setup, middle investigation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The label appears in three beats: found on the corkboard, matched to the bar photo, and placed on the counter at closure. It enables the photograph trail and returns with reweighted meaning (evidence of a forgotten memory). However, its causal pressure is moderate; it serves as clue rather than constraint. Removing it would weaken but not break the story if another artifact (e.g., the chime itself) performed the clue function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The resurfacing town is the engine of the plot: drought exposes Bellford, forcing the artifact trail and boot print discovery. It shapes stakes (audit versus expungement) and Mara's final action (public documentation). Present in inciting incident, middle discovery, and closure image. The concept is indispensable; without resurfacing, there is no story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is declared in the opening ("my second duty, precisely humane, to spin stories into shared meaning") and echoes in the closure choice to share truth rather than expunge it. However, it functions primarily as thematic label rather than visible constraint. The trait is consistent with Mara's final action but does not force a dramatized tradeoff on the page; the cost is to her father's legacy, not to her humanity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Expunge" anchors both the institutional imperative (to expunge rumors, to silence evidence) and the moral question. Mara's arc pivots on choosing to stop expunging. The verb appears in setup, governs the photograph investigation (father "tried to expunge" truth under paperwork), and is negated at closure ("I could either keep expunging or make room for truth"). The action redefines options and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photograph trail is signaled early ("I followed the clue the way my predecessor taught me"), structures the middle investigation (bar → family snapshot → aerial survey → dedication photo), and yields the closure revelation (boot print, father's order). The method is causally active across beats and shapes Mara's investigative tactics. Minor friction: the phrase "by a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory" is slightly on-the-nose but the mechanics matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Midnight Ridgeway appears in two beats: twilight visit to check seep meters and pre-dawn return to watch exposed roofs. The corkboard with the label is located there, enabling the discovery. However, the ridgeway itself does not constrain choices beyond serving as observation point; it is setting-as-stage rather than setting-as-pressure. The bar interior (boot print, counter) does more tactical work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chime's silence is the inciting anchor ("After the wind chime on my porch fell silent, I knew the lake had dropped again") and its return bookends the closure ("when the wind returned, I let the chime sing"). The timeframe is elegiac rather than urgent; no live clock tightens decisions. The drought progression is implied but not tracked beat-by-beat. The element shapes tone and frames the arc but does not create temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to spin stories into shared meaning so the living can stand beside the drowned without shuddering"—is declared early and tested at closure when Mara chooses public truth over institutional silence. The desire conflicts with inherited duty (her father's expungement), creating friction. However, the internal struggle is more told than shown in real-time beats; the climactic choice feels inevitable rather than agonized. Present in setup, implicit in investigation, and fulfilled at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is established in the opening ("in the mirrored hush of late summer even water sounds like listening"), recurs at the town meeting ("I spoke in the same mirrored hush the valley keeps at dusk"), and governs the prose texture throughout (quiet revelation, elegiac pacing). Tone modulates subtly from vigilance to recognition to public declaration without breaking. The tone charges the final image and is integral to the piece's emotional architecture.</comment>
