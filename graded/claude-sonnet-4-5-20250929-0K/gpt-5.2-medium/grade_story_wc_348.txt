<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear—guilt over the bridge failure drives her to atone through both technical innovation and ethical repair. The interior work is concrete and embodied at key moments (tracing foam patterns, placing the chrysalis), though the symphonic-minded trait remains mostly ornamental. The arc from isolation to engagement carries visible cost (patent rights, public testimony), but the chemical epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly without prior struggle over the adhesive problem. Minor slips: her brother's voice in the chrysalis memory feels slightly convenience-placed rather than deeply integrated into her working grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (foam patterns → adhesive insight → settlement action → new bridge). Orientation anchors quickly: polymer chemist, braided ravine, one year post-disaster. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara crosses the new bridge, witnessing foam braid below, believing her work can "make a connection without erasing the split"—a crystallized stance with visible prior cost (settlement, patent license, public admission). One meaningful tightening occurs when the foam insight narrows her technical path and enables the ethical repair sequence. Cost is legible: she forfeited patent control and faced families. The lens holds cleanly, though the midpoint epiphany compresses causal steps more than ideal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The braided ravine functions as both setting and conceptual anchor: gravel bars, foam rafts, scalloped patterns, and ruined abutments ground spatial action and directly enable the polymer insight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (chemist sees "boundary conditions," "shear lines"). The ravine constrains choice—Mara must come here to trace patterns—and charges the final image when she crosses the new bridge and hears the hammer-water duet. Field station and cairn provide micro-settings that advance beats without catalog padding. Minor limitation: the "warm rock" and "confluence" moments trend slightly generic in phrasing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is atonement through technical and ethical repair, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: foam insight enables a stress-responsive adhesive, which unlocks the settlement/license path and new bridge construction. Agency is clear—Mara drafts the formulation, writes to families, volunteers patent rights, testifies—and each step forecloses comfort (corporate resistance, public exposure). The corporation "balks" and the technician's testimony "cracks the narrative in the right direction," providing a reversal with visible cost. Escalation is modest but coherent; the resolution avoids passive luck. The final walk across the bridge tests her belief under self-imposed scrutiny, completing the arc with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—connection without erasure, repair that honors the break—emerges organically from ravine braiding, polymer blends that "braid microdomains," and the ethical choice to fund a safer crossing rather than hide. The chrysalis motif ("you can leave a form behind and still fly" → "change was not betrayal") evolves across three beats and charges the cairn placement without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the foam-tracing silence and the "duet, not a dirge" final image. The insight that "leaving and joining were the same motion at different scales" risks slight abstraction but remains anchored in concrete polymer science and river observation. No thematic echo or late moralizing; the ending invites reflection through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Voice carries distinct texture: "symphonically minded habit," "scalloped rafts," "naming catalysts like instruments." Perceptual signature is chemist-filtered (shear lines, boundary conditions, microdomains), and the "See, you can leave a form behind" brother-voice memory feels plausibly recalled idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during foam-tracing, slightly elevated during the settlement summary. Minor weaknesses: "the pieces fall into place in her mind the way themes resolve in a slow movement" leans tell-heavy, and a few abstract phrases ("grief loosened enough to let curiosity in") drift from embodied perception. No head-hopping; quote mechanics are clean; the final shift to present-tense internal voice ("she believed her work could make...") reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the foam-insight and bridge-crossing beats. Sentence variety supports momentum, and figurative language (braiding, duet/dirge, stitching) is coherent and load-bearing. Weaknesses: several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear—"she had come to translate... for rivers but for people, for ethics, for the way blame fractures" chains prepositional phrases mechanically; "not to argue but to admit... offer what she could repair" repeats structure without added pressure. The phrase "as proof that change was not betrayal" and "leaving and joining were the same motion" edge toward abstraction rather than concrete image. The final paragraph's "quiet finale" risks stock phrasing. Proofreading is clean; no major artifacts touch the closure beat, but mid-passage scaffold and synonym churn ("distinct until they chose to mingle" echoes prior "split and rejoined") lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry, river hydrology, and ethical atonement is specific and non-obvious. The stress-responsive adhesive concept (microdomains that force cracks to "wander and weaken") feels researched and purposeful, not ornamental. The braided-ravine setting and foam-insight method avoid cliché disaster-redemption arcs by embedding technical causality in the repair. Transformation is evident: the chrysalis and "divergent path" tropes shift from stock to integral through the polymer-blend parallel. Risk: the story commits to a reflective, lyric accumulation rather than high-conflict drama, and it succeeds without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "symphonically minded" trait and some phrasing ("themes resolve in a slow movement") lean toward writerly ornament rather than lived urgency.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Polymer chemist shapes all three gates: present by opening sentence (setup), enables foam-insight and formulation mid-story (development), and her professional standing allows patent-license offer and technician corroboration at closure (payoff). Causal pressure is high—only a chemist with adhesive expertise can diagnose the brittleness problem and propose the stress-responsive bond. The element is irreplaceable: swap to generic engineer and the polymer-blend insight collapses. Visible cost: her reputation and patent rights are wagered. Present across beats: ravine observation, field-station drafting, hearing testimony, final bridge walk. Tight integration; removing "polymer chemist" breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Empty chrysalis appears in opening (specimen jar, "light as the grief she had finally allowed to loosen"), mid-story memory (brother's voice: "you can leave a form behind and still fly"), and closure (placed beneath cairn). The object reweights across beats: initially a symbol of abandonment, later reinterpreted as proof that "change was not betrayal," finally laid to rest after grief loosens. It does not constrain a physical choice but charges the emotional arc and closure image. Specificity is strong (empty, in a jar, clinks in pack), yet it remains more lyric accent than causal lever. All three gates met; lyric reprise is purposeful; reaches mid-6s on resonance but lacks direct action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Divergent path" is signaled early ("contract pushed her onto a divergent path"), returns at closure ("this better divergent path"), and operates thematically throughout (rivers split/rejoin, polymer domains segregate/braid, Mara's career fork). It shapes the dominant stake (atonement as choosing a new professional/ethical path) and charges the final image. Causal work is moderate: the concept frames her inquiry but does not narrow a specific mid-story choice. Present at setup and payoff; thematic coherence is high, yet the core concept is more organizing metaphor than action-forcing constraint. Reaches setup + payoff gates with thematic payoff; mid-5s baseline lifted by closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded habit of hearing lab instruments as strings and brass" appears in the opening sentence and recurs when she imagines "naming catalysts like instruments" and hears hammer blows as "duet, not a dirge." The trait colors perception and voice but does not constrain or enable a plotted choice with cost. It is swappable (another sensory metaphor—visual, tactile—would serve equally). Setup gate met; development and payoff are ornamental rather than causal. Label-only use without action pressure or visible tradeoff; remains atmospheric texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Atone" is the story's spine: present from opening ("came here to atone in the only language she trusted"), drives foam-insight (seeking repair method), compels letter to families and settlement proposal, and resolves in bridge-crossing belief that her work can connect "without erasing the split." All three gates strongly met. Causal pressure is decisive—every major turn traces to atonement drive. The action is irreplaceable: swap to "move on" or "investigate" and the ethical stakes collapse. Visible cost: public admission, patent forfeiture, exposure to families. Strong integration; removing this action breaks closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Foam-tracing insight is signaled early (kneeling, tracing patterns with twig), provides the breakthrough ("if she could tune the curing reaction to respond to stress the way foam responded to collision"), and enables the formulation and new adhesive at closure. All three gates met. The method is specific (shear lines, boundary conditions, microdomains braiding) and irreplaceable—generic "inspiration" would lose causal texture. Causal pressure: the insight directly narrows her technical options and unlocks the ethical repair path. Visible mechanics matter: foam patterns teach the stress-responsive principle on the page. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine is present throughout: opening location, site of foam-tracing insight, setting for cairn placement, and vantage for final bridge crossing. It supplies the foam patterns (causal resource), embodies the separation/connection theme, and constrains choice—Mara must come here to observe the natural analogue. All three gates strongly met. The setting is irreplaceable: a lake or canyon would not provide braiding streams and scalloped foam rafts. Causal work is high: environment enables the technical breakthrough. Charges the final image ("converging currents a quiet finale"). Tight spatial choreography; no postcard padding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"As the pieces fall into place" labels the moment of insight but does not function as a live ticking clock. Timeframe is present (one year post-flood, "late summer" bridge completion) yet does not tighten on-page decisions or escalate pressure within the single-scene/summary window. The element anchors backstory duration but is swappable with minor phrasing edits. Setup gate met (signaled early); development and payoff are absent—no moment where shrinking time forces a tactical shift. Functional but replaceable; reaches low-4s on setup alone.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Translate separation into connection" is stated early, dramatized through foam-insight (polymer blends that braid rather than segregate), and tested in the ethical choice (settlement funds a crossing rather than hiding the break). All three gates met. The motivation drives causal choices: drafting formulation, writing to families, volunteering patent rights. Friction is visible—corporate resistance, public exposure, grief that must loosen before curiosity can enter. The desire is irreplaceable: swap to "forget" or "prove innocence" and the thematic/action arc collapses. Strong integration; cost is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Loosened grief" is signaled early ("light as the grief she had finally allowed to loosen"), modulates under pressure (snapping-cable auditory flashback, chrysalis reinterpretation), and resolves in the final belief that "her work could make a connection without erasing the split." Tone is coherent and purposeful: somber opening, tentative curiosity at foam insight, quiet resolve at bridge crossing. It charges the final image ("duet, not a dirge") without flatlining into resolution. All three gates met; tone constrains voice (reflective, measured) and supports closure effect. Minor limitation: "for the first time since the flood she believed" edges toward tell, but the progression is dramatized across beats.</comment>
