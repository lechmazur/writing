<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomniac motivation and methodical hope are clearly anchored in concrete action—painting panes, offering tea, proposing the rooftop alphabet—but her internal contradictions remain shallow; the piece tells us she needs proof "for survival" without dramatizing a competing fear or cost that would make her renunciation of sleep feel earned. Ro's grandmother memory arrives as convenient backstory that neatly solves his skepticism rather than complicating it. The final sleep as "trust" reads declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative lens: moonlight sparks daydreams, script accrues on glass, strangers return with offerings, and the final word "rouse" reweights the premise with felt cost (Mira surrendering to sleep after sustained vigil). Orientation anchors promptly (rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, waxing moon cycle). One tightening occurs when Ro's memory unseals and he agrees to collaborate, narrowing Mira's solitary method into shared proof. The closure lands as Charged Poise—sleep as trust, the last word inscribed—but the cost is more asserted ("finally felt sleep approach") than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, citrus trees, saffron crocuses, smog-choked streetlamps, and moon-tipped brush constrain and charge multiple beats: Mira paints panes because street visibility is nil, Ro removes his mask (toxic dawns), the thermos of saffron tea offers hospitality, and the final glow draws passersby who mouth remembered sounds. The micro-setting (greenhouse panes as canvas) directly enables the proof Mira seeks. Spatial choreography (metal stairs, brightest patch of moonlight, street-level view upward) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and pressure tightens when Ro arrives questioning the "secret graffiti," then deepens when his grandmother's memory unseals and he commits to the rooftop alphabet project. The escalation is primarily Accumulative (single skeptic to multiple passersby returning with offerings) rather than a causal turn that narrows options. The visible cost at closure is implied (Mira's vigil ending, the word "rouse" inscribed) but the price paid—what she forfeits by trusting sleep—remains abstract rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (kindness persists, changes form, and can be recovered through shared memory) emerges from concrete actions—jam shared, brush given, tea poured, script painted, offerings returned—without overt moralizing until the final lines hint at "trust" and the word "rouse." The moon-tipped brush and lost language function as more than symbols; they constrain Mira's method and rouse Ro's memory, charging the closure image. The piece resists binary resolution (the city's toxicity persists, only a pocket of proof forms) and the non-literal answer (writing "rouse" before sleep) reweights the premise without a stated moral, though the phrase "methodically hopeful" recurs as a near-label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mira as focalizer; psychic distance contracts appropriately when Ro's memory surfaces ("his shoulders rose as if his lungs had found a cleaner pocket of air"). Diction ("methodically hopeful," "hinge she needed," "sealed envelope") is purposeful but occasionally slips toward elevated register ("crescent shells," "rouse daydreams") that reads more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse and functional—Ro asks about graffiti, Mira explains, Ro whispers the next line—without strong subtext or distinct idiom between speakers. The perceptual signature (moonlight, saffron, crescent strokes) is consistent but not idiosyncratic enough to feel irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high in most beats (moon-tipped brush carries backstory and present function, greenhouse setting supplies multiple pressures), but the piece suffers from template cadence ("she was," "he was," "they would") and synonym loops ("methodically hopeful" appears twice without reweighting, "rouse/roused" recurs three times in close proximity). The phrase "as if" appears four times in under 800 words, flattening immediacy. The closure paragraph lists consequences ("passersby paused," "some returned," "gifts land") in summary fashion rather than dramatizing one beat with specificity. No paraphrase loops touch the final image directly, so artifact penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis (lost language + kindness + moonlight + rooftop graffiti as proof) is specific and coherent, but the constituent parts—insomniac artist, smog dystopia, magical moonbeam, stranger recognizes past kindness—echo familiar templates (hopepunk, solarpunk memory recovery, pay-it-forward myth). The moon-tipped brush's origin story (jam for brush, Sayeed's promise) and Ro's grandmother twist add fresh detail, yet the emotional arc (skeptic convinced by memory, community forms around art) follows predictable beats. The final word "rouse" as both verb and closure device is a neat touch but not enough to overcome the derivative premise guardrail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's choices—painting panes, inviting Ro in, proposing the rooftop alphabet, writing the final word—drive every major beat and the closure. She appears in all three gate zones (setup, middle collaboration, ending inscription). Her insomniac trait constrains the vigil and the decision to sleep carries conceptual cost (trust vs. proof-seeking). Causal pressure is clear: without her agency, no script accrues, no community forms. The element is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brush appears in setup (Sayeed's gift), middle (painting the song's first line), and implicitly at closure (writing "rouse"). Its moon-tipped crescent shape matters twice (catching lost letters, lifting to let Ro whisper). The brush enables the method but is not irreplaceable—any calligraphy tool with symbolic backstory could serve. Cost is tied to Sayeed's promise rather than the brush's unique properties. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage place it solidly in the essential range, but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lost languages shape stakes from the opening (letters drift up, city ground schools to dust) through middle (script on panes makes Ro's chest hurt) to closure (passersby mouth sounds their tongues remember). The concept defines Mira's proof-seeking and the method (painting scripts before morning erases them). It constrains choices—only the moon-tipped brush can catch them, only moonlight sparks them—and charges the final image (offerings as proof, "rouse" as last word). The element is causally active across all three gates and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears twice as a label (opening and closure paragraph) framing Mira's approach, but the trait does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The attribute describes her stance (painting night after night, proposing the alphabet experiment) rather than enabling or foreclosing a choice. It functions as thematic coloring rather than a tactical lever. Two-gate presence (setup and closure) with lyric resonance but no middle friction or cost connection places it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears as the final word Mira writes, the verb describing passersby's reaction ("roused from their hurry"), and implicitly in Ro's memory being unsealed. The action defines the story's success metric (strangers roused to remember kindness) and the closure's charge. It participates in at least three beats (Ro's memory, passersby pausing, final inscription) and is irreplaceable—no synonym carries the dual sense of awakening and social召. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all elevate the score, though the action's peak use (final word) is told rather than dramatized in full sensory detail.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moonlight sparking daydreams is signaled early ("daydreams sparked by moonlight began to move behind her eyes") and recurs in the middle beat (Mira lets moonlight rouse Ro's memory, "moonbeam warmed the glass"). The method constrains Mira's work (only under moonlight can she see the letters) and enables the climactic memory-unsealing. It appears in all three gates and shapes two key beats. However, the mechanics remain vague—what exactly does "letting her own daydreams rouse his" entail?—limiting causal specificity. Closure linkage is indirect (the waxing moon's "steady climb" frames the final moment but does not appear in the last action).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies pressure and resources across all three gates: smog below drives Mira upward (setup), glass panes serve as canvas (middle), and the glowing roof draws passersby with offerings (closure). The setting constrains choices (toxic street air makes rooftop necessary, greenhouse transparency allows street-level visibility) and charges the final image (glow as proof, gifts landing). The micro-setting (panes as medium, metal stairs as access) alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The waxing moon cycle frames the entire story ("night after night," "sixth night of the waxing moon," "rest of the waxing moon," "moon's steady climb") and provides a ticking clock that tightens Mira's vigil. The timeframe constrains the daydream method (only moonlight works) and signals progression toward the full moon. It appears in all three gates and matters to the ending's sense of accumulation. However, the moon does not impose a hard deadline that alters tactics—Mira could theoretically continue indefinitely—so the time pressure is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is stated early ("wanted proof, not for pride but for survival") and dramatized through actions: painting scripts, inviting Ro in, proposing the rooftop alphabet, watching gifts land "like proof." The desire is tested when Ro questions the graffiti (friction between her hope and his skepticism) and fulfilled when offerings arrive. The motivation drives all major beats and charges the closure (proof achieved, sleep becomes possible). However, the "for survival" claim is never unpacked with visible cost or competing want, so the friction remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Saffron appears three times (opening description, saffron tea, final "saffron quiet") establishing a warm, muted tonal palette that contrasts with the smog-choked city. The tone modulates subtly under pressure (Ro's red eyes and thin knock introduce urgency, the final paragraph breathes into trust) without breaking coherence. "Saffron quiet" as a phrase charges the closure by linking the opening's sensory anchor to the ending's repose. However, the tone does not constrain a choice or create tactical friction—it colors rather than pressures. Lyric reprise and closure participation place it in the mid-6s, but lack of causal force prevents higher scoring.</comment>
