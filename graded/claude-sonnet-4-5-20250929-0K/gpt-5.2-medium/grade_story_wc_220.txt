<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio's interior carries strong specificity ("named people by the smells on their sleeves") and the choice to follow Sera's riddle is rooted in a coherent hierarchy of values. The relationship with Morrow as translator of truth provides embodied pressure. Sera's arc—luring scouts, broadcasting betrayal—drives the closure with agency, though her binding feels slightly telescoped and the council's conversion by broadcast lacks visceral friction. Minor: the "tint of red that no desert could keep" edges toward poetic over-grounding without full payoff in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors POV, wasteland settlement, and post-war timeframe by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: riddle → cylinder decryption → relay station → broadcast, with each beat narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change (secrets into signal; camps answering) paired with visible cost (guards running, Morrow stepping between). The cylinder's content revelation motivates the relay-station journey without hand-waving. One minor linkage slip: Sera "hidden herself... until I solved her riddle" compresses her agency and timing in a way that feels slightly convenient, though it doesn't break causality outright.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard's catwalks, rusted heaps, and blue lamps anchor spatial choices. The phonograph cylinder and waxed leaf function as micro-setting that charges the closure (leaf warm from skin, cylinder grooves read by needle and mirror). Sensory filter is purposeful: bolts cooling, wind hush, Morrow's whine. The relay station's "field of sunken antennas" arrives late but constrains the final beat. Minor: "cracked flats" and "open cracks" are under-differentiated in traversal, leaving the path slightly abstract when specificity would sharpen Morrow's route.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: expose the council's betrayal and protect Sera. The riddle-solving beat tightens options (copper coils traded, cylinder decrypted), and the broadcast decision at the relay station forces Lio to stand beside Sera against armed guards—a turn with visible cost (guards running, camps mobilizing). Morrow's choice to bark "at the lies" rather than at people crystallizes stance and participates in resolution. The warlord-coordinate setup raises external pressure efficiently. One hairline weakness: the camps' instant coordinated response ("closing the wasteland with voices") compresses collective action without dramatizing friction, slightly softening the final cost's texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of distance into closeness operates through concrete beats: Morrow's companionship, Sera's message-running, the phonograph revealing hidden coordinates, and the broadcast collapsing isolation. "All confession was just sound turned sideways" seeds the cylinder payoff without moralizing. The waxed leaf as a "color of home" anchors longing without abstraction. The ending's "closing the wasteland with voices" answers the thematic question through image rather than thesis. Minor: "truth always arrived with a smell first" edges toward aphorism in a way that slightly flattens what the scene already demonstrates through Morrow's nose and Lio's riddle work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lio's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: naming by smell, reading grooves by lamplight, trusting the bloodhound over council words. Diction stays grounded in the POV's scavenger lexicon ("bolts cooling," "catwalks of welded rebar and prayer"). No head-hopping; focalization is stable. Sera's single line of dialogue ("Lio, keep the leaf...") reads purposeful and distinct from narration. Rhythm modulates under pressure: the cylinder-reading beat compresses syntax ("Letters rose... tinted revelations"), then opens for the broadcast finale. Zero filter-verb stacks in peak moments. The phrase "wild hush" recurs as tone anchor without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance image, motive, or causality. Rhythm varies purposefully (longer syntactic braids in setup, shorter cuts during the cylinder read). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The figurative language ("split like pottery," "sound turned sideways") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor: "watching the mirror catch minute shadows as the cylinder turned" and "Letters rose out of those shadows, tinted revelations that looked stained by smoke" compress two slightly redundant descriptions of the same visual mechanism within three lines, creating a micro-loop that slightly dulls momentum before the payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The phonograph-as-text premise and the scavenger-who-names-by-smell are fresh angles that avoid stock post-apocalypse templates. The riddle's "turn the storm backward" integrates the cylinder-decryption mechanic organically. The waxed autumn leaf as memory anchor is specific and non-ornamental. Risk-taking in voice (compressed poetic syntax, metaphor density) heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Minor: the "bloodhound retired from finding bodies" and "council selling refugee coordinates to a warlord" are recognizable genre moves; the story transforms them through the cylinder and leaf particulars, but the underlying betrayal-and-broadcast arc follows a template that limits the synthesis's full surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Morrow is present in opening, middle (whines at the council's lie, sniffs locket/floor/door, leads across catwalks), and ending (steps between Lio and guards, barking at lies). His route-finding enables the relay-station arrival, and his final bark participates in the closure's pressure. The beat count (≥3) and closure linkage are strong. One friction: his "choice" at the end reads more as embodied symbol than a decision with visible cost—he doesn't forfeit safety or shift allegiance on the page, only manifests what the text has already established as his nature.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The waxed autumn leaf appears in Sera's shack (first beat: discovery anchors the riddle), is referenced in the cylinder message ("keep the leaf, because it remembers the color of home"), and returns warm from Sera's skin at the relay station, where Lio stands beside her. Three beats, early signal, closure linkage. The "tint of red that no desert could keep" charges the leaf with thematic resonance (home, distance into closeness). Minor: the leaf's role in the middle is recounted rather than handled—Lio doesn't make a choice about it between discovery and finale, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is literalized in the cylinder decryption ("letters rose... tinted revelations that looked stained by smoke") and governs the mechanic that unlocks Sera's message. The concept shapes the middle beat (cylinder read) and enables the relay-station payoff. Early signal is implicit in "secret texts in the grooves." Closure participation is indirect—the broadcast itself is auditory, not visual/tinted—so the concept's charge at the ending is thematic rather than tactical. One cost: Lio trades copper coils for the cylinder, tying the concept to resource pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is demonstrated in the opening ("named people by the smells on their sleeves") and pays off when Lio trusts Morrow's nose over the council's words—a choice with relational and tactical cost. The trait enables the riddle-solving beat (reading grooves by lamplight, a synesthetic/descriptive skill). Present in two beats; early signal. Friction: the trait is more label than constraint in the final scene, where Lio's actions (standing beside Sera, following Morrow) don't visibly hinge on descriptive intuition. Swappability test: "observant" or "perceptive" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The riddle ("turn the storm backward and read the rivers on its spine") is discovered early, drives the cylinder-decryption beat (major turn), and its solution unlocks the relay-station coordinates that lead to Sera and the broadcast. Three beats, early signal, closure participation. The riddle's mechanics (storms = cylinders, grooves = rivers) are specific and teach the world's logic. Cost: Lio trades coils and risks the seller's warning ("cried blood"). One friction: Sera's phrasing is highly literary for a signal-runner under duress, edging toward authorial convenience, but the voice consistency within the riddle itself holds.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phonograph-groove method is seeded early ("taught me to decipher the secret texts"), executed in the middle beat (needle, mirror, cylinder turning, letters rising), and its product (Sera's message) drives the relay-station journey and broadcast. Present in three beats; the mechanic matters (mirror/needle/grooves are handled, not summarized). Closure linkage is causal but one step removed—the broadcast itself uses a different device (receiver). Cost: copper coils, and the method's risk ("cried blood" warning). Minor: the mirror-and-needle optics are compressed; a reader might wonder how shadows encode letters without more grounding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement spans opening (catwalks, heaps, lamps, Sera's shack, barter pit) and middle (Lio crosses it to trade coils, read cylinder under tarp). The cracked wasteland governs Morrow's route to the relay station (no map, paws choosing). The settlement's resource economy (copper coils as currency) constrains the cylinder acquisition. The relay station's sunken antennas close the spatial arc. Present in all three structural beats; the cracks and catwalks charge the final crossing. Minor: the open cracks' traversal is under-detailed—Morrow's route reads efficient but slightly abstract, reducing the setting's tactical pressure in the penultimate beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" anchors the world's scarcity and the council's water-for-coordinates trade. The timeframe explains the phonograph relics and the settlement's scrap economy. Present in two beats (setup, council motivation). Friction: the timeframe doesn't tighten a present decision or create a live clock—Sera's disappearance and the relay journey unfold without urgency markers (days? hours?). The post-war frame is functional backdrop but swappable for "long drought" or similar scarcity premise without altering plot mechanics. No closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is embodied in Morrow's companionship ("he still wanted to translate distance into closeness"), Lio's choice to follow the riddle (closing distance to Sera), and the broadcast finale (camps answering, "closing the wasteland with voices"). Present in three beats; the motivation drives both the cylinder-solving and the relay-station stand. Cost: Lio risks guards and trades resources. Minor: the motivation is more thematic frame than on-page friction—Lio's want to close distance doesn't visibly conflict with a competing need (e.g., safety, council favor), slightly reducing the felt tension of the choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears literally ("wind moved through heaps... in a wild hush," "in the wild hush between wind gusts") and governs the settlement's atmosphere. The tone modulates: quiet at the cylinder read, urgent at the relay station ("Morrow stepped between us, barking... and in that hush the camps answered"). The hush charges the final image—silence broken by coordinated voices. Present in opening, middle, and ending; the tone's shift under pressure is legible and purposeful. The phrase recurs without becoming mechanical, and the final "hush" reweights the opening's isolation into collective response.</comment>
