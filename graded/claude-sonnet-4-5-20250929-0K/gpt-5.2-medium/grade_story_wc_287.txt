<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's wistfully pragmatic stance is embodied through concrete choices—keeping seedlings alive in wind, translating mirror-shard instincts to harbor locks—and her fear channeled into task drives escalation cleanly. Jonas is less developed but functional; his lock-gauge trust creates the crucible without becoming fully dimensional. Interior texture stays consistent ("fear without a task is what kills her") and the final tending of the rosebush earns stasis through prior causality. Minor: the smuggler threat remains abstract, lowering antagonistic pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mara waters the stripped canes and arranges mirrors knowing darkness is "only a corner that can be turned," foreclosing retreat into invented safety with the repaired gauge as anchor. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—garden practice accretes into harbor competence through mirrored moonlight—held cleanly to the end. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (fire escape, harbor, Pier Nine). One meaningful deepening (mirror-shard competence validated) suffices at this length. The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "endings still need tending" as the exact legibility moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fire-escape planters, harbor pilings, and customs cages supply resources that alter tactics (mirror shards wedged between bolts to angle moonlight). Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical iron, skiff, and pier. The rosebush's stripped canes charge the final image, functioning as micro-setting that reconfigures meaning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (luminous spill of silver, quivering hush, oar rhythm). The lockmaster occupation reads plausible in scope and the mirrored-moonlight recurrence constrains the detective choice, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validate vertical-garden instincts beyond flowers—signals early and tightens through one key choice: kneeling beside the cage to reflect light, which narrows options and exposes Mara to disaster. The scratch-mark discovery and radio call escalate under the Accumulative lens via a credible agency choice with visible cost (standing "one mistake away"). No antagonist on the page and the smuggler truck is stopped off-stage, lowering confrontation pressure slightly. The ending forecloses retreat with felt cost scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central question—whether carefully tended light can navigate darkness beyond one's invented domain—emerges from concrete particulars (foil shards, mirror wedges, rosebush canes) without thesis statement. The final image of mirrors arranged on landings offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "darkness is not a room you must stay in, only a corner that can be turned." The repaired gauge as promise and the oar-rhythm callback reweight prior material cleanly. Subtext operates in gesture (gauge left on sill) and the piece resists tidy morals while embracing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Mara notices wind-threat to seedlings, translates sunrise into stairwell safety). Diction remains within POV lexicon with occasional lyric elevation ("quivering hush," "luminous spill") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Jonas's single line of dialogue reads natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs are sparse. The rhythmic control under pressure (oar cadence instilling courage) heightens without obscuring clarity. Minor: some figurative density in transit beats ("thin green ladder," "bones in moonlight") borders on decorative but stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance action or charge imagery. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes with the turns. The rosebush/mirror/gauge motifs recur with evolving meaning, no loops detected. Minor figurative muddle: "thin green ladder" and "bones in moonlight" cluster without clear causal work, and "quivering hush" repeats as texture rather than constraint. Some filter verbs ("feeling every step," "understands her garden") dull immediacy in mid-beats. The closure beat is clean, limiting penalty reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of vertical gardening as detective instinct is specific and non-obvious, and the mirrored-moonlight mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. The piece transforms the mentor-protégé template through occupational specificity (bitting gauge, lockmaster seal) and the wistfully pragmatic stance. Risk is moderate: the lyric texture and accumulative lens are executed competently but not boldly. The emotional arc could function with different names and a different harbor, suggesting surface freshness rather than deep transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara frames the opening (fire escape gardener, rosebush's final petal), drives the middle choice (kneeling to wedge mirror shards at Pier Nine), and anchors closure (watering stripped canes, arranging new mirrors). Her decisions alter tactics under pressure and her agency shapes the scratch-mark discovery. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Cost is tied to her renunciation of safety and the gauge left on her sill as promise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bitting gauge tooth appears in three beats: Jonas holds it up (snapped off, seal failure), Mara tucks it "like a seed," Jonas fits it back to measure scratch marks, then it returns repaired on her sill. The broken/repaired arc charges the ending and the gauge enables the scratch-pattern detection. Setup early, development middle (measuring scratches), payoff strong (left as promise). Causal pressure and closure linkage meet; specificity (lockmaster tool) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears twice as atmosphere (when Jonas knocks, when he radios his captain) but does not constrain choices or alter tactics. It supports tone but remains ornamental texture. Setup present, no middle constraint, minimal closure payoff. Functional as motif but swappable with "tense silence" or similar. Scores mid-band for coherent presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic about trouble" is dramatized once: Mara does not ask who is smuggling, only what Jonas needs, because "fear without a task is what kills her." This constrains her response and enables the mirror-shard choice. Setup early, one clear development beat with visible cost (exposure to danger), payoff implicit in final tending. Causal pressure moderate; one strong beat lifts it past replaceable but lacks closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Instill" appears twice with evolving weight: oar rhythm "instills courage in her ribcage," then mirrors "instilling in her neighbors the simple belief that darkness is not a room you must stay in." Setup via oar cadence, development as internal shift, payoff in final image with charged meaning. The action redefines her stance and anchors closure. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Not fully indispensable but integral to the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rhythm of oars in water" appears once in the skiff beat, instilling courage and teaching darkness to "keep time and behave," then returns obliquely in the stairwell: "she can almost hear oars again, steadying her breath." Setup middle, no direct development constraint, payoff as echo. The method matters emotionally but does not shape tactical attempts. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly, landing low-6s for coherent presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight supplies the resource (moonlight) Mara reflects into cages to expose the scratch; it appears in opening ("luminous spill of silver"), middle (mirrored moonlight across lock faces), and ending (moonlight slides down iron steps). Setup early, development strong (enables detection), payoff charges final image. Causal pressure and closure linkage are solid; the setting constrains tactics and the specificity (moon as light source) is irreplaceable for the mirror mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" anchors the opening and the rosebush's stripped state pressures Mara's sense of endings needing tending, seeding her readiness to help Jonas. It returns in closure when she waters the canes. Setup strong, development oblique (the "tonight" frame holds but does not tighten), payoff present. The petal-drop moment primes her stance but does not create a live clock that alters moves. Lyric reprise with moderate causal weight lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is dramatized in the pier beat (wedging mirror shards to angle moonlight, exposing the scratch) and recurs in the ending (arranging mirrors on landings to make every landing visible). Setup implicit in fire-escape mirrors for children, development strong with visible cost (risk of discovery), payoff clear. The desire drives two key beats and closure, though Jonas initiates the plot. Causal pressure and closure linkage justify low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is coherent throughout: Mara feels "that protected vulnerability of being trusted while standing one mistake away from disaster" at the pier, and the final image ("steadying her breath, instilling...belief that darkness is not a room you must stay in") modulates the tone into quiet resolve. Setup in Jonas's knock and "quivering hush," development at the cage (close to disaster), payoff charges the ending. Tone modulates with pressure and supports the final reconfiguration, meeting low-7s for coherence and charge.</comment>
