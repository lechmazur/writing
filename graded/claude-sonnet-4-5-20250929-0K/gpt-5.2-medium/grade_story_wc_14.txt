<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haru's interiority is concrete and particularized—his desire to "collect the textures of different times" drives micro-choices (carrying the notepad to the garden, placing gilded slips at crossings). The transition from fluorescent-lamp charting to bonsai-labyrinth work shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. However, the final choice ("wrote a final history in which the people returned quietly") feels more declared than dramatized; the embodied cost of renunciation or endurance is implied but not viscerally felt on the page. No emotional label-speak mars the peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Haru frames silence "not as loss but as pause waiting to be scored" and writes a history that catalogs sensation rather than prediction, forecloses easy redemption, and carries conceptual cost (the town may stay mute). The lens is Accumulative/Textural throughout—density increases from indoor lamp-hum to layered garden sensory data, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. The orientation anchor (town silent, Haru gilded-leaf stationer) lands by ~80 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful deepening (shop to mountaintop, thin to rough grain) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains Haru's method: "paths twisted between knee-high pines," "leaf-rustle and distant river" mix with lamp-hum to refract fiercer rhythm, and tactile anchors (brittle needles, wet soil, bruised petals) charge his invented histories. The split bonsai oak's scar becomes the final image where silence is reweighted as pause. Sensory hierarchy reflects the stationer's priorities (gold leaf, paste, cedar, paper slips catching light). No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome; the garden's living persistence despite abandonment tensions the premise purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: collect time-textures before they fade. Pressure deepens once—from thin indoor hum to rougher outdoor grains—and the tightening is a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: the combined rhythm refracts more fiercely, Haru invents broader histories (war years, romances), and the split oak becomes the site where silence shifts from loss to scored pause. Agency manifests as attention and method that foreclosed naive hope (no prediction, only cataloged sensation). The cost is conceptual and legible: the town may stay mute, yet he can "still name their time." One deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory and witness under erasure—emerges from particulars: charting hum-lines, placing gilded slips, matching histories to textures (brittle/wet/bruised). The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Haru carries "cataloged sensations" rather than predictions, reframing silence as scored pause with undeniable cost (streets may stay mute). No prompt-echo or thesis statement mars the ending. The bonsai's layered air ("pages pressed together") and the gold-leaf breadcrumbs recur with shifted meaning, charging closure without symbolic convenience. Subtext operates in gesture (letting himself mourn "with incandescent restraint") and implication (invented histories as "careful reconstructions").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds stable psychic distance throughout; focalization anchors in Haru's perceptual signature (stationer's attention to paste, cedar, gold, grid-notes, textures). Diction remains within his lexical range—"earnestly studious," "refract," "incandescent restraint"—without register drift. The prose modulates purposefully: compressed early beats ("no one remains to read it") expand in the garden to richer sensory layering. One elision (how he charts the hum mechanically) is slight and does not obscure method or choice. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or voice convergence. The narrative certainty matches what Haru can know; invented histories are framed as reconstructions, not omniscient fact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character method or sensory accumulation. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm modulates with scene needs (short early beats, longer garden exploration). However, minor scaffold persists: "by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs 8 and 17), and "history/histories" cycles across adjacent lines in the final third without added pressure (−0.3 paraphrase-loop penalty). The repetition of "hum" as anchor is purposeful, but the exact template phrase reads as seam artifact. No figurative muddle, filter stacks, or register drift in peak beats. Propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—gilded-leaf stationer inventing histories via fluorescent-lamp hum and bonsai textures—feels specific and non-obvious. The method (charting hum-lines as prisms) and the garden's layered temporality transform familiar "last-person-in-town" material into fresh conceptual territory. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, lyric texture, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image (split oak, cataloged sensations over predictions) grows inevitably from prior particulars. Emotional truth anchors novelty: Haru's restraint and the bonsai's stubborn blooming avoid sentimentality. No derivative premise or template echo.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph 2 ("gilded-leaf stationer"). Development: his choice to carry the notepad to the garden (~paragraph 13) and to place gilded slips at crossings (~paragraph 22) constrain method and charge the ending. Payoff: paragraph 24 he "wrote a final history" and descended "carrying...cataloged sensations." Three beats, causal pressure (method shapes tactics), closure linkage (final writing act). Swappability moderate—role matters less than method, but the gold-leaf detail recurs purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 ("battered notepad...grid of tiny notes"). Development: paragraph 13 he carries it to the garden, paragraph 24 he "opened the battered notepad to a blank page" for the final history. Payoff: paragraph 25 he "folded the notepad into his coat." Three beats, reprise with reweighted meaning (from existing notes to final blank page to carried artifact). Causal pressure: the notepad is the repository that enables his method. Cost: implied in the act of closing it and descending. Specificity high (battered, softened cover, grid).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 10 ("Those colors became invented histories"). Development: paragraph 11 details the baker, child, councilman scenes he invented; paragraph 19 "Each invented history had to match a texture"; paragraph 24 "wrote a final history." Payoff: the final line "cataloged sensations" vs. "predictions" reframes the concept as witness method rather than fiction. Four beats, stakes-shaping (the concept is the project that drives all choices), closure linkage (final history crystallizes stance). Specificity and irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4 ("earnestly studious even when no teacher watches"). Development: implicit in his meticulous method (charting hum, matching textures, placing slips precisely). No single on-page action explicitly hinges on "earnestly studious" as opposed to general dedication. Payoff: the trait colors voice but does not visibly constrain a choice with felt cost. Two-of-three gates (setup, implied development), lyric reprise absent. Causal pressure minimal; the trait describes rather than enables a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 9 ("each pattern would refract his memory into separate colors"). Development: paragraph 18 "combined rhythm refracted more fiercely"; paragraph 19 histories matched to textures. Payoff: the final act (writing a history where people "reading one another's faces the way he read humming lines") extends the refraction metaphor. Three beats, closure linkage. However, "refract" is slightly swappable with "translate" or "transform"; the prism image is vivid but not mechanically indispensable to plot logic. Causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 8 ("by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn"). Development: paragraph 9 hum as lines that refract; paragraph 17 he waits for hum in the garden shed, charts it again mixing with leaf-rustle; paragraph 18 combined rhythm refracts more fiercely. Payoff: the method enables the final histories and the lamp-hum serves as metronome (paragraph 20). Four beats, irreplaceable mechanics (the hum's variations are the data), causal pressure high (method constrains and enables all invented histories). Specificity: "fluorescent lamp," "dawn," "faint hum" all matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 13 ("blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests" on mountaintop). Development: paragraph 15 paths twist, "air felt layered...each turn seemed to open onto a different century"; paragraph 17-18 hum mixes with leaf-rustle and river; paragraph 19 he matches histories to bonsai textures (needles, soil, petals); paragraph 22 split bonsai oak becomes the site where silence reweights. Payoff: the oak's scar charges the final image (paragraph 23). Five beats, irreplaceable setting (the bonsai's scale and layered temporality enable the method's leap), causal pressure and closure linkage both strong. The garden is not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1 ("After the town goes silent"). Development: paragraph 5 silence arrives gradually, paragraph 6 "the night the last train stopped" frames urgency; paragraph 7 he lets himself mourn and begins his method. Payoff: paragraph 23 silence is reweighted "not as loss but as pause," and paragraph 25 "even if the streets stayed mute" acknowledges ongoing silence. Four beats, closure linkage strong. However, time does not tighten tactics on the page—no live clock forces speed or a deadline. The timeframe is static context rather than dynamic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4 ("to collect the textures of different times before they fade"). Development: paragraph 12 he longs for "rougher grains" and carries notepad to garden; paragraph 19 matching histories to textures; paragraph 24-25 he collects "cataloged sensations" over predictions. Payoff: the final line confirms the desire fulfilled with visible cost (streets may stay mute). Four beats, causal pressure (desire drives all choices), closure linkage strong. Friction: the desire is told early rather than dramatized in a conflicted micro-choice, but it constrains every subsequent action with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 7 ("incandescent restraint" as he lets himself mourn while gold leaf shines and voice stays low). Development: the tone modulates across the piece—controlled early beats ("closes his shop without turning the sign"), expands in the garden with richer sensory layering, contracts again at the oak. Payoff: the tone charges the final image: "folded the notepad...descended, carrying...cataloged sensations" remains measured yet weighted with undeniable pressure. Coherence across turns, specificity high ("incandescent" pairs light with heat, "restraint" with control), and the tone is irreplaceable to voice and closure effect.</comment>
