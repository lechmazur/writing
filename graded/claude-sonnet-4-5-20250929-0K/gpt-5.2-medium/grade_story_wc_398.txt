<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's interiority shows purposeful control—"not paid to counsel strangers" checks impulse, "gentle persuasion" governs action—and the vineyard metaphor ("harsh hand snaps canes") embodies occupational logic. Mara's motivations are clear (destined mismatches, fear of mistiming), but her inner conflict remains told more than shown; we see her produce the letter and hear her explain rather than watch her waver in micro-choices. The final stance shift (burning as "speaking over" someone) lands cleanly, foreclosing the impulse with modest cost, yet the reflective mode softens contradiction and urgency throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through the burned-letter motif, mirrored confessions, and the pavilion as crucible, culminating in Mara's decision to keep the pages intact—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that reweights burning as erasure rather than release. Orientation anchors quickly (platform, vineyard, pavilion) and the single-scene window holds spatial coherence. Cost is legible (Mara abandons her impulse to erase, the sentinel feels "less mismatched"), though the ending's reflective summary ("feeling less mismatched") dilutes immediacy and leans toward told insight rather than charged image, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion functions as micro-setting and constraint: its glow draws them upslope, the glass "holds warmth," and the honeyed light charges their shared confession ("shadows look steeped in honey"). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("crushed skins and smoke," "wires hummed faintly like distant strings"), and the vineyard's spatial logic (trellises, rows, the slope) remains coherent. The pavilion table becomes the stage for the burned scraps, and the setting directly enables the final turn—Mara unfolds her letter under that amber light—elevating the category into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to burn the relationship's record or honor it whole—is signaled early and tightens through the sentinel's parallel confession and the mirrored scraps. Pressure accumulates (Accumulative lens) via the sentinel's persuasion ("sap refuses and the cut must be made clean") and the shared realization that "burning words is just another way of speaking over someone's experience," narrowing Mara's options with clear cost: she keeps the pages, relinquishing the erasure impulse. Agency is present (the sentinel's gentle redirection, Mara's final choice), yet the resolution is achieved largely through dialogue and reflection rather than embodied action under duress, limiting urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—honoring another's experience versus erasing it, the ethics of closure—emerges organically from the burned-letter motif and the vineyard graft metaphor ("sometimes the union takes…the cut must be made clean"). The intersubjective-understanding goal charges the ending without moralizing; Mara's choice to keep the pages intact reweights burning as coercion rather than catharsis. The final image ("feeling less mismatched to the world") leans slightly toward summary, but the amber pavilion and the act of reading aloud ground the thematic answer in particulars, avoiding overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable, lyric, and voice-particular ("the estate kept an amber pavilion on the hill glowing like a held breath"), with sentence rhythm modulating for mood (short urgency: "I stopped"; longer reflection: the graft meditation). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety") in ways that feel imported from the prompt rather than organically sentinel-voiced, especially when contrasted with the grounded vineyard idiom elsewhere. Dialogue is spare but functional, and free-indirect control holds throughout. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (the opening bus sigh, clipped exchanges, the longer pavilion meditation), and imagery is specific ("burned edge…curled and crisp," "wires hummed faintly"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase adjacent content: "honored each other best by meeting in the same present" echoes "shared field where her fear and my regret could be seen," and the closing sentence rehearses the intersubjective-understanding claim already staged. Metaphor density is high but coherent (amber = warmth = preservation; vines = graft = relationship logic). The "passionate subtlety" formulation in the climax reads slightly thesis-like, breaking immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and minor template cadence in reflective stretches, with an additional −0.2 for the abstraction slip at a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vineyard-sentinel frame freshens the "stranger counsels stranger" template, and the burned-letter-as-shared-artifact motif is specific and purposeful. The graft metaphor (sap refusal, clean cuts) synthesizes occupational detail with emotional stakes in a non-obvious way. Risk is present in the reflective, conversation-driven structure and the quiet Earned Stasis closure. Yet the "destined mismatches" premise and the pavilion confession scene echo familiar workshop arcs (two wounded souls, parallel confessions, mutual healing), and the final insight—burning as erasure versus witness—feels earned but not surprising in hindsight. The piece transforms its materials competently without delivering a startling synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's choices drive key turns: stopping to offer help, sharing his own burned envelope, invoking the graft metaphor to reframe Mara's dilemma, and listening without judgment as she reads aloud. He appears in setup, middle persuasion, and closure witness. His occupation (vineyard guard) enables the graft logic and charges the setting. The role is indispensable to the story's thematic and causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The burned love letter edge appears in three beats: Mara's initial presentation, the side-by-side comparison on the pavilion table, and her decision to keep only the burned fragment as a reminder. The object shifts meaning from erasure attempt to witness token, directly shaping the story's central turn. Its charred state and the parallel with the sentinel's own scrap drive the intersubjective realization and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Destined mismatches" is named explicitly by Mara and structures her explanation of the failed relationship (timing, children, borders). The concept shapes the dominant stake—whether mismatch justifies erasure—and the sentinel's graft counter-argument reframes it as a question of honoring versus denial. It drives tactics (burning versus reading) and charges the thematic resolution. Integration is strong, though the concept is primarily articulated through dialogue rather than embodied in on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently persuasive" governs the sentinel's on-page choices: offering shelter without demand, sharing his own failure to create parity, and using the graft metaphor ("soft hand bends them back") to guide rather than dictate. The trait is named, demonstrated in the walk to the pavilion and the pavilion dialogue, and tied to visible cost—he risks vulnerability by confessing his own mismatch. The trait appears in setup (vineyard habit) and middle development (the persuasion beats) but is less visible in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears as the pivotal verb when they place the two burned scraps side by side and "began to rediscover what each of us had been refusing to name." The action triggers the parallel confessions, shifts Mara's stance from erasure to witness, and directly precipitates the ending choice to read the letter aloud rather than burn it. The mechanics of comparison-as-discovery are staged on the page (the table, the burn lines), and the action is irreplaceable—no other beat carries equivalent causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is explicitly named ("by drawing parallels between their uneven burn lines") and its mechanics matter: the side-by-side scraps on the pavilion table enable the mutual confession structure. The method shapes the middle beats (each tells their story in turn) and charges the intersubjective realization. It is signaled early (the sentinel's own envelope), developed in the comparison, and pays off when Mara shifts from burning to reading. The method could be more embodied—physical gestures of tracing or pointing would deepen its on-page presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion anchors the middle and closure beats: its glow draws them upslope (tactic), its warmth offers shelter (resource), and its honeyed light charges the confession and reading scenes ("amber turned each sentence into something tender"). The setting appears in setup (estate hill glow), development (walk to pavilion, table for scraps), and closure (reading aloud under amber). Its specific properties (glass panels, retained warmth, light quality) alter the emotional tone and enable the final turn. Indispensable to atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the final bus") establishes isolation and a temporal boundary—no escape route remains, pressure to resolve before dawn. It brackets the encounter (bus departure to pre-dawn) and the "near dawn" marker signals closure urgency. However, the clock is loose; no beat explicitly tests the shrinking window or forces a choice because time is running out. The frame is functional and contributes atmosphere but does not materially tighten tactics. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, absent from middle development as a pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desire to "nurture intersubjective understanding" is explicitly named in the penultimate paragraph and governs the sentinel's actions throughout: listening, sharing his own story, guiding Mara toward witness rather than erasure. The motivation shapes his middle choices (persuasion via graft metaphor, patience) and charges the ending realization ("shared field where her fear and my regret could be seen"). Cost is present—he risks reopening his own wound by confessing—but the motivation is primarily told in reflection rather than tested through on-page friction or competing impulses. Strong thematic integration, weaker embodiment under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is explicitly named at a key beat ("not advice but, with passionate subtlety, attention") and the tone coheres: restrained lyricism, vineyard idiom grounding elevated reflection, emotion conveyed through image (amber, burn lines, wires humming) rather than declaration. The tone modulates appropriately—calm at the walk, intimate at the pavilion, quiet resolve at the ending—and charges the final image (Mara reading, sentinel witnessing). The overt naming of the tone element slightly breaks immersion, and some reflective stretches drift abstract, but overall the tonal control is strong and integral to the piece's effect.</comment>
