<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is coherent—she seeks meaning through her wound rather than accepting closure—and embodied choices (peeling gauze, descending despite pain, reopening stitches) anchor the arc. The "closure seeker who opens wounds" contradiction generates real pressure. However, the pivotal diagnostic skill (reading trauma in coffee rings) functions as ornament rather than lived competence; the ivy's telepathic whispers and the healer's backstory arrive without prior grounding, weakening causal weight. The final wound "knitting legible" reads as conceptual payoff but lacks embodied cost that would elevate the choice into genuine renunciation or transformation with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: images (hourglass, coffee rings, scar, ivy, miracle-jar) recur with shifting charge, and the closure reweights the wound from rupture to legible script. Orientation anchors cleanly (tower, dawn, post-surgery). Escalation proceeds through density increase (wound inspection → ivy contact → cellar tunnel → rooftop release → street pour) with one meaningful deepening when Mara pours the light into the pavement crack shaped like her scar. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wound knits "not shut but legible") with felt cost (pain, reopened seam, warmth leaking "like ink"). The healer backstory and miracle's origin arrive late without setup, creating a causal seam, but the final image recharges prior material and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower, greenhouse, and cellar are spatially coherent and constrain action (spiral stairs pull stitches, archived hymnbooks hide the crack). Micro-setting—hourglass, coffee saucer, bread knife, roots pulsing like veins—charges choices and the final image. "Meteor hush" and sensory anchors (wet stone, frosted sand, chlorophyll syllables) build atmosphere without catalog. However, the coffee-ring diagnostic method and the healer's buried blessing lack procedural grounding; the world rules feel asserted rather than discovered through action, and the plants' guilt-ridden whispers remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: move the miracle to heal both neighborhood and self. Mara's agency drives each beat (peeling gauze, contacting ivy, tunneling, opening jar, pouring light), and one meaningful tightening occurs when she makes the wound "worse on purpose" to let it speak. The final pour into the pavement crack is protagonist-driven with visible cost (reopened wound, pain quieting to "distant pulse"). However, the miracle's discovery and the plants' instructions feel convenient rather than hard-won; no competing option is foreclosed with dramatized sacrifice, and the neighborhood's healing is summarized rather than shown as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: closure is not a lid but a return; scars are doors, not neat endings. The wound, hourglass, coffee rings, and miracle-jar recur with shifting weight, and the final image (wound knitting "not shut but legible") answers the central question without moralizing. The ivy's chlorophyll syllables and the rosemary's hymn-voice charge the premise organically. Minor slip: "displacement" and "return" as thematic operators are somewhat stated in the ivy's memory and the narrator's synthesis ("closure is not a lid but a return"), though the particulars (tunneling, pouring light) earn the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature: "meteor hush," coffee rings as "the only maps she trusts," pain as satisfaction and dread. Diction remains consistent ("chlorophyll syllables," "the thought tastes like copper") and purposeful compression ("the plants have been drinking that light ever since") aids density. However, the narrator occasionally leans omniscient when claiming the tower "keeps" a greenhouse and describing the miracle's hunger with unearned certainty. The ivy's dialogue ("put it in the street") and the wound "speaking in real time" blur the line between metaphor and literal telepathy without clear POV anchoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory specificity is strong ("brown rings on the saucer," "roots that pulse like veins," "dust orbit slowly"). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally muddles: "trauma always settles in circles" and "the ivy shows her a memory of something bright being dragged underground" rely on abstraction. Minor loops: "the sight makes her swallow hard with satisfaction and dread" / "the neighborhood has been growing sicker, and Mara's own wound refuses to close" rephrase causality without advancing it. The closure image ("raised script she can finally read without tearing it wider") is clean and propulsive, mitigating line-level debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—closure seeker who opens wounds; displaced miracle; accidental plant telepathy; coffee-ring diagnostics—is specific and committed, avoiding generic fantasy. The wound as door and the miracle's return earn freshness through embodied action (tunneling with a bread knife, pouring light into pavement). However, the "healer died here" premise and the plants' guilt-ridden thirst lean on familiar displaced-magic tropes without full transformation. The coffee-ring diagnostic skill is signaled but not developed into unique world logic, and the telepathy arrives as convenience rather than a risky constraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as "closure seeker who opens wounds" shapes every beat: she peels gauze, reopens stitches "on purpose," tunnels despite pain, and pours the miracle into the street. The contradiction between seeking and opening drives the arc and the final image (wound knitting "legible" rather than shut). Early signal, causal pressure across at least three beats, and decisive closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in four beats (bedside, flipping during pain, wrapped in scarf, final tip to mark the seal-breaking) and is handled with purpose. However, its function is largely as a time-marker rather than a constraint or enabler of choice; removing it would not break the story's logic. The white sand as visual motif supports tone but does not reweight stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The displaced miracle is the story's central stake: it drives Mara's descent, the plants' guilt, the neighborhood's sickness, and the closure act (pouring light into the street). Signaled early via the ivy's memory, it constrains middle choices (tunneling, opening the jar) and the final pour reweights both Mara's wound and the neighborhood's health. High causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accidental plant telepathy enables key beats (ivy shows the miracle's memory, rosemary instructs "put it in the street") and is signaled early. However, the trait functions as plot convenience without cost or tradeoff; Mara never struggles with unwanted whispers or misinterprets plant signals. The telepathy is essential to the middle turn but lacks friction or visible price, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tunneling with a bread knife is a vivid, extended action (hours compress, guided by ivy, scraping through stone, finding the chamber). It drives discovery of the miracle and is irreplaceable as the physical act that bridges diagnosis and retrieval. Signaled in setup (sealed cellar door, crack behind hymnbooks), executed in middle, and its result shapes closure. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Coffee-ring diagnostics are mentioned early ("trained to diagnose memories by examining coffee rings") and the saucer is held up to the lantern as a compass to find the crack. However, the mechanics are never shown; Mara does not interpret the rings in action, and the method is replaceable (any divination tool could point the way). Functional but swappable, with minimal beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tower anchors all action (waking in the room, greenhouse above, spiral stairs pulling stitches, cellar below, rooftop pour). Dawn's timing is noted at open and close. The setting constrains choices (stairs tax the wound, cellar hides the miracle, roof provides access to the street below) and the "quiet" and "meteor hush" modulate tone. However, the tower itself is somewhat generic; removing "tower" and substituting "building" would not break logic. The micro-settings (stairs, cellar, roof) do more work than the tower as a whole.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" is signaled at the start and the anesthesia's side effect (accidental telepathy) drives the plot. However, time is not tracked with pressure; "hours compress into the frosted hourglass" compresses rather than tightens, and no live clock forces a deadline. The post-surgery state matters more as setup than as escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars, not just the neat ending stitched over them" is stated early and dramatized through peeling gauze, reopening stitches, and the final wound knitting "legible." The motivation drives at least three choices and the closure directly fulfills it. Slight abstraction in the initial statement and minimal friction between want and cost (Mara never hesitates or weighs abandoning the search) keep it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" and "quiet tower" establish tone at the open and modulate through the arc: the cellar smells of wet stone, the jar makes dust orbit slowly, the neighborhood exhales. The tone supports the premise (displaced miracle, patient recovery) and charges the final image (wound knitting legible). However, tonal consistency leans static rather than dynamic; urgency does not sharply shift cadence during the tunnel or the pour, and "meteor hush" as a phrase does minimal active work beyond setup.</comment>
