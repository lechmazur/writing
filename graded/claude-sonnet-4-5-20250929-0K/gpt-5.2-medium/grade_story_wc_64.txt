<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority shows consistent texture ("joy is easier to carry than the headstones' dates") and the final choice to plant the ash sapling is earned by the investigation. However, motivation relies heavily on told abstraction ("I listen for uncharted echoes") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The widow Alvera remains functional but flat, present mainly to deliver exposition rather than apply relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the ledger is unearthed, the case returned, and the ash planted, reweighting Tomas's secrecy as sheltering rather than betrayal. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (threaded tapestry, layered rumor, counted colors) and holds it through the final velvet image. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (cemetery, silo, chess table). One friction: the chess-clock frame promised by the title and opening recedes after setup; the clock's mechanics never constrain a present choice, only backstory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" and "star-cold roofline" constrain the investigation spatially and charge the final planting image. The tapestry strip and its frayed border function as micro-setting, guiding the decoding action and narrowing options (green strand pulled hard, cipher stitched). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("smells of smoke and lavender," "iron gate shut like a lid"). Small slip: "stars over the silo roof" are invoked for pattern-matching but never dramatized as visible constraint during the night scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discover Tomas's intentions—is signaled early and tightens once: the cipher reveals the ledger's location, reframing the chess games as refugee protection. The final act (digging, returning the case, planting the sapling) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (uncharted echoes ease, night feels less like shroud). Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length. One gap: Alvera's question "was it love or fear?" receives an answer from the narrator without dramatized friction or trade-off in the present moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the stitched cipher, the salt ledger, the ash burial site. The final image (planting the sapling under the cobalt silo) offers a resonant answer to "the shape of intentions" without stating a moral—sheltering becomes literal root-work. "Intentions have shapes like roots, branching for many purposes" verges on thematic statement but is anchored by the subsequent digging and planting. The recurring "tenderly organized" motif (tools, ledger names) charges the closure without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (counting graves, listening for echoes) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction ("velveteen gloom," "arguments" of chess pieces, "statue rubbed warm") is controlled and purpose-driven. Small slips: "uncharted echoes" appears three times as a label without evolving texture, and Alvera's dialogue ("was it love or fear?") shifts into more abstract register than her earlier concrete speech. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the cipher-decoding beat. Clear propulsion in the silo investigation. However, paraphrase loops appear: "tenderly organized" recurs three times without reweighting, and "uncharted echoes" is restated as "faint click…intake of breath" without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening third: "They call me…Tonight my tools…The widow Alvera…" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems. Figurative density is high but coherent; no mixed metaphors touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardening, refugee-cipher tapestry, and chess-clock dead-drop is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the detective-investigator trope by routing insight through counted threads and grave-plot listening rather than interrogation. Risk is present in the lyric compression and cipher mechanics. One friction: the chess-clock "runs down" frame promised by the title remains underdeveloped; the clock itself is broken and static, limiting its mechanical ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gardener's choices—walking to the silo, spreading the fabric, decoding the tapestry, digging under the ash, planting the sapling—drive all major beats and closure. "Blithe" is established early ("joy is easier to carry") and the listening-for-echoes stance shapes method. The final planting is causally earned and irreplaceable. Setup (first third), development (middle decoding), and closure (digging, planting) are all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in four beats: Alvera holds it at the gate, opens it in the silo to reveal the tapestry strip, the narrator decodes its cipher message ("lock the case where the sky is bluest"), and it is returned to Alvera at closure with the echoes eased. Its dual function—container and courier signal—matters causally. Early setup, middle involvement (decoding the instruction to lock it), and closure return with reweighted meaning (grief object becomes evidence of sheltering). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is signaled early ("I listen for uncharted echoes that cling to places like damp") and recurs at closure ("the uncharted echoes ease"). It frames the investigation's stake (hearing what the dead leave behind) and the resolution (Tomas hears the answer and rests). However, the concept remains largely metaphorical; it does not constrain a present tactic or force a trade-off. The narrator's method (decoding threads) could proceed without the echo conceit. Present in setup and closure; minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears three times: tools on sackcloth (opening), the decoding process (implicit in careful thread-counting), and ledger names (closure). The trait characterizes the narrator's care and contrasts with chaotic grief, but it does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. The organization enables the investigation but does not force a trade-off. Functional but largely ornamental; swappable with "meticulous" or "careful." Setup and closure present; no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled ("I begin to untangle the story by decoding frayed threads") and executed on the page: counting colors, following the damaged green strand, decoding the cipher. The action drives the middle investigation beat and enables the closure (finding the ledger). However, the mechanics are compressed; the cipher-solving itself is summarized rather than dramatized step-by-step. Setup, development, and closure presence; causal but not fully irreplaceable (another investigative verb could substitute with moderate edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border, counting colors the way I count graves") and executed in the silo: spread fabric, count colors, follow the green strand, decode the cipher using chess moves and grave symbols. The method shapes the investigation's means and could not be swapped without rewriting the middle beat. Setup and development present; the decoded message directly enables closure (dig under the third ash). Specific and causally essential, though the cipher mechanics remain compressed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is established early (husband died there midgame), houses the investigation (chess table, broken clock, tapestry decoding), and charges the final image ("under the cobalt silo and its star-cold roofline, I plant a new ash sapling"). The "blue walls swallowing sound" and "velveteen gloom" create atmosphere and the starlight guides the cipher pattern-matching. The silo's dual past (refugee hiding, chess games) drives the thematic revelation. Setup, development, closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" opens the story and frames the husband's death ("clock falls silent," "last second fell," broken clock with red flag fallen). The timeframe signals the investigation's trigger but does not constrain present tactics; the silo visit occurs at the narrator's pace with no live clock pressure. The clock is static, already stopped. Setup strong, closure weak (time does not tighten the final choice). Functional framing but replaceable with "after his death" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to discover the shape of intentions that led him there") and dramatized through the investigation: decoding threads, interpreting the cipher, digging for the ledger. The narrator's answer to Alvera ("his bent toward sheltering others was clear in every careful stitch") resolves the question. However, the narrator faces no competing desire or internal friction; the motivation proceeds linearly without cost. Setup, development, closure present; causal but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is introduced in the silo description and modulates through the investigation (iron gate "like a lid on a box," Alvera "like a statue rubbed warm") to the final transformation ("night feels less like a shroud and more like velvet"). The tone charges the closure image by recasting funereal texture as protective softness. Coherent through turns, with purposeful final modulation that reweights the opening mood. Setup, development, closure; high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>
