<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ila's interiority is concrete and embodied—her scars as contagion, breath held like hot tea, brother's weight on her arms. Internal contradiction appears: childhood superstition both failed and now guides her ("old fears are also runes"). The final choice to write her scars' history earns its cost through the crystallization metaphor, and "something in her chest shed, not skin, but shame" lands as embodied transformation. Minor deduction: the master remains a vessel for exposition rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors within 120 words (platform, Ila, rune scholar, storm ceremony). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—scars become "readable," superstition translates to craft, childhood circles gain their fourth gate. The cost is visible: she revisits trauma, holds breath under storm pressure, and sheds shame on the page. One meaningful deepening through the held-breath rune writing tightens the dominant stake (transform scars into stories). Deduction: the master's whispered cue ("old fears are also runes") feels convenient rather than earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating platform, its chains, storm fronts, and lacquered table constrain the central action—Ila must stabilize the platform during the held breath or the storms will tear the sky. The quill, mica-tea ink that crystallizes under stress, and the brazier with cloudleaf steam are handled tactilely and charge the closure (ink facets whiten, then soften when brother-rune warms them). Sensory details filter through Ila's trauma: mineral scent recalls lightning, steam rides the storm's exhalation. Deduction: the valley below and cliff town remain postcard anchors without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: transform scars into stories. One meaningful tightening when Ila adds the fourth circle ("giving the storm a mouth") narrows options—the platform levels, storms pause. Agency is clear: she writes runes on the table and on her arm, risking crystallization failure. Cost is visible: holding breath under storm pressure, revisiting childhood trauma, shedding shame. The master's promise of "narrow, living interval" provides a constraint, but his whispered guidance lowers earned escalation slightly. Deduction: the storms' anthropomorphic "hesitation" and "listening" soften the mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: childhood superstition (three circles) becomes craft (stabilizing rune), scars transform from contagion to readable text, shame sheds without a stated moral. The fourth circle as "gate that lets the storm speak" integrates with the ink's crystallization and the brother-rune's warmth, charging the final image. Recurring motifs (breath, storm, quill, circles) deepen rather than decorate. The final line—"grateful for that brief interval of calm, and for the courage to write it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction: "one superstition at a time, translated into craft" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close with consistent perceptual signature: storm scent as memory trigger, scars as contagion, breath as spillable tea. Diction stays character-bound ("mineral scent," "blisters while a person keeps moving"). Free indirect style is clean. Deduction: "saturated hush," "the lattice of burn marks," "the surest way to set them in order" drift into elevated register during peak beats, and the master's whispered exposition ("old fears are also runes") reads more writerly than spoken. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "remembered") cluster in the opening third without harming immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Deductions: "the same scent Ila remembered from the day lightning shattered their roof" is a paraphrase loop (scent already identified as mineral/lightning). "Crystallizes when stressed" appears twice in adjacent concepts (ink formula, ink flashes crystal facets). Template cadence in the opening: "She had come…because…," "In that childhood storm she had hidden…," "Now, years later, she was told…" stacks similar stems across three sentences. Figurative density ("bowl turned upside down," "breath like hot tea," "story told at the right volume") is high but mostly coherent; "glitter softened into a dark line" strains physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating tea ceremony, rune scholarship, held breath as constraint, and scars-into-stories resists generic writing-prompt templates. The fourth circle as missing gate and ink that crystallizes under stress feel specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth—shame shedding, brother's weight, superstition as craft—grounds the fantastical premise. Deduction: the master as passive guide and the storms' cooperative "listening" lean toward convenience. Risk-taking in the compressed timeframe and interiority-under-pressure structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ila's choices drive all key turns: she dips the quill, traces childhood circles in her mind, adds the fourth circle on the table, writes her scars' history. Each decision narrows options and raises cost. Present in setup (rune scholar waiting for calm), development (stabilizing rune under held breath), and payoff (writing scars, shedding shame). Causal pressure throughout; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crow quill appears in three beats: childhood clutch under eaves (setup), dipping into mica-tea ink to write the rune (development), tucked into sleeve at closure (payoff). It enables the central action but could be swapped for "rune stylus" or "engraver's pen" with minor edits. The "trimmed tip" specificity is noted but not leveraged—why crow, why trimmed? Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"A breath between storms" is the story's spine: the master promises it, Ila holds her breath to stabilize the platform, and the two storm fronts grant "exactly the space" during that interval. It shapes stakes (write the rune before storms touch), tactics (held breath tightens the timeline), and closure (platform drifts into clearing sky). The concept is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the logic and metaphorical weight of transforming scars into readable stories.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ink formula "crystallizes when stressed" constrains the central action: "one trembling stroke could turn to brittle glitter and expose a mistake." It creates visible cost—facets whiten with strain when the gust presses, then soften when the brother-rune warms them. Present in setup (formula described), development (ink flashes crystal, facets form), and payoff (glitter softens, line does not fracture). The attribute is causally active and specific; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Shed" operates literally (skin into blisters) and metaphorically (shame sheds in her chest). It anchors the childhood trauma, drives the scars-into-stories motive, and reappears at closure ("something in her chest shed, not skin, but shame"). Present in setup, development (memory of shedding skin while rescuing brother), and payoff. The dual resonance elevates it above swappable synonyms, though "release" or "slough" could approach similar effect with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (master whispers it), mechanized in the middle (Ila traces childhood circles in her mind, then adds the fourth), and paid off at closure ("one superstition at a time, translated into craft"). It shapes her tactics: revisiting the three-circle charm and daring the fourth gate. Causal and irreplaceable to the transformation arc. Deduction: the master's exposition somewhat lowers earned discovery, and the method could be compressed to "revisiting childhood fears" with modest rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The platform must be stabilized or "the two storms finally touch and tear the sky." It supplies the high-stakes arena, the lacquered table as writing surface, the chains that hum, and the altitude constraint. The platform's drifting into clearing sky at closure delivers visible proof of success. Present in setup, development (must hold steady unless rune is written), and payoff. Removing it breaks the story's physical and metaphorical logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The held breath is the story's clock: "she held the breath as if it were a cup of hot tea that might spill," writes the rune during that interval, and "finally released the held breath…like a story told at the right volume." It tightens all decisions, escalates physiological cost, and delivers closure proof (breath released = task complete). Tracked on the page, irreplaceable, and causally indispensable. The timeframe is the hinge of the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ila's desire to "transform scars into stories" is dramatized through action: she watches strangers glance away, remembers pulling her brother free, writes her scars' history in miniature runes, and at closure sees them "gleam and knew they had become readable." Friction appears when the ink tries to crystallize under her pulse, and the brother-rune must warm it. Present in setup (stated motive), development (conflicted action), and payoff (scars become readable). Cost is visible; irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is established early (chains hum in it, steam carries it) and modulates under pressure: the hush deepens during held breath, then thunder resumes its quarrel below while the platform enters clearing sky. Tone charges the final image—quiet after ceremony, gratitude for the "brief interval of calm." Coherent through turns and integral to the accumulative design. Deduction: the phrase itself leans slightly writerly, and tonal consistency could be threatened by the master's expository intrusions.</comment>
