<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to democratize the prophecy is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—"quietly inspired" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's teaching and button-sorting are told in summary; we never see Lysa hesitate, doubt, or make a trade-off that reveals her hierarchy of values. The foreman's attempt to seize the jar arrives too late to test her commitment in scene, and the workers' collective action diffuses individual agency at the closure moment. Emotion is labeled ("fear that wrapped the warehouse like resin") rather than dramatized through perception and bodily response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational/accumulative lens: Lysa gathers buttons, listens to echoes, invites workers to speak, and the final release resolves the prophecy. Orientation is delayed—who Lysa is and what the warehouse stores emerge slowly, though the lyric register may justify this. The closure lands on the page (the canyon returns memories, the prophecy becomes a plan to leave), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we do not see what Lysa or the workers forfeit or risk in that final turn. The causality is additive rather than narrowing: each step accumulates evidence without a meaningful tightening that forecloses an option or forces a visible trade-off before the release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is vividly anchored with "unearthed silence" and sensory specificity (dust, resin, narrow stairs, intake platform). The buttons, hourglasses, and jar function as micro-setting elements that constrain Lysa's method and charge the final image. The cliffs participate actively in the closure (the canyon mouth returns the echo), meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Spatial choreography remains clear across the warehouse, platform, and cliff mouth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy to empower the workers—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is accumulative rather than a tightening that narrows options: Lysa sorts, listens, invites, catalogs, without a moment where failure or opposition forces her to choose between competing paths. The foreman's seizure attempt arrives at the end and is deflected off-page by collective action, robbing the climax of individual agency and visible cost. The prophecy's resolution feels additive (more voices = clearer echo) rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of shared wisdom emerging from collective testimony is coherent and arises organically from buttons, echoes, and the jar's polyvocal structure. The final image—memories returned as choices rather than commands—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The buttons function thematically (each a letter in an alphabet nobody owned) and the prophecy's transformation into a plan avoids neat resolution. Minor penalty for the grandmother's teaching being told rather than enacted, and for "quiet courage to listen" editorializing in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("silence lay unearthed, as if the rock itself had been dug up"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated diction ("stubborn things," "braid of voices," "canyon echo") that occasionally feels imposed rather than organically Lysa's idiom. Dialogue is absent. The foreman and workers are named roles without individuated speech or thought, reducing voice distinctness. The grandmother's method is summarized rather than shown through Lysa's perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, but the piece suffers from recurring scaffold patterns: "She was quietly inspired," "To unscramble it, she began," "As the truth unravels, she realized," "When their words came back," "On the seventh night she found"—template openings that stack across beats. Mixed metaphors ("fear that wrapped the warehouse like resin" after "silence lay unearthed") and elevated register ("braid of voices," "unearthed silence") occasionally obscure rather than sharpen. Information density is high, but paraphrase loops (buttons described twice, prophecy mechanism explained in overlapping clauses) reduce propulsion. The final paragraph over-explains the closure instead of trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—decoding a prophecy through lost buttons and collective testimony—offers a fresh synthesis of object-as-text and worker solidarity. The hourglass-turning role and canyon-echo mechanics are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (lone archivist empowers the oppressed) follows a recognizable template, and the workers' collective action at the end resolves conflict without individual risk or surprise. The grandmother's seamstress wisdom and the "alphabet nobody owned" metaphor elevate thematic originality, but the closure lacks a final turn that redefines prior assumptions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysa drives all major beats: she sorts buttons, invites workers, marks new buttons, and times the jar's release. However, her choices are methodical rather than pressured; no moment shows her choosing one path over another with visible cost. The foreman's attempt to seize the jar is deflected by the workers, not Lysa's decision. She shapes the ending but does not undergo a transformation or make a trade-off that redefines her stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jar appears early (second paragraph), is used repeatedly (Lysa listens to it at each hourglass turn, invites workers to speak into it, carries it to the cliff), and is central to the closure (the echo pours out as the sand runs clear). Its polyvocal property (storing multiple echoes) constrains Lysa's method and charges the final image. The jar is indispensable; removing it would collapse the plot. Slight penalty for the jar's mechanics being explained rather than discovered through failed attempts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Shared wisdom is the story's organizing principle: the prophecy is "a braid of voices," and the resolution arises from collective testimony. It shapes Lysa's tactics (cataloging, inviting workers to speak) and the ending's conceptual cost (wisdom as a map of suffering, theft, forgiveness). However, it remains more thematic than a live stake that forces on-page choices; Lysa never hesitates between individual insight and collective process. The concept is present in all three gates but functions more as premise than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is asserted in the opening and echoed in the final line ("quiet courage to listen") but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. Lysa's inspiration is described (small stubborn things, grandmother's teaching) rather than shown through a moment where quietness limits her reach or intensifies her focus. The trait is ornamental—label-only—without visible trade-offs or tactical consequences.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is signaled early (paragraph four) and drives the middle section: Lysa sorts buttons, listens to the jar, marks patterns. The prophecy's unscrambling is the story's spine. However, the action is additive (more buttons = clearer echo) rather than redefining; no failed attempt or wrong turn that forces a new approach. The final unscrambling happens in summary ("the prophecy, finally unscrambled, became a plan") rather than a dramatized beat. Essential but replaceable with "decode" or "reconstruct" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (paragraph five: Lysa sorts lost buttons, keeps a catalog, notes coat/shift/argument/laugh), used across multiple beats (she pins them to cloth, turns the hourglass at each row's end, marks new buttons beside old ones), and shapes the closure (the scorched button reveals the missing owner's name, triggering the workers' collective action). The button patterns match the broken phrase, making the method causally indispensable. Removing it would require a complete rewrite of Lysa's discovery process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The warehouse is anchored early with vivid detail (amber, cliffs, silence, shelves, narrow stairs, intake platform) and participates in the closure (the cliff mouth returns the echo). The space constrains Lysa's movements (she climbs to the platform each dawn, sits among shelves with workers) and supplies resources (the canyon's acoustic properties enable the echo). However, the warehouse's stored amber—central to the prophecy's promise—remains backstory; we never see it pressure a present choice. The setting is essential for tone and mechanics but not irreplaceable for conflict.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" frames the story, and time is tracked through hourglass turns and the seven-night sequence. The timeframe organizes Lyra's method (she turns the glass at each row's end, times the release "at the exact moment the sand ran clear") and the seventh night delivers the scorched button discovery. However, time does not tighten decisions; Lysa's process is patient and accretive rather than racing a deadline. The hourglass functions more as ritual than clock. Present across all three gates but does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lysa's desire to democratize the prophecy is stated early ("Lysa wanted something else: to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, so the promise could belong to the people") and drives her button-cataloging and worker-invitation tactics. The motivation is thematically coherent and present at closure (the prophecy becomes a plan to leave). However, it is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice; we never see Lysa tempted to keep the jar for herself or fear the owners' retaliation. The friction between the prophecy's control (used by owners to keep everyone working) and Lysa's vision is conceptual rather than embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is established in the opening line, maintained through "careful breathing" and the jar's hum, and charged at closure ("the air felt lighter"). The tone modulates subtly under pressure (the foreman's fear, the workers closing ranks) without breaking into melodrama. The final image ("shadow" and "lighter air") recaptures the opening's register. Coherent and purposeful, though the tone is more atmospheric than a constraint that alters tactics. Strong lyric execution that supports the ending without being indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
