<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to find patterns and her functional creativity are embodied through concrete actions (prying the sextant free, rerouting water). Internal experience is richly rendered through her engineering mindset translating grief and intention into systems, though the final realization about the architect feels slightly expository. The choice to send the beacon is earned by her progression from surveyor to resurrector, with the cost of professional risk implicit in ignoring her supervisor's demolition mandate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Lina, abandoned terminal, post-carnival survey). The causal chain from discovery → water system restoration → beacon activation is coherent with motivated ellipsis in the technical work. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the beacon as Charged Poise: the terminal's silent decades resolve into active signal, options reconfigured from demolition to preservation, cost legible in Lina's professional defiance and the terminal's patient wait now ended. One tightening (discovery of architect's letters) reweights the maze from bureaucratic to personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terminal's queue rails, murals, and mechanical systems constrain and enable Lina's choices throughout. The sextant arc physically aligns with the balcony curve, charging the final recognition. Sensory detail (cold metal smell, trickle sound, carnival glitter) is selective and purposeful. The tile map's "routes that ended in blank oceans" returns with new meaning when emergency lights reveal it, micro-setting shaping both tactics and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand versus demolish) signals early and tightens when Lina's water-loop gambit commits her beyond survey duties. The pump resurrection narrows options from passive documentation to active intervention. Cost is visible in her hands shaking from cold and ignoring supervisor instructions, with professional consequences implied. One meaningful escalation (beacon transmission) forecloses the demolition path and stakes her claim for preservation under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope conserved through redirection, enacted literally via water/power loops and metaphorically through Lina's reframing of the architect's grief-maze. The sextant piece as intentionally broken fragment gains conceptual weight across beats. The final line "hope is conserved when it is redirected" risks didacticism but earns its place through prior engineering specifics. The beacon image offers non-literal closure—intention outliving maker, pattern recognized and continued—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Lina's engineering lens consistent: "flow diagrams that treated people like water," "equations drawn in steel and paint." Perceptual signature is character-specific (load paths, drainage plans, angles). Diction occasionally stretches toward lyric register ("resurrect, because the place needed more than function to breathe") but remains anchored in her voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance controlled, free indirect clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density high in technical sequences. Some figurative overlap in mid-passage: "intentions had outlived their makers" followed closely by "held them like stale air" risks overwriting but remains legible. "She did not call it repair; she called it resurrect" reads slightly scaffolded. One paraphrase near the architect's office (maze personal/not bureaucratic; broken on purpose/missing piece) approaches loop but advances understanding. Propulsion solid, no major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineer as archaeologist of intent, water systems as metaphor for hope's conservation, terminal as navigational instrument. The sextant-matching-balcony discovery feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in engineering precision. Risk-taking in extended technical sequence and quiet beacon ending elevates without obscuring stakes. The transformation of demolition survey into resurrection project through redirection (water, grief, intention) offers non-obvious thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's curiosity drives every major turn: prying the sextant free initiates discovery, reading panel diagrams enables water restoration, aligning the arc reveals architect's design, activating the beacon completes her shift from surveyor to preserver. Her engineering creativity constrains methods (gravity-fed rainwater, turbine-to-transmitter) and her choices alter tactics throughout, culminating in professional defiance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sextant appears in three distinct beats: discovery in floor crack (inciting object), alignment with balcony arc (revelation), resting on maintenance table as Lina completes the pattern. Its engraved degrees and broken state charge the theme of intentional incompleteness. The object enables recognition (architect navigated by stars and crowds) and shapes closure by linking past explorer grief to present resurrection hope.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" structures the story: queue rails and kiosks as designed flows, architect's letters revealing personal grief embedded in layout, Lina navigating both physical maze and conceptual puzzle. The concept shapes her stake (puzzle out versus demolish) and final understanding. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure reweighting ("still a maze, now a map"), though occasionally risks becoming thematic label rather than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Functional creativity manifests on-page: turning cracked tile map into drainage plan, improvising downspout guides from broken signposts, routing turbine output to antenna motors. The trait enables specific problem-solving under constraint (no power, dead pumps) and differentiates Lina's approach from bureaucratic survey. Cost visible in hours of cold ladder-climbing; the attribute drives methods and shapes the resurrection action throughout middle and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" anchors Lina's semantic choice ("she did not call it repair") and drives the major turn from documenting decay to restoring function. Water loop primes pump, pump powers lights, lights enable schematics, turbine lifts antenna—each resurrection stage causally linked. The beacon transmission at closure completes the resurrection, redefining terminal from relic to active participant. Removing this exact action would collapse story logic and thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Redirected flows operate literally (rainwater to cistern to pump to turbine to antenna) and thematically (grief to design, survey to preservation, past intention to future signal). The method is signaled early via panel diagrams, shapes her entire technical sequence, and appears in the final line as conservation principle. Mechanics matter: gravity-fed flow constraint, valve timing, turbine output routing all affect tactics and enable closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned terminal supplies every resource and constraint: mechanical room provides water system access, service ladders enable gutter clearing, cistern and pump become resurrection tools, transmitter room and antenna enable beacon. The terminal's dual identity (failed spaceport/carnival venue) charges atmosphere. Skylights frame navigation theme, queue rails and murals embody intentions, and the building's "holding its breath" state makes restoration stakes visceral. Setting indispensable to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Post-carnival timeframe provides initial condition (dust and confetti, sugar smell) and explains emptiness enabling unsupervised work. However, "after the carnival left" functions mainly as setup color; no ticking clock pressures Lina's choices, and the hours she spends restoring systems carry no time-driven urgency. The carnival's absence enables rather than pressures, making the timeframe functional but not load-bearing for escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized through Lina's progression: wanting patterns over demolition numbers, imagining the explorer's star-measurement, choosing to restore rather than document, risking professional consequences to send the beacon. The discovery of architect's grief letters adds friction (hope entangled with loss), and her final equation—"hope is conserved when it is redirected"—earned through concrete engineering struggle. Cost visible in cold, ignored supervisor, professional deviation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stoic wonder coheres throughout: Lina's calm face despite shaking hands, quiet fascination with load paths and human paths, "quiet constellation" and "patient creaks" at closure. Tone modulates appropriately—technical precision in mechanical sequences, lyric expansion when contemplating intentions, restrained triumph as beacon rises. The combination of engineering restraint and conceptual awe charges the final image without sentimentality, supporting theme and stakes.</comment>
