<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and complex—rational forager turned safety-cultivator constrained by involuntary truthfulness. Her micro-choices under pressure (holding the glass eye, occluding vision to control truth) embody contradictory impulses and physical constraint. The final burial choice shows earned stance crystallization with visible cost (choosing secrecy over her reflex honesty). Interior voice remains consistent and character-particular throughout, though the closing phrase "fractured grace" edges toward diagnostic abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara chooses secrecy by burying the eye, foreclosing transparent safety in favor of protective deception—visible cost paid on the page. Causal lens holds cleanly: glass eye discovery → testing → Ministry threat → planted decoy → burial, each because/therefore linkage narrows options. Orientation anchors (Mara, hanging orchard, post-virus) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when the Ministry arrives forces the trade-off that the entire arc has prepared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting constrains multiple choices: swaying platforms during storms create immediate danger, the truffle bed becomes both workspace and burial site, cables and terraces shape spatial choreography. Micro-setting (glass eye pressed to palm, then eyelid) functions as constraint in the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wind thread the ladders," "ravine filled with static empathy"). The setting charges the final image when Mara buries the relic "beneath the black truffle bed," converting her professional ground into a keeper of secrets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological safety for survivors vs. Mara's involuntary truth) is signaled early and braided tightly with the glass-eye tool. Pressure escalates through one meaningful turn: Ministry arrival forces immediate choice between transparency and protection. Agency is clear—Mara's occlusion tactic and decoy planting drive the resolution with visible cost (she must bury the tool that gave her grace). The coincidence of Ministry timing complicates but does not resolve; Mara's prepared deception (hollow casing) shows prior constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (safety requires chosen secrecy, not compelled transparency) emerges through concrete particulars: the glass eye as diagnostic lens, occlusion as grace, burial as protective choice. The final image—"my fractured grace was to keep choosing it"—reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to whether truth always serves safety. The empathy-virus world and psychological-safety motive interweave to create earned complexity. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the eye, focusing on boots) and the planted decoy's silent swap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices the orchard's sway, reads ground "like a ledger," filters storm details through forager expertise. Diction is controlled and character-specific ("truth is a kind of shrapnel," "static empathy"). Lio's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Under peak stress (Ministry encounter), compression tightens appropriately. One minor slip: "my fractured grace was to keep choosing it" in the final line drifts slightly toward authorial thematic vocabulary rather than Mara's established idiom, though it remains broadly within her reflective voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences tighten under pressure ("I lifted the glass eye and occluded my good eye, focusing on the captain's boots"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two friction points lower the score: "searching through rumored cures in discredited textbooks" repeats "discredited textbooks" within one sentence (paraphrase loop), and "psychological safety" appears four times, creating mild scaffold echo. The closing abstraction "fractured grace" twice in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than earned image, slightly dulling propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of empathy-contagion world, involuntary-truth affliction, and diagnostic glass-eye relic feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "truth-teller" trope through the occlusion mechanic: Mara gains not silence but *choice* over which honesty to serve. The hanging-orchard micro-economy and discredited-textbook margins add fresh texture. Risk-taking in the lyric-adjacent compression ("static empathy," "fractured grace") heightens stakes without full obscurity. The Ministry resolution (planted decoy) is earned but slightly predictable in the smuggler-relic genre; the premise's boldest elements (empathy virus, occlusion-as-grace) carry the originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's forager role shapes her reading of "ground like a ledger" and her choice to bury the eye in the truffle bed—two beats where occupation directly enables tactics. Her rational stance contrasts with the empathy-virus chaos, driving her textbook study and the clinical occlusion experiment. The closure turn (burial) is both forager action and philosophical pivot. Present in setup, development (testing the eye, guiding Ministry to "safe paths"), and payoff (truffle bed burial). High causal pressure and irreplaceability: remove the forager specificity and the burial loses its charged spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in at least four beats: Lio's delivery, Mara's testing (pressed to palm, then eyelid), nightly councils, and Ministry encounter. Its mechanics (occludes sight, allows chosen honesty) directly enable the climax tactic and shape the resolution (burial as protective choice). Early signal (Lio's entrance), strong development (experimental use narrows Mara's options), and closure linkage (buried beneath truffles with felt cost). Swappability is low—the eye's diagnostic function and physical occlusion are plot-essential. The twin/casing decoy adds a clever recursion that tightens integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Smuggled-relic concept frames Lio's entrance, the Ministry's search motive, and Mara's final burial to hide it. It generates the external pressure (patrol) that forces the climactic choice. Present in all three gates: setup (Lio confesses the eye's origin), development (relic status makes possession dangerous), payoff (burial protects it). Causal role is solid but partly swappable—another illegal object could serve the Ministry-threat function. The specificity (saint-statue eye from flooded capital) adds texture but doesn't uniquely constrain Mara's occlusion tactic; the *glass eye's function* matters more than its smuggled status at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is Mara's core constraint, forcing her to answer Lio ("This is a smuggled relic, and you are afraid"), nearly exposing the eye to the Ministry ("My mouth started to tell her everything"), and driving her entire search for the occlusion tool. It creates the dominant stake (how to offer safety when truth is compulsory) and makes the glass eye's mechanics indispensable. Visible cost at multiple beats: Lio flinches, Mara must plan silences "with care," and the final burial trades her "small choice" for secrecy. Present setup to payoff; the attribute is irreplaceable—remove it and the plot dissolves.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Occlude action is the tactical hinge: Mara occludes her eye to test control ("my words came slower, kinder"), uses it in nightly councils to prevent emotional crashes, and occludes again during the Ministry encounter to withhold truth and enable the decoy swap. The action's mechanics (blocking sight to regain speech choice) are specific and non-swappable. Present in development and directly shaping the climax. Strong causal pressure: without occlusion, Mara cannot navigate the Ministry threat. Minor ceiling: the action is slightly procedural—impressive integration but not quite indispensable to the emotional arc's final image (burial), which could theoretically stand without the occlusion beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks provide the method Mara uses to discover the glass eye's diagnostic function and the occlusion principle ("margins warned that the method worked only if the healer could not lie"). This knowledge enables her entire testing and tactical sequence. Present in setup (Mara studies them) and implied in development (her experiment draws on learned mechanics). Weakness: the textbooks themselves don't reappear at closure or constrain the final choice; they prime the solution but remain offstage during payoff. Lyric reprise is absent. Functional and causal, but the mechanics could be learned another way with modest edits; the method's *content* matters more than its textbook *form*.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hanging orchard setting pressures multiple choices: storm snaps a platform (inciting Lio's arrival), swaying structures make the space precarious, the truffle bed becomes the burial site, and "static empathy" filling the ravine drives survivors to Mara's shed-clinic. Spatial choreography (cables, terraces, rope bridge for Ministry) remains coherent. The orchard's dual function—shelter and workspace—directly enables the final act: Mara buries the eye where she cultivates psychological safety, charging the image. Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure. Slightly less indispensable than top elements; a different vulnerable refuge could serve, but the forager/truffle-bed recursion adds meaningful specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Post-empathy-virus timeframe establishes the world rule (contagious feeling) that creates Mara's psychological-safety mission and makes involuntary truth dangerous. "After the empathy virus burned through the cities" signals altered reality in the opening, and "storm season worsened" marks progression that increases ravine pressure. The timeframe generates the dominant stake and explains why the glass eye's emotion-dampening function matters. Present in setup and implied throughout. Weakness: no ticking clock or deadline tightens the Ministry encounter; time passage is gestural ("one evening," "nightly councils") rather than a live constraint that alters tactics beat-to-beat. Solid thematic scaffolding but moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cultivating psychological safety is Mara's explicit, friction-laden motivation: she shelters survivors "who cannot bear another mind reading their grief aloud," studies cures to "damp the contagion of feeling," and uses the eye in councils so "survivors stopped accusing each other of secret hatred." This desire drives her glass-eye experiment and collides directly with her truth compulsion, creating internal conflict. The Ministry encounter forces her to choose *secrecy* over transparent safety, and the burial pays visible cost: "psychological safety sometimes requires secrecy." Motivation is dramatized across all three gates with clear want/cost friction. Very strong integration; only hairline distance from indispensable because the final image emphasizes *her* fractured grace over the survivors' state.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured-grace tone coheres through diction ("truth is a kind of shrapnel," "small choice felt like grace," "my fractured grace was to keep choosing it") and modulates with pressure: reflective in study passages, tighter during storm and Ministry beats, elegiac at closure. The phrase "fractured grace" itself appears twice in the final paragraph, charging the ending image. Tone matches the premise (broken honesty yielding imperfect safety) and supports theme without becoming static. Minor friction: "fractured grace" as explicit label in the last line edges toward authorial summary rather than emergent image, slightly reducing resonance. Strong but not fully indispensable—remove the phrase and the elegiac mood persists through action and image.</comment>
