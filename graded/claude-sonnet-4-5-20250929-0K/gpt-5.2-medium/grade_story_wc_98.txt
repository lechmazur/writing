<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tavo's interior life shows some contradictory impulses—empirical doubt versus willingness to engage dream logic—but these remain somewhat abstract. The micro-choices (kneeling, reading aloud, planting with specific jar order) demonstrate his ritual process, yet the moment when he "answers with the only tool a reality checker trusted, a question" feels more like authorial declaration than embodied discovery. The shift from skeptic to participant is traced but not fully earned through on-page struggle; his embodied doubt never quite crystallizes into a decisive trade-off that forecloses a prior stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story establishes clear anchors (Tavo, ridge, dawn, seed, monsoon threat) and follows a Causal/Situational hybrid: the dream interpretation enables the planting, which yields the tree, which restores collective memory. The closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the tree holds and "its leaves listened"), and the conceptual cost—Tavo's "surrendered certainty" as he pours his breath—is present. However, the mechanics of the waking dream and the voices emerging from leaves remain somewhat asserted rather than fully motivated; the tree's sudden growth and choral voices feel like resolution by fiat rather than earned escalation, lowering the closure's felt inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridge setting is vivid and specific: orchids, stone lilies, warm stone meeting cool mist. The crevice where Tavo plants the seed becomes a micro-setting that constrains his choice—he must match dream logic to physical materials (rainwater, ash, breath). The monsoon functions as both temporal and atmospheric pressure, and the ridge draws the villagers upward "as if by scent," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment directly shapes the planting ritual and the tree's emergence, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—anchoring collective memory before the monsoon washes it away—is signaled early and remains coherent. Tavo's choice to plant the seed in a specific way, guided by interpreted dreams, constitutes one meaningful tightening, and the tree's emergence narrows options (either it holds or the island loses its memory). However, the escalation feels more like a confirmed hypothesis than a pressure turn: once the seed is planted correctly, the tree simply grows and the villagers arrive. The cost of "surrendered certainty" is present but somewhat abstract; we lack a concrete forfeiture or trade-off that makes the price visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—memory as collective tide rather than individual ledger, proof arising from shared imagination—emerges organically from Tavo's empirical whimsy and the dream-interpretation mechanism. The final image of leaves shaped like "small ears" listening to the village chorus is resonant and non-literal, and the line "the tree was not giving him facts to file, it was returning a shared rhythm that made the facts survivable" reweights the premise without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries (empirical vs. mythic) and earns its insight through the on-page planting ritual and the tree's choral response, though the risk of over-articulating the thesis ("what proof do you need, when the proof is us remembering together?") hovers at the edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and confident: "He did it in an empirically whimsical way: weighing shadows on a fish scale, timing prayers with a cracked stopwatch, and writing results in the margins of old songs." The perceptual signature is consistent—Tavo notices chalk marks, jar contents, and the tree's growth with a reality-checker's precision. The psychic distance is stable, and the diction ("luminous doubt," "borrowed legends," "surrendered certainty") matches the heightened-lyric register throughout. No head-hopping or filter clutter mars the flow, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately from skepticism to reluctant faith without jarring shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but density issues emerge. The opening sentence runs long with stacked subordinate clauses ("Before the monsoon arrived, the ancient ridge in bloom glowed above Lanu Island like a spilled lantern, and the air tasted of salt and unspoken names"), and several beats paraphrase the same idea: the Council's fear of memory loss is stated, then restated via "stories slid away each season," then again as "the coming rains would wash the rest clean." The line "when many people dreamed the same image, the next day the ridge bloomed in the same colors" is followed by a near-duplicate move in the next paragraph. These loops dull momentum in the middle third, triggering a −0.6 deduction for paraphrase and synonym churn (Q7 patterned-artifact penalty). The closure image is clear, so the impact is confined to the mid-section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a reality checker who tests miracles empirically yet must engage collective dream logic to wake a memory-storing seed—offers a fresh synthesis of rationalism and communal myth. The detail of dream-gathering in a notebook, the three jars (rainwater, ash, breath) matching dream logic, and the tree's leaves as "small ears" that return a "shared rhythm" are specific and non-obvious. However, the core arc (skeptic learns to trust collective knowledge) follows a familiar template, and the transformation is more philosophical than tactically costly. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the climax's mechanics (plant correctly → tree grows → memory restored) resolve without a surprise turn or resistance that would elevate ingenuity into the higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tavo's role as fantasy reality checker is signaled in the opening paragraph and drives his approach: he brings tools (pouch, notebook, chalk, jars) and tests the seed with empirical ritual. His decision to plant the seed "in a crevice where warm stone met cool mist, then poured in the jars one by one to match the dream's logic" is a key turn, and his final act of measuring the shoot's growth "while the crowd fed it more dreams" demonstrates ongoing engagement. The character is present in setup, middle choice (planting), and closure (testing as the tree holds), meeting all three gates. The choice to invite "the ridge to speak back" and to plant according to dream logic rather than pure skepticism narrows his prior stance with a cost (surrendered certainty), and the specificity of his tools and methods makes him irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is present from the opening ("This morning the pouch held a knowledge fruit seed, dark as wet soil"), anchors the Council's request, and is handled in multiple beats: Tavo lays it on a flat rock, marks its position with chalk, sets three jars beside it, then plants it in a crevice with the jars' contents. The seed's transformation into a pale shoot with ear-shaped leaves is the story's climax, and its growth is measured against chalk marks in the final beat. The seed is causally active in the middle (planting ritual shapes the outcome) and directly shapes the ending (the tree holds against the monsoon), meeting all three gates. The specificity of its appearance ("dark as wet soil") and its unique properties (wakes through interpreted dreams, stores histories in pulp) make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Collective memory is the story's dominant stake, signaled in the opening third ("the island's collective memory," "Without that anchor, stories slid away each season") and tested in the middle when Tavo reads aloud "shared fragments" from the notebook of village dreams. The tree's leaves return "the village speaking in chorus, each person supplying a missing word the others could not find alone," and the ending confirms "the young tree held, and its leaves listened, keeping the island's collective memory rooted." The concept constrains Tavo's approach (he cannot plant alone; he must interpret communal dreams) and shapes the closure (the tree functions only when fed by the crowd). The mechanics are visible on the page, and the cost (Tavo's breath as "surrendered certainty") ties directly to the collective nature of the solution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is illustrated in the opening paragraph ("weighing shadows on a fish scale, timing prayers with a cracked stopwatch, and writing results in the margins of old songs") and shapes his approach to the seed: he lays it on a flat rock, marks its position with chalk, and sets three jars beside it "to check his own bias." The trait constrains his method (he cannot simply plant on faith; he must test) and the final beat shows him "still doubting the mechanics, tested anyway, measuring the shoot's growth against his chalk marks." However, the trait is more thematic flavor than a source of visible conflict or trade-off; it does not create a distinct cost or force a choice between whimsy and empiricism that alters tactics. It is present in setup and closure but does not drive a middle turn with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Waken" is the story's central action, requested by the Council in the opening and dramatized when Tavo plants the seed with the three jars and "when his breath touched the soil he felt it leave him like a surrendered certainty. The ground trembled... and a pale shoot rose, unfolding leaves shaped like small ears." The action is signaled early, attempted in the middle (planting ritual), and completed at closure (the tree wakes and holds against the monsoon). The mechanics of wakening—interpreted dreams, matched jar contents, breath as final catalyst—are specific and causally necessary; removing "waken" would collapse the plot. The action redefines options: without it, the island loses its memory; with it, the collective memory is anchored.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method "through interpreted dreams" is signaled in the first third ("The elders said the seed would only wake through interpreted dreams") and shapes Tavo's approach: he brings a "notebook of dreams gathered from the village" and reads them aloud until "they formed a map: a canoe carved from bone, heading toward a storm shaped like a mouth." The method enables the planting ritual (he matches the jars to the dream's logic) and is referenced again when "the crowd fed it more dreams, softly interpreted aloud." However, the interpretation itself is somewhat passive—Tavo reads, the fragments cohere, and he follows the pattern without dramatized friction or failed attempts. The method is present in setup and middle and implied at closure, but it does not impose a visible constraint or cost that alters tactics; it functions more as a required step than a source of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "ancient ridge in bloom" is present from the opening sentence and anchors the entire action: Tavo climbs it at dawn, plants the seed "in a crevice where warm stone met cool mist," and the ridge's flowers and orchids provide sensory grounding. The setting supplies a micro-constraint (the specific crevice for planting) and charges the final image: "By noon the ridge drew people upward as if by scent" and "the young tree held" against the monsoon. The ridge's blooming in colors matching village dreams establishes the setting as causally responsive to collective imagination, and its elevation (higher ground, safe from the rain) is necessary for the seed's survival. The setting is present in setup, middle, and closure, and it directly shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the monsoon arrives" is signaled in the opening sentence and creates urgency: "The Council feared the coming rains would wash the rest clean" and "Clouds stacked in the east" as the tree grows. The final beat tests the timeframe's pressure: "When the first monsoon gust finally reached the ridge, it carried sheets of rain, but the young tree held." The timeframe tightens decisions (Tavo must plant before the storm) and the closure confirms the stakes (the tree survives the rain). However, the time pressure is more backdrop than live clock; there is no mid-scene tightening where the approaching storm forces a rushed choice or alters Tavo's method. The timeframe frames the action but does not impose a felt constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to protect cultural memory" is clear from the opening: the Council asks Tavo to waken the seed "because the last tree of knowledge fruit had once stored histories in its pulp, and now it was dead. Without that anchor, stories slid away each season." Tavo's desire for proof ("Tavo wanted proof too") and his internal conflict ("he distrusted that kind of instruction, yet he could not deny the pattern he had measured") dramatize the motivation as both external (the Council's fear) and internal (his need for empirical certainty versus communal faith). The motivation shapes his planting ritual and is tested at closure when the tree restores the village's "names reattached" and "forgotten boat routes." The friction between Tavo's empirical doubt and the communal need for memory creates visible tension, though the cost (surrendered certainty) is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "luminous doubt" is established in the opening ("luminous doubt in his eyes") and sustained through Tavo's internal ambivalence: "Tavo distrusted that kind of instruction, yet he could not deny the pattern" and "still doubting the mechanics, tested anyway." The prose carries a heightened-lyric register ("the air tasted of salt and unspoken names," "the ground trembled, not like an earthquake but like laughter held too long") that balances wonder and skepticism. The tone modulates with pressure: the opening is contemplative, the planting ritual is ritualistic and charged, and the ending is both triumphant and cautious ("Tavo, still doubting the mechanics, tested anyway"). The final image of the tree holding against the rain while "its leaves listened" charges the tone with earned resolution, and the luminous quality (glow, pale shoot, mist) threads through the setting and action.</comment>
