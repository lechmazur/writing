<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is seeded early ("to befriend uncertainty in planning") and her choices—taking the map, searching the conservatory, offering the bargain—track consistently. However, the internal contradiction promised by "uncertainly certain" remains more label than embodied struggle; her decisions feel methodical rather than torn. The admiral and Corin serve functional pressure roles but lack distinct voice or embodied tension. Emotional progression is muted; no moment forces a trade-off between contradictory impulses with visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece infers a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through serial discoveries (feathers, clocks, trapdoor, compass rose, Corin's confession) that force Mara to crystallize a stance. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (Sile, harbor fire, Mara's shop). The closure—building a probability clock instead of returning the compass rose outright—reconfigures the admiral's certainty into communal doubt with conceptual cost (the town must "begin again without pretending it knew the route"). One minor causal stretch: Corin's motive for diverting the compass rose (to "map hidden currents") feels retrofitted rather than seeded, weakening the hinge between discovery and bargain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conservatory greenhouse and subterranean waterfall supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere; the waterfall's spray forces Mara to improvise gear placement, directly constraining tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: soot, wet earth, cold roar. The clocks-on-the-table and the feather function as micro-setting that charges discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (sill → table → trapdoor → tunnel → pool → niche). One missed opportunity: the burned botanical conservatory's former purpose could have deepened thematic resonance if its lost order contrasted with Mara's embrace of uncertainty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to recover the compass rose to restore naval certainty or transform it into a tool for living with doubt. The escalation tightens through serial clues (feathers, midnight chimes, hidden chamber) and culminates in Mara's bargain with Corin, which forecloses simple restitution. However, the tension remains situational-accumulative rather than agonistic; Mara never faces a moment where returning the rose conflicts with her philosophy in a way that costs her something on the page. The final "probability clock" lands as conceptual repricing but the trade-off—what she or the admiral gives up—stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: broken clocks as dual-time vessels, ash and fire as shallow-planning emblems, the compass rose's "needleless hub" clicking to start. The central question—how to steer with doubt instead of rage—finds a non-literal answer in the probability-clock bargain without moralizing. One minor slip: "certainty had burned the harbor as surely as the enemy did" edges toward thesis-statement territory in the waterfall beat. The final image (chiming minute shifting "to the one they chose to watch for") resonates without declaring a moral, but the conceptual cost could be sharpened on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable throughout; Mara's perceptual signature—clocks as lies, accidents as patterns, befriending uncertainty—flavors every observation. Corin's dialogue ("I had been leaving signs to lure someone who could listen to broken time") feels slightly elevated but remains legible within the piece's heightened diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the waterfall improvisation, broader during the greenhouse entry. One rhythm wobble: "roots hung like dark hair" and "black flakes still drifted down like moths" in close succession lean toward stock lyricism, though not enough to break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is generally high. Two minor loops: "accidents repeated" and "coincidence becomes pattern" restate the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. The waterfall beat ("she had to improvise a way past the spray using the gears as stepping teeth") achieves clarity and propulsion. One template-cadence run: "She said… and she learned… So she took… set… and went" stacks similar stems but not quite enough to trigger the −0.4 threshold. The final sentence compresses the resolution effectively but "the chiming minute had shifted… to the one they chose to watch for" edges toward abstract summary rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-tinkerer, naval mystery, and botanical-underground hideout feels specific and non-obvious. The "two times" premise and the probability-clock solution avoid template tropes. However, the "map hidden currents under the city" motive and the feather-as-signature clue echo familiar mystery-breadcrumb patterns. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (clocks that point, not tell), but the final bargain—trading certainty for communal doubt—lands more as thematic assertion than earned dramatic reversal. Risk-taking in structure (one continuous descent) supports rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is present from the opening and drives every major turn: accepts the chart, follows the clues, improvises past the waterfall, offers the bargain. Her choices alter tactics twice (pursuing the conservatory, proposing the probability clock) and her final decision shapes closure. However, the tinkerer identity operates more as backstory flavor than on-page constraint; we never see her repair a clock or demonstrate craft under pressure in a way that costs her something.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass rose appears in the opening beat (lost, burned chart), reappears half-buried in the chamber (Mara lifts it, it clicks), and directly shapes the closure (she offers to return it conditional on building the probability clock). It is handled in two distinct beats and returns with reweighted meaning: from proof-object to bargaining chip. The "needleless hub" detail signals irreplaceability. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; removing it would break the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" frames the setting (conservatory behind collapsed wall, soot-webbed glass, scorched crates) and the search stakes (what hides under fire's aftermath). It shapes one middle choice (Mara's descent through the trapdoor) and charges the final image ("beneath the ashes the town could begin again"). Present in all three gates, but its causal pressure is moderate; the concept could be rephrased to "after disaster" without breaking logic. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is labeled in the opening ("she learned to live uncertainly certain between them") and echoed once in the waterfall beat ("Mara, uncertainly certain, offered a bargain"). It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; the trait remains voiced philosophy rather than embodied friction. Swappable with "cautiously confident" or similar without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Improvise" appears explicitly in the waterfall beat ("she had to improvise a way past the spray using the gears as stepping teeth") and shapes one key turn: reaching the compass rose. The gears-as-stepping-teeth detail demonstrates the action concretely. However, the improvisation does not recur or redefine later options; it solves one local obstacle. Present in development and indirectly in payoff (the gears foreshadow collaborative making), but not indispensable across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" is the method of entry, signaled early and used once. The swirling leaves offer atmospheric texture but do not constrain tactics or alter outcome; Mara could enter via broken wall or side door with minimal rewrite. The greenhouse setting matters (clock faces on table, vines, trapdoor), but the specific leaves-method is ornamental. Present in setup, absent from development and payoff as a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is introduced mid-story, supplies immediate tactical pressure (Mara must use gears to edge past the spray), and hides the compass rose in the niche behind it. It appears in two beats (descent, retrieval) and directly enables the central discovery. Removing it would require significant rewrite. Late arrival (past first third) and single-location use prevent higher score, but causal role and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is voiced in the opening ("this was the third week when coincidence becomes pattern") and frames Mara's decision to search. The three-week timeframe and the recurring midnight chime establish pattern-pressure. However, the passage of time does not tighten decisions on the page; Mara's descent unfolds in one continuous sequence without clock-driven urgency. Present in setup and thematically in payoff (chiming minute shifts), but lacks middle development as a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated explicitly in the waterfall beat ("to befriend uncertainty in planning, not to banish it") and motivates the final bargain (probability clock instead of fixed compass). It frames Mara's philosophy but is not dramatized through conflicted choice with visible cost; we do not see her tempted to banish uncertainty or pay a price for befriending it. Present in all three gates as philosophy; moderate causal force because it determines the type of resolution but not the path to reach it.</comment>
