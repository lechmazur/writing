<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is densely lyric and embodied through gesture and camera handling, with clear motivation to combat erasure. The father's memory thread provides a contradictory pull between grief and rhythm that grounds the climactic foghorn moment. Aster remains thinly sketched—his "whispering advisor" role and sign-language teaching are told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices on the page. The ending choice to leave the camera as offering feels earned by prior causality, though the stake of being "unseen" is asserted more than tested through friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes silence-mapping gestures and culminates in the musician's performance, which reweights the protagonist's stake of invisibility with visible social recognition. Orientation anchors (who, luminous harbor, the hour of forgetting) arrive promptly. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tune "stitches brief recognitions" and the protagonist names their motivation explicitly, crystallizing the attempt without full decisive change but with undeniable pressure and the camera-offering as felt cost. One clear tightening occurs at the foghorn failure, which narrows the window and accelerates the sign-work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The harbor is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (lanterns as floating commas, rope fibers, gull cries) filtered through a lyric POV. The foghorn's failure provides a concrete environmental event that narrows tactical options and charges the climax. Spatial choreography is legible across bollards, pier, and crate. The moonlit water and accordion anchor the ending image, making setting participatory rather than merely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—combating erasure by translating silence into sound—is signaled early and tightened at the foghorn failure, which forces faster signing and creates urgency. The protagonist's agency is clear in the decision to map silence and to offer the camera at closure. Cost is visible: the camera (father's relic, "only thing that still belonged") is set down as offering, foreclosing personal possession. The musician's acceptance and the tune's effect provide a meaningful deepening that changes the protagonist's social legibility, though full transformation remains open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (voice/memory against forgetting, silence as substrate for meaning) emerges organically from the mapping action and camera clicks without moralizing. The final image—camera as offering, sound made from silence—resonates non-literally and reweights prior material (father's teaching, empty lens, the hour when "no one remembers you"). The protagonist's closing assertion "so forgetting could not have the last word" risks slight on-the-nose phrasing but is framed as personal motivation rather than sermon, and the tune's social effect dramatizes the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, first-person, with a distinct lyric perceptual signature (lanterns as commas, "soft ache of being unseen"). Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, consistent with the focalizer's interior idiom. Aster's whispered directions and the protagonist's signed apologies create purposeful gestural texture. Minor register drift: phrases like "coordinates into a melody" and "joyful sorrow threading through my wrists" approach abstract diction at peak beats, but remain legible within the established voice and do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character knowledge, or symbolic charge. The piece deploys extended single-sentence paragraphs and comma-spliced constructions for lyric accumulation without teaching the pattern explicitly, which slows momentum in mid-passage. Minor paraphrase loop: "taught me sign language years ago" is immediately followed by a second clause restating the same backstory beat. Figurative density is high (lanterns as commas, "cavern of sudden quiet," "stitching brief recognitions") but metaphors remain coherent and voice-motivated, not template artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, empty camera, and silence-mapping offers a specific, non-obvious angle on invisibility and memory. The foghorn failure as climactic environmental gift and the transformation of absence into shared melody feel earned rather than convenient. Risk is present in the lyric density and the refusal to dramatize full social reintegration, sustaining ambiguity. The piece transforms a familiar erasure-and-recovery template through the concrete particulars of gesture, mechanical failure, and collaborative street performance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aster is present early, arranges the protagonist's fingers into a question, points along the quay, whispers counts, translates gestures into notes, urges faster signing at the foghorn, and guides the protagonist to the musician. His choices enable the mapping method and the musician encounter (two beats), but his own goals and costs remain off-page; he functions as facilitator rather than agent with conflicting stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The camera appears early as brass-bodied relic and "only thing that still belonged," is raised at each marked point to measure angles of absence (beat one), clicks along as metronome during the musician's tune (beat two), and is set on the rail as offering at closure (beat three, reweighted as proof and sacrifice). The empty lens motif recurs with evolving meaning and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sign language is introduced early (Aster taught it years ago), used on-page to sign apologies and to capture the foghorn silence ("sign faster"), and described as translating absence into notes. It enables the mapping method and provides the protagonist's expressive tool under pressure. The mechanics are not fully dramatized—most signing is summarized rather than shown gesture by gesture—but it constrains the protagonist's communication mode and shapes the collaborative process.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is applied to Aster as a label ("in the way he listened first and spoke second"), but the trait does not constrain or enable a visible on-page tradeoff. His whispered directions and guidance are presented without friction or cost tied to charisma; the attribute remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is named explicitly ("disrupt the harbor's ordinary noise") and the climactic beat shows the accordion tune lowering conversations, slowing oars, and quieting gulls. The action shapes the middle mapping sequence and the closure effect, though the disruption is cooperative (musician's assent) rather than conflictual. It could be reframed as "repattern" with minor edits, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mapping silence is introduced early as Aster's named method, executed through the protagonist's camera angles and hand signs translated into staff notation, and pays off when the musician reads Aster's marks and the tune emerges from charted pauses. The mechanics are present across setup, middle action, and closure; the method is specific and not easily swapped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is established in the opening line, provides the foghorn (a concrete pressure point), anchors spatial choreography (bollards, quay, pier, crate), and frames the final camera-offering image. The setting supplies resources (musician, accordion) and the moonlit water recurs as visual anchor. It shapes tactics moderately but functions more as coherent backdrop than as dynamic constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"The hour when no one remembers you" is introduced early as timeframe and thematic condition, motivates the protagonist's need to create proof, and recurs implicitly at closure ("when no one remembers you, the surest proof is sound made from silence"). The timeframe is conceptual rather than a ticking clock; it does not impose minute-by-minute pressure or alter tactics within the scene, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to translate silence into music is dramatized through the mapping action, the camera's empty clicks, the protagonist's hand-signing under pressure, and the musician's performance. The final paragraph names it explicitly ("That was my motivation all along"), risking slight tell-after-show, but the desire has been enacted with visible cost (camera offering, the rush at the foghorn) and friction (the risk of ridicule, the apologies to frowning passersby).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is embodied in the moment when the protagonist's palms flash the father's memory "not as grief but as a rhythm, joyful sorrow threading through my wrists." The tone modulates across the piece (loneliness, urgency at the foghorn, tentative recognition at the tune) and charges the ending image (offering, shared proof). The phrase risks slight label-speak but is anchored to gesture and the ending's bittersweet incompleteness.</comment>
