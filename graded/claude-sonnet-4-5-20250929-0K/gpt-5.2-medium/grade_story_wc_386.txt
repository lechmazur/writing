<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—"listened, because she was a wreck-diver and a ghost whisperer" roots motive in profession without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (warming the globe, aligning distortions "the way she aligned testimonies") reflect occupational bias under pressure. The child's ghost is embodied through image-pressure rather than dialogue, avoiding sentimentality. Minor slip: Fen's capture feels efficient but his psychology remains exterior; the crowd's complicity is asserted, not dramatized, slightly flattening the final turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mara returns the globe to the shrine, reweighting it from evidence into a gentler "window of connection," and the child's gratitude arrives as imagined snow—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (she relinquishes proof to restore memory). Drive lens is Causal: Mara tracks Fen through dream-cameos → uses the globe and ice lens → catches his pattern → confronts him with proof. One meaningful tightening (aligning the globe through the lens to see Fen's method) narrows options and enables the exposure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (shrine, Mara, satchel, wreck below fjord). The piece exceeds two-shard scope but teaches its mosaic structure early (shrine → wreck memory → dream-tracking → confrontation → return) with legible transitions and a single dominant stake (expose Fen, salvage purity), satisfying Track B tests without penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly anchored: "hollowed chamber carved into glacier ice, candle-lit... ice walls carved into shallow alcoves," and the ice lens functions as both setting feature and tactical resource—Mara uses it to align the globe and see Fen's entry into the wreck. The melted globe itself acts as micro-setting, constraining her method (she must warm it, align distortions). Sensory hierarchy reflects occupational POV: she notices "candles borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue" and the tactile shift of water inside the globe. Spatial choreography is clear across all beats. Minor limitation: the pier confrontation and the crowd's presence are asserted rather than choreographed, slightly reducing immersion at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose Fen and salvage the child's memory—is signaled early and pursued across all beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara aligns the globe through the ice lens, narrowing her method and revealing Fen's pattern, which enables the pier confrontation. Cost is legible: she returns the globe to the shrine, relinquishing its evidentiary use to restore its memorial function. Agency is consistent: Mara tracks, witnesses, and confronts using her skills. Weakness: the crowd's shared dream and the guards' arrival feel convenient—coincidence complicates the setup but also resolves the exposure, slightly undercutting earned escalation. Fen's capture is efficient but the price paid (social, legal) is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—"purity is not untouched, only rescued and held where the light could reach it"—emerges from concrete action: Mara salvages the globe, refuses to sell it or use it solely as evidence, and returns it to serve memory rather than commerce. The globe's transformation (evidence → memorial window) and the child's final imagined snow answer the central question without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the shrine's architecture (ice lens as literal and metaphoric "window of connection") and in Fen's cruelty (skimming reflections, thinning spirits). No thematic echo or sermonizing; the final image reweights "salvage something pure" with earned cost. The piece resists tidy closure—Fen is gone but the larger economy of dream-harvesting persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance is consistent and tight to Mara's perception. Voice carries occupational idiom: "weaves truth carefully, translated only what she could confirm," "aligning distortions the way she aligned testimonies." Perceptual signature is selective—she notices forensic detail (the globe's slump, the heat required) and filters setting through professional lens. No head-hopping; the child's ghost communicates via image-pressure, not dialogue, maintaining POV modesty. Minor slip: "she suspected he had used the wreck as a furnace for his craft" reads slightly expository mid-paragraph, and the phrase "borrowed starlight" recurs in a way that edges toward authorial ornamentation rather than strict character perception. Dialogue is absent; no penalty applied there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do two jobs (e.g., "candles borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue" establishes atmosphere and primes the closure image). Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths modulate with pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Mild overwriting in the opening: "a snow globe, or what remained of it, its glass collapsed and melted into a lopsided teardrop that still held a blur of water and silver grit" stacks modifiers without functional differentiation between "collapsed" and "melted." The phrase "borrowed starlight" appears three times, twice in nearly identical context, risking decorative repetition. The long sentence describing Fen's brazier method compresses action that might warrant a beat; clarity holds but momentum drags slightly. Grammar and usage are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver as ghost whisperer tracking a dream-harvester through cameo dream appearances—is specific and non-obvious. The melted globe as forensic clue and memorial object avoids stock symbolism by grounding its transformation in physical logic (heat underwater). The "windows of connection" concept is instantiated through the ice lens, the globe, and dream-doors rather than left abstract. The exposure method (shared dreams as public witness) is fresh. Minor derivative note: the "salvage purity from wreckage" frame echoes familiar redemption arcs, but the piece personalizes it through occupational lens and the child's ghost. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic, multiple locations, dream-logic) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as wreck-diver ghost whisperer drives all key turns: she retrieves the globe, interprets the child's images, tracks Fen through dream-cameos, uses the ice lens to witness his method, and confronts him at the pier. Her occupational skills constrain her method (she must "weave truth carefully" and "confirm" before accusing) and enable the exposure. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (tracking and witnessing), and closure (returns globe to shrine). Causal pressure is strong; specificity is high (no generic detective could replace her without loss). Cost is tied to her choices (relinquishing evidence to restore memory). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in setup (retrieved from wreck), middle (warmed and aligned through ice lens to reveal Fen's method), and closure (placed in shrine alcove as memorial window). Its evolving use drives escalation: physical evidence → forensic lens → charged memorial. The globe's melted state is causally specific (heat underwater) and irreplaceable—its distortion enables the vision. Cost is legible: Mara returns it, foreclosing its evidentiary use. Three distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage both strong. Minor friction: the globe's mechanics (how warming and aligning produce the vision) rely on symbolic logic more than physical, slightly reducing hard specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" shapes stakes and tactics on the page: the ice lens is literal (Mara uses it to see Fen's wreck entry), dream-doors are Fen's method (he steps into dreams), and the shrine itself functions as a window between water and memory. The concept constrains Mara's method (she must align distortions through the lens) and enables the shared-dream trap. Present in setup (shrine description), middle (lens use, dream-tracking), and closure (globe becomes "a gentler window"). Cost is felt: Fen exploited windows to skim spirits; Mara repurposes one to restore connection. Swappability is low; removing the concept would require structural rewrite. Solid integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" constrains on-page action twice: Mara "translated only what she could confirm" (limits her interpretation of ghost images) and tracks Fen "by analyzing cameo appearances" rather than accusing on hearsay. At the pier she tells "the careful truth that finally left him nowhere to hide." The trait enables her method and reflects occupational ethic. Present in setup (reason paragraph), middle (confirmation work), closure (confrontation phrasing). Cost is implicit: caution slows her but ensures the exposure sticks. Friction: the trait is more often told than dramatized in micro-choices; we don't see her wrestle with a tempting shortcut or reject an unconfirmed lead on the page. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Expose" drives the major turn: Mara's goal from setup, pursued through dream-tracking and ice-lens witnessing, culminates in the pier confrontation where she lays the melted globe in Fen's palm as proof and tells the crowd the truth. The exposure forecloses Fen's operation (guards take him) and redefines the globe's use (from evidence to memorial). Present across all beats. Cost is legible: she sacrifices the globe's evidentiary future to restore its memorial function. Friction: the actual confrontation and crowd response are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing immediacy slightly. Swappability is low—"expose" is more specific than "defeat" or "stop." Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is signaled early ("Fen never appeared in daylight... so Mara hunted him by analyzing cameo appearances") and used twice on the page: the fisherwoman's dream (ink-stained fingers, "Leave the window unshuttered") and the priest's dream (man reflected in glacier wall "drifting at the edge like a cameo"). These clues enable Mara to identify the shrine as a window and later to trap Fen in shared dreams. Present in setup and middle; closure linkage is indirect (the method leads to exposure but isn't reprised in the final image). Mechanics are told more than shown: we don't see Mara interviewing or how she synthesizes the clues into a trap. Functional, but the method's on-page labor is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shrine supplies the ice lens, which Mara uses to align the globe and see Fen's wreck entry—a tactical resource that shapes the middle beat and enables the exposure. The candles and alcoves frame the opening and closing, and the shrine's role as a "window of connection" charges the closure (the globe joins other memorial objects there). Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (lens use), and closure (globe placed in alcove). The setting constrains choice: Mara must return to the shrine to use the lens. Minor friction: the pier (confrontation site) is mentioned but not developed, and the shrine's social function (who tends it, who visits) remains vague. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated early ("Mara's reason was always the same") and dramatized through her retrieval of the globe, refusal to sell it, and choice to return it as memorial rather than keep it as evidence. The motive drives her confrontation with Fen (his cruelty offends her ethic) and shapes the closure (she restores purity by holding it "where the light could reach it"). Cost is felt: she relinquishes proof and control. Friction: the motive is told more than tested—we don't see a moment where Mara is tempted to profit or withhold. The child's ghost adds urgency but the internal conflict (pure salvage vs. exposure need) is implied rather than dramatized. Functional across beats but lacks a visible trade-off scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears three times: candles "borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue" (setup), Mara with "borrowed starlight on her face" (confrontation), and implicit in the final image of the globe catching light. The tone—cold, mediated luminosity—coheres across turns and charges the closure (light as witness and memorial). Modulates subtly: cool in the shrine, accusatory at the pier, gentle at the end. The phrase itself risks decorative repetition, but its function (light as both forensic and elegiac) is integral. Present in setup and closure; middle use is briefer. Swappability is moderate (other light sources could work), but the "borrowed" quality—indirect, dependent—fits the window-of-connection concept and Mara's careful ethic. Solid lyric integration.</comment>
