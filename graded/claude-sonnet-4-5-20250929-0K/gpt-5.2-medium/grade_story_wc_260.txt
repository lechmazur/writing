<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between anger and compassion is embodied through concrete micro-choices (writing two lists, calling Tessa, preparing intake forms). The decision to file the report while offering aid demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the therapeutic framing ("layers of pride, anger, and easy certainty") edges toward label-speak, though the subsequent actions ground it. The chameleon's shed tail functions as an earned motif that charges her final choice without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara files the report, accepts custody of animals, and pins the tail tip as a renewal symbol with visible cost (her reputation, the emotional labor of balancing boundaries and mercy). The causal lens holds—each beat (discovery, lists, call, sanctuary transfer) tightens options through her agency. Orientation is clear by the opening phrase. One meaningful deepening occurs when Tessa's confession reweights Mara's anger into structured compassion, altering her tactics from pure anger to a dual-track response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty workshop with heat lamps and terraria provides tactile grounding and constrains her nocturnal reflection. The chameleon's tail tip on paper towel is a micro-setting element that charges the final image when pinned above her desk. Sensory detail (cedar smell, mist hiss, chalk squeak) anchors without catalog excess. Spatial choreography (crates, van, workshop, sanctuary) tracks cleanly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balancing self-respect and compassion) is signaled early and tightens through the call with Tessa, where Mara's anger thins "layer by layer" yet she still files the report. The decision to offer legal aid while reporting fraud is a forced trade-off with visible cost: emotional labor, risk to her credibility, extended responsibility for animals. Agency drives escalation—Mara writes lists, initiates the call, drafts the public statement, and delivers animals—foreclosing the path of simple anger or avoidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of fragile convictions and renewal emerges through the tail-tip motif and the duality of boundaries/mercy. The final image (pinning the shed tip after "what is false comes to light") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Minor issue: "the smallest cast-off piece could teach you how to grow something truer" edges toward thematic summary rather than remaining fully implicit. The parallel between Mara's and Tessa's "fragile convictions" enriches without false equivalence—Tessa's panic-driven fraud is acknowledged but not excused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; diction matches Mara's careful, animal-handler sensibility ("heat lamps glowed like small moons," "her compassion had found a spine"). The call with Tessa carries subtext through Mara's listening "until the anger thinned, layer by layer." Minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("to balance self-respect and compassion") slightly abstracts the texture but remains within plausible internal voice. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character or situation. Rhythm varies (short action beats, longer reflective passages). Two small issues: "she let the shame rinse away without excusing it" is slightly abstract at a pivotal moment, and the phrase "fragile conviction she had clung to: that saving animals meant you could trust the people" uses a colon where internal punctuation would be smoother. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final paragraph's sequence (drove animals, signed forms, returned, pinned tail tip) propels cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The transformation of a wildlife rescue con into a study of principled compassion offers a fresh angle. The chameleon's shed tail as a regeneration lesson turned personal symbol feels specific rather than generic. The two-list approach (Boundaries/Mercy) and dual-track resolution (report + aid) avoid binary simplification. Derivative penalty mitigated: while the "kind person scammed" frame is familiar, the specific calculus (file report, keep animals, offer resources) and the animal-handler lens particularize it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's identity as wildlife handler shapes every key turn: she recognizes the animals are real despite the fraud, writes lists informed by care work, accepts custody, transfers to a vetted sanctuary. Her professional skill and ethical framework drive the dual-track resolution. Present in setup, middle choices (lists, call, public statement), and closure (sanctuary transfer, tail-tip pinning).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tail tip appears in three functionally distinct beats: early as a teaching tool she's kept, mid-story when she sets it down during the call with Tessa realizing "why she had saved it," and finally pinned above her desk as a renewal symbol. Its meaning evolves from educational prop to evidence to emblem of shedding falsehood. Charged reprise at closure; swapping it for another object would break the regeneration logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fragile convictions" shapes stakes explicitly ("what stung was the fragile conviction she had clung to") and reappears when Mara sees "the same fragile convictions in Tessa...only twisted by panic." It drives the central choice—whether to harden or reconstruct—and the resolution balances both. Present across beats but leans slightly toward theme-echo rather than fully constraining each tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" as an attribute appears in the description of the tail tip ("no longer alive yet still patterned, quietly vivid") and implicitly colors Mara's approach (she "kept her voice low," writes lists in "shimmering stillness"). It inflects tone more than constraining a discrete action with visible cost. Functional reprise but not indispensable to choice mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" is signaled early ("she decided to reconstruct what had been broken") and governs the middle structure: writing Boundaries/Mercy lists, calling Tessa, drafting a transparent statement, transferring animals to a vetted sanctuary. The action defines her dual-track response and shapes closure (pinning the tail tip as a renewal marker). Removing "reconstruct" would weaken the throughline; swapping for "repair" or "rebuild" would lose the shedding/regeneration link.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By shedding layers" is signaled early ("by shedding layers of pride, anger, and easy certainty") and enacted through the call ("the anger thinned, layer by layer"), the public statement (admitting her mistake), and the final image (pinning the shed tail tip after "what is false comes to light"). The method is both metaphor and dramatized process. Present across beats and essential to the regeneration closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "misty workshop under stars" anchors the nocturnal reflection and provides sensory grounding (heat lamps, damp cedar, mist hiss). It enables the private work (writing lists, making the call, washing terrariums) and contrasts with the public fraud. The setting choice (night, solitude, animal presence) supports tone and stakes but does not force a tactical pivot unavailable elsewhere. Strong atmospheric fit; moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the con was revealed" frames the entire story and tightens the timeline (police call at dusk, overnight decision-making, early-hours sanctuary transfer). The timeframe compresses Mara's emotional arc into one sleepless night, lending urgency. However, the exact clock does not visibly narrow options at any single pivot—the same choices could occur over two nights without breaking logic. Functional pressure but not indispensable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to balance self-respect and compassion" is dramatized through concrete friction: Mara wants to "burn every bridge" yet "could not ignore the hungry animals." She writes two lists (Boundaries/Mercy), files the report (self-respect) while offering aid (compassion), and the final statement admits her mistake publicly. The dual-track resolution is the story's spine; removing this motivation would collapse the conflict. Present in setup, choices, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shimmering stillness" is established early ("the shimmering stillness that filled the workshop between the hiss of mist") and recurs ("the quiet made every decision feel heavier, yet clearer"). The tone modulates with pressure—stillness during reflection, forward momentum during action—and charges the final image (chameleon asleep, tail tip pinned, fog curling in). Coherent but slightly ornamental; swapping for "hushed clarity" would preserve most effects.</comment>
