<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's occupation as "corporate memory keeper" and her desire to find deleted files provide coherent motivation, but her internal state remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The final choice to walk into Legal with the patch stitched to her coat carries symbolic weight, yet the contradictory impulses that should attend such a consequential act—fear of retaliation, doubt about the buoy's existence, grief over her mother's disappearance—are asserted rather than dramatized in the moment. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary (the entire investigation unfolds in compressed past-tense retrospection), which flattens the micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her mother's voice in the final clip provides an emotional anchor, but Mara's reaction to hearing it after years of absence is summarized rather than shown, missing an opportunity to embody the contradiction between professional duty and personal wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an accumulative/retrospective lens early—Mara recounts months of investigation through compressed summary—but the closure unit struggles to land with on-page cost. The final beat (walking into Legal with the patch, lying while seeding a message to families) is presented as fait accompli rather than a choice dramatized under pressure; we do not witness her weighing the risk of retaliation, the uncertainty of whether the buoy exists, or the moral calculus of lying to Legal. The recurring numbers (11-27-73) function as breadcrumbs across beats, creating pattern, but the revelation that they point to a buoy and living voices arrives late and is summarized rather than discovered on the page. The piece signals a Decisive Change (Mara moves from passive listening to active whistleblowing) but the cost—career destruction, potential legal jeopardy, the gamble that the families will find the buoy—is declared rather than felt in the final image. Orientation is clean; causality holds within the retrospective frame; the lens is coherent but the closure moment lacks the visceral weight required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The server room is vivid and specific: "a wall of servers that hum like a choir muffled by dust," "bright status lights," and the Chute as a concrete region where deleted files "dissolve into zeroes." Mara's body and attention are filtered through her professional lens—she notices "slips in metadata the way other people notice weather"—and the environment constrains her choices (the old administrator account she was told never to use, the locked folder, the midnight timing). The patch image, scanned so closely "the threads look like roads," functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final beat when Mara stitches it to her coat. Spatial choreography is clean: desk facing servers, server room at midnight, Legal office in the morning. The recurring numbers appear as comment counts, time stamps, track numbers, creating a textural layer that supports the accumulative lens. The archive as a space where "certain names are missing from the air" establishes sensed absence as an environmental quality. Minor deduction: the southern sea and the buoy remain abstract coordinates rather than felt geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go, for the families and for Mara's missing mother—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure accumulates through the recurring numbers, the locked folder, the anomalous access log, and the revelation of nine living voices. However, escalation is largely retrospective summary rather than on-page tightening: "for months recurring numbers have been appearing," "I follow the numbers like breadcrumbs," "at midnight I slip into the Chute." The final act—walking into Legal with the patch, lying while seeding a message—should force a trade-off between safety and truth, but the decision is narrated as already complete rather than dramatized under pressure. The cost (career destruction, legal jeopardy, the gamble that the families will act) is legible in concept but not viscerally felt in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the case was never about bodies; it was about silence, engineered," yet this realization is told rather than discovered through a specific on-page action or sensory trigger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recurring numbers, the deleted files, and the corporate archive as a space where grief and control intersect. The patch—embroidered starburst and lattice pattern, threads like roads—functions as a charged image that reappears stitched to Mara's coat in the final beat, reweighting prior material without overt statement. The piece asks what happens to inconvenient people and data, and the Chute as "not deletion but exile" crystallizes this question. Mara's mother, who vanished to keep the crew alive, and Mara's own lies (reporting the anomaly as a glitch, lying to Legal) create a thematic echo of silence as survival and silence as complicity. The ending resists moralizing: Mara's "real message, seeded through the recurring numbers," guides the families to the buoy, but the story does not resolve whether rescue succeeds or whether her sacrifice was worth the cost. Minor deduction: the line "I have always wanted to find where deleted files go, partly for the families, partly for myself" edges toward thesis statement rather than letting the particulars carry the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The first-person narration is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices metadata slips "the way other people notice weather," describes servers as "a choir muffled by dust," and filters the archive through professional idiom ("checksum fragments," "raw audit trail," "corrupted thumbnails"). The retrospective frame is voice-motivated and consistent, compressing months of investigation into a single reflective arc that culminates in the morning walk into Legal. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the server room at midnight ("I slip into the Chute and pull back a veil"), more detached when summarizing the investigation's scope. Minor deduction: the line "I am brightly attentive, noticing the slips" reads as label-speak rather than demonstrated perception, and the phrase "singing its thin electrical lullaby" for the server room edges toward decorative diction that slightly inflates the register. The final beat—"I lie one last time"—maintains voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally; the opening establishes voice and stakes with "I am Mara Sato, the corporate memory keeper for Lattice, hired to sit in the social network archive where every post is preserved, and to listen for what the database refuses to say." Information density is high in the investigation beats: "They show up as comment counts, as time stamps on old videos, as checksum fragments on backups, and even as the track numbers of forgotten songs that users streamed in 2009 before the playlists were wiped." Minor loop issue: "I report the anomaly to my manager, then lie again, claiming it is a harmless indexing glitch" and later "In the morning I walk into Legal...and I lie one last time" create a paraphrase cycle around the lying action without adding pressure. Template-cadence check: several sentences in the middle third follow identical stems ("The trail repeats...I have always wanted...At midnight..."). Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("threads look like roads," "choir muffled by dust"), but the phrase "singing its thin electrical lullaby" edges toward purple without earning the elevation. No major artifacts obscure causality or closure, but the accumulation of minor loops and template stems prevents entry into higher bands. Deduction range: −0.6 for loops and stems, totaling within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archive, cold case, and deleted files as "exile" rather than destruction offers a fresh angle on memory and complicity. The recurring numbers as breadcrumbs, the Chute as a region where files "dissolve into zeroes," and the patch stitched to Mara's coat as both evidence and protest create a specific, non-obvious design. The piece transforms the familiar missing-persons premise by routing it through metadata and digital infrastructure rather than forensic investigation, and Mara's mother as the architect of the survivors' exile adds moral complexity. Minor deduction: the cold-case frame and corporate whistleblower arc are widely used templates, and while the digital-archive setting adds specificity, the emotional beats (archivist discovers conspiracy, risks career to reveal truth) follow a recognizable path. The risk-taking in using recurring numbers as a narrative device and compressing months into retrospective summary elevates within band, but the piece does not fully escape the template's gravity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as corporate memory keeper shapes every beat: she notices metadata slips, uses an old administrator account, pulls back corrupted thumbnails, and walks into Legal with the patch. Her decisions—to request the audit trail, to slip into the Chute at midnight, to lie to Legal while seeding the message—create the key turns. The character is present in setup, drives middle investigation, and executes the closure action. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement across the arc. Minor deduction: the retrospective frame means many choices are summarized rather than dramatized in the moment, which slightly reduces on-page decision weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The patch appears in the locked folder (ASTERIA-PATCH-ORIG), is described in sensory detail ("embroidered with a starburst and a tiny lattice pattern, scanned so closely that the threads look like roads"), and returns stitched to Mara's coat in the final beat, charging the closure image. Three distinct beats: discovery, description, and final reprise with reweighted meaning (evidence becomes protest symbol). The element is irreplaceable—removing the patch would break the closure's visual and thematic charge. Visible cost: Mara's act of wearing it into Legal signals defiance and risk. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cold case (Asteria mission, nine vanished passengers) is the engine of the investigation: it drives Mara's search through the archive, provides the recurring numbers, and reveals the corporate cover-up. The concept shapes tactics (Mara uses the old administrator account to access the Chute) and redefines stakes (from finding bodies to exposing "silence, engineered"). Present in setup (families tag the dead, ask where deleted files go), structures the middle investigation (following numbers to the Chute), and lands in closure (seeding the message to guide families to the buoy). Strong causal pressure and beat involvement. Minor deduction: the case itself is mostly backstory; the on-page investigation is metadata-driven rather than a traditional cold-case procedural, which slightly softens the concept's direct pressure in the present frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears in the opening paragraph as a label ("I am brightly attentive, noticing the slips in metadata") but does not constrain or enable specific on-page actions with visible cost. The trait is demonstrated through Mara's noticing of recurring numbers and metadata patterns, which could be attributed to professional skill rather than this specific attribute. No middle beat where heightened attention creates a trade-off or cost, and the trait does not return to charge the closure image. Functional but replaceable; the investigation would proceed identically if described as "skilled" or "meticulous." Present in setup, absent in middle development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lying appears three times with escalating stakes: Mara lies to her manager (calling the anomaly "a harmless indexing glitch"), lies again by requesting the audit trail through a forbidden account, and "lies one last time" to Legal while seeding the real message to families. The action redefines options at each turn—the first lie buys time, the second enables access, the third delivers the payoff. Removing the lying action would collapse the closure: Mara's final walk into Legal depends on the dual performance of compliance and subversion. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement (three distinct uses), and closure linkage. The element is irreplaceable and tied to visible cost (career jeopardy, moral compromise).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (11-27-73) appear as comment counts, time stamps, checksum fragments, track numbers, and storage-block coordinates. They structure the investigation: Mara follows them "like breadcrumbs," maps them to the Chute, and discovers they point to the buoy coordinates. The method shapes tactics (using the numbers to navigate the archive) and delivers the closure payload (seeding the numbers as a message to families). Present in setup (appearing "everywhere I search"), drives middle beats (leading to the locked folder and the Chute), and lands in closure (the "real message, seeded through the recurring numbers"). Strong beat involvement and causal pressure. Minor deduction: the mechanics of how the numbers encode the buoy location are asserted rather than demonstrated, which slightly reduces specificity and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The social network archive provides the physical setting (servers humming, status lights, Mara's desk), the professional context (memorial pages, deleted files, access logs), and the conceptual space (the Chute as exile region). The setting enables key choices: Mara uses the archive's structure (old administrator account, audit trail, locked folder) to navigate toward the revelation. The environment pressures her actions (midnight timing to avoid detection, the need to lie to Legal). Present in setup (anchored early with sensory detail), supplies resources in middle beats (the Chute, the private group chat), and contextualizes closure (walking into Legal from the archive). Strong functionality and beat involvement. Minor deduction: the archive as a whole is somewhat generic corporate infrastructure; the Chute as a specific region adds distinction but the broader setting could be swapped for another corporate tech environment with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once in the middle of the investigation: "Across the echo of those songs, the archive replays their clipped choruses while I follow the numbers like breadcrumbs." The timeframe is poetic and atmospheric but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The investigation spans "months," but elapsed time is summarized rather than tracked, and no live clock pressures Mara's choices. The phrase adds texture to the accumulative lens but does not constrain action or shape the ending. Present in one beat (middle discovery), absent in setup and closure payoff. Functional as mood but replaceable; removing it would not change the plot or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to find where deleted files go, partly for the families, partly for myself, because my mother left Lattice and vanished from my life with nothing but a blank profile"—is signaled early and drives every beat. The desire shapes the investigation (following numbers, accessing the Chute), structures the middle revelation (discovering her mother's voice in the final clip), and charges the closure (walking into Legal to deliver the message). The dual motivation (professional duty to families, personal grief over her mother) creates friction and cost: Mara risks her career for both. Strong setup, development across beats, and payoff in closure. The element is irreplaceable—removing this motivation would collapse the stakes. Minor deduction: the motivation is stated explicitly rather than discovered through micro-choices under pressure, which slightly reduces the felt weight of the internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensed absence is established in the opening ("even in the bright status lights I sense absence, as if certain names are missing from the air") and modulates through the investigation: the "muffled" choir of servers, the "thin electrical lullaby," the "veil of corrupted thumbnails," and the final realization that "the case was never about bodies; it was about silence, engineered." The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (Mara's silent walk into Legal, the "real message" seeded rather than spoken). The piece maintains tonal consistency—quiet, elegiac, archival—without flattening into static mood. Present in setup, threaded through middle beats, and shapes closure. Strong coherence and payoff. Minor deduction: the tone is more atmospheric than pressure-driving; it supports rather than alters tactics, which places it slightly below the highest band.</comment>
