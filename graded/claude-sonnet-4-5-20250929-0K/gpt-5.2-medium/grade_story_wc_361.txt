<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rook's jitteriness and need for motion anchor his character trait specifically. His internal contradiction between wanting to coax wonder and feeling Nera's absence creates genuine tension that drives micro-choices—offering the greeting, hesitating at handover, writing the question on the cairn. The final choice to leave the question rather than complete the transactional delivery earns a visible shift in stance. Minor: Mara's interior remains thin, serving more as catalyst than pressure point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to a conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening: Rook, ridgeway, aurora, dawn. The closure lands on-page when Rook writes the question on the cairn and understands "the delivery was never about ownership but about planting"—a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he releases the transactional model and Nera's direct presence). The vision of Nera decades prior and her words "Let them find wonder themselves" reweight the entire courier premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara refuses to accept the pendant and asks the ridge to keep it, narrowing Rook's options and forcing the shift from delivery-as-transaction to delivery-as-seed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ridgeway's aurora, scree, cairns, and iron-rich mountain constrain the closure: the pendant vibrates sympathetically with "the buried iron of the mountain," making the setting an active participant in the final reconfiguration. The lamplighter encounter demonstrates how the route itself extends brief moments. The cairn as anchor for Rook's chalk question charges the final image with spatial specificity. Sensory detail (green curtains, frozen scree, felt buzz) is selective and tied to pressure rather than catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Rook can honor Nera's cryptic instruction and his own desire to coax wonder while carrying the grief of her absence. The handover moment tightens when "his fingers would not let go"—a visible hesitation that opens the beat. Mara's refusal to accept the pendant deepens pressure by removing the transactional exit. The cost is legible: Rook relinquishes both the pendant and the hope of Nera's return, choosing to plant rather than possess. One clear escalation under the Hybrid lens; a second micro-turn (the lamplighter's unexpected connection) primes but does not over-complicate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as planted attention rather than delivered spectacle—emerges through specific actions: the pendant's sympathetic vibration, the lamplighter's bread, Mara's decision to let the ridge decide, Rook's chalk question. The vision of Nera placing "the same pendant" decades ago reweights the mentor-absence into a deliberate pattern of release. The final image (the question on the cairn, the pendant vibrating in the ridge's bones, children's answers germinating into tales) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph; pressure resolves into image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Rook's perceptual signature (jittery motion, felt absence, attention to small impossibilities) colors every beat. Diction stays within his register—"coax wonder from the routine," "smuggling small impossibilities"—without jarring leaps. Brief dialogue from the lamplighter and Mara feels natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs ("he wondered," "he expected") appear but remain voice-consistent. Minor: the phrase "vibrating sympathetically" recurs near-identically in two different contexts (lamplighter, mountain iron) without variation, creating a template echo that slightly flattens rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer action, memory, and thematic resonance. Rhythm varies appropriately—longer accumulative sentences in reflective beats, shorter when the pendant stirs or Mara speaks. The phrase "by vibrating sympathetically" appears twice in close succession with nearly identical syntax, creating a minor template-cadence slip (−0.4). "The vibration did not shake stones loose; instead it extended brief encounters that had never met, stitching Rook's memories…" is a strong, propulsive line. Opening and closing images are charged. No major loops or scaffold, but the repeated construction around "vibrating sympathetically" and the recurrence of "brief encounters" in multiple forms slightly dulls momentum in the climax third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of absent-mentor grief, relic-as-listener rather than spell-caster, and the courier's self-imposed mission to "coax wonder from the routine" feels specific and non-obvious. The twist that Nera planted the same pendant decades ago and that the delivery is "never about ownership but about planting" recontextualizes the entire courier premise in hindsight. The ending risk—leaving a question on a cairn for future travelers and schoolchildren—commits fully to the premise's implications. Minor: the "dragonfly-wing pendant" and "vibrating sympathetically" lean toward familiar metaphor territory (resonance, lightness), but the execution through ridge iron and time-stitching lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rook appears in every beat and makes the key choices: greeting the lamplighter (enabling the first pendant demonstration), hesitating at handover (opening the tightening), and writing the question on the cairn (the closure action). His jitteriness and need for motion are embodied throughout. Present by paragraph one; drives two middle beats (lamplighter mile, handover hesitation); decisive at closure. Cost: he releases transactional certainty and Nera's presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pendant is handled in three distinct beats: wrapped in Rook's pack, stirring against the lamplighter's loneliness, quivering at Mara's touch and fear, placed on the cairn where it vibrates with the mountain's iron and stitches memories. Setup in opening, development twice (lamplighter, Mara), payoff at closure when Rook understands it will keep vibrating in the ridge's bones. Its specific property—vibrating sympathetically—shapes each encounter and the final image. Irreplaceable: no other object type would permit this exact closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nera's absence generates Rook's internal conflict, the sealed note's cryptic instruction, and the emotional ache throughout. The vision at closure reveals she placed the same pendant decades ago, reframing the entire delivery as a pattern of planting rather than transaction. Present by opening paragraph, pressures the handover beat, and transforms meaning at closure. Cost: Rook must accept that her absence was intentional teaching. The vision of Nera on the ridge decades ago is the conceptual hinge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The attribute "extends brief encounters" is demonstrated three times: the lamplighter's shared mile, Mara's moment with Rook at the cairn, and the final image where the pendant extends encounters "that had never met, stitching Rook's memories to Mara's lessons and to the lamplighter's mile." Setup in opening (the note says "deliver it where routine forgets to look"), enacted in lamplighter beat, reweighted at closure when time slides "from memory to myth." The cost is legible: Rook gives up transactional closure for a dispersed, unknowable effect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears twice: Nera's teaching ("make a seed of attention germinate in a hard heart") and the closure line ("helping each child's answer germinate into a tale worth retelling"). It frames the thematic mechanism but does not drive a distinct turn—Rook's chalk question and the pendant's placement do the causal work. Present early via Nera's remembered lesson, returned at closure to charge the final image. Lyric reprise that reweights but does not independently pivot tactics. Strong thematic fit, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method "by vibrating sympathetically" is signaled in Nera's lesson ("such relics do not cast spells so much as listen"), demonstrated with the lamplighter's loneliness, enacted at Mara's touch when the wings quiver at her "practiced certainty and the tired fear behind it," and culminates when the pendant vibrates "with the buried iron of the mountain and with the two humans' shared longing." Present by mid-first-third, shapes two middle beats, pays off at closure. The method's specificity (sympathetic vibration vs. spell-casting) is essential to the thematic pivot from delivery to planting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway anchors every beat and supplies the iron-rich mountain that allows the pendant's final vibration. The cairns provide the surface for Rook's chalk question. The ridge itself becomes a character when Mara asks it "to keep [the pendant] until it decided whom it truly belonged to." Setup in opening, pressures navigation and encounter spacing, charges closure when the pendant vibrates in "the ridge's bones." The environment is not merely backdrop; it enables the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" appears once, in the climactic vision: "time slid across the fade from memory to myth, and Rook saw Nera on this very ridge decades ago." The timeframe reweights Rook's delivery into a mythic pattern rather than a single transaction. Present as concept in the opening (Nera's absence "as if the mountain air had swallowed her"), paid off at closure. Does not tighten tactics beat-to-beat; instead, the shift from lived time to mythic time is the conceptual repricing itself. Lyric use; moderate causal necessity but strong thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rook's desire "to coax wonder from the routine, smuggling small impossibilities into villages that measured life by milk pails and clock bells" is stated early and tested throughout: the lamplighter's unexpected connection, Mara's admission that her pupils no longer believe ridge tales, Rook's final choice to leave a question rather than complete a transaction. The motivation drives his hesitation at handover and his decision to write on the cairn. Cost: he must release the transactional model and trust dispersed, unknowable effects. Present by first paragraph, drives two beats, shapes closure.</comment>
