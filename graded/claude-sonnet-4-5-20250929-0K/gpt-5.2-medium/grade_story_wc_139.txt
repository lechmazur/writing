<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong: her interior ledger of truth and safety creates contradiction that drives choices under pressure. The shift from hiding Mercy to using it to write Sami's real story shows agency with cost—defying Ivo's con by choosing honest documentation. Sami's embodied fear ("pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence") and specific detail (published proofs, torn passport) ground his stakes. Minor: Ivo remains somewhat stock, his "practiced grin" and magician gestures leaning toward archetype, though his late deflation—"smaller"—earns the trajectory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mara's decision to write the real story in Mercy's ink enables Sami's credible testimony, which softens the agent and forestalls Ivo's con. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the prep room's "quiet labor had already priced the truth"—with visible cost: Ivo's collapse and Mara's ongoing calculation replace certainty. Orientation anchors quickly (prep room, Mara, corpse, Ivo's arrival). One meaningful tightening: agents' arrival forces the proof. The final image ("I keep calculating") leaves Mara in Charged Poise, the ledger open but the breach made.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room is vivid and functional: "air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die," the drain "gurgle like a throat clearing," stainless table and scalpel tray ground the space. The unclaimed woman's body anchors the thematic work—her toe tag becomes a micro-prop that constrains Mara's choice, reminding the agent of name-mishandling stakes. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. Minor: spatial choreography when agents enter could be tighter (positions of Ivo, Sami, agents less clear), but the setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Sami's asylum versus deportation, braided with Mara's search for fair trade. Pressure tightens when agents arrive, and Mara's gambit—showing the margins, sliding the toe tag—narrows Ivo's con and opens a path for truth. The agent's face "tightened, then softened" is a micro turn; questions shift from traps to openings. Cost is visible: Ivo's con collapses, the breach between father and daughter opens. One escalation point is sufficient at this length; the stakes remain coherent under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—the mathematics of fairness, truth's price against safety—emerges through concrete action: Mara's ledger, the ink that liquefies rigid thinking, the unclaimed woman as reminder of what happens when names are mishandled. The final exchange ("how she knew what was fair") and Mara's answer ("I do not know, but I keep calculating") offer a resonant, non-literal close that reweights the premise without moralizing. The prep room's conjunction of death work and asylum claim deepens the thematic inquiry. No overt thematic echo; subtext lives in gesture and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "a con artist's honest child" establishes idiom, and Mara's perceptual signature (ledgers, equations, symmetry) remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional—Ivo's rehearsed charm, Sami's soft proof, Mara's direct questions. Minor slips: "the way any rule book softened after a line was written with it" feels slightly expository, and some metaphors ("pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence") drift toward elevated register during high pressure. Free indirect style is clean; the prose reflects Mara's calculation-minded lens throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines serve character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor line-level issues: "swore its ink liquefies rigid thinking" reads as attributive exposition rather than dramatized discovery; "feeling life keep working even here" at the close is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. The paraphrase loop "Mara knew... Mara instead..." in adjacent paragraphs creates slight redundancy. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but figurative density in some beats ("air tasted," "gurgle like a throat") occasionally clusters without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—funeral prep room, asylum case, magic-realist ink, con artist's honest child—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar tropes (truth versus deception, immigrant peril) through the charged particularity of the unclaimed corpse as moral anchor and the ink pot as rule-liquefier. Risk-taking is present: the magical ink could have felt gimmicky, but it's grounded in Mara's prior observation and constrains her choice. The ending resists tidy resolution, committing to ongoing calculation rather than epiphany. Fresh angle on fairness and asylum earned through occupational and symbolic detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (con artist's honest child) is present throughout, her ledger-keeping and choice to write the real story create the key turn that alters Ivo's con and enables Sami's credible testimony. Her observation becomes decision with visible cost—the breach with Ivo. Setup early, middle choice (pulling Mercy from hiding, writing Sami's story), and closure participation (the final calculation exchange). Causal pressure is strong; the character's trait directly shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mercy (vintage ink pot) appears in multiple beats: introduced with backstory (softening rule books), hidden by Mara, pulled out and used to write Sami's real story, and its ink "shimmered" on the affidavit pages when the agent reads them, softening his stance. Final image places it "beside the unclaimed woman's folded hands." Setup early, middle use constrains choice, closure linkage via the shimmer and final positioning. High irreplaceability—its specific property (liquefies rigid thinking) drives the agent's shift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Political asylum shapes the dominant stake from the moment Ivo arrives with Sami ("needs political asylum before the men at the border notice"). The asylum interview's "wall of rigid questions" and "the slightest lie would become a breach" drive Mara's choice to write the real story instead of Ivo's false narrative. Setup early, middle tactics (writing margins, preparing the affidavit), and closure outcome (agents move Sami to shelter to await review). Causal pressure and closure linkage are clear; the concept alters options throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is attributed to Mercy's ink early, shown in past action (rule books softening), and tested on-page when the agent's face "tightened, then softened" after reading the ink-soaked affidavit and questions shift from traps to openings. Setup early, middle constraint (Mara's choice to use it), and closure participation (the agent's softening). Cost is visible—Ivo's con collapses. Specificity is high, but the mechanism's magic-realist nature reduces grounding; the trait is more told than embodied in repeated beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Breach" appears explicitly near the end: "Ivo watched his con collapse, and in that collapse Mara saw her first honest breach in the wall between them." It names the major turn—Mara's defiance creates a rift with Ivo—but the word itself arrives late (after the peak choice). The action (breaking the con, sliding the toe tag, choosing truth over Ivo's rehearsed lie) redefines father-daughter options. Setup is thematic (Mara's ledger seeks safety against truth), middle choice enacts it, closure names it. Solid causal role, but the label's late arrival and its interchangeability with "rift" or "break" lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is signaled when Mara tells Ivo "she would help, but only by waiting actively, studying each step like a proof." The method shapes her middle action: rather than rushing or passively obeying, she prepares Sami's real story, studies the steps, and waits for the agents to arrive before acting. Setup in dialogue, middle constraint (her preparation during the wait), but the mechanics are less visible than Mara's direct writing and prop-sliding. It frames her stance but is somewhat swappable with "deliberate patience" or "strategic observation."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is present throughout: stainless table, scalpel tray, unclaimed woman's body, disinfectant and roses, formaldehyde. The setting supplies the crucial resource—the woman's toe tag—which Mara slides across the counter as a silent reminder, constraining the agent's stance. The space's occupational logic (death work, viewing preparation) charges the asylum negotiation with memento-mori pressure. Setup immediate, middle choices use props from the space, and the final image ("capped the vintage ink pot, and placed it beside the unclaimed woman's folded hands") anchors closure. High irreplaceability; the prep room's particulars shape tactics and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to find the mathematics of a fair trade") is introduced early via her ledger ("one impossible equation: how much truth was enough to buy safety") and tested in the middle when she asks Sami "what he had traded for this request." Her final choice—writing the real story instead of Ivo's con—dramatizes the friction between fair trade and her father's risk-offloading. Closure directly addresses it: Ivo asks "how she knew what was fair," and Mara answers "I do not know, but I keep calculating." Setup early, middle friction, and closure participation. Cost is visible—rejecting Ivo's method isolates her.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is coherent throughout: the prep room's "air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die," the drain "gurgle like a throat," Sami's "pulse beat loud enough to animate the silence," the fluorescent lights making his skin "look embalmed, yet his pulse beat loud," and the final line "feeling life keep working even here." Tone braids death imagery with active pressure—stitching, washing, writing—charging the asylum stakes with mortality's frame. Setup immediate, modulates with pressure (Sami's fear, agents' arrival), and the final image ("life keep working even here") recharges the motif. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
