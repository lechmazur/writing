<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to find resilience is clear and grounded in economic need (seed rights) layered with curiosity. Her internal contradiction—dismissing superstition then testing it—drives action coherently. The arrow-tip discovery and seedling experiment provide embodied micro-choices that advance her stance. However, the final choice to embed the arrow tip feels more ritual than renunciation with visible cost; she accepts a thesis rather than foreclosing a path through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Lysa presses the arrow tip into the stone tree, accepting resilience as distributed chorus rather than singular source—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation anchors early (Pomona Drift, orchard pilot, seventh-day inversion). The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: gravity inversion deepens atmosphere, the arrow tip's warmth and echo-layering build density, and the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when she crosses the hollow threshold and hears layered heartbeats. Cost is conceptual (renouncing the search for one miracle) but the final act—embedding her arrow—reads more as joining than forfeiting, muting felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, inverted gravity, and irrigation channels climbing like glass ladders create vivid, purposeful constraint. Water-flow navigation is signaled early and pressures her route choice at the climax. The arrow tip's warmth and the stone tree with embedded tips function as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory detail (violet sky, orbiting fruit, whirling silence) is filtered through Lysa's pilot attention and supports the lyric accumulation without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early and sustained. The inversion hour provides a timed constraint; following water upward tightens her path. Crossing the hollow threshold deepens pressure through echo-layering and warmth cues. The arrow-tip legend escalates from dismissed superstition to tested tool to revealed origin. However, the climax lacks a decisive reversal or trade-off; Lysa's choice to embed the arrow feels confirmatory rather than a forced renunciation with visible cost, softening escalation impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as chorus of choices rather than miracle source—emerges through the arrow tips, echo-layering, and the final stone tree image without overt statement. The broken arrow that heals and the historical turn of weapons into grafting tools provide non-literal thematic charge. Subtext operates in the warmth cue, the layered heartbeats, and the final act of pressing metal into stone. The ending reweights the premise with conceptual cost (renouncing singular miracle) though emotional price remains oblique, slightly muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Lysa's perceptual signature (watching water, pilot attention to arches and orbits) is consistent and voice-particular. Diction—"whirling silence," "pale fingers," "coached to be strong"—carries lyric control without register drift. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she had learned," "she had dismissed") early on is acceptable as grounding. Compression intensifies at the climax (layered heartbeats, repeating patterns) without obscuring causality. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: gravity inversion mechanics, water navigation, arrow-tip discovery, seedling test, and echo origin compressed without redundancy. Minor template cadence in early exposition ("she had learned," "she had dismissed," "she decided") and one paraphrase loop ("the arrow tip grew warm…tugging her") slightly flatten momentum. The final image—pressing the arrow into the stone tree—propels cleanly. No metaphor muddle or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—gravity-inverting orchard planet where broken weapons heal trees—offers fresh synthesis. Water-flow navigation during inversion and the stone tree embedded with arrow tips transform familiar quest-for-secret tropes through specific world logic and lyric accumulation. The historical turn (pilots firing metal seeds as grafting tools) is non-obvious and earned in hindsight. The ending avoids tidy moral, instead offering a charged image of collective memory. Risk-taking in compression and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysa is present throughout, flies during inversion, tests the arrow tip on seedlings (middle development), and presses it into the stone tree (closure). However, key turns trace more to the arrow tip's revelations than her decisions under pressure; she follows cues rather than choosing between competing goods. Her agency is observational at climax, not decisional with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears early (raider skirmish discovery), constrains middle action (seedling test, warmth navigation cue), and is causally active at closure (embedded in stone tree). It accumulates meaning across three distinct beats and its final use reweights the premise (resilience as chorus). Removing it would collapse the central causal chain and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is signaled by farmers early, dismissed then sought, and dramatized at climax (layered heartbeats, repeating patterns of drip/root/wind). It shapes Lysa's navigation choice and delivers the origin revelation. The concept constrains her route, charges the final image, and is indispensable to closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accelerated plant growth appears in the seedling test (middle beat) with visible effect ("stems stretched in minutes, then steadied") and explains the arrow tip's past healing role. It enables her hypothesis and motivates the search. However, it does not constrain a closure choice with visible cost; the attribute informs rather than pressures the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Discover" drives the narrative goal (find the source of resilience), the inversion-hour search, and the climax revelation (arrow tips as grafting tools). The action is present across setup, middle navigation, and closure. However, the discovery itself is delivered via echo-vision rather than protagonist agency under pressure, slightly reducing irreplaceability; a similar revelation mechanism could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("learned to fly by watching water flow"), invoked at the inversion turn ("she listened for the faintest rush of water"), and executed in the climax approach ("following the bright threads into a canyon"). The method constrains her route choice, shapes tactics under the inverted-gravity condition, and is mechanically specific. Removing it would break the navigation logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches anchors all action. Arches form the ring around the hollow center at climax, terraces and irrigation channels provide navigational structure, and the stone tree grows from bare rock. The setting pressures flight choices, supplies the echo-gathering mechanism, and charges the closure image. Spatial logic is consistent and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is signaled early (every seventh day), tightens the window ("at the appointed dusk"), and shapes all climax action (fruit orbiting, irrigation climbing, slab hovering, gravity righting at the end). The timeframe constrains navigation tactics and adds urgency. Removing it would collapse the core world mechanic and much of the atmospheric charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation to find the source of resilience is stated early, drives her decision to test the arrow and fly during inversion, and is reframed at closure (resilience as chorus). However, the motivation is more intellectual curiosity than conflicted desire with visible emotional cost; no competing want or fear creates friction. Dramatization is present but lacks internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears in the opening line ("air around the arches held a whirling silence"), recurs at the threshold ("the whirling silence tightened"), and modulates with pressure (engines "seem like thoughts," then only heartbeat audible). The tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the final image without static repetition. Strong lyric integration across setup and closure.</comment>
