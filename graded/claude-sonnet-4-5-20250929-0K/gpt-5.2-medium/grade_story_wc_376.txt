<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's agency is clear—she chooses to pursue the map, climb to the hatch, write the honest note—and her motivation to find lost conversations (and her brother) is established early. Interiority remains concrete through embodied details (the fern, the zinc fragment in her pocket), and her final choice to confront Lio "with one clean question" forecloses the path of accusation with visible cost. Minor slip: the move from finding the map to deciding to follow it lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or hesitation that would deepen the contradiction between wanting the water and wanting her brother back.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Mara, calligrapher, greenhouse city, post-oasis failure). The causal lens holds: map discovery → climb → hatch opens with zinc seal → conduit reveals Lio's bundle → honest note unlocks cistern location. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara leaves with the vellum and a "clean question," reweighting the relationship from accusation to candor, with the cost of uncertainty felt in "practiced the question in her mouth" and "the city felt answerable" (not answered). One tightening—moving from scattered loss to actionable map to candor-gated water—narrows options with visible cost (she must face Lio without certainty of reconciliation).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city constrains movement (algae canals, biodome spine, maintenance hatch) and the toxic sky frames every choice as survival-scaled. The fern Sable functions as micro-setting and recurring object: it wilts at dishonesty, guiding Mara's exchanges and validating her final honest note. The conduit's translucent tubes with floating scraps and the scent of "ink, ozone, and something like rain" charge the final third with sensory specificity and thematic weight, making the setting essential to the closure (candor unlocks access).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go, driven by Lio's silence—is signaled early and tightens through the climb, the hatch unlock, and the conduit revelation. One meaningful escalation: Mara's realization that only candor will reopen the cistern forces her to write an honest admission of dual wants (water and brother), a trade-off with visible emotional cost. The resolution is protagonist-driven (her choice to write plainly) and the cost is legible: she must face Lio with vulnerability rather than accusation, and the water remains conditional on their future exchange.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—candor in small moments versus the lies people use to survive—emerges organically from Sable's wilting, the conduit's function ("composted into air"), and Lio's vellum fragments. The final image ("practiced the question in her mouth, and for the first time since the oasis dried, the city felt answerable") offers a non-literal answer: honesty makes connection possible again, but does not guarantee it. No overt thesis; subtext operates in the wilting fern, the "small lies people used to survive," and the contrast between gold-leaf shine and plain paper. Minor note: "candor could reopen the cistern without poisoning it" edges slightly toward articulating the premise, but is spoken by Rull and remains scene-functional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mara; perceptual signature is selective (she notices shine, torn fibers, Sable's responses). Diction remains consistent ("words people swallowed," "quiet demand for candor") and modulates under pressure without register drift. Two minor slips: "carried the scent of ink, ozone, and something like rain that the city no longer owned" leans slightly elevated for the moment, and the phrase "fear that telling her would invite thieves" in Lio's vellum reads as summary rather than Mara's interpretation of fragmented text. Dialogue with Archivist Rull is brief and functional; no voice-convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence appears in the conduit sequence: "She reread... asked... understood... wrote" stacks protagonist-verb stems without variation, and "by dawn she had..." plus "When she reached..." are slight scaffold openers. No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddles touch the closure beat. Figurative language ("paper scraps floated like jellyfish," "words that had never been said aloud") remains legible and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—gilded calligrapher, truth-sensing fern, conduit of lost words, candor-gated water—feels cohesive and specific to this world. The greenhouse-city-under-toxic-sky premise and water-scarcity stakes are familiar post-apocalyptic elements, but the focus on lost conversations and the postal-guild angle offer a fresher inflection. Transformation test: swapping names and removing the fern/conduit would flatten the thematic charge, suggesting earned originality. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric tone and symbolic fern are unconventional but legible, and the closure avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (gilded-leaf calligrapher) drives all major beats: finds the map, climbs to the hatch, asks for Lio's bundle, writes the honest note that unlocks the cistern path, and chooses to confront Lio with a question rather than accusation. Her occupation (gilding words) directly contrasts with the final plain-paper note, charging the closure. Early signal, three distinct beats (discovery, conduit entry, honest admission), causal pressure (her choices narrow options), and closure linkage (her profession and candor converge in the final choice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in three beats: discovery under the floorboard, carried in her pocket during the climb, and pressed into the hatch lock to open it. Its postal-guild history and Dead Letter Seal make it specific and irreplaceable for unlocking the conduit. Participation in closure is indirect—it enables access but does not reappear or reweight meaning in the final image. Early signal, causal pressure (unlocks the hatch), two distinct beats, but no closure reprise limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is the core concept: Sable wilts at dishonesty and revives at truthful exchanges, Mara offers "a single truthful line" to workers, and only her honest admission on plain paper clears the tubes and reveals the cistern map. The concept shapes stakes (only candor can reopen the cistern), tactics (her decision to write without gold), and the final choice (practicing "one clean question" instead of accusation). Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, and closure linkage (candor enables the path forward and reweights her relationship with Lio).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attribute "wilts near dishonesty" (Sable the fern) is introduced early and constrains two on-page actions: it revives when Mara offers a truthful line to workers (guiding her tactic) and stays upright through her honest note, validating her admission and enabling the tubes to clear. It also droops at Lio's false claim, deepening characterization. Early signal, causal pressure (guides exchanges and validates honesty), two beats, and indirect closure linkage (the honest note's success depends on this attribute). Minor cap: the fern does not appear in the final image itself, limiting direct closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reread" drives two key turns: Mara rereads the map scraps to piece them together (enabling the route discovery), and rereads Lio's vellum fragments to understand his pattern of fear and the false claim. The action is specific and irreplaceable—without sustained close attention to torn/fragmented text, neither the map route nor Lio's motive would emerge. Early signal (map), two distinct beats (map assembly, Lio's bundle), and causal pressure (both rereads unlock critical knowledge). Closure linkage is indirect: the honest note follows from understanding Lio's lie, but "reread" itself does not appear in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded treasure map is signaled early ("reread the map scraps," "aligning torn fibers like veins") and occupies one substantial beat in the first third, yielding the route to the Echo Conduit. The mechanics matter—Mara's care to align fibers and find the spiraled arrow—and the result is causal (the map directs her climb). However, the method does not constrain or enable later choices once the route is known, and it does not reappear or reweight meaning at closure. Early signal, one beat, causal role in setup, but no middle development or closure linkage limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky frames all choices (water scarcity, sealed domes, respirators, algae canals) and provides the biodome spine route and the maintenance hatch as physical constraints. The toxic sky appears in the opening and final line ("under the toxic sky"), creating a lyric bookend. The setting supplies resources (the conduit hidden in city infrastructure) and pressures movement (the climb past glass orchards). Early signal, shapes tactics (the route), and closure reprise (final image), but the greenhouse/toxic-sky details do not directly alter the ending choice (candor does). Solid integration across beats but not indispensable to the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the oasis dried" establishes backstory causality (water caravans stopped, conversations grew thin, Lio left) and frames urgency—Mara seeks water and lost connection in a city defined by post-collapse scarcity. The timeframe appears in the opening and returns in the final line ("since the oasis dried"). However, no live clock tightens on-page decisions; Mara's climb and conduit visit unfold without time pressure, and the ending is open ("planning not to confront"). The timeframe colors stakes and atmosphere but does not constrain tactical choices. Early signal, thematic weight, lyric reprise, but limited causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To find where lost conversations go" is Mara's explicit motivation, established early ("She began to wonder") and dramatized through the map discovery, the climb, and the conduit entry. The desire is conflicted: she wants both the water (pragmatic) and her brother back (relational), a friction visible in her honest note ("I wanted the water and also wanted her brother back"). The motivation shapes every choice—pursuing the map, asking for Lio's bundle, writing without gold—and culminates in the decision to ask "one clean question" rather than accuse. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, friction with cost, and closure linkage (the question is the answer to the lost-conversation problem).</comment>
