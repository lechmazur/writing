<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Noah's observant restraint is consistently embodied—he reads weight, mood, and unspoken terror without questioning. His micro-choices (carrying crates, writing the anonymous letter, building cairns until his fingers bleed) show a hierarchy of protective instinct over verbal fluency. The final choice to restore the lamp alongside Maris and leave the envelope feels earned by his established pattern. Minor slip: Maris remains thinly sketched; her "quiet courage" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (dark lighthouse, letter chain, stone cairns) and a cadence shift at the ending when the lamp returns and "did not blaze; it sighed." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the anonymous chain holds, the beam resumes, and Noah feels "a bottled safety warming in the dark" with visible cost (bleeding fingers, unspoken effort). Orientation anchors early (Noah, Brinecap Light, last run of October, lamp out). One minor seam: the phrase "after the lamp flickers out" in the inciting-incident sentence then "entered the lantern room after the lamp flickers out" mid-story reads as tense inconsistency, though it does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room, the brass table with sea glass, the shingle beach, and the stone cairns all constrain choices and charge the final image. The lens "gleam[s] with an aching, drowned luminescence," the wind pushes at panes, and Noah's body (bleeding fingers, chest sore) anchors the work. The cairn grammar (three flat stones = safe water, single tall = come) teaches a micro-setting rule that enables the trawler's horn response and the climactic "come" stack with Maris. The setting drives action rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the beacon to protect the sea lanes—is signaled early and tightens through the radio mast failure, forcing reliance on stones and paper. Noah's agency shows in building cairns, writing the letter, and climbing to repair the lamp; each move forecloses passivity with visible cost (bleeding fingers, exhaustion). The trawler's horn-answer and the lamp's return provide on-page consequence. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening through the letter chain and stone messages until the final glow "left his chest sore."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the anonymous letter chain as "a bottle, passed hand to hand across years," the cairns as hidden grammar, and Noah's childhood memory of his mother bottling safety. The ending image—"the anonymous chain hold, a bottled safety warming in the dark"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to protect strangers, how to hold fear) without moralizing. The sea glass, cairns, and letter all accumulate meaning and reweight prior material. The piece resists tidy binaries: fear is not erased but "held, smoothed, and made harmless."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third limited on Noah, with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: "every crate by weight, every wave by mood." Diction remains character-particular ("the dark made the lens gleam with an aching, drowned luminescence"), and the prose modulates under pressure (short clauses at peak beats: "come. And Maris joined him with a wrench"). Minor slip: the phrase "warmly observant habit was a kindness he never admitted to" reads slightly over-articulated for the established voice, edging toward authorial summary rather than Noah's self-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density: "the island exhaled," "a throat refusing to sing," "the wind pushed at the panes." Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language coheres (bottle, breath, light as eye). Two minor artifacts lower the score: the phrase "after the lamp flickers out" appears twice with tense inconsistency, and "the haunted lantern room" is named identically in two separate paragraphs, reading as a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs; the closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-keeper isolation, anonymous care-chain, and stone-message grammar feels specific and non-obvious. The cairn code and letter tradition transform familiar maritime-danger tropes through grounded detail (bleeding fingers, wrench work, the trawler's answering horn). Risk-taking in structure (accumulative pressure, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the haunted-lantern-room frame and "old watchfulness like a scent" echo familiar gothic maritime atmospherics without full transformation, keeping the piece in the strong rather than exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Noah's reticence shapes key turns: he reads Maris's terror without asking, writes the anonymous letter "in careful block letters" because "he had never been good at saying what mattered," and builds cairns instead of speaking. His observant restraint enables the protective action and letter-writing beats. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (letter-reading, cairn-building), and closure (lamp repair, envelope placement). Causal pressure is strong; cost is visible (bleeding fingers, unspoken effort). Slightly below indispensable because another taciturn protector could fill the role with edits, though the fit is tight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three distinct beats: on the brass table beside the letter (setup), carried in Noah's pocket, and placed atop the first cairn where "a trawler answered with its horn." Returns with reweighted meaning in the final envelope: "he wrapped the sea glass in the paper so it would not cut." The object constrains choice (Noah builds the cairn to signal safe water) and charges the closure by linking the letter chain to the stone messages. Specific properties (green, softened, promise that "fear could be held, smoothed, and made harmless") matter. Just below indispensable; another small token could serve with modest rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is the story's spine: it explains the dark lantern room's history, instructs stone-message tactics, and compels Noah to write his own addition. Shapes stakes (the chain as "a bottled safety warming in the dark") and tactics (Noah leaves the envelope "where the next fearful hands would reach"). Present in setup (letter discovered), middle (read aloud, Noah carries sea glass), and closure (Noah writes and places the next letter). Cost is visible (Noah's struggle to write, bleeding fingers from cairn work). Removing the letter chain would collapse the plot and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" enables Noah to read Maris's terror without her asking, see the extra life vests, and "protect her quiet courage" by taking action. Constrains his verbal reticence: he writes "nothing that night, because he had never been good at saying what mattered." The trait drives the protective choice to build cairns and write anonymously. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (observing Maris, reading her fear), and closure (writing "in careful block letters" without signing). Cost is implicit in his silence and solitary labor. Slightly below 8.0 because the trait overlaps with "reticent" and could be replaced by "perceptive" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protection drives every major turn: Noah carries crates, climbs the spiral, reads the letter aloud to Maris, builds cairns "protecting strangers he would never meet," writes the anonymous note, and repairs the lamp with Maris. The action redefines options (from passive observation to active guardianship) and is inseparable from the closure: "the anonymous chain hold, a bottled safety warming in the dark." Present in setup (meeting Maris at the slip), middle (cairn-building, letter-writing), and closure (lamp repair, envelope placement). Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, chest sore, unspoken effort). Removing "protect" would require rewriting the entire arc; no near-synonym fits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is seeded early ("In that way of stacking stones as messages, three flat stones meant safe water, two meant trouble, and a single tall cairn meant come") and its mechanics matter: Noah builds the first three-stone stack with sea glass on top, the trawler responds, and he later builds a tall cairn ("come") that brings Maris to join him. The method shapes attempts (Noah compensates for the weak radio and skiff lamp) and is causally active at closure. Present in setup (grammar taught mid-story but linked to the letter's instruction), middle (first cairn, trawler response), and closure (tall cairn, Maris joins). Just below indispensable because another signaling system could replace it with moderate rewrites, though the fit is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room pressures choices: "the air held old watchfulness like a scent," "the great lens sat black as a closed eye, yet Noah felt it staring, measuring whether he would flinch." The brass table supplies the letter and sea glass; the room's "aching, drowned luminescence" charges the atmosphere and Noah's realization about the letter chain. Present in setup (Noah enters after the lamp flickers out), middle (letter discovery, writing the note), and closure (finding another envelope, lamp restoration). The "haunting" shifts from threat to "an old keeper leaning close, insisting that silence could be useful," altering Noah's stance. Slightly below 8.0 because the room's specific features (lens, table, panes) are atmospheric more than constraint-drivers; the work could occur in a generic tower room with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the lamp flickers out" frames the entire sequence and tightens decisions: without the beacon, "freighters would aim by rumor, and rumor was how people died out here." The darkness forces reliance on stones and paper. Time is tracked loosely ("that night," "at dawn," "when Maris finally slept") but lacks a live clock that escalates moment-to-moment pressure. Present in setup (lamp out as inciting incident), middle (darkness constrains repair options), and closure (lamp restoration). The timeframe shapes stakes but does not narrow tactical windows beat-by-beat, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to "bottle the feeling of safety" is dramatized through Noah's memory of his mother humming in a storm closet and his realization that "the letter chain was the same bottle, passed hand to hand across years." The motivation drives his choice to write ("he could add his own"), build cairns, and restore the lamp. Conflict is visible: Noah "had never been good at saying what mattered" yet writes the letter; he works until his fingers bleed. Present in setup (implicit in his protective observation), middle (memory and realization), and closure (letter-writing, lamp repair, "a bottled safety warming in the dark"). Cost is felt and visible. Just below indispensable because another protective motive could serve with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" coheres through the piece: "the lantern went dim behind the fog," "the dark made the lens gleam with an aching, drowned luminescence," "the lamp returned... did not blaze; it sighed into a steady glow that painted the fog silver and left his chest sore." Tone modulates with pressure (Noah's quiet observation, the cairn-building intensity, the closure's gentle exhaustion) and charges the final image: "the anonymous chain hold, a bottled safety warming in the dark." No tonal breaks or static mood; the ache is both visual (light) and emotional (cost, tenderness). Slightly below indispensable because another tonal palette (e.g., "quiet resolve") could serve with rewrites, though the fit is very strong.</comment>
