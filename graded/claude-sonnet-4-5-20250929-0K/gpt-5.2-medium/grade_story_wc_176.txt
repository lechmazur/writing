<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is specific and grounded in craft: misreading metal, listening for fiber creak, pricking wax with holes. The guilt over erased names is concretely embodied in "an ingot in my chest" and the final choice to cast a durable transcript is motivated by prior particulars. The arc from carrying the mistake to mending it through exact technical work is earned, though the emotional progression is somewhat smooth—no contradictory impulses complicate the final act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist learns to mend what was broken by aligning knot to gap, and the final image of playing the bronze strip in the village square reconfigures the stakes with visible cost (the entire journey, the technical labor, the public reckoning). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through craft detail, pattern emerges (punched holes → rope braids → bronze strip), and the final line reweights the opening sentence with cadence shift. Cost is legible in the commitment to public performance and the deliberate choice to honor forgotten names alongside the two erased. One minor slip: the Archivist's invitation and the sanctum's mechanics are introduced quickly without much friction, slightly softening the because/therefore linkage in the first third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and craft tools constrain choices throughout: the rope must be warmed over seal oil, the wax tray is pricked with the punched-card pattern, the bronze strip can survive fire and flood. Micro-setting (the protagonist's hands, the rope, the punched card) functions as setting and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the glacier road, the blue-ice chamber, and the furnace room. The sanctum itself is vivid but does not pressure a major choice; it supplies resources and atmosphere more than obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names and mending the memorial chime error—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through the rope-reconfiguration sequence. Agency is technical: the protagonist chooses to align knot to gap, pricks wax, pours bronze. The escalation is driven by craft precision under the inferred Accumulative lens: each step narrows the method and raises the stakes (if the pattern fails, the names remain lost). Cost is visible in the labor, the public commitment, and the protagonist's acceptance that forgiveness is "learning the exact way to mend it." No major reversals or sharp turns, but the deepening through tactile craft detail and the final forfeiture of silence is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: forgiveness as technical mending, absence as a mold to be filled, memory encoded in knots and holes. The final image—children dancing to names they never knew, the old chime no longer alone—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The opening line ("After forgiving yourself, the world does not brighten at once; it thaws") is reprised in the closing insight, reweighting it with the labor between. The metaphor of negative spaces and punched holes is sustained and charged at closure. One small slip: the phrase "snowmelt ardor" in the climax moment edges toward poetic labeling rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the caster's attention to metal, wax, fiber creak, and negative spaces. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("filings in a bell," "an ingot in my chest"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's "I realized" edges toward expository insight, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closing image, but the line recovers with the concrete metaphor of "one carefully illuminated braid at a time." Psychic distance shifts intentionally, modulating with the protagonist's focus on craft and memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or craft. Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the protagonist's attention. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two minor slips: "the holes chewed and patched, still smelling of tar and songs" stacks modifiers without tight propulsion, and "snowmelt ardor against my cheeks" is a figurative reach that slightly obscures the sensory moment. The final line's "one carefully illuminated braid at a time" risks overwriting but earns its place by charging the closure image with the rope motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, knotted memory encoding, and aurora-triggered harmonics is specific and non-obvious. The emotional arc—guilt over erased names, technical mending, public restitution—feels earned and particular to this protagonist. The transformation of the punched-card pattern into a bronze music strip is ingenious. One friction: the premise (forgotten names encoded in ceremonial rope, preserved by a guilt-driven caster) leans on a constellation of conveniences (the Archivist's invitation, the aurora's precise mechanics, the alignment of craft skills) that slightly soften the inevitability. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost-wax caster's craft knowledge drives all major turns: mapping rope to punched holes, pricking wax, pouring bronze. Setup early, developed in the rope-reconfiguration sequence, and essential to closure—the bronze strip could not exist without the caster's method. Two beats (studying the pattern, casting the bronze) and causal pressure throughout. The decision to cast the sound is the protagonist's final agency. Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The punched card scrap appears in the chamber, is studied alongside the rope, and is pressed into wax to create the mold. Three beats (introduction, study, impression) and it enables the final casting. Closure linkage is solid: the card's pattern becomes the bronze strip. One friction: the card is introduced abruptly in the sanctum without prior mention, slightly softening its setup. Still, the card's holes are essential to the method and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes stakes throughout: the Archivist wants names preserved, the protagonist aligns knots to gaps to encode memory, and the bronze strip is "a durable transcript." The concept is active in the rope-reconfiguration sequence and charges the closure image (children dancing to names they never knew). Setup, development, and payoff all present. The concept constrains tactics (the protagonist must learn the grammar of knots) and alters the final outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is embodied early ("the smallest hurry leaves pits") and constrains every on-page action: the protagonist warms gloves before touching the rope, picks strand by strand, listens for fiber creak, and pours bronze in a steady stream. The trait is essential to the method and visible in the protagonist's choices. The cost of gentleness is time and patience, legible on the page. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the climax: the sanctum brightens, threads of color run down the rope to illuminate frost bells, and the bells ring with light. The action redefines options—the protagonist can now hear the forgotten names—and charges the closure image. Setup in the aurora's shimmer, payoff in the frost-bell sequence. The action is indispensable to the method and the emotional turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the rope braids is the central method, signaled early ("The Archivist explained that each braid encoded a line"), developed in the picking-apart sequence ("I mapped the rope against the punched holes, aligning knot to gap"), and paid off when the final tuck triggers the aurora. The method shapes all middle attempts and is essential to closure. The protagonist's craft knowledge makes the method specific and irreplaceable. High causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum supplies the rope, the aurora, and the furnace room, all of which constrain the protagonist's method. The setting pressures choices (the protagonist must work in extreme cold, the aurora must read the rope) and provides resources (seal oil, the ice chamber). Setup early, development across the rope and casting sequences, and payoff in the final image of leaving the sanctum. The micro-setting (the protagonist's hands, the wax tray) does more tactical work than the macro-setting, but the sanctum is essential context.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving yourself" is the opening anchor and the thematic hinge: the Archivist invites the protagonist only after the apology. The timeframe recurs in the closing insight ("Forgiveness, I realized as the aurora faded"). Setup and payoff present, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics within the main sequence—the protagonist's work proceeds at the pace of craft, not a live clock. The timeframe reweights the premise but does not constrain the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is dramatized early (the Archivist's request), drives the rope-reconfiguration sequence, and is honored in the closing image (playing the strip in the village square so "my old chime will no longer stand alone"). The motivation is conflicted: the protagonist seeks to mend the original error by adding new names, creating a chord "that did not accuse." Friction between guilt and restitution is legible. Setup, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears explicitly in the frost-bell climax ("notes fell into the chamber in warm droplets, snowmelt ardor against my cheeks") and implicitly in the opening metaphor of thawing. The tone modulates from cold stillness (glacier road, blue ice) to warmth (the furnace, the bronze cooling) and charges the final image of children dancing. Setup in the thawing metaphor, development in the tactile warmth of the frost bells, and payoff in the protagonist's realization. The phrase "snowmelt ardor" is slightly over-articulated, but the tonal shift is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
