<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and her embodied response to Mara's silence shows controlled interiority. The locket touch and final choice to share the curl demonstrate agency under pressure. However, the brother's backstory and the explanation of her "cautious exuberance" lean toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction, and the final whistle exchange feels too calibrated—a therapist performing therapy rather than a person wrestling with grief's asymmetry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors efficiently (Ridge, clinic, Mara's silence by ~80 words). The eclipse functions as a pressure point that narrows options and the curl-sharing creates a meaningful turn when Mara hums, then speaks. Closure lands on the page with cost (vulnerability of sharing the keepsake, grief acknowledged aloud). The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: therapeutic choices link causally while sensory density during totality deepens the stakes. One meaningful tightening is achieved, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("not about grand miracles") edges toward telling where resonance had already been shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sage Ridge, the Dreaming Roots grove, and the eclipse's "dim blue hush" are vivid and purposeful. The kalimba and locket function as micro-setting tools that constrain Liora's choices and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency—shadows sharpen, birds go uncertain, color seeps back—without catalog excess. The grove's "room without walls" at totality directly enables the vulnerable exchange that unlocks Mara's voice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching Mara through music and shared grief—is signaled early and escalates through the eclipse plan. Liora's choice to show the curl is a genuine risk with relational cost (exposing her own wound to a grieving child). Mara's hum, then whisper, emerge from prior causal pressure rather than convenience. The lack of a clear secondary complication (e.g., mother's hesitation, Mara's fear during darkness) leaves the escalation curve somewhat gentle, but the single tightening is sufficient for this length and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the locket, eclipse, and the "ordinary magic" of shared attention rather than statement. The final image—Mara copying the whistle—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief and connection. However, the closing lines ("not about grand miracles but about noticing the small ones together") shift into mild thematic summary that undermines the prior embodiment. The phrase "nurturing lifelong wonder" also echoes prompt language too directly in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with lyric compression ("scrubby juniper clung to stone," "thin thread at first, then steadier") that matches Liora's professional lens. POV remains stable in third-limited with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—phrasings like "quietly practical" and "cautiously exuberance" read more like editorial summary than character-specific noticing. Filter verbs ("found the girl's silence softly adaptive") are acceptable but stack in early exposition, mildly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("moon began to nibble the sun," "love keeps changing and still stays"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "ordinary magic" is stated three times, "cautious exuberance" twice, and the locket's meaning is explained in both the climax and the denouement. Template stems recur ("she believed," "she asked," "she felt"), and the phrase "softly adaptive" is repeated identically. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the closure image, reducing propulsion. Deductions total approximately −1.3 for loops and scaffold touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The eclipse as a therapeutic event and the keepsake curl as shared vulnerability offer modest freshness. The specificity of the kalimba and the Dreaming Roots grove avoids generic placeholder settings. However, the core arc—silent grieving child reached through music therapy—is a familiar template, and the transformation relies more on gentle execution than a non-obvious synthesis. The "ordinary magic" frame and the tidy emotional resolution trend toward the safety middle rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora's professional role frames every beat: she chooses drum and flute, plans the eclipse outing, calibrates tempo during totality, and decides to reveal the curl. Her therapeutic training shapes tactics throughout and her final whistle directly prompts Mara's imitation. Setup by first paragraph, involved in planning/eclipse/clinic beats, and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curl is introduced early (locket at throat), traced by Mara's fingers mid-story, revealed during totality as the pivot that unlocks Mara's hum, and discussed again at the clinic. It appears in four distinct beats, each time with escalating emotional stakes, and the closure turn depends on Liora's choice to show it. Removing it would collapse the climactic exchange.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named three times and thematically present throughout (breath/rhythm/attention, the eclipse's "hush," grief braided with love). However, it functions more as thematic overlay than a constraint that alters tactics. The concept does not meaningfully narrow Liora's options or force a trade-off; her therapeutic approach would read similarly without the "magic" frame. Present in closure image but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" describes both Liora's method (adjusting tempo to Mara's breath, lowering volume) and Mara's silence. The attribute enables Liora's responsive tactic during the eclipse and is named twice. It shapes one key middle beat (the kalimba calibration under totality) but does not impose a visible cost or constraint. Functional with one beat involvement; swappable with "responsive" or "flexible" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Link" operates in multiple forms: Liora links grief to living via choice, the locket chain is traced, and at totality Liora and Mara's tones "link like hands finding each other in dark." The metaphor charges the closure and the hum-matching is the decisive action that breaks Mara's silence. Present in setup, development, and closure; causally active. Could be replaced with "connect" or "join" with minor edits, limiting the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eclipse is introduced early (astronomer visiting, Liora wonders if it could open a doorway), planned as the outing's goal, and its totality provides the "dim blue hush" that enables Liora's vulnerable reveal and Mara's response. The mechanics matter: shadows sharpen, birds quiet, the grove becomes a "room without walls." Removing the eclipse would eliminate the pressure frame that justifies the risk and the sensory shift that charges the closure. Three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is named in the opening line and returns as the climb destination; the Dreaming Roots grove supplies the acoustic intimacy and symbolic weight for the climactic exchange. The ridge's "cold sap" and sage scent anchor the eclipse scene, and Liora feels "the ridge answer through its roots" in the denouement. Setup, development, and closure participation; the grove's enclosure directly enables the quiet necessary for Mara's hum. Specificity and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" functions as setting descriptor (the grove) rather than a temporal frame. No clock is established, and the phrase does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. It appears early and returns at closure as an image ("the ridge answer through its roots"), but this is spatial/symbolic resonance, not timeframe pressure. Ornamental use; swappable with "under the old trees" without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nurturing lifelong wonder" is stated as Liora's belief in the opening and closing paragraphs and implied through her non-coercive method (offering instruments, letting Mara choose). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflict—Liora never faces a moment where nurturing wonder competes with a faster, more controlling approach. Present in framing and thematically consistent, but lacks friction or visible cost tied to this exact motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice (opening, closing) and enacted through Liora's careful yet hopeful pacing: she does not force songs, she lowers volume during the eclipse, yet she takes the risk of revealing the curl. The tone modulates appropriately—quiet at the clinic, intensified during totality, lifting at the laugh. It shapes method across beats and charges the final image ("a cautious exuberance rising"). Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but the label-reliance and direct restatement prevent higher integration.</comment>
