<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilian's interiority is concrete and distinctly filtered through his archival lens ("measure their decay...by sampling frequencies, counting the tremble"). His micro-choices—accepting the case with both hands, whispering a promise to stabilize the script—embody contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief) that act simultaneously in scene. The sister backstory anchors present emotion without stalling momentum. The final vow to "measure every fading illusion until the last of them learned to mean" is earned by the cumulative pressure of witnessing and personal loss, though the phrasing edges toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (frozen library, courier arrival, Lumen Room). Closure lands as Charged Poise—Ilian's final vow crystallizes his stance with undeniable conceptual cost (the ledger becomes "a mirror in which he could not look away"). One meaningful deepening occurs when his witnessing transforms into a vow of his own, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is felt in the shift from duty to existential commitment, though the closing image leans abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quartz hush, frozen windows, frost-sleeping lenses, and cloud seas create a vivid tactile world. Spatial choreography is clean (aisles → Lumen Room → window). The projector constrains choice—Ilian must "measure its pulse" and "let the slide borrow something from him"—charging the closure when he returns to the window and makes his vow. Sensory selection reflects urgency (warmth leaking from the cracked case, crystals catching breath).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving luminous vows against oblivion. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ilian must whisper his own promise to stabilize the script, forgoing detachment and accepting personal cost. The courier's fear and the bride's vanishing raise external pressure. Agency is clear (measure, listen, conjure, vow), and the final stance forecloses the path of passive recording. Cost is legible—he becomes entangled in the Archive's mission—but the escalation is gentle, more deepening than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory, witness, meaning at the edge of loss) emerges from particulars—the jars of mirages, the slide's warming, the reconstructed vow. The final image reweights prior material: Ilian's measurement becomes an act of meaning-making, not mere inventory. Subtext operates in gesture (accepting with both hands, breath caught by crystals). The piece avoids stating its thesis outright, though "the last of them learned to mean" edges toward thematic declaration. No token motifs; the slide and vow recur with earned pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct and archival: "counted the tremble in their light the way one counts a heartbeat," "listened...with the fingertips of his mind." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). No head-hopping. The elevated register is consistent with the character's profession and interiority. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the slide's warming, wider at the window.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high ("each jar, once opened, shed its illusion into air and then into memory"). Minor repetitive stems appear: "He [verb]" construction recurs across five sentences in the Lumen Room sequence, though not clustered enough to trigger the −0.4 template penalty. One paraphrase loop: "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" / "the act of keeping had changed him" restates the same insight. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "slow ink" for auroras is fresh. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (archive of captured illusions, luminous vows that fade) is fresh and fully committed. The magic-lantern slide and frequency measurement synthesize specific archival practice with metaphysical stakes. Ilian's role as witness-turned-participant is earned in hindsight. The emotional truth (grief channeled into preservation) feels specific, not generic. Minor proximity risk: "quartz hush" and the frozen-library aesthetic echo existing fantasy tropes, but the synthesis is distinct enough to avoid derivativeness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilian's choices drive all major turns: accepting the case, measuring the slide, whispering his own promise to stabilize the script, sealing it, and returning to the window to vow continuation. His decisions alter tactics (from passive inventory to active witnessing) and shape the closure. Early signal (first paragraph), causal pressure across three beats (acceptance, measurement, final vow), and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in four distinct beats: arrival, insertion into projector, warming/script emergence, and sealing. It constrains choice (Ilian must measure and stabilize it) and charges the closure (his act of keeping transforms him). Early signal, causal involvement, and closure participation all met. Irreplaceable—no other object could carry the bride's vow or demand this specific preservation act.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape stakes (preserving promises against oblivion) and tactics (measuring frequencies, whispering his own vow). The concept is defined early ("words...that glowed brightest at the moment they were sincerely spoken") and recurs in the slide's vow text and Ilian's final commitment. It drives two beats and contributes to closure, though it functions more as thematic frame than direct mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is embodied in concrete actions: dimming the lantern to blue, measuring peaks twice, tracing gaps onto paper, sealing with care. It enables his success (accuracy as "the last kindness") and constrains his approach (he cannot rush). Present early, functional in two beats (initial walk, Lumen Room measurement), but no visible tradeoff—the trait is advantage without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Measuring drives the entire Lumen Room sequence: measuring pulse, checking peaks, tracing gaps, sampling frequencies. It shapes two major beats (initial measurement, deeper listening) and is causally necessary for the vow's reconstruction. The final turn (Ilian vowing to "measure every fading illusion") makes the action symbolic and structural. Irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is signaled early ("counted the tremble in their light"), demonstrated in the Lumen Room ("turning a dial until the script flickered in harmonic bands," "the frequencies told him where missing syllables should live"), and shapes tactics (he must map sound into light). The method is specific and constrains his approach, though its mechanics remain partly abstract. Present across two beats with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen library pressures choices throughout: cold that "bit through wool," frost-sleeping lenses, crystal lattice to catch projected words. The environment supplies resources (projector, crystals) and constrains action (the slide's warmth must be managed). It charges the final image (cloud seas brighten as Ilian vows). Early signal, functional in three beats, and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" frames the dominant stake and creates urgency ("visions dissolved faster," "If the slide went dark, another promise would fall off the edge"). Time pressure is felt but not tracked with a live clock. The timeframe shapes two beats (courier's breathless arrival, slide warming "as" Ilian works) and contributes thematically to closure, though the pacing remains contemplative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is dramatized in Ilian's actions: accepting the slide, measuring to preserve it, whispering his own promise, and vowing continuation. Friction appears when he must "let the slide borrow something from him"—witnessing demands personal cost. The motivation drives three beats and shapes closure, though the phrasing in the final paragraph edges toward on-the-nose articulation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is established in the opening line and sustained through "frozen windows ringing softly," "all motion felt suspended in ice," and the closing vow "in the same quartz hush." Tone modulates appropriately—tightening during the slide's warming, breathing at the window. It charges the final image (stillness reconfigured as commitment) and is irreplaceable—the story's atmosphere depends on this exact register.</comment>
