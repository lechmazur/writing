<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iri's interiority is concrete and embodied: "the slight tightening of guards near the dunes" shows peripheral awareness as practiced skill. Her half-mask functions as visible stigmata and tactical asymmetry ("leaving the other side strangely honest"), and her final choice—offering the prophet ritual risk—grows from contradictory impulses (duty to elders vs. sensed restraint in his tremor). The prophet's confession of doubts and single quiet tear earn his motive without therapy-speak. Minor slip: "She had never learned prophecy, yet she could read a crowd" tells rather than dramatizes the contrast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Iri's honesty "had chosen the right kind of secrecy," crystallizing her role as preserver without owner—a stance that forecloses easier paths (reporting the prophet, refusing him access) with felt cost (ongoing risk, complicity). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the parapet's noon twitch, the prophet's arrival stress, then the dawn ritual deepens via confessed doubts as "stone set true," widening the clearing and settling the parapet "into a steadier sleep." One meaningful tightening (the bargain and shared rite) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible in "her honesty had chosen" and the "whisperfield calm" return with new weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes constrains the entire action: Iri must balance "between attention and disregard," and its noon twitch signals the prophet's disruptive pressure. The rope walkway, dune crest, and "thin stair of sound" are tactile and purposeful. The half-mask is worn and referenced multiply, functioning as tool and social marker. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("a faint, grinding pulse," "the usual wind hiss vanished"). Minor gap: the pavilion's interior layout during the prophet's speech remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the sages' echo without becoming its owner. Escalation operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: the parapet's twitch at noon raises the problem, the prophet's confession of restraint (tremor near his cup) complicates motive, then the dawn ritual deepens through matched rhythm and confessed doubts, each a "stone set true" that widens the clearing. Agency is shared but clear: Iri's bargain ("a bargain of ritual and risk") and the prophet's breath-matched participation drive the resolution. Cost is visible in the parapet's "steadier sleep" and Iri's acceptance of "the right kind of secrecy," foreclosing simpler refusal. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "clearings" vs. noise, preservation vs. ownership, restraint vs. command. The sages' counsel arrives not as sentences but "layered hums," and Iri "let it pass through her without grabbing"—a non-literal answer to the central question. The prophet's motive is revealed through embodied contradiction (tremor, tear) rather than thesis statement. The closing image ("her honesty had chosen the right kind of secrecy") reweights the opening whisperfield calm without moralizing. Minor lift: the "measured kindness" heel-tap pattern and "conjured clearing" motif recur with shifted meaning, charging the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Iri; POV modesty is consistent ("Iri sensed," "she recognized"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "measured kindness" read as local idiom without Wikipedia drift. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the prophet's "borders are where my clearings spill out of control" and Iri's silent "uncovered eye" reply carry subtext and advance plot. Filter verbs appear sparingly and fit the reflective register. Psychic distance remains stable. Minor slip: "the elders hired Iri" and backstory exposition in paragraph eleven slightly flatten momentum, though they anchor motive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening anchors voice and tone. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a murmuring pavilion of stitched linen breathed with low voices and kettle steam"). Clarity holds through complex action (the dawn rite sequence). Minor overwriting: "the kinetic parapet, a buried ringwall that shifted when footsteps approached" stacks descriptors, and "Each confessed doubt was a stone set true" risks metaphor clarity. Paraphrase micro-loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the elders' fear and Iri's prior rite without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "conjured clearings," kinetic parapet, and peripheral-awareness ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The prophet's motive (tuning his voice to avoid command) transforms the "wise teacher arrives" trope through embodied restraint (tremor, tears, confessed doubts). The half-mask as asymmetric honesty and the sages' echo stored as vibration rather than text are fresh particulars. The resolution avoids both theft and didactic transmission, landing on shared preservation with visible cost. Minor familiarity: the "elder wisdom endangered by charismatic newcomer" frame echoes genre templates, though the mechanical and perceptual specifics elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iri frames the story (paragraph 3), reads the crowd and guards (paragraphs 8–9), offers the bargain (paragraph 21), leads the dawn ritual (paragraphs 22–28), and performs the consecration that settles the parapet (paragraphs 26–29). Her choices create all major turns: the decision to meet the prophet's gaze, the bargain offer, the ritual choreography, and the final acceptance of "the right kind of secrecy." Removing her exact role (half-masked line walker with peripheral awareness skill) would collapse the story's logic. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is seeded in paragraph 9, explained in paragraphs 10–12 (its nature and Iri's task), reactivated in paragraph 14 (noon twitch), used tactically in paragraph 22 (holding horizon in peripheral awareness to steady it), and resolved in paragraphs 26–29 (the "slow opening," alignment "like ribs under skin," and final "steadier sleep"). It drives two beats: the problem (twitch) and the resolution (consecration). The parapet's mechanics (shifts with footsteps, steadied by balanced attention) are irreplaceable and shape both the bargain and the ritual. Closure depends on its settling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Conjured clearings" are introduced in paragraph 6 (the prophet's teaching), applied tactically in paragraph 24 ("a conjured clearing of quiet around their feet"), and shape the resolution (the clearing widens, reveals the sound-stair, then collapses gently). The concept constrains the ritual method and stakes: the prophet seeks clearings but risks losing restraint; Iri must balance silence and attention. It appears in setup, middle turn, and closure. Causal role is solid but somewhat secondary to the parapet's mechanics; the clearing is the prophet's frame, while the parapet is Iri's tool.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is assigned to Iri's uncovered eye in paragraph 4, repeated in paragraph 16 when she meets the prophet's gaze ("letting her face stay strangely honest"), and implied in the closing acknowledgment of her honesty choosing secrecy (paragraph 30). It enables the key exchange with the prophet (paragraph 16) and charges the final stance. The trait is somewhat label-reliant and does not visibly constrain a prior action with dramatic cost, though it underpins the tonal closure. Present in setup and payoff; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Consecrate" is named in paragraph 12 as Iri's task, performed pre-story each new moon (paragraph 13), and executed on-page in paragraphs 26–27 ("She began the consecration by tapping the rope with her heel in a pattern the elders called the measured kindness"). The consecration action drives the climax: the heel-tap rhythm, matched by the prophet's breath and confessed doubts, widens the clearing and settles the parapet. Removing this exact action would break the resolution. Setup, development (the twitch problem necessitates re-consecration), and payoff all clear; irreplaceable and causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Peripheral awareness" is introduced in paragraph 5 as Iri's skill ("she could read a crowd through peripheral awareness, noticing what no one looked at directly"), applied in paragraph 8 (reading truth and fear under the prophet's words), and becomes the ritual instruction in paragraph 23 ("hold the horizon in his peripheral awareness"). The method shapes the middle beat (Iri's reading of the prophet) and the climax tactic (steadying the parapet requires peripheral rather than direct attention). It is signaled early and its mechanics matter at closure, though the second application is more instructional than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "murmuring pavilion of stitched linen" is established in paragraph 2, houses the prophet's speech (paragraphs 6–7), and is passed at dawn (paragraph 22) and returned to at closure (paragraph 30). It supplies the social context and the elders' presence but does not directly constrain a choice or alter tactics; the dune crest and rope walkway do that work. Setup and closure reprise present; middle development weak. The pavilion functions more as backdrop than pressure point, though its "low voices and kettle steam" texture the tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrived" frames the inciting change (paragraph 1) and is developed in paragraph 14 ("After his arrival, the parapet began to twitch at noon"). The timeframe creates the problem but does not tighten on-page decisions; the dawn ritual (paragraph 22) occurs in story-present but is not tracked as a live clock. The timeframe is functional but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "during the festival," "when the winds changed"). Setup clear; development and payoff are implicit rather than dramatized as narrowing window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is Iri's explicit task (paragraph 12) and is dramatized in her resistance to "grabbing at" the sages' hums (paragraph 28) and her recognition of the prophet's shared motive (paragraph 29: "to preserve the echo of wisdom without becoming its owner"). The motivation is tested in the bargain scene (paragraphs 19–21: she could refuse or report him) and shapes the resolution. The friction between preservation and ownership, restraint and command, is concrete. Setup, development (the prophet's admission in paragraph 18), and payoff all present; causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" opens the story (paragraph 1), modulates through the parapet's twitch and the prophet's pressure (paragraphs 14–15: Iri watches with tension), returns during the clearing's opening (paragraph 25: "the usual wind hiss vanished"), and closes the story (paragraph 30: "the same whisperfield calm"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image by bracketing the disruption. It does not modulate sharply under peak pressure (the ritual is described as measured rather than urgent), which slightly limits dynamic range. Setup and payoff strong; middle modulation present but subtle.</comment>
