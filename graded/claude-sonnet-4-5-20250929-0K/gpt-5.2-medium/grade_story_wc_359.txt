<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's synesthetic perception is vividly particular and consistently embodied ("blues and tasting brass," "copper sunrise"), and the final decision to unfetter the hush through bell-playing flows from established traits. Maera's terror when her breath makes no sound provides a credible pressure moment. However, Lio's motivations remain largely instrumental—serving the Guild's mission—without internal contradiction or personal cost that forecloses a meaningful option. The ending choice feels competent rather than agonized, limiting the felt weight of transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal–accumulative hybrid lens: Maera's chisel strikes deepen the hush and release cracks, creating a problem Lio must solve by playing the amber sheet in synesthetic translation. The closure—unfettering the sculpted hush into a choir of color, then using the darkened sheet as testimony before the Council—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the decree feels "fragile, like ice over deep water") and a resonant final stance as bell ringer keeping "both lullaby and warning." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first sentence. The lens holds through the ending, though the Council scene compresses heavily and the "fragile" cost, while present, reads more stated than dramatically embodied in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern is concretely realized—lanternlight, veined marble block, stalactites, dripping tunnel—and directly constrains the crisis: the sculpted hush "clenches" in the enclosed space, Maera's breath makes no sound, and the cavern "answers with soft thunder" when Lio plays. The amber music sheet as micro-object charges the final image: its notes darken "like resin swallowing fireflies," visibly recording the new pattern. Spatial choreography (Lio unrolls the sheet on the marble block, hangs bells from wrists) remains clear. The alternating stillness and drips on the climb back subtly mirror the oscillating repose theme, and the Council hall's shuttered windows provide pointed contrast to the aurora-lit cavern.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential before music is rationed—is signaled in the opening and drives both the underground expedition and the Council testimony. The chisel-strike crisis (Maera's voice trapped in sculpted silence) provides a meaningful on-page tightening that narrows options: Lio must "do the opposite and unfetter her voice." The bell-playing solution is earned by prior setup (synesthesia, the amber sheet, prism bells), and the Council's weeping and charter represent a visible outcome. However, the victory feels more declarative than costly—Lio acknowledges fragility but does not sacrifice a tangible resource or relationship to secure it, and the return to bell-ringing reads as continuity rather than a stance crystallization that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as both miracle and weapon, wonder as civic necessity, and the tension between control (the Council's rationing) and permission (the unfettered choir). The amber sheet's transformation—notes darkening to hold the cavern's pattern—offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Lio's dual role as bell ringer keeping "both lullaby and warning" encapsulates the oscillating repose premise. The piece resists neat binaries (absence versus sound, art versus control) and the final fragility—"like ice over deep water"—acknowledges precarious victory. Minor thematic echo: "wonder cannot be taxed away" and "wonder an essential civic good" approach explicit thesis, though they remain diegetically motivated as Guild mission and Council decree rather than pure authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic translation anchors every high-pressure beat ("greens tasting of mint," "copper sunrise"). Diction is elevated but voice-consistent, reflecting Lio's role as a Guild certifier with specialized sensory literacy. The single brief dialogue snippet from Maera ("confesses she carved the hush…") is reported rather than direct-quoted, maintaining Lio's narrative control. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary—"my task is to carry proof" feels more like prompt-echo than lived urgency—and the Council testimony is compressed into a single telling sentence ("let my synesthetic testimony be my argument") rather than dramatized perception under pressure. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the crisis (the hush clenches, Lio watches terror) and loosens for reflection, but the final paragraph's "keep time for the city" edges toward thematic declaration rather than embodied action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance image, causality, or thematic charge. Figurative language is purposeful and internally coherent ("aurora thread," "resin swallowing fireflies," "ice over deep water"). Syntactic variety supports rhythm, and the opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. However, the piece carries scaffold artifacts: "I realize the silence is a prison that will unfetter nothing unless I do the opposite and unfetter her voice" loops "unfetter" and explicates the solution mid-crisis rather than letting action speak; "oscillating repose in frozen walls" drops the prompt phrase into narration as a theme label; and the Council paragraph compresses multiple causal steps ("I play… until even the rationers weep. Afterward they stamp a charter") into summary when dramatization would sharpen closure cost. Filter-verb density ("I feel it settle," "I watch a pale aurora," "I realize") is moderate but present in key beats, slightly dulling immediacy. Paraphrase-loop check: "the hush clenches, sculpted too well" and "the silence is a prison" restate the same condition within two lines. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for scaffold + loop + late summary that touches closure terrain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, sculptural silence, and civic wonder-certification offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The amber music sheet as a relic that records "the reason people dare to listen" and darkens to hold new patterns is a fresh inflection on magical-object tropes. The ice cavern + aurora + prism bells combination feels purposefully integrated rather than checklist-assembled. However, the Guild-versus-Council frame (artist proving beauty's value to bureaucrats) is a familiar template, and the resolution—testimony moves rationers to tears, decree is issued—follows a well-trodden arc. The story transforms through sensory specificity and the oscillating-repose tonal constraint, but the emotional and structural beats (crisis → solution → fragile victory) remain conventional. The final image of Lio ringing "both lullaby and warning" elevates closure without fully surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio appears throughout, drives the crisis response (unrolling the sheet, playing the bells in sequence, timing the final strike with Maera), and delivers the Council testimony. The role as prism-song bell ringer constrains perception (synesthesia) and enables the solution. Choices—playing the aurora scale, returning to the post at dusk—shape beats and closure. The character is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is introduced early (carried in satchel, "said to record not sound but the reason people dare to listen"), used mid-crisis (unrolled on marble, notes flare, Lio plays the scale), and reweighted at closure (darkens "like resin swallowing fireflies," holds the cavern's new pattern, then serves as testimony). It appears in at least four distinct beats and its transformation charges the final image. Removing it would break the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sculpted hush is the story's central problem: Maera's art creates it, it traps her voice ("the hush clenches"), and Lio must unfetter it. The concept drives stakes (absence as miraculous yet weaponizable), tactics (opposite action via bell-ringing), and closure (hush unfettered into choir, later shown as "silence shaped into shelter"). It is the mechanism of crisis and the thematic pivot. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia is established in the opening sentence, enables all of Lio's perceptual narration (blues/brass, echoes as ribbons, greens tasting mint, copper sunrise), and provides the method for translating the amber sheet into playable notes. The trait constrains how Lio perceives and acts under pressure, shapes the testimony ("through the colors of the aurora remembered in my throat"), and charges the final bell-ringing image. The story's sensory logic depends entirely on this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unfetter is the crisis action ("unfetter her voice from it"), the solution ("unfettering the sculpted hush into a choir of color"), and the thematic payoff ("music shaped into permission"). It recurs across three beats with escalating stakes and is named in the opening setup ("unfetter nothing unless I do the opposite"). The verb defines the protagonist's task and reweights the premise at closure. Swapping it for a synonym ("release," "free") would flatten the specific charge. Strong integration, though the recurrence occasionally edges toward keyword reinforcement rather than organic iteration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The aurora is seeded early ("ribbons… pale aurora thread through the ice ceiling, its greens tasting of mint and its violets ringing"), provides the method for playing the sheet ("notes… mapping a scale that climbs through the colors of the aurora," "I play it exactly as learned, through the colors of the aurora remembered in my throat"), and charges the final image in the cavern ("the aurora overhead blooms brighter"). It appears in three beats, constrains Lio's translation method, and is indispensable to the sensory-magical logic. The Council hall note ("windows are shuttered against the northern lights") reinforces its presence but does not add causal pressure. Strong middle and closure work; early mention is concrete but brief.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern pressures every beat: the enclosed space amplifies the sculpted hush, the ceiling transmits the aurora, stalactites carry harmonics, and the tunnel's alternating stillness and drips on the climb back embody oscillating repose. The cavern is the site of crisis (Maera's trapped breath), solution (bells and unfettered choir), and thematic inscription ("inside it the cavern's new pattern"). Spatial details (lanternlight, veined marble block, dripping tunnel) guide action. The setting is indispensable; the story cannot function elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor ("at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble") is vivid but does not constrain urgency or tactics. The crisis unfolds across an unspecified duration—multiple chisel strikes, the hush clenching, bell-playing, climb back, Council testimony, return at dusk—without a live clock that alters decisions. The phrase functions as an atmospheric hook rather than a pressure mechanism. Present but replaceable with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to certify wonder as essential is stated early ("the Guild sent me under the glacier to certify wonder"), drives the expedition and the Council testimony, and is dramatized in choices (playing the bells to unfetter the hush, carrying the darkened sheet as proof, returning to the bell-ringer post). It shapes the dominant stake and closure stance. However, the friction between duty and personal cost is thin—Lio's commitment is professional rather than internally conflicted—and the ending acknowledges fragility without a visible personal sacrifice tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Oscillating repose is embodied throughout: the cavern "trembles between lull and alarm," Maera is "serene one breath and frantic the next," the hush "loosens as if it had joints" then bursts into "tiny harmonics," the tunnel "alternates between numbing stillness and sudden drips," and Lio rings "both lullaby and warning in the same breath." The tone modulates with pressure (calm opening, terror at the crisis, charged quiet at closure) and charges the final image. The phrase "oscillating repose in frozen walls" is explicitly named mid-narrative, which feels slightly forced, but the tonal pattern is otherwise organic and indispensable to the story's rhythm and thematic coherence.</comment>
