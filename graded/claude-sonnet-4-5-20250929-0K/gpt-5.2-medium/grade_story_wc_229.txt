<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is embodied through physical trembling and the whispered sentence to Jonas, with internal contradiction evident in the "screaming tenderness" and need to prove softness without quietness. The cork-pressing ritual and garden-scent preparation show micro-choices under pressure. Jonas's transformation from foghorn blasts to forehead-touch represents earned change, though his interior remains thin. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "purifies intentions" framing, but the final choice to "listen for the tremble" demonstrates agency with visible cost to his former method.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, after heat wave). The piece accumulates pressure through the cork ritual, garden-scent preparation, tower vibration, and Jonas's arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Jonas abandons volume for trembling whisper with felt cost to his foghorn method. The closure image—"tended the morning beam...as a promise sent gently"—reweights the volume-versus-whisper stake with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening through the vibration experiment narrows options and charges the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse functions as both macro-setting and instrument: "the whole structure began to tremble" constrains the method and charges the closure. Micro-setting through the cork, jasmine pots, and lantern-room lens mechanism shape tactical choices. Sensory specificity—"damp soil," "exhausted anger" of sea slaps, "teeth sing"—filters through the narrator's urgency. The dawn timing and garden scent directly enable the beckoning action. The "cobalt shadow" reprise in the final third ties setting to the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers travel farther than shouts) is signaled early and tested on the page. The narrator's whisper-into-cork action tightens options when Jonas's far-point light blinks in non-standard rhythm, providing causal confirmation. Jonas's arrival "ashamed of the dents his foghorn had punched" forecloses his prior method with visible cost. The final choice to "listen for the tremble" represents protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens. One reversal (from volume to vibration) with felt price: Jonas must abandon his insistence on blast-after-blast.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete contrasts: shouts scatter/whispers gather, foghorn dents/tremble carries, volume/intent. The cork and jasmine scent function as particulars that embody the central question without stating it. "Screaming tenderness, a need so fierce it could only speak softly" reframes aggression and gentleness through the narrator's discovery. The final image—"promise sent gently through every listening stone"—offers a non-literal answer with no moral tag. The "purifies intentions" conceit risks abstraction but remains anchored in breath-warming-wood and the tower's physical vibration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent: "softer kind of thunder," "screaming tenderness," "teeth sing." Psychic distance tightens during the ritual and opens slightly at Jonas's arrival. Minor filter-verb reliance ("I felt a screaming tenderness") in one high-pressure beat, but voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. Diction—"purifies intentions the way lime purifies water," "beckoned the message by the scent of a garden"—stays within the narrator's lyric-technical register. No head-hopping; Jonas's shame is inferred through visible behavior ("looked ashamed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, relationship, or thematic layer. Rhythm modulates from the opening's short declaratives to the longer suspended syntax during the vibration sequence. Minor paraphrase loop: "made me hold the cork to my lips as if it were a whistle, then told me to say one sentence I meant" followed immediately by the whisper—efficient, but the "as if it were a whistle" simile adds little. Stock metaphor "like a blue bone under new light" in the opening and "like a hand raised from sleep" for the blink are functional but not fresh. No template cadence or major loops; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vibrations-of-intent premise transforms the lighthouse-keeper trope through the cork-purification ritual and garden-scent method—specific, non-obvious. The emotional specificity of "screaming tenderness" and "shouts scatter, but whispers gather themselves and go on" avoids generic romantic-reunion beats. The cork as intention-filter and the tower-as-bell offer fresh synthesis. Risk: the lyric compression and unexplained mechanism could alienate, but the piece commits fully and follows implications without retreat. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. The transformation from foghorn blasts to tremble-listening feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Assistant lighthouse keeper frames the narrator's authority and access; the role enables the cork ritual and tower tuning. Present in setup (opening line), middle (Sello's teaching), and closure (tending the morning beam with Jonas). The narrator's whisper and beckoning choices create the key turn when Jonas arrives. Causal pressure: the assistant role constrains knowledge (must learn from Sello) and enables the final act. Cost: must prove the method against Jonas's skepticism with visible risk of failure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vial cork is handled in three distinct beats: Sello's palm-press, the whisper-over-cork ritual, and the warm cork shown to Jonas at closure. Setup early, development through the "purifies intentions" mechanic (narrows what can be said), payoff when Jonas sees it "still warm, smelling faintly of jasmine." The cork's warming response to truthful speech provides causal feedback. Specificity: "dark wood polished by decades of salt and worry" makes it irreplaceable. Cost: the narrator's throat clenches, and only drowning-proof words pass through.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vibrations of intent shapes the central tactic: whispering into the cork to send a message via the tower's tremble rather than volume. Setup in Sello's explanation ("vibrations of intent in a murmur could slip through rock and rope"), development through the tower's hum ("tremor answered"), payoff when Jonas "felt it" and asks "how I had reached him without noise." The concept changes options: the narrator abandons persuasion-by-argument for physical transmission. Cost: requires the garden-scent ritual and risks failure if intent isn't pure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Purifies intentions constrains the whisper: "refusing the bitter half truths, leaving only what you would still say while drowning." Setup in Sello's teaching, tested when the narrator's "throat clenched" before managing the sentence. The cork warms only for truthful speech, providing mechanical feedback. Payoff: Jonas understands "intent made pure" at closure. Causal pressure: the narrator cannot simply shout a demand; must distill to core need. Slight label-only quality ("purifies") without full dramatization of what bitter half-truth was refused, but the drowning test adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Beckon is the central action: "beckon the message by the scent of a garden at night" drives the middle ritual (crushing jasmine and basil, carrying scent into the tower). Setup in Sello's instruction, development through the scent preparation and climactic whisper-with-scent, payoff when the far-point light blinks and Jonas arrives. The action is specific and non-swappable; removing it would collapse the method. Cost: requires night timing and garden cultivation. Slightly functional rather than transformative: the scent method could be replaced with another ritual, but within the story's logic it is essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Scent of a garden at night is the delivery mechanism: setup in Sello's instruction, development through crushing jasmine and basil and carrying the scent in clothes, payoff when the cork "still warm, smelling faintly of jasmine" proves the method to Jonas. The scent contrasts with "smoke" and makes "the air remember softness," shaping the tactic. Causal role: without the garden scent, the message cannot be beckoned. Slight swappability (another sensory anchor could serve), but specificity (jasmine, basil, damp soil) and the childhood memory tie add irreplaceability. Cost: requires Sello's garden and night timing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors every beat: setup in opening line, development through the lantern room and tower vibration, payoff in "the cobalt shadow of the tower as the first pink spread" and "tended the morning beam." The lighthouse functions as instrument (bell, lens, tremor source) and spatial constraint (stair landing, service vial, railing). Dawn timing creates urgency and frames the final image. The cobalt color recurs purposefully (opening, closure shadow). Removing the lighthouse or dawn would collapse the story's logic and final resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After the heat wave breaks is setup in the opening line and provides relief that allows sound to "carry across the harbor" and makes the ritual possible. The timeframe shapes the narrator's urgency ("for weeks the heat had made every word stick") and the cooler air enables the scent and vibration method. However, the heat wave is not tracked or tested in the middle; it functions as backstory contrast rather than a live constraint. Payoff: the dawn and cooler air frame the final image, but the heat wave itself does not reappear. Functional but replaceable with another seasonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To prove that whispers travel farther than shouts is the dominant stake, signaled early ("I needed proof for the man I loved") and tested on-page. Setup in the narrator's laugh/wince with Sello, development through the cork ritual and tower vibration, payoff when Jonas "finally understood that a whisper can travel farther than a shout." The motivation is dramatized through the narrator's "screaming tenderness" and conflicted by Jonas's insistence on "volume, blast after blast." Cost: risk of failure and Jonas's potential rejection. The motivation directly shapes every tactical choice and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Screaming tenderness is introduced early ("I felt a screaming tenderness, a need so fierce it could only speak softly") and modulates through the piece: urgency in the throat-clench, intensity in the tower's tremble, resolution in Jonas's filled eyes and forehead-touch. The oxymoron tone charges the central paradox (soft volume, fierce gentleness) and is coherent through turns. Payoff: the final image of tending the beam "not as a weapon against fog but as a promise sent gently" embodies the tone. Slightly conceptual rather than sensory, but the tone pressures the narrator's choices and reconfigures at closure.</comment>
