<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is textured and concrete ("crater glass warmed in my palm"), and micro-choices—following seeds, placing glass against Mira's pulse—reveal a clear hierarchy of values. However, Mira's transformation from grief to healing feels rushed; her spoken apology resolves the broken promise with minimal internal conflict or embodied cost. The narrator remains an observer through most of the closure beat, reducing agency at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: images and sensory particulars gather density until the final spiral of Mira's apology and the ridge's reappearance reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands on the page with a visible change (the trail shimmers into being), and the cost—Mira's spoken confession—is dramatized. Orientation anchors (narrator, geode, coast) arrive cleanly within the first third, and the causal chain from seeds to doorway to pool to resolution holds without breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crater glass reveals the emotional gap, narrowing options and forcing Mira's choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode's "crystal ribs," "luminescent algae," and "pool of sea foam" are vivid and purposeful; the environment supplies the foam pool that Mira uses for her confession, directly enabling the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (cliff → doorway → spiral tunnel → cavern → pool → return). The crater glass functions as a micro-setting object, constraining the narrator's diagnostic method and charging the final image when the gap fills.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator finds Mira and the emotional gap on the shard. Mira's apology is an on-page reversal that narrows options (no more evasion) and restores the ridge with visible cost (public confession of shame). The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens: the seeds guide, the glass diagnoses, the pool receives, and the trail returns. No secondary pressure or antagonist appears, which is acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: broken emotional routes erase physical paths, and mending the promise restores both. The geode as an account-keeper and the crater glass as a translator are specific, non-obvious images that avoid abstraction. The final image—the ridge shimmering into being—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Mira's apology to "her brother and to herself" adds emotional specificity, though the mechanics of the geode "swallowing" trails based on broken promises could have been tested with more friction earlier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes," "laugh curdle when the crater glass warmed," "cheerfully, because despair likes company." Psychic distance is stable, and POV modesty holds (conjectures are framed as conjectures). Diction remains voice-specific and poetic without slipping into corporate register. Mira's brief dialogue ("used to walk a ridge trail… until one morning the ridge simply stopped") carries subtext (grief, evasion) and advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high ("I work where the tide forgets itself" anchors occupation, setting, and tone in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent and matches the lyric voice ("emotional routes," "gap shaped like a choice"). Minor scaffold phrase: "which meant someone had walked here recently with terror in their throat" slightly over-explains the shard's function, but the lapse is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—emotional routes erasing physical trails, a meteor-glass translator, seeds as guide—is specific and non-obvious. The "cheerful gloom" tone and the geode as memory-hoarder avoid stock fantasy tropes. However, the broken-promise mechanic (Mira's argument → vanished ridge) arrives late and is accepted without skepticism or counter-evidence, reducing the transformation test slightly. The resolution feels earned in hindsight but not risky; the pieces fit neatly without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist frames the investigation, follows the seeds, interprets the crater glass marks, and guides Mira to the pool. However, Mira's apology—not the narrator's decision—creates the key turn at closure. The narrator's conjecture and placement of the glass enable the resolution, but the protagonist's agency is shared rather than sole.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crater glass is introduced early (after the meteor mention), used twice on-page (narrator holds it at the cliff, then places it against Mira's pulse), and its mechanics (transliterating emotions into marks, revealing the gap) drive the diagnosis and resolution. The gap filling at closure reweights its meaning. The object is indispensable; without it, the emotional route cannot be read or repaired.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Missing pieces shape the narrator's quest and Mira's grief. The "missing piece" is literalized as the gap on the crater glass and the broken promise, which Mira must mend to restore the ridge. The concept drives tactics (following seeds, using the glass, speaking the apology) and is present at closure when "the gap filled with a gentle curve." It could be replaced with a broader "vanishing" metaphor, but the specificity of "missing pieces that make their stories wobble" constrains the investigation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transliteration is demonstrated twice on-page: the shard etches a spiral of dread at the cliff, then transliterates Mira's longing into marks with a gap. The attribute enables the diagnosis (emotional route is broken) and the solution (apology fills the gap). The mechanics are specific (joy becomes loops, fear jagged, regret smudges) and constrain the narrator's method. Visible cost: Mira must speak her shame aloud for the marks to reconnect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conjecture is signaled early ("I began to conjecture that the vanishing paths were not physical at all") and frames the investigation. The narrator's hypothesis—that emotional routes shape physical trails—is tested when Mira's broken promise is linked to the vanished ridge. However, the conjecture is validated by Mira's confession rather than a prior on-page test, reducing its causal force. It could be replaced with "realize" or "discover" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scattered seeds are introduced early ("Every spring a migrating bird… drops peppery seeds"), guide the narrator to the hidden cliff doorway, and sprout into pale shoots pointing toward the foam pool. The method is signaled, used to navigate the investigation, and reappears at closure when "the seeds at our feet straightened as if someone had pulled a thread taut." The mechanics are specific and constrain the narrator's route; without the seeds, the doorway would remain unfound.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iridescent geode cave is the narrator's office, the site of Mira's encounter, and the location of the foam pool that receives her apology. The crystal facets hold trapped memories, the luminescent algae light the descent, and the doorway's lack of reflection signals its threshold function. The geode's mechanics—hoarding stories, swallowing broken routes—constrain the resolution: Mira must speak inside the geode for the trail to return. The setting is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before memory fades" is announced early and motivates the narrator's urgency, but it does not tighten decisions on the page. No live clock is tracked; the investigation proceeds at a reflective pace without time pressure altering tactics. The phrase recurs once mid-story ("Before memory fades, I have to map…") but does not shape the closure. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover why paths disappear—frames the narrator's quest and is tested when the narrator finds Mira and learns the broken-promise mechanism. The desire is dramatized through the narrator's actions (following seeds, using the glass, guiding Mira) and conflicted briefly when the narrator "laughed at the absurdity" before feeling dread. The motivation drives the investigation and is present at closure when the ridge reappears, but the narrator's personal stake (beyond professional duty) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom is embodied early ("blues that look like laughter in mourning clothes," "cheerful gloom is the only honest mood on this coast") and modulates with pressure: the narrator laughs at being led by bird droppings, then feels the laugh "curdle" when the glass warms. At closure, the narrator "cheerfully, because despair likes company" tells Mira the geode is not punishing her. The tone charges the final image—grief and restoration coexist without resolving into tidy comfort—and remains coherent across turns.</comment>
