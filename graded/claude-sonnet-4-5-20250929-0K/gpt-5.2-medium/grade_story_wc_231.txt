<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's ability to "take recollections from objects" and "investigate by observing gaps" is embodied through concrete action—pressing the Edelweiss to the post, noticing missing rope scars, deducing alpine cord. His loneliness is legibly enacted through the borrowed-memory mechanism and the final gesture of archiving the stranger's absence. The narrator's witnessing stance remains consistent and filters all perceptions. Internal contradiction appears when Eamon's isolation is both his burden and his purpose, charging the final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered particulars (boutonniere, missing rope scars, alpine knot, letter) that converge at closure when Eamon pins the flower to the packet and places it in the logbook. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Eamon accepts his role as keeper of "other people's missing parts" with visible cost—his isolation is not solitude but a witnessing burden. The inferred lens holds; the final image reweights all prior mentions of gaps and borrowed memories.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal dock "shining like pearl through mist," the lighthouse beam's slow pulse, and the post lacking rope scars all constrain choices and charge the final image. Nautical twilight brackets the narrative and creates temporal pressure. The Edelweiss—mountain coldness on the coast—supplies sensory specificity that drives investigation. Micro-setting (the post, the packet sewn in canvas) alters tactics. The environment is filtered through both the narrator's clerk role and Eamon's sensory method, avoiding catalog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the stranger's final gesture. Pressure accumulates through Eamon's method—each gap (no sand, wrong knot, empty grip) narrows options and deepens the mystery. The tightening occurs when the packet is found and the letter read aloud, transforming the stranger's "offering of absence" into an act Eamon can witness and archive. Agency is clear: Eamon chooses to pin the boutonniere and place it in the logbook, a renunciation of ownership that forecloses other responses (e.g., personal possession, official filing). Cost is legible in the final line: his isolation is redefined as a burden of witnessing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing and the cost of holding others' absences—emerges from concrete particulars: borrowed memories with gaps, the empty grip, the letter asking for a name to be remembered. The boutonniere's mountain coldness and the opal dock imagery recur with shifting weight. The final act (pinning the flower, archiving the packet) is a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The ending reweights the lighthouse-keeper role from isolation to keeper of "missing parts," and the cost is felt in "the loneliness around him thicken." No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV (harbor clerk narrator) with stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: "I was the harbor clerk, sent only to witness," filtering all events through observation. Eamon's voice is distinct in dialogue ("the empty grip was a message he could not read," "the footprints of intent"). Diction remains controlled—"softly persistent," "as if he spoke to the fog"—and rhythmically varied. Free indirect style is clean when tracking Eamon's process. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final sentence shifts cadence to land the thematic charge without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or mystery. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight prior images effectively. Minor scaffold appears in mid-story phrasal repetition ("Eamon asked," "Eamon told," "Eamon understood") that could tighten, but no loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language ("opal dock," "borrowed memories," "far star") is purposeful and does not muddle. Syntax varies; no template cadence mars peak moments. One paraphrase near midpoint ("worked the problem the way he tended the lens, not forcing it, just noticing") slightly restates an earlier observation, warranting a small deduction within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of borrowed-memory mechanics, object-reading, and gap-observation is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock psychic-investigator templates. The Edelweiss as mountain artifact on a coastal dock is a fresh inflection. Emotional truth in Eamon's isolation—being "the keeper of other people's missing parts"—feels earned rather than quirky ornament. The final image (pinning the flower to archive absence) is purposeful and transforms prior material. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eamon's choices—asking the narrator to stay, pointing to the empty grip, pressing the Edelweiss to the post, pinning it to the packet—drive all major beats and shape closure. Introduced in the opening, he appears in setup, middle investigation, and ending archival act. His eccentric trait (object-reading via gaps) enables the investigation method and final gesture. Causal pressure is clear; swapping him for a generic investigator would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The boutonniere appears at discovery (in the drowned man's pocket), is pressed to the post to borrow memory, recurs in the snow-ridge vision, and is pinned to the packet at closure—four distinct beats. Its mountain coldness constrains choice (signals wrongness on coast), its brittleness embodies absence, and the final pinning charges the archival image with irreplaceability. Removing this exact object would break the closure's resonance and the gap-observation method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape stakes (Eamon's ability and its limits), tactics (observing gaps between fragments), and closure (the letter as placeholder for what cannot be kept). The concept is dramatized on-page when Eamon touches the boutonniere and sees the snow ridge, then the knot vision. It constrains his method—he "could take such recollections...only fragments"—and the final gesture (archiving absence) directly enacts the premise. Cost is visible: his isolation thickens as he accumulates others' missing parts.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is shown through Eamon's repeated gentle questioning, his patient lens-tending metaphor, and his method of "not forcing it, just noticing." It enables the investigation's success (he doesn't rush the gaps) and shapes the tone at closure. The trait appears in setup and is enacted in middle and ending beats. Swapping it for "patient" would weaken specificity but not break logic, placing it in the mid-7s. Visible tradeoff: his softness means he cannot demand answers, only witness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Investigate" drives the entire middle section: Eamon walks the dock, listens to pilings, notices the post lacking rope scars, works the knot problem, and finds the packet. The action is signaled early ("he had learned to investigate by observing gaps") and shapes closure when the letter is read aloud and archived. Removing this action would collapse the plot; it redefines Eamon's lighthouse-keeper role as investigator of absence. Two major turns (finding the post, discovering the packet) trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is taught in the first third ("he had learned to investigate by observing gaps"), enacted in at least three beats (missing smell of inland air, absent gulls, no sand in boots, missing rope scars, wrong knot), and articulated at closure ("borrowed memories leave holes...the letter was meant to sit in those holes"). The method constrains tactics—Eamon cannot force memory, only notice absence—and charges the final image when the packet becomes an anchor for gaps. Mechanics matter throughout; swapping for generic "observation" would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock appears in setup ("opal dock lay under mist"), middle ("We walked the opal dock, boards shining like pearl"), and closure framing ("At the edge of nautical twilight"). It supplies the post (micro-setting element) that enables the discovery and constrains the search space. The mist and boards' sheen create atmosphere that charges the final image. However, the dock itself does not force a tactical choice as directly as the post or packet; it functions more as coherent frame than active constraint, placing it in the upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight brackets the narrative (opening and closing lines) and the lighthouse beam's slow pulse recurs, creating coherent atmospheric pressure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no live clock forces Eamon to hurry, and the investigation proceeds without temporal constraint. The twilight charges the final image ("the beam swung across the mist and briefly lit Eamon's face") but does not alter tactics. Present in setup and closure, weak in middle development, it scores in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eamon's desire to decode the stranger's final gesture (the empty grip) is dramatized in his choices: asking the narrator to stay, describing what is *not* seen, pressing the boutonniere, finding the packet, and asking the narrator to read the name aloud. Friction appears between his ability (borrowing memories) and its limits (only fragments, gaps), creating cost. The motivation shapes all three acts and is resolved at closure when the gesture is understood as "an offering of absence." Removing this motivation would collapse the investigation and final archival act.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent through all turns: the narrator observes Eamon's solitary lighthouse life, the loneliness that "thicken[s]" around him, and the final realization that "his isolation was not merely being alone but being the keeper of other people's missing parts." Tone modulates from observational setup to charged closure without breaking register. The final image—Eamon's face briefly lit by the beam—crystallizes the tone with undeniable pressure. The tone is indispensable; swapping it for companionship or triumph would destroy the story's thematic and emotional core.</comment>
