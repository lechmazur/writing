<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—portraits fracturing, seeking redesign through untangling—reads coherently and her descent is earned by her mother's note and the Tower card. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("bleed light into uncertainty," "layered stories") that sometimes abstracts emotion rather than embodying it. The sister's stakes remain shadowy; we never see Mara wrestle with contradictory impulses about whether to pursue rescue or accept fracture, flattening what could be a richer internal conflict. The final shift—accepting fracture, painting with calm—lands but feels more announced than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors Mara, the lighthouse library, and the broken box by the first paragraph; spatial grounding is clear. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accrues images (tarot cards, thread, lighthouse beam, filaments) that intensify until Mara's weaving act reconfigures the portrait and stabilizes the beam—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Cost is legible in "not rescued, but changed" and the acceptance of fracture, though the sister's reappearance in the portrait's eyes verges on convenience. One meaningful deepening (untangling filaments → aligning slivers) suffices at this length, and the closure image reweights earlier material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library—circular room, rising shelves, trapdoor, lens mechanism below—constrains Mara's physical descent and provides the webbed filaments that she must untangle, directly enabling the redesign action at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "dust glowed…with a luminescent ache," salt and cold ink rising from the stairwell. The closing-walls threat adds atmospheric pressure but does not materially alter her tactics on the page. The body (fingernails unknotting twine) and recurring objects (tarot cards, thread, canvas) function as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redesigning fractured portraits to restore coherence—is signaled early and tightens when the library walls press inward and Mara descends to the lens mechanism. Her agency is clear: she unknots filaments and weaves them into the canvas, altering the portrait's eyes and stabilizing the beam. The coincidence that the Tower card matches her childhood sketch and that untangling filaments releases "slivers of another world" feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; the mechanics of how threads align realities remain impressionistic. Cost is present but oblique: the sister is "changed, carrying a calm that made room for pain," which reads more as thematic claim than on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—accepting fracture as necessary to redesign reality—emerges organically from the tarot cards, thread-untangling, and the final portrait that "stop[s] chasing perfection and start[s] accepting fracture." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the beam "asked, without needing answers, who she would paint next," reweighting the opening's despair into open possibility. Subtext operates in gesture (fingernails unknotting, eyes opening "with a watery shine") and image (the Tower split by lightning, the stitched radiance). Minor slip: "necessary darkness" is stated in the mother's note and then echoed in narration, edging toward thematic echo rather than full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors visual and tactile detail filtered through an artist's lens ("cracked mirror," "ribs," "luminescent ache"). Voice is lyric and metaphor-dense, which fits the accumulative mode but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("articulate ache," "bleed light into uncertainty") that edges beyond interiority into authorial narration. Psychic distance compresses appropriately under pressure (the descent, the weaving), and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm modulates well from the opening's despair to the closing's calm resolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("the sea below flashed like a cracked mirror," "shelves rose like ribs"), but several metaphors stack without clear payoff: "bleed light into uncertainty" and "dust…mourned [the sun]" edge into overwriting. Sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. Minor loops: "luminescent ache" appears twice, and "the lighthouse turned/turning" recurs without added meaning. The closing line—"asked, without needing answers, who she would paint next"—lands cleanly, but the penultimate paragraph's "accepting fracture" nearly summarizes the theme rather than trusting the image alone. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library-as-design-studio and thread-untangling-as-reality-mending offer a specific synthesis that feels purposeful rather than stock. The tarot Tower matching Mara's childhood sketch and the filament-webbed prisms provide fresh tactile detail. Emotional specificity—"calm that made room for pain"—avoids platitude. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative mode. Minor proximity concern: the artist-repairing-fractured-reality premise and lighthouse-as-metaphor-for-vision are familiar in speculative literary fiction; the transformation here is solid but not radical enough to feel entirely inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices—tipping out the cards, unknotting twine, descending, weaving filaments—drive every beat and the closure. She makes at least three on-page decisions that alter tactics under pressure, and the final portrait's eyes opening traces directly to her agency. The "crestfallen" attribute anchors her opening state but does not constrain later moves; the transformation from despair to calm is earned by the descent and weaving, not by the label itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears in the opening beat (setup), yields the thread-wrapped key and mother's note (development), and its sole intact card—the Tower—travels to the lens mechanism and shapes the descent (closure linkage). It is handled on the page at least three times and its broken state mirrors the fractured reality Mara seeks to repair. The box itself does not return at the ending; the Tower card does, so the object's closure participation is partial. Swappability is low: a different container would not carry the tarot/design resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is dramatized on the page: clients walk away with faces that change between dawn and supper, half the tarot cards fall blank, the atlas map shows "two doors" and a third darkness. It shapes Mara's stakes (she cannot paint stable portraits) and the solution (untangling filaments aligns slivers). The mechanics remain impressionistic—how thread aligns realities is asserted more than shown—but the concept constrains her opening despair and enables the redesign at closure. Cost is oblique: accepting fracture rather than forcing coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Questions" and "rhetorical questions" appear thematically: "Wasn't that what art was, a way to ask without demanding" and the closing beam "asked, without needing answers." These are narratorial reflections, not on-page actions or constraints. The trait does not foreclose a path or enable a tactic; it flavors the theme but remains ornamental. No visible tradeoff or cost ties to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redesign" is signaled in the mother's note ("Redesign what you see by untangling threads"), drives Mara's middle choice (laying twine across the atlas, unknotting snarls), and crystallizes at closure when she redesigns her sister's portrait by weaving filaments into the canvas. The action is indispensable: without it, the lens mechanism remains webbed and the lighthouse beam unstable. The final image—"who she would paint next"—extends the redesign forward. Swappability is low; "repair" or "restore" would not capture the active reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Untangling threads is introduced in the mother's note (setup), dramatized when Mara unknots twine snarls and lays them across the atlas (development), and paid off when she loosens the filaments webbing the lens mechanism and weaves them into the canvas (closure). The method is tactile and specific: fingernails unknotting, guiding threads through fingers, releasing slivers. It shapes attempts across at least three beats and is irreplaceable—no other method would align the fractured realities or stabilize the beam. Cost is implicit in the labor and the sister's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library supplies the atlases, twine, and loom that Mara uses to model the redesign; the trapdoor behind the lowest shelf enables her descent to the lens mechanism where the climactic weaving occurs. The closing-walls threat adds atmospheric pressure ("how long before the place tightened like a fist") but does not materially alter her tactics—she descends anyway. The library's circular shape and rising shelves anchor spatial choreography. The setting is indispensable: without the lighthouse's interior structure and stored materials, the redesign cannot occur. Minor deduction: the walls' closing is mentioned twice but does not constrain a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is mentioned in the opening third ("sometimes, when the storms rose, the lighthouse settled and the walls close in") and recurs once ("the library groaned and its stone walls pressed inward"). The threat adds urgency but does not tighten a decision on the page—Mara is told to "work quickly," yet the narrative does not track elapsed time or force a tactic change. At closure, "the walls had stopped closing," removing the pressure. The timeframe is present but does not shape attempts or constrain the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Necessary darkness" is named in the mother's note ("the place you had to enter so the rest of the world could be designed anew") and dramatized when Mara opens the trapdoor and descends to the lens mechanism. The descent is a clear choice that forecloses retreat, and the sister's door—"only darkness"—recurs in the atlas's shimmering scenes. Friction is present: Mara hesitates ("Was that the necessary darkness…?") before committing. Minor deduction: the motivation is stated more than it is embodied in contradictory wants; the descent reads as inevitable rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears in the opening beat ("dust glowed…with a luminescent ache, as if every mote remembered the sun and mourned it") and returns at closure ("soft, stitched radiance that asked, without needing answers"). The tone—melancholy beauty, longing tempered by acceptance—remains coherent through turns and modulates from despair to calm resolve. Diction sustains the ache: "crestfallen," "pleading," "mourned," "watery shine," "made room for pain." The final image charges the tone by shifting from mourning to open possibility without abandoning the ache. High irreplaceability: a different tonal phrase would not fuse sorrow and light as precisely.</comment>
