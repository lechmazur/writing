<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's "perpetually surprised face" and the pilgrim's tired quest both show internal states through external markers. The pilgrim's motivation—"to decode the frequency of belonging"—feels abstract and label-like, particularly in the explanation about radios hissing; his smile and laugh at the end are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Mara's micro-choices (launching the drone, climbing to the notch, fitting the chips) are goal-driven and the ending choice to share this "family" has cost, though the emotional specificity remains somewhat muted. No major causality breaks, but interiority occasionally leans on stock phrasing ("itch of missing pieces," "bloom again, sharp as frost").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through linked images (stones drinking light, star trails, matrix chips interlocking) and a cadence shift at the tuner activation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the tuner hums, pulses organize, and the pilgrim laughs in recognition—options are crystallized and the conceptual cost (belonging is assembled, not found whole) is legible on the page. The "frequency of belonging" motif accumulates density and the final image reweights prior searching. One small causality note: the wall segment "swung inward on hidden hinges" after star trails "pointed beyond the dome toward the western wall" is a motivated ellipsis that holds under Accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's "soot-dark lenses and brass circles," the slit leaking dusk "like ink poured onto paper," and the hidden cabinet all anchor spatial choreography and constrain Mara's search path. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional attention (drone screen, rotors, grooves in the chip). The "notch" in the stone rim and the hidden passage function as micro-setting that alters tactics—she climbs, pulls masonry, and discovers the cabinet. The final tuner hum fills the chamber, charging the space at closure. Minor slip: "dusk leaked through a slit" and "brilliant dimness" are evocative but edge toward stock metaphor without fresh grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the frequency/assemble the missing alphabet to understand belonging. Pressure coheres through the pilgrim's arrival, the chip exchange, the star-trail mapping, the wall discovery, and the tuner activation—a single meaningful tightening under Accumulative logic. The final assembly (chips forming READ, tuner humming) forecloses the search path with on-page success; the cost is the pilgrim's long journey and Mara's surprise at "a family could be spelled, tuned, and shared." Agency is present in Mara's choices to launch the drone and pull the masonry. The escalation is smooth but not highly dramatic; the moment when "the whole word READ formed a key" narrows options and changes knowledge as required by the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—"frequency of belonging" as assembled rather than inherent—emerges through the interlocking chips, the tuner pulses matching letter spacing, and the shared final hum. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "a family could be spelled, tuned, and shared" reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the pilgrim's "tired smile," the observatory's dual purpose (sound as well as stars), and the erasure of labels on the cabinet drawers. Minor demerit: "frequency of belonging" is stated twice by the pilgrim in prompt-like language, edging toward thematic echo, though the final image partially mitigates by dramatizing the concept through the tuner scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited through Mara; POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice has a distinct texture: "chain sounded like punctuation," "sky wrote its own routes," "brilliant dimness seemed to brighten from within." Psychic distance is controlled and the narrative stance modulates with discovery beats. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("why he had walked so far" / "frequency of belonging"); the pilgrim's speech carries subtext (tired smile, evasive metaphor). Minor issues: some diction edges toward elevated register not fully anchored in Mara's professional idiom ("perpetually surprised face" as descriptor, "shy comet" simile), and a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") could be tightened, though they don't obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through the search sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance plot (drone launch, star trails, notch discovery) or atmosphere (stones drinking light, dust exhaling). Two minor loops: "perpetually surprised" appears twice; "missing pieces" recurs in adjacent beats without reweighting. Template cadence appears in paired participial openers and repeated "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. A handful of stock metaphors ("ink poured onto paper," "shy comet") and elevated diction ("brilliant dimness," "exhaling dust") in high-pressure beats nudge toward overwriting. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong; no major scaffold or syntax errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of typography (matrix chips, fonts, alphabet assembly) with radio frequency and star-trail navigation is specific and non-obvious. The observatory as a dual instrument (stars and sound) offers a fresh angle on "belonging." Emotional particularity—Mara's perpetual surprise, the pilgrim's tired quest—avoids generic templates, though "frequency of belonging" as phrase feels slightly abstract. The ending turn (chips interlock → tuner hums → belonging is shared) is earned in hindsight by prior setup. Risk is moderate: the lyric compression and multi-element weave heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (sharp-eyed drone pilot) is present throughout and makes key decisions: she takes the chip, launches the drone, interprets star trails, climbs to the notch, pulls the masonry, opens the drawer, and fits the chips. Her professional skill (tracking wind, long exposures) shapes her tactics. However, her choices are methodical rather than high-stakes reversals; she reacts more than she transforms the situation. The ending credits her as co-agent ("together they fit"), but the pilgrim's arrival and the pre-existing cabinet do much of the causal work. Setup early, development in middle (drone launch, notch discovery), payoff at ending (chip assembly). Beat count: at least three distinct (chip handoff, drone flight/wall discovery, tuner assembly). Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present. Applying guidance: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal moderate +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.4, cost visible +0.3. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4. Swappability slight penalty −0.3 (could be another tech specialist). Ornamental touch in middle paragraph (watching him climb) −0.3. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The matrix chip appears in at least four beats: pilgrim offers it, Mara examines grooves, chip gleams in lantern circle showing pitted edges, chip is fitted with others to form READ key, inserted into tuner slot. Early signal (first exchange), middle development (lantern examination reveals interlock need), payoff (forms READ, activates tuner). Causal: the chip's half-letter and pitted edges drive the search for mates and enable the tuner unlock. Closure: directly shapes the ending action. Specificity high: "half a letter that never met its other half," "pitted edges where other chips should have interlocked." Applying guidance: early +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal strong +1.2, closure decisive +1.5, specificity high +0.7, cost tied +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8. Slight swappability (another fragment could serve similar function in a puzzle-lock) −0.6. Late full payoff (tuner slot) occurs only in final third, but prior examination in middle mitigates. Chip could not be removed without breaking the interlock logic. Final: 7.6, rounding down from 8.2 after cumulative adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is stated explicitly ("the familiar itch of missing pieces") and drives the entire search: the pilgrim seeks the rest of the font set, Mara maps to find hidden chips, the cabinet holds fragments, and the climax is their assembly into a complete word. Setup in first third (pilgrim explains the mountain print shop melted fonts, observatory keeps the rest). Middle: Mara's drone search and discovery of the gap/notch (literal missing piece in the dome). Payoff: chips "fit edge to edge" and "the whole word READ formed a key." Causal pressure high: the concept shapes every tactic. Closure: the tuner hums only when pieces align. Cost: the pilgrim's journey and Mara's perpetual surprise at completion. Applying guidance: early +0.7, three beats (setup, search, assembly) +1.4, causal strong +1.4, closure decisive +1.6, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.2 = 9.2. Deductions: the phrase "missing pieces" is slightly generic and appears in label form ("itch of missing pieces") −0.4; the concept is also echoed thematically ("a family could be spelled") without additional on-page constraint −0.3. The middle search (drone, notch, cabinet) is causally tight. Swappability low. Final after deductions: 7.1, rounding down from 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears as a facial descriptor ("perpetually surprised face") and recurs when "she felt that perpetual surprise bloom again, sharp as frost" at the notch discovery, then again at the ending ("Mara packed her drone she stayed perpetually surprised"). Setup: early label. Development: the trait is mentioned at a middle turn (notch discovery) but does not constrain or enable a different choice—Mara pulls the masonry regardless. Payoff: stated again at the end, but as a static emotional label rather than a visible tradeoff. The attribute does not create cost; it describes her reaction pattern without forcing her to act differently than another character would. No clear moment where being "perpetually surprised" narrows options or imposes a price. Applying guidance: early label +0.3, mentioned in three beats +1.4, but no causal pressure 0.0, ornamental use −0.8, label-only in peak beat −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.4 = 3.4. Cap for missing middle development at 3.4 applies. Final: 3.4, rounding down to 4.2 after reconsidering the recurrence as minimal thematic callback rather than true beat involvement. Corrected final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Pull" appears in at least three functional moments: Mara "pulled the rotors free of their clips" (setup action), "pulled at a loose segment of masonry" (major discovery), and implicitly pulls the drawer open. The masonry pull is the major turn: it reveals the hidden passage and cabinet, directly advancing the plot. The rotor pull is preparatory. The drawer pull is transit. Setup present (rotor pull early), middle pull (masonry) is the key beat, closure participation indirect (the drawer contents enable the ending but the pull itself is not foregrounded). Causal pressure: the masonry pull is essential; without it, no cabinet. Closure linkage: the pulled drawer supplies the chips, but the pull action itself is not charged at the ending. Swappability: "pull" could be "push," "slide," "lift" with minor edits at the rotor and drawer moments; the masonry pull is more specific (hinges swing inward). Applying guidance: early +0.4, two distinct pulls +0.9 (rotor, masonry; drawer is borderline), causal moderate +0.9, closure indirect +0.4, specificity moderate +0.4, cost connection weak +0.1. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1. Swappability at non-key moments −0.4. Summary-only for drawer −0.2. The masonry pull is irreplaceable and drives the major discovery. Final: 6.9, rounding down from 6.5 after adjusting for the masonry pull's strength.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By following star trails" is signaled early ("she could map them, but she would do it by following star trails") and executed in the middle: Mara launches the drone, lets it hover for long exposures, watches "the first stars appeared as scratches, then curves, then a slow wheel that pointed beyond the dome toward the western wall." The method shapes her search tactic and leads to the notch discovery. Setup clear. Development: the star trails guide her to the wall gap. Payoff: the trails' pattern (the notch/gap) is the key to finding the hidden passage. The method is specific and irreplaceable within the story's logic (other search methods would not use the dome's astronomical function). Causal: the star-trail method narrows the search space and provides the discovery. Closure: indirect—the method leads to the cabinet, which enables the ending. Applying guidance: early +0.7, two beats (method stated, method executed) +0.9, causal strong +1.2, closure indirect +0.5, specificity high +0.7, cost weak +0.1. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. The method appears somewhat convenient (why would star trails point to a hidden door?) −0.4. The logic is internally consistent but not deeply explored. Final: 6.4, rounding down from 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "ancient observatory at dusk" is anchored in the opening line and sustained throughout: stones drink light, the dome's slit leaks dusk, soot-dark lenses and brass circles, the western wall notch, the hidden passage, the cabinet. The setting provides resources (the dome's star-pointing function, the hidden cabinet) and constrains choices (Mara must use the drone through the slit, climb to the notch, navigate the passage). Dusk as lighting condition affects visibility and tone ("brilliant dimness"). Setup immediate. Development: the observatory's architecture (slit, wall, passage) shapes every search tactic. Payoff: "the observatory filled with the same faint tone" at closure. The setting is essential; story logic fails without it. Applying guidance: early +0.8, present in all major beats +1.4, causal strong +1.4, closure linkage strong +1.4, specificity high +0.7, cost connection moderate +0.4. Base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1. Minor: "dusk" is slightly generic as a time marker and the "brilliant dimness" phrase edges toward mood over constraint −0.3. The observatory's function (sound and stars) is key. Swappability: no other setting could provide the same causal architecture. Final: 7.3, rounding down from 8.8 after reconsidering that while the *observatory* is essential, "at dusk" as timeframe is less causally pressed than the structure itself—routing the time element to 9H and scoring the *place* here.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" sets the story's start point; all action occurs in a single continuous evening. The timeframe is coherent and dusk provides lighting for the star-trail method. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no live clock or deadline. The characters work at their own pace; urgency is intrinsic (the quest itself) rather than temporal. Setup: implicit (dusk, evening). Development: time passes (drone hovers for "long exposures") but does not constrain tactics. Payoff: time is not invoked at closure. Applying guidance: early implicit +0.3, one beat (long exposures require time) +0.4, causal weak +0.3, closure absent 0.0, specificity low (dusk is generic) +0.2. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2. The timeframe is functional but replaceable with "morning" or "night" with minor edits; "dusk" matters for the star visibility but is not irreplaceable (stars visible at night, too) −0.4. Time does not create pressure. The coherent single-evening window is a positive for clarity +0.3. Final: 5.1, rounding down from 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To decode the frequency of belonging" is stated by the pilgrim ("he was trying to decode the frequency of belonging") and echoed in the ending ("The frequency of belonging was not a place but a set of missing pieces"). The motivation drives the pilgrim's journey and Mara's participation ("she had heard it too while flying search grids"). Setup early (pilgrim's answer to Mara's question). Development: the motivation is recounted more than dramatized—the pilgrim explains the radios, Mara recalls her own experience. Payoff: the tuner pulses match the frequency and the pilgrim laughs in recognition. Cost: the pilgrim's long walk and the shared surprise at the ending. Friction: the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted choices; the pilgrim's desire is declared, not tested against competing wants. Applying guidance: early +0.6, two beats (statement, payoff) +0.9, causal moderate +0.7, closure strong +1.2, specificity moderate +0.4, cost visible +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2. Summary-only in middle (radios "hissed," Mara "suspected") −0.6. The motivation is somewhat abstract and label-like ("frequency of belonging") −0.4. The pilgrim's tired smile and final laugh are declared emotions rather than embodied −0.3. Final: 6.7, rounding down from 6.9 after accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears in the opening ("stones began to drink the last light and give it back as a brilliant dimness") and recurs near the ending ("the brilliant dimness seemed to brighten from within"). The phrase sets a paradoxical, liminal tone (light within darkness, fading yet glowing) that coheres through the piece: dusk, soot-dark lenses, lantern circle, the faint radio tone. Setup immediate. Development: tone is sustained through selective sensory detail (dust exhaling, ink poured onto paper, shy comet). Payoff: "brilliant dimness seemed to brighten" charges the final image by reversing the opening's fade into a glow. The tone modulates slightly at the tuner activation (hum, pulses, recognition) but remains within the established register. Applying guidance: early seed +0.7, recurrence across story +0.9, lyric reprise reweights stake +1.0, closure linkage strong +1.2, specificity high +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4. Deductions: "brilliant dimness" as phrase is slightly generic (paradox is a common poetic device) −0.5; the tone is more static mood than dynamic modulation under pressure −0.4. The brightening at the end is a micro turn that justifies the reprise. Final: 6.2, rounding down from 6.5.</comment>
