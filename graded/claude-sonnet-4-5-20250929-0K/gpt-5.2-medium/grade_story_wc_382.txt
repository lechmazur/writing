<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to learn building-language is embodied through concrete actions (pressing the seal, following stone sentences) and the internal contradiction between preservation duty and tenant collusion creates genuine tension. Ilyas as a character feels specific—his steam-as-script detail and tutoring habits—though his ghostly nature skirts explanation. The final choice to slip documents into the inspector's folder shows agency with visible cost (risk of discovery, shared deception), and the emotional arc from anxious preservation to earned resolution reads credibly without sentiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the building is saved through the narrator's cunning, Ilyas fades into mortar "like a word finally understood," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the ghost's dissolution and the narrator's acceptance of deception. The causal lens holds: grandmother's seal → ledger knowledge → clay impression → stone sentences → hidden documents → inspector sleight → preservation order. One meaningful tightening occurs when the maintenance room opens and the documents are found, narrowing options and raising stakes for the walk-through. The "agreed upon lies" frame coheres throughout and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop anchors early with concrete details (herb pots, brass kettle, parapet stones) and the dove-and-key seal recurs purposefully, constraining the narrator's search and charging the final preservation. Meteor shower and steam-curling-into-letters create atmospheric texture without postcard drift. The maintenance room cavity and soot-lined documents feel tactile and plot-essential. Spatial choreography remains clear across roof, stairwell, and maintenance room, though the broader Dovetail interior stays lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the Dovetail from demolition—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector schedules the final walk-through. The narrator's agency drives escalation: interrogating Ilyas, stamping clay, following stone sentences, slipping documents. One credible reversal occurs when the sealed box of permits is discovered, transforming the narrator's options from rumor to proof. The sleight-of-hand resolution carries risk (landlord could discover, inspector could reject) and visible cost (shared deception, Ilyas's fading). Coincidence (grandmother's seal matching the parapet) complicates rather than resolves; the narrator must still act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—language, memory, and agreed-upon lies as preservation—emerges through concrete particulars: the seal's imprint, stone sentences, steam-letters, and Ilyas fading into mortar. The story resists moralizing; the final image of Ilyas smiling as he disappears offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether truth or deception saves what matters. The dove-and-key motif recurs with reweighted meaning (shorthand signature → proof of refuge design → heritage protection), and the "word finally understood" closure ties the building-language premise to Ilyas's role without stating a thesis. No thematic echo or sermon contaminates the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person voice is stable and idiosyncratic: "like the sky was being repaired," "patient as lichen," "the building settled with a long wooden sigh." Perceptual signature—reading lintels, hearing consonants in hinges—feels character-specific. Ilyas's dialogue ("time is the only verb a building understands") carries slight exposition but reads voice-motivated for a dead tutor. A few lines ("my grandmother's rolltop," "the inspector would have to grant heritage protection") tilt toward helpful-narrator clarity over discovery, slightly dulling immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "steam were a script," "meteors stitched white seams," "faded into the mortar like a word finally understood." One mixed metaphor: "I came up there whenever the masonry below began whispering" pairs oddly with "roof made me listen"—does masonry whisper or must the narrator listen harder? A minor paraphrase loop: "agreed the Dovetail was beyond saving" / "tenants had agreed to different lies" / "agreed upon lies bought time"—three "agreed" stems in quick succession. Information density is strong overall; most lines advance plot or world. No scaffold or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost mentor, building-language conceit, and heritage-document sleight-of-hand feels specific and non-obvious. The dead-language tutor tutoring dead-building grammar is a fresh inflection that grows organically from the premise. The agreed-upon-lies frame transforms familiar "save the old building" material through moral ambiguity (deception as preservation tool). The ending—documents slipped into the inspector's folder, Ilyas dissolving—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor proximity concern: the "language of buildings" / "word finally understood" metaphor echoes common literary idiom, but the execution through seal, clay, and stone sentences particularizes it enough to avoid cliché.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mr. Ilyas appears early (gate 1), his choices drive key beats: correcting vowels, instructing the narrator to press the seal, explaining the ledger history, nodding to open the maintenance room (gate 2), and fading at closure as the preservation order posts (gate 3). His decision to reveal the seal's meaning and guide the clay-stamping enables the stone-sentence discovery and document find—causal pressure is strong. The final image of him dissolving "like a word finally understood" ties his arc to closure. Irreplaceable: a living tutor could not fade into mortar; his ghostly state and linguistic expertise are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The antique desk seal is handled early (Ilyas asks the narrator to press it into wax, gate 1), used again in the middle (stamped into clay beside the carved parapet mark, unlocking stone sentences, gate 2), and its dove-and-key image charges the closure documents (permits bearing the same seal in red wax, gate 3). It constrains the narrator's search (must match the parapet mark) and enables the final solution (documents prove heritage refuge design). The seal's worn handle and specific iconography (dove on key) are irreplaceable details; no generic object could substitute. Visible cost: the narrator must learn to use it "patiently nimble" and risk misreading.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is signaled early (tenants swear the fifth floor is occupied, basement dry, night watchman exists, gate 1), shapes middle tactics (the narrator and Ilyas choose "a single shared lie" to slip documents without the landlord's knowledge, gate 2), and frames the closure (lies "held steady until truth could do its work," gate 3). The concept narrows options—direct confrontation would fail, so deception becomes the preservation method—and carries conceptual cost (the narrator becomes complicit in systemic falsehood). The final irony (agreed-upon lies enable legal truth) reweights the premise. Moderate irreplaceability: "strategic deception" could swap in, but "agreed upon" communal aspect matters.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is attributed to Ilyas early ("patient as lichen and nimble in his thin hands," gate 1) and the narrator tries to emulate it when working clay ("trying to be as patiently nimble as he was," gate 2). It constrains the clay-stamping action—the narrator must learn a technique, not just press—though the on-page cost is implicit (effort, learning curve) rather than a visible trade-off. No closure participation (gate 3 missing): the trait does not return or charge the final image. Moderate swappability: "careful" or "deliberate" could replace with minor edits, though the pairing of "patient" + "nimble" adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears early ("I came to interrogate the one person who knew the mark," gate 1), drives the middle dialogue where the narrator questions Ilyas about the seal and ledger (gate 2), and recurs at the walk-through ("I met the inspector at the stairwell and interrogated him in friendly tones," gate 3). The action enables two key beats: extracting seal knowledge from Ilyas and distracting the inspector during the document-slip. Causal pressure is strong; without interrogation, the narrator would not learn the clay method or successfully deceive the inspector. Moderate irreplaceability: "question" could substitute, but "interrogate" carries a sharper, more desperate register that fits the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions" is seeded early (narrator knocked for sugar, Ilyas required tea, returned cup refilled, third week turned into weekly sessions, gate 1) and frames the rooftop friendship that enables the present interrogation. It provides backstory causality—trust built over time allows Ilyas to share the seal secret—but does not constrain a middle choice (gate 2 weak) or return at closure (gate 3 missing). The method is told rather than dramatized; we see the result (tea on the roof tonight) but not the pattern shaping present tactics. Swappability high: any repeated visit ritual could establish trust. Lyric reprise potential unused.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during meteor shower anchors the opening (herb pots tremble, meteors stitch white seams, gate 1) and returns at closure (meteors dwindle to embers, Ilyas pours tea, gate 3). The setting enables the clay-from-planters action (middle beat, gate 2) and the meteor light illuminates the wax impression and later the stone sentences, subtly guiding the narrator's perception. Moderate causal pressure: the rooftop privacy allows the secret lesson, but the choice to go there versus another location feels soft. The meteor shower adds atmospheric texture but does not constrain tactics beyond lighting. Mid-band: all three gates present, but the setting could swap to another private space without breaking plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To learn the language of old buildings" is the narrator's stated desire early ("I wanted to learn the language of old buildings," gate 1), drives the middle interrogation and clay-stamping lessons (learning building-grammar to keep it standing, gate 2), and the closure rewards it: the narrator finally hears "a consonant I could finally place" and Ilyas fades "like a word finally understood" (gate 3). The motivation is conflicted—preservation duty versus tenant collusion—and costs are visible (risk of discovery, complicity in deception). Strong causal pressure: the desire to learn pushes every major choice. Irreplaceable: no other motive explains the seal investigation or clay ritual as cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is established early (Ilyas "familiar as a neighbor and strange as a memory," meteors repair the sky, masonry whispers, gate 1), modulates through the middle beats (steam curls into almost-recognized letters, stone sentences click into place, gate 2), and charges the final image (Ilyas fades "familiar as a neighbor and strange as a memory," echoing the opening line, gate 3). The tone supports the ghost-tutor premise and the agreed-upon-lies theme—known routines hide uncanny truths. Coherent across turns; the eerie-domestic balance never breaks. The closing reprise reweights the opening, making the friendship's end feel both inevitable and elegiac.</comment>
