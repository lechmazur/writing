<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior world is embodied through tactile engagement with clockwork and the memory of her father's teaching, and her choices—restructuring the feedback loop, trusting the leaf tick—are driven by consistent expertise and personal stakes tied to Lio's loss. The line "she felt, for one breath, that she had restructured time itself into something that could let loss escape" operates as earned interiority grounded in prior action. Minor slip: the connection to Lio is told in a single retrospective beat rather than woven through earlier micro-choices, slightly weakening the emotional cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The runaway clock hand creates a clear obstacle, Mara's leaf-tick governor restores stable tracking, and the launch command completes a because/therefore chain with visible stakes. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change—the camera pod climbs, the quake subsides, and Mara's listening to leaf ticks and telemetry reweights the opening promise to "harness the ephemeral." Cost is legible in the phrase "let loss escape," implying both technical success and unresolved grief. Orientation is anchored early (Lunar Observatory, Mara, tonight, tremor), and the causal chain holds without retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains every choice: the tremor threatens rail alignment, the clock governs the launch window, and the dome slit reveals the Moon as a visual stake. The pressed aspen leaf in its clear cylinder functions as micro-setting that supplies a solution under pressure. The closing image—"thin blue," telemetry, the roar that "shook her bones"—charges the final beat with embodied consequence. Spatial choreography (service corridor, control room, clockwork bay, rail) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the micrometeor swarm before dawn—is signaled early and tightened by the spinning clock hand and worsening quake. The tightening is causal: without stable tracking, the camera cannot lock; Mara's leaf-tick governor narrows the runaway feedback loop into a usable signal. The launch command is an on-page act of agency that forecloses the alternative of waiting, and the cost is felt in the phrase "let loss escape," linking technical success to unresolved grief for Lio. One meaningful escalation drives the closure under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of ephemeral flashes, stable timing, and the unresolved loss of Lio, without overt statement. The leaf-tick governor literalizes the father's teaching that "timing is only honest when it refuses to be bullied by noise," and the final image—listening to leaf ticks and telemetry as the pod climbs—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether one can "restructure time itself into something that could let loss escape." The aspen leaf recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the technical success with emotional ambiguity. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices gears, vibrations, and the Moon "bright as a scar," filtered through her repairer's expertise and grief. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, with no head-hopping. Diction ("luminous ache," "skittering around the dial like a trapped comet") is elevated but voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: the phrase "something as fleeting as sparks turned into data" briefly shifts into expository register, slightly loosening the embodied texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high ("the hand fed the drive motors, and the drive motors fed the hand"), and the prose propels without loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. Minor overwriting in the phrase "the luminous ache of the shaking night" and "thin cloud seas rolled far below like silent surf"—two consecutive figurative turns in a high-pressure beat—slightly blur focus. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of lunar observatory, earthquake pressure, and a leaf-tick governor as analog timing solution is specific and non-obvious. The closure—sending a camera pod up an electromagnetic rail to capture micrometeor flashes—feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from established constraints. The story transforms a familiar "repair under pressure" premise through the particular mechanics of clockwork feedback and the ghost of Lio's loss. No close echoes of famous lines; the synthesis is original enough to avoid derivative penalties.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—opening the drawer, dropping the leaf, restructuring the feedback loop, giving the launch command—create key turns at midpoint and closure. Her expertise is dramatized in action, not merely observed, and the final launch is a decision that alters the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The spinning clock hand is introduced early, handled in the control-room beat when Mara lays her palm on the case, and reappears when she watches it "slow, hesitate, and finally point like an arrow" after the repair. Its runaway state creates the obstacle; its stabilization enables the closure. Two distinct beats and causal pressure across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Escape velocity" is present in the exposition ("until the upper stage could hunt escape velocity") and shapes the stakes—the launch timer depends on stable tracking. It constrains the middle choice (fix the clock or lose the window) and is implicit in the final image of the pod climbing "into the thin blue." The phrase "let loss escape" reprises the concept thematically. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is indirect but present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" is embodied in the father's teaching ("timing is only honest when it refuses to be bullied by noise"), dramatized when Mara uses the leaf tick to replace the runaway hand, and paid off when the clock hand "point[s] like an arrow" and the tracking motors answer with steadier hum. The attribute constrains the repair method and charges the closure with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Restructure" appears in the midpoint beat ("began to restructure the feedback loop") and again in the closing line ("she had restructured time itself into something that could let loss escape"). The action is the major turn that resolves the technical crisis and enables the launch. Removing it would break the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The leaf-falling method is signaled when Mara "reached for an older method, one she used when she repaired field cameras in forests," then demonstrated in the beat where she drops the aspen leaf and listens for the tick. Its mechanics shape the repair attempt and appear in the closure ("she listened to the leaf ticks and to the distant telemetry"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting supplies every constraint: the pier where the telescope stands, the tremor that threatens rail alignment, the dome slit that reveals the Moon, and the electromagnetic rails that fling the pod. Micro-setting (the clear cylinder, the clockwork bay, the microphone clamp) alters tactics throughout. The final image—pod climbing into thin blue as the quake subsides—is inseparable from the setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The earthquake timeframe drives every decision: foundations shake, the clock hand spins, the quake worsens, and the window for the swarm is "closing toward dawn." When the crack runs along the floor seam, Mara braces and keeps her ear on the leaf cylinder "until the tick returned." The quake subsides as the pod climbs, marking the closure. Time pressure is legible and shapes tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated early ("to bottle them on film before they vanish into ordinary night") and dramatized in the choice to launch the camera pod. Friction is present in the phrase "let loss escape," linking the technical goal to unresolved grief for Lio. The motivation shapes the stakes but is not deeply conflicted on the page—Mara's commitment to the launch is consistent rather than torn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears explicitly in the midpoint ("in the luminous ache of the shaking night") and is sustained through diction ("bright as a scar," "thin cloud seas rolled far below like silent surf," "feeling that she had restructured time itself"). The tone modulates with pressure—clinical precision during the repair, wistful longing in the closing image—and charges the final beat with resonance.</comment>
