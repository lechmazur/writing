<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore trust after hiding the codex is clear and drives the ritual setup. However, her interior life relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("promises had started to sound like paper in a fire") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The team members remain undifferentiated gestures—"careful distance of scholars who once were friends"—without distinct speech or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Ilyon's confession at the climax introduces a new betrayal (his silent test) that feels more like plot convenience than earned character complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: Mara's secrecy → team fracture → ritual restoration attempt. The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust re-stitched via shared pledges) with felt relational cost (Ilyon's admission poisons as it heals). Orientation anchors early (archive, night, team scatter looming). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vow ink darkens and the snarled script resolves, narrowing the emotional stakes and foreclosing the path of solitary heroism. The cost is visible in Ilyon's wince and the "new, tentative melody" that replaces verdict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vault is well-anchored: cedar oil, cold quartz lamp, drawers of extinct scripts. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (desk → vault → center ink well). The ritual setup constrains the climax—witnesses required, objects arranged—giving the environment causal weight. However, the archive itself remains atmospheric rather than a live pressure on choices; Mara could perform this ritual in any secure room. The glass ink well and tuning fork function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore trust before the team scatters) is signaled early and tightens when the ritual begins. One meaningful turn: the codex reveals it does not erase names but "erases spaces between promises," reweighting the threat from annihilation to coercion and offering a path to repair. Mara's agency (send notes, perform ritual, confess) drives escalation under the causal lens. The cost is legible: her reputation for caution is risked, Ilyon's counter-confession exposes mutual poisoning, and the final pledge commits them to speak when silence tempts—foreclosing the old pattern with visible relational price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (trust, secrecy, the gap between promises and truth) emerges organically from the codex ritual rather than assertion. The ink well shifting from clear to midnight to clear again is a non-literal answer to "how do you restore broken faith?" The discord that "stung each listener with the same shame" embodies collective cost without moralizing. Ilyon's test and Mara's fear are morally ambiguous without forced balance. The final image—"a new, tentative melody of truth they would have to keep playing"—invites ongoing struggle rather than tidy resolution, and the symphonies-of-truth concept reweights the premise with conceptual cost (truth as binding, not just revealing).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Mara's professional lens ("read dead scripts the way musicians read scores") and her caution. However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("silence drained away like ink in water," "corridor no one wanted to cross") that feels writerly rather than character-particular under stress. The team's dialogue at the climax is reported in Sava rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. The phrase "carefully reckless" is applied twice as a label without embodied syntax that mirrors the trait in her thought patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several metaphors blur under scrutiny: "silence...was never neutral; it meant withheld translations, unshared credit, or a curse left unnamed" stacks three abstract equivalents without grounding. "Promises had started to sound like paper in a fire" mixes auditory and visual/tactile domains awkwardly. The phrase "carefully reckless" recurs without fresh context. Minor template cadence: "She had hidden... She had learned... She had tested..." The closure beat is clean, but figurative density in the vault scene ("syllables rose as sound, a chord that made the lamps vibrate") verges on overwriting without clear propulsion, triggering a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct language, ritual trust-binding, and vow ink as truth-detector offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The turn—that the codex erases gaps between promises rather than names—feels earned and reframes the threat in a fresh direction. However, the "oath ink distilled from a choir that sang only truths" and tuning-fork-activates-ancient-script beats echo fantasy-of-academia templates. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (the discord stings, the pledges must be spoken aloud), avoiding safety hedges. Risk-taking in structure (ritual as climax rather than chase) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (arcane linguist) is present throughout, frames the ritual setup (~15%), hides the codex (inciting decision), sends notes (middle choice), and performs the final tracing that unsnarls the script and confesses her fear (closure action). Her profession directly enables the climax: only she can read Sava and perform the vow-ink ritual. Swapping her for a generic scholar would break the story's internal logic. Early signal, two+ beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears early (Ilyon's relic on Mara's desk), is placed center in the vault ritual (~50%), darkens as pledges are spoken (middle transformation), and lightens to clear at the end when Mara hands it to Ilyon as "a shared instrument rather than a secret" (closure reprise with reweighted meaning). Three beats, causal function (holds vow ink that guides her hand), and charged closure linkage. However, it is functionally a ritual vessel; a chalice or bowl could substitute with minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" shapes the Sava language's rule-set (harmonies make lies discordant), structures the ritual (tuning fork, vow ink, unsnarling script into syllables that rise as sound), and drives the climax when the chord stings listeners with shame and reveals the codex's true function. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters tactics (Mara must coax music from the page, not force it) and narrows options (ritual requires witnesses and spoken pledges). Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage present. The mechanics are specific enough that removing "symphonies of truth" would require a different magic system.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is applied to Mara twice: once via Ilyon's past observation and again in the final line ("carefully reckless to the end"). The trait is illustrated by her action—hiding the codex to protect it (reckless secrecy) after measuring for weeks (caution)—and her decision to risk reputation by staging the public ritual. However, the label recurs without fresh dramatization; the trait is told more than enacted in a high-pressure micro-choice with visible cost. Lyric reprise (first third → final line) and one clear mid-story beat (weeks of measurement before the ritual) push it into mid-5s, but swappability (bold, audacious, daring could substitute) and label-reliance cap it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is the ritual's core verb: Mara's task is "to unsnarl" the knotted Sava script "not with force, but with listening." The action structures the climax—she traces the snarled line with vow ink, loosening knots into syllables that rise as the truth-chord. This act triggers her confession, Ilyon's counter-admission, and the codex's final revelation. The specific method (gentle listening rather than decryption) reflects the theme and cannot be swapped for "translate" or "decode" without losing thematic resonance. Early signal (~30%), causal pressure, closure participation, and thematic specificity all present, though the act itself is brief and somewhat abstract (tracing with a quill).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" is discovered by Mara in a marginal gloss, tested by her keeping vows all week (setup), and executed in the ritual when each team member speaks a written pledge aloud and the vow ink darkens, "braiding into a single channel of trust." The method is mechanically necessary—without the spoken pledges, the ink cannot guide her hand—and shapes the middle beat (sending notes, gathering witnesses). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatically tested; we see the result (ink darkens, syllables rise) but not a moment where the method nearly fails or forces a tactical choice. Early signal, clear mechanics, closure participation, but modest causal friction and summary-dominant portrayal limit the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "extinct language archive" anchors early (opening line), supplies the codex and ritual space (vault with cedar oil, cold quartz lamp), and its professional context (arcane linguist, dead scripts, team expeditions) frames the stakes. The vault is "the heart" where the ritual must occur. However, the setting is more atmospheric than constraining—Mara could perform this ritual in any secure room with the same objects. The archive's resources (clay tablets, bone slips) are mentioned but do not alter tactics. Solid setup, functional middle presence, closure participation via the vault's symbolic weight, but limited causal pressure keeps it in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" (eve before the team scatters) is the story's opening anchor and tightens stakes throughout: "tonight mattered," "promises to return," "before dawn." The timeframe compresses Mara's window to act (she must restore trust now) and charges the final image ("before their paths diverged at sunrise, they linked pledges again"). However, the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat; we feel urgency but do not see Mara racing against minutes. Early signal, thematic weight, closure linkage (sunrise arrival), but the mechanics of time pressure remain implied rather than dramatized in tactics. Mid-6s for solid framing with modest tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To restore trust after silence" is Mara's explicit goal ("she meant to restore trust after silence, even if the attempt ruined her reputation"), drives her decision to stage the ritual, and structures the climax (confession via vow ink, Ilyon's counter-admission, final shared pledge "to speak when fear urged silence"). The motivation is dramatized through her fear (the codex could erase names) and conflicted by cost (risking reputation, exposing her lie). The resolution directly addresses the desire with visible relational price. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage, and friction between want (protect alone) and need (restore collectively) all present. Strong integration with one hairline slip: the motivation is slightly over-articulated in narration rather than fully enacted through harder micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The phrase "cautious exuberance" appears once, describing Mara's ritual performance ("with cautious exuberance began tracing"). The tone is present in her character setup (measures the ice before stepping) but does not modulate across the story's emotional beats—the vault scene reads somber and tense rather than exuberant. The final image ("tentative melody") echoes caution but lacks exuberance. Functional use in one beat and thematic echo, but static application and limited tonal range across pressure points cap it in the low-5s. Swapping for "careful intensity" would not break coherence.</comment>
