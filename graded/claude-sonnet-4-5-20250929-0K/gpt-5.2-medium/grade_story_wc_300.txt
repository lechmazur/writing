<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shows specificity in her professional lens ("tapping steel doors," "unspoken fears that clung to the concrete"), and her micro-choice to ask about the pearl opens the widower's confession. However, the final turn—her decision to crown the entrance with the pearl and file noncompliant—arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost; she simply "understood" and "saw her job differently" in what reads as an unearned epiphany. The widower's confession lands with embodied detail ("shaking hands," "fingering a cultivated pearl"), but his arc from sealing the door on neighbors to standing beside Mara feels rushed and externally resolved by the pearl's magic rather than his own struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (bunker inspector, Vault Seventeen entrance, evening) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the pearl-seashell ritual, the recited confessions, and the dawn crowning. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pearl above the door loosens tongues, Mara files noncompliant yet leaves the shelter unsealed, and the seashell waits for new etchings—a crystallized final moment where options and stakes are reconfigured. However, the cost is mostly conceptual (filing noncompliant, leaving the door unsealed) and not dramatized with visible professional or relational consequence on the page; the final image tells us "faces soften, old grudges dissolve" rather than showing a specific neighbor's choice or Mara's price paid. The causal link from pearl-warming to community confession feels more magical than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal caves are vividly rendered ("mineral spires caught their lantern light and broke it into silent rainbows") and the seashell fossil with hair-thin confession markings functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear: entrance → storerooms → maintenance shaft → caves → back to the entrance at dawn. The pearl crowning the door at dawn supplies the final image with concrete environmental detail. Sensory selection remains filtered through Mara's professional attention (blast valves, water pumps) early, then shifts to wonder in the caves without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara certifies bunkers while "the surface towns argued about who deserved shelter," and the widower's confession introduces the interpersonal cost of isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the widower leads Mara to the caves and explains the pearl's function, narrowing the choice to whether she will use it. However, escalation is largely handed to Mara by the pearl's latent radiance rather than driven by her agency under pressure; she asks about the pearl, listens, recites confessions, and the pearl does the work. The final act—crowning the entrance—feels more like enacting a provided solution than a trade-off with visible cost. No persistent constraint (time, resource, social cost) visibly alters her tactics or the widower's stance on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—dissolving walls between hearts through shared confession and vulnerability—emerges through the pearl ritual, the spiral of confessions, and the dawn gathering. The seashell's hair-thin markings and the pearl's warming provide concrete particulars. Mara's realization that "the pearl acquired abandoned hopes not to hoard them, but to keep them from rotting into bitterness" avoids didacticism by tying insight to action (she crowns the entrance, neighbors speak). However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "she knew her motive had been met: to dissolve the walls between hearts, starting with this door" makes the theme explicit rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection on communal healing and the cost of isolation, but the resolution is more affirming than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is professional and specific: "tapping steel doors and counting filters," "latent radiance, the soft afterglow that blooms when truth is finally named." Diction stays consistent (no register drift), and narrative distance modulates purposefully from detached inspection to intimate witness. The widower's direct speech—"it was all he had left from the sea," "the pearl awakened via confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral"—reads slightly formal but remains plausible for a man in extremis. Filter verbs ("understood," "saw," "realized") cluster in the climax without obscuring immediacy. One minor slip: "she knew her motive had been met" in the final paragraph edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, with longer constructions in the opening ("She learned that every bunker carried two inventories: canned beans and battery stacks, and the unspoken fears that clung to the concrete like damp") giving way to shorter beats during the cave descent. Information density is high; most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the widower said the pearl awakened via confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral, and that if you traced the lines and spoke them aloud, it would drink what was left unfinished" restates mechanics already implied by prior action. Template cadence in the final third: "the pearl warmed," "the pearl flared," "the pearl's latent radiance spilled" stacks similar constructions. The phrase "abandoned hope" recurs four times without clear evolution. Stock metaphor: "broken into silent rainbows." These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in the closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—bunker inspector discovers a confession-absorbing pearl and ritual in hidden caves—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic isolation and communal healing. Specific details (cultivated pearl, seashell fossil with hair-thin markings, "latent radiance") feel particular to this world. However, the emotional arc (isolated man confesses, community gathers, walls dissolve) follows a familiar redemption template without sustained friction or surprise. The pearl's mechanics—warming, gathering hopes, spilling radiance—read more convenient than earned; the piece does not wrestle with why neighbors would trust the widower after he sealed them out, or what Mara risks by filing noncompliant. The transformation test is mixed: the beats would change if the pearl were replaced, but the emotional resolution (confession leads to reconciliation) could occur with different objects and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as bunker inspector frames the opening and closing (she files noncompliant, leaves the shelter unsealed). Her choice to ask about the pearl at the moment of hesitation opens the confession sequence, and her decision to crown the entrance with the pearl creates the dawn gathering. However, the middle sequence (cave descent, reciting confessions) is guided by the widower; Mara's agency reads more as witness than driver. Her realization that the pearl could "dissolve the walls between hearts" and her choice to crown the entrance are present in the final third but arrive without visible internal conflict or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cultivated pearl appears in the opening beat (widower "kept fingering a cultivated pearl on a string"), is explained and handled in the cave ritual (Mara "took the pearl in her palm, pressed it to the seashell"), warms and flares during the confession sequence, and is crowned above the bunker door at dawn where it "spilled outward, loosening tongues." The pearl's meaning evolves from grief token to confession vessel to communal beacon. It drives two key beats (cave ritual, dawn crowning) and charges the final image. Specificity is high (cultivated, nacre, warming, flaring); the story would break without this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" is named explicitly mid-story ("Mara had inspected blast valves and water pumps for ten years, but she had never been taught to handle latent radiance, the soft afterglow that blooms when truth is finally named") and recurs in the closure ("the pearl's latent radiance spilled outward"). It shapes the pearl's function—gathering abandoned hopes and enabling communal confession—but the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint. The mechanics (radiance loosens tongues) are asserted rather than tested under pressure; we do not see what happens if radiance fails or what cost it imposes on Mara or the widower. It colors the ending but does not narrow options in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Acquires abandoned hopes" is defined mid-story ("the pearl acquired abandoned hopes not to hoard them, but to keep them from rotting into bitterness") and demonstrated when the pearl warms while Mara and the widower recite confessions ("gathering the child's abandoned hope as if it were breath"). The attribute enables the cave ritual and the dawn gathering, but the acquisition is passive (the pearl does the work) and carries no visible cost or constraint on Mara's choices. The trait is causal but not contested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Crown" appears in Mara's choice: "She asked the widower to lend her the pearl for a single night, to let her crown the entrance with it as a signal" and is enacted at dawn: "she fixed the pearl above the bunker door like a small crown." This action creates the final turn—the pearl "spilled outward, loosening tongues and shoulders," enabling the community gathering and Mara's choice to file noncompliant yet leave the shelter unsealed. The verb "crown" carries symbolic weight (small crown, signal, elevation) and the action is indispensable to closure. However, the choice to crown arrives without visible internal conflict; Mara simply "understood" and asked.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—"via confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral"—is introduced when the widower leads Mara to the fossil seashell with "hair-thin markings: confessions etched inside a seashell's spiral by generations who had hidden here." The mechanics are explained and demonstrated: "if you traced the lines and spoke them aloud, it would drink what was left unfinished." Mara and the widower recite confessions from the spiral, the pearl warms and flares, and at dawn "each word joined the spiral's unseen script." The method drives the cave ritual and structures the community gathering; the story teaches the mechanics early and pays them off at closure. Swapping for "via spoken confessions" would lose the tactile, historical, and spatial specificity of the seashell spiral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Crystal caves appear mid-story when the widower leads Mara "past the storerooms to a maintenance shaft that opened into crystal caves beneath the bunker, where mineral spires caught their lantern light and broke it into silent rainbows." The caves house the seashell fossil and provide the charged space for the confession ritual; the setting supplies the "listening ears" image when crystals respond to the pearl's radiance. At closure, the caves return: "in the crystal caves below, the seashell waited for new etchings, keeping their shared future quietly lit." The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image but does not constrain Mara's choices or alter tactics under pressure; it functions more as symbolic frame than tactical resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the heartbeat of a hesitation" appears in the opening: "On the evening she was sent to certify Vault Seventeen, the air around its entrance held a resonant hush, as if the world were listening for a decision" and "Mara asked about the pearl, and during the heartbeat of a hesitation his face cracked open." The timeframe signals the moment of choice and the widower's vulnerability, but it does not tighten decisions or track a live clock through the story. The narrative then shifts to evening → cave descent → dawn crowning, and the "heartbeat of a hesitation" does not recur or constrain later beats. It is ornamental signal rather than sustained pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to dissolve the walls between hearts"—is signaled implicitly in the opening ("every bunker carried two inventories: canned beans and battery stacks, and the unspoken fears that clung to the concrete like damp") and stated explicitly at closure: "she knew her motive had been met: to dissolve the walls between hearts, starting with this door." The motivation drives her choice to ask about the pearl, to recite confessions in the caves, and to crown the entrance at dawn. However, the desire is more told than dramatized under pressure; we do not see Mara struggle between professional duty (certify locks) and interpersonal risk (unseal the door, file noncompliant) with visible cost. The friction between wants and costs is conceptual rather than embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" appears in the opening: "the air around its entrance held a resonant hush, as if the world were listening for a decision" and recurs at closure: "People began to speak in the same resonant hush she had heard at the gate." The tone is coherent through the cave descent ("silent rainbows," "quiet it could only be felt between pulses") and modulates with pressure (widower's shaking hands, pearl's flare, dawn gathering). The hush charges the final image by linking the initial moment of choice to the community's shared vulnerability. The tone is purposeful, consistent, and elevates the ending without becoming static.</comment>
