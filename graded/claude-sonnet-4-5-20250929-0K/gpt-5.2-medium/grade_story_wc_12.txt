<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Father Selo's motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions is dramatized through deliberate choices under pressure. Mara's internal conflict surfaces through the parasite's grip loosening when memory contradicts the conquest assumption. The characterization relies heavily on abstract rhetorical concepts ("anaphora," "chiasmus," "metonymy") that function as labels rather than embodied struggle—the priest's tools feel more like authorial annotations than lived choices. The final act of drawing the circle is earned, but the middle beats lean toward summary of technique rather than visceral contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Selo, Mara), where (Dimensional Anchor), and stakes (possession nearing completion) within the opening lines. The causal lens holds: Selo's looped anaphora disrupts the parasite's straight commands, the chiasmus surfaces Mara's assumption, the memory loosens the grip, and her circle completes the exorcism. Cost is visible in Mara's shivering and the rift's trembling, though the climactic moment—Mara drawing the circle—feels slightly understated given the buildup. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ironic litany forces the parasite's choice, which Mara exploits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt ring bolted to air is vivid and specific; the palette's single ash-blue well becomes a concrete constraint that channels Mara's final choice. Micro-setting elements (Selo's satchel, the stone rim, the rift) are integrated into action. The "cloth over a bell" metaphor and "muffled clarity" establish atmosphere that charges the final quiet dawn scene. Spatial choreography remains coherent—Selo kneels, Mara sits, the circle is drawn on stone—without floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the possession before completion—is signaled immediately and sustained through the encounter. Pressure escalates as the parasite fights and the basalt trembles, but the tightening is more textural (looped prayers, accumulated rhetorical moves) than a sharp reversal. Mara's agency in drawing the circle and declaring the unknown a neighbor constitutes the decisive turn, though it arrives somewhat gently. The cost is legible (shivering, the rift's near-unbolt) but muted in scale; the resolution feels more philosophical than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: conquest versus mercy, limits as protection, exorcism as illumination of hidden assumptions. The palette's single color and Mara's brother-map memory concretize the abstract claim without sermonizing. Selo's closing statement—"exorcism was less a battle than illumination"—borders on thematic summary but is earned by the prior dramatization of rhetorical devices reweighting power. The final image of tending the rift with "deliberate quiet" resonates without foreclosing ambiguity, though the conceptual neatness (one color, one boundary) flirts with over-tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person close to Selo maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (silence as ornament, rhetorical devices as tools). The prose leans into elevated, almost liturgical diction ("metonymy," "anaphora," "chiasmus") that fits the priest's POV but risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy. Mara's interiority is filtered through Selo's observation, which keeps her opaque until the memory surfaces—acceptable but limiting. The parasite's voice is "thin as graphite," a precise image, yet direct dialogue is absent, replaced by narrated rhetorical moves that sometimes read more like craft lecture than lived scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong images (basalt bolted to air, cloth over bell, ash blue as promise). However, template cadence appears in repeated "not X but Y" constructions ("not with knives or exorcist fire but through rhetorical devices," "not as melody but as metonymy," "not an enemy but a neighbor"). The final third recaps the exorcism's method in a near-summary register ("showing what we assume about power, about maps, about ourselves") that deflates momentum. Figurative language is frequent and mostly effective, though "the unknown was not an enemy but a neighbor with undisclosed names" tips toward precious phrasing. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "the possessing thing" / "the parasite" / "the possessing voice") recur without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of possession exorcism with rhetorical devices and cartographic metaphor is specific and non-obvious, anchored in the loop-pedal priest and single-color palette. The piece avoids stock exorcism tropes (no holy water, no violent confrontation) in favor of philosophical pressure, which feels fresh. The dimensional rift setting and the notion of silence as ornament add textural originality. However, the central conflict—hidden assumptions about conquest—risks abstraction, and the rhetorical-device framing occasionally reads more like an essay on method than lived stakes. The final image (tending the rift until dawn) is quiet and earned but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Father Selo is present throughout, makes the key choices (anaphora, chiasmus, palette offer, ironic litany), and drives the exorcism to closure. His decisions alter tactics at each beat and his role is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The palette appears in setup (in satchel), is placed in Mara's palm at the mid-scene turn, and Mara uses the blue to draw the anchoring circle at closure. Two distinct beats and closure participation, though the palette's single color feels more thematic than mechanically indispensable—another modest object might serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" is introduced early in Mara's posture and recurs as the parasite's grip loosens. It shapes the diagnosis (her quiet "picked apart thread by thread") but does not constrain a tactical choice; the concept is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Decorating with silence is Selo's signature trait, signaled in the chapel description and deployed when he uses pauses to force the parasite's hesitation and ends on "a pause long enough to teach." The trait constrains his method and charges the final quiet vigil, though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Plumb" (via rhetorical devices) is the action that structures the entire encounter: anaphora, chiasmus, palette offer, and ironic litany are all plumbing moves. The action is indispensable to the exorcism's success and shapes multiple beats, though the execution leans summary at times.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhetorical devices (anaphora, chiasmus, metonymy, litany) are introduced early, named explicitly, and used in distinct beats to disrupt the parasite. The method is mechanical and integral to the plot, though the naming risks didacticism and the beats sometimes read as glosses rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Dimensional Anchor is present in setup, the basalt ring is sat upon, and the rift's trembling raises stakes mid-scene. Mara draws the circle on the stone at closure. The setting provides concrete resources (ring, stone) and the rift adds external pressure, though the location's unique properties (bolted to air) are more atmospheric than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the possession completes" is signaled in the opening and the parasite's fight to completion drives urgency. However, the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat; we are told it is tightening but do not feel incremental pressure or see a visible countdown. The temporal constraint shapes the premise more than the tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selo's motivation to illuminate hidden assumptions is stated early and dramatized through his choice of rhetorical devices over violence. The chiasmus surfaces Mara's conquest assumption, and his closing explanation ties the entire encounter to this goal. The motivation drives the plot and is paid off at closure, though it leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is established in the opening ("air felt like a cloth over a bell") and sustained through the encounter's deliberate quiet, looped cadence, and pauses. The tone modulates slightly when the parasite fights and the basalt trembles, then returns to "deliberate quiet" at dawn. The tone charges the final image and coheres with the method, though it remains relatively static across beats.</comment>
