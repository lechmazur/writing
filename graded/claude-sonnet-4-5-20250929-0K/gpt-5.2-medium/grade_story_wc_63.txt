<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical action—releasing the escapement, lifting the bob, carrying the weight down to the ridge. Her internal conflict between duty and guilt drives micro-choices (pausing at the crank, keeping the rake handle as evidence) that accumulate visible cost. The widow interaction at the end earns the incremental-absolution arc through renunciation rather than forgiveness. Minor slip: the father/Torren flashback ("she saw, as in searing reverie") edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction, but the choice to recalibrate the marker and show the lead sliver remains grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the first ~100 words (Mara, clock tower, low tide, recent wreck). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered objects (bob, rake handle, lead sliver, tide marker) and the closure—showing the widow the engineered imbalance—reconfigures meaning through conceptual repricing with social cost (the nod, not forgiveness). Causality is motivated throughout: the pendulum's drift was engineered, Torren left instructions, removing the lead restores truth. One minor gap: the exact mechanism by which the lead sliver "pulled time ahead of the moon" is asserted rather than demonstrated, but the image of Mara cutting the notch and the wave meeting it "neither early nor late" lands the closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting that pressures the final recalibration: Mara uses the bob as plumb, sets it beside the old marker, and the wave meets the notch she cuts. The tower's interior (escapement, chain assembly, brass belly of the bob) supplies tactile constraint. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "black glass veined with salt and barnacle scar," "heat rose from the dark stone though the air was cold," "green corrosion." The ridge's dual presence—at opening and closure—charges the final image without repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring mechanical truth to prevent future deaths—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's discovery of the engineered drift. Pressure escalates via accumulation: paused hand on crank → pendulum stilled → latch clicks → lead sliver removed → marker recalibrated → widow confronted. Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost: removing the sliver "felt like taking a hot coal from her own throat," and the widow's nod (not smile) refuses easy absolution. The final acceptance that "absolution would remain incremental" forecloses reconciliation and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—engineered imbalance, incremental correction, the impossibility of full restitution—emerges through particulars: the lead sliver, Torren's carved numbers, the notch meeting the wave. The title concept "incremental absolution" is dramatized rather than stated: Mara's penance is "mechanical, exact, and slow," and the pendulum's renewed arc embodies "the only justice she could offer, minute by minute." The widow's nod without a smile is a non-literal answer to the thematic question, rejecting tidy forgiveness. The final image—absolution passing "through center again and again"—reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; perceptual signature filters the world through mechanical precision ("tooth of the gear," "latch in the chain assembly clicked"). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "cooled forge," "guilt makes even duty hesitate," "surf gnawing the ridge." Minor density issue: the phrase "searing reverie" in the flashback moment edges toward elevated register that slightly tensions the established voice, and the final paragraph's "she felt a small, painful easing in her ribs" + "she recognized the only justice she could offer" doubles the interiority beat. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Information density is high: most sentences do multi-job work (bob's history + storm damage + jury chain in one move). Minor loop artifacts: "she heard more than silence; she heard the widow's words, the surf gnawing the ridge, and her own shame" reprises structure within a single beat; "The widow did not smile, yet she nodded once, and Mara accepted that absolution would remain incremental" stacks clauses that could tighten. No figurative muddle in peak beats. One small template-cadence run in the middle third (repeated "she" + past-tense verb openers across three consecutive sentences) slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical guilt, tidal calibration, and inscribed instructions feels specific and non-obvious; the image of using the pendulum bob as plumb to reset a tide marker is memorable. The core concept—engineered time-drift for bureaucratic efficiency causing literal death—transforms a clockwork-guilt template through grounded occupational detail (escapement, lunar days, gear settings). The widow encounter resists both reconciliation and pure tragedy, landing in earned ambiguity. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, high reflection percentage, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's role as precise winder drives every major beat: pausing at the crank (inciting guilt), releasing the escapement, discovering the latch, removing the lead, recalibrating the marker, restarting the swing, confronting the widow. Her decisions alter tactics and foreclose paths with visible cost. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pendulum bob appears in at least four distinct beats: historical polish by father, jury-chain hang, lifted to reveal scratch, used as plumb at ridge, then restarted. The scratch/rake alignment clicks the latch open (causal). The bob-as-plumb enables the tide-marker recalibration. Final image: "renewed arc of the pendulum" charges closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Incremental absolution" is named early and operationalized: "moving the world back toward rightness one tooth of the gear at a time," each correction narrow and slow, widow's nod without smile, final acceptance that absolution "must pass through center again and again." The concept shapes Mara's tactics (mechanical penance, step-by-step recalibration) and the ending's refusal of tidy forgiveness. Setup, development, payoff all met; cost clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Ethically diligent" is demonstrated through Mara's refusal of shortcuts, her systematic discovery process, and her choice to show the widow the evidence rather than hide the council's manipulation. The trait constrains her action (she cannot ignore the drift) and enables the exposure with social cost. Visible tradeoff: she accepts incremental absolution over comfort. Present in setup (vow), middle (removing sliver), and closure (widow confrontation).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Emerge" anchors the climactic ridge scene where Mara recalibrates the marker and watches the wave meet the notch, then again as she returns to restart the pendulum and later emerges to the widow. The action redefines options: from interior guilt to public exposure. First emergence at two-thirds mark charges the shift from discovery to correction. Not easily swappable; the spatial transition from tower enclosure to open ridge embodies the thematic move from private penance to shared truth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tiny inscriptions on the broken rake handle supply Torren's map: "Carve one truth where your hand rests" and gear/lunar sequences that let Mara decode the engineered drift. The method is signaled early (washed-up handle, "lamplight and patience"), drives the middle discovery (numbers correspond to settings), and its final blank inch receives the lead's mass and date. The specificity (carved instructions rather than a note) makes Torren's resistance concrete and Mara's correction traceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge pressures the opening (wreck site, widow's accusation) and supplies the closure resource: Mara uses the ridge's tide marker and the wave's arrival to verify her correction, then feels "a small, painful easing." The ridge's heat shimmer triggers the flashback that clarifies motive. Micro-setting (bob as plumb, notch cut in marker) alters tactics at the climax. All three gates met; causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"The rare pause in a pendulum's swing when motion becomes a held breath" frames the discovery beat: Mara releases the escapement, waits for the pause, then lifts the bob and finds the scratch. The timeframe tightens the window for action and symbolically links mechanical stillness to moral reckoning. The pause recurs in the final image ("must pass through center again and again"). Live clock that shapes attempts and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is dramatized through every choice: Mara's penance is mechanical (not emotional theater), she recalibrates tide to moon, she exposes engineered imbalance to the widow, she accepts that balance will remain incremental. Friction between want (absolution) and cost (widow's refusal, ongoing guilt) is visible. The desire shapes setup (paused hand), middle (removing lead), and closure (showing evidence, accepting the nod). Indispensable to motive and arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" modulates through the piece: the opening's "cooled forge" and "black glass," the guilt that "makes even duty hesitate," the flashback shimmer on the ridge, the "small, painful easing," and the pendulum's arc as "the only justice." Tone is coherent through discovery and correction, intensifying at the ridge scene and softening (but not resolving) at the widow's nod. Charges the final image without stasis.</comment>
