<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orren's interiority is well-embodied through his physical relationship to vibration and memory of the capsized boat. His micro-choices (arranging the forks, testing with his own memories, conducting the staff) reveal character under pressure without therapy-speak. Mara remains somewhat thin—her gestures and slate-writing are clear but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful cost at closure. The final choice ("the empty slot...had its purpose") feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through prior contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (winterglass conservatory, post-silence world, Orren's survivor status). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the tuning-fork calibration sequence, and the closure reweights the empty slot from loss to purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when Orren's memory-test proves the forks stabilize vibration, narrowing the system's flaw. Cost is present but muted—Orren's trauma is referenced but not viscerally paid at closure; the final image reconfigures meaning without a sharp felt price, landing as Conceptual Repricing with moderate charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vivid and purposeful: frost flowers, seed vaults, sensor grids, and benches that transmit vibration all constrain the heat-mapping method and shape Orren's calibration work. The tuning forks function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography (center hall table, benches, vitrines) remains clear. Minor penalty: the conservatory's architecture could pressure a mid-scene choice more directly; it mostly supplies resources rather than obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence into tactile music and fix the system flaw) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Orren's memory-test reveals the forks prevent vibration collapse, enabling the choir effect. Agency is present in his alignment of forks and silent conducting, but the escalation is modest—Mara's problem is posed, Orren solves it in one attempt without visible cost or trade-off. The child's bright vibration is a micro-turn but does not narrow Orren's options; the resolution feels gentle rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (loss reweighted as purpose, silence as communicable presence) emerges organically from the tuning-fork mechanics and Orren's survivor guilt. The empty slot reappears with shifted meaning at closure, avoiding overt statement. Subtext operates in gesture (Mara's throat-touch, Orren's mime) and the unspoken grief carried by visitors. Minor slip: "to translate silence into music and to keep the marvels unshaken" in the penultimate beat edges toward thesis articulation, though it remains character-voiced rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable on Orren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—he reads emotion as warmth, rhythm as survival memory. Diction is controlled and lyric ("winterglass," "frost flowers blooming between glass layers") without register clash. The phrase "silently expressive" recurs as both attribute and rhythm, bordering on template but serving the motif. Minor artifact: "the system had a flaw, Mara told him" shifts briefly to summary when the slate-writing could have been shown on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Sentence rhythm modulates well ("When his boat flipped, the sea took his hearing and then the world took everyone's"). Minor overwriting: "unshaken marvels" appears three times, and "silently expressive" twice within proximity, edging toward decorative recurrence. The closure beat ("the empty slot...had been a question, not a loss") leans slightly abstract when a concrete image would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (tactile music via heat-mapping in a silent world) is fresh and integrated with character (capsize survivor who felt fear as warmth). The tuning-fork calibration mechanic is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric voice and speculative setting heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the ending's emotional resolution (empty slot as question/purpose) feels slightly familiar in its redemptive arc, and the conservatory's "wordless, measurable song" edges toward abstraction rather than a final concrete image with sharper irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orren (capsize survivor) drives the calibration choice, memory-test, and silent conducting. His survivor trauma anchors the heat-as-emotion insight. Present in setup, middle (memory-test and conducting), and closure (realizes the empty slot's purpose). Cost is conceptual (reframing loss) rather than a visible trade-off, capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in setup (carried, four forks plus empty slot), middle (forks aligned on sensor grid, brass fork retrieved), and closure (Mara slides case back, empty slot reweighted as purpose). Drives the calibration mechanic and charges the final image. High integration, though the forks solve the problem without visible cost or constraint on Orren's choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is mentioned three times (frost flowers, lamps, final line). Present early as setting detail, returns at closure in Orren's written statement. Functions more as thematic echo than causal lever—does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately but lacks mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is introduced in setup (hands speaking, eyes finishing phrases) and demonstrated in middle (miming waves, conducting staff). Enables Orren's communication with Mara and the staff, affecting the calibration sequence. Present at closure only by implication (final writing). Functional across two beats but no visible cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rectify" anchors the middle turn: Orren proposes forks as calibrators to fix the system flaw, then tests and succeeds. Drives the heat-mapping demonstration and staff choir. Present in closure beat as the algorithm Orren tunes. Causal pressure is solid, though the action succeeds on first attempt without complication, capping irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced early (sensor grid, thermal maps), shapes the middle sequence (Orren's memory-test, staff demonstration), and anchors the nightly visitor ritual at closure. Mechanics matter: the forks stabilize what the sensors capture. High integration, though Mara explains the method rather than Orren discovering its constraints through failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory provides vivid setting (vitrines, benches, center hall table) and supplies the infrastructure (sensors, benches) for the heat-mapping system. Present throughout and returns at closure ("watched the conservatory glow"). Constrains the method spatially but does not force a difficult choice or obstacle; functions more as resource than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" frames the premise and motivates the tactile-music solution. Present in opening and implied throughout (slate-writing, gesture). Does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock or escalating silence effect that alters Orren's tactics. Functions as backstory context rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is dramatized through Orren's calibration work, memory-test, and conducting. Signaled early (he "felt rhythm in his bones"), drives middle beats, and appears in Orren's final written statement. Cost is conceptual (reframing the empty slot) rather than a visible friction between wants. High integration with moderate felt price.</comment>
