<comment>Mira's motivation is concrete (finding Jalen's shadow via dream recording) and drives her through escalating choices. The craft details (lantern making, gem polishing, origami) anchor her specificity, though interiority remains functional rather than contradictory—she grieves, resolves, acts, without simultaneous competing impulses wrestling in scene. The final transformation into shadow-bird and tear feels earned by the journey but略 anticipated rather than wrestled from ambivalence. Minor voice-convergence between narration and the priests' explanation flattens what could be Mira's unique perceptual filter under duress.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Lumen Isle, post-shadow-detachment, Mira at workbench). The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat (learning gem polishing, traveling to basilica, entering Archive Spire, projecting dream, folding crane, shadow's return) layers density until the climactic "split into flame and paper" reconfigures the dominant stake. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Mira steps into the projection, splits herself, and folds grief into the crane, yielding the shadow-bird and her tears. The cost is legible (she "leaves part of herself in the light") and the final image reweights prior cranes from dead objects to vessels that can hold shadows. One minor ambiguity: the phrase "transform the recording into a new shadow" suggests creation rather than retrieval, but the ending clarifies Jalen's shadow returns, so the logic holds under lyric compression.</comment>

<comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and stairway "that descends while ascending" supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The lantern (brass throat, polished moonstone lens) is handled across multiple beats and its mechanics (storing dream flickers) constrain Mira's method. Sensory detail is selective: jasmine scent pulls the island, tea steam and cold rain inside the basilica, stained-dawn projection. The vertigo on the corkscrew stair and the priests' mirrored veils avoid postcard catalog. However, spatial choreography during the climax—"she steps into the projection" and "takes the paper part"—compresses the body's position and the mechanics of splitting, leaving the reader to infer rather than track Mira's literal stance. At this length, the detail economy is sound, but one more concrete cue (e.g., where her hands are, how the flame/paper division manifests physically) would anchor the pivotal act.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (retrieve Jalen's shadow to fill the empty cranes) is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through escalating costs: months learning gem polishing, the vertigo stair, and the priests' price ("leave part of herself in the light"). The Archive Spire climax narrows options—Mira must step into the dream and split herself—forcing a visible trade: flame polishes from within, paper folds grief, and she weeps only after the shadow returns, marking the forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow "turns, sees her, and returns," shifting from lost to reclaimed. Agency is clear (she chooses each step), and coincidence does not resolve. The piece could benefit from a live obstacle mid-journey (a priest's refusal, the lantern malfunctioning) to force a second tactical pivot, but the escalation present is sufficient under the Accumulative lens and the final cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of grief, recording, transformation, and utility: "luminous torment made useful, so other mourners can find their shadows again." The cranes shift from dead objects to vessels; the split into flame and paper literalizes the cost of recovery without stating a moral. Mira's final act—hanging lanterns shaped like cranes—invites reflection on collective mourning and the ache she folded into them. The piece resists false balance (no hedge that grief must be "let go" or "accepted") and trusts the image of the shadow-bird circling the basilica to carry weight. One small deduction: the phrase "missing note has returned" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward meta-commentary, though it's brief and filtered through the priests' reaction rather than narrator assertion, so the slip is minor.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady throughout; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, compressed register consistent with the fantastical milieu: "kettles sing," "shadow tore loose and slid away," "stairway that descends while ascending." Psychic distance narrows during the climax ("she feels herself split into flame and paper") without filter clutter. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that sits slightly above embodied urgency: "luminous torment in sound," "stained dawn," "lightless light." These phrases are evocative but risk ornament over precision. The priests' dialogue is minimal and functional; Mira's interiority is present but could modulate more under peak stress (the split and the weeping are asserted rather than rendered through fragmenting syntax or sensory breakdown). No POV leaks, but the voice lacks a second gear of intensity at the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, craft detail, or plot (gem polishing, lantern mechanics, basilica architecture). However, several lines loop conceptually: "dead on the shelf, because her hands cannot remember the weight of his laughter" and "empty wings" both gesture at the same lack without added pressure. The phrase "luminous torment" appears twice (once in recorded whispers, once in the final lanterns), which is intentional recurrence but edges toward stock metaphor. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening third: "she tries," "she has spent," "she chooses," "she sets," "she transforms"—five proximate stems that flatten propulsion. The climax compresses action economically ("she steps into the projection, letting the dream record her back") but "takes the paper part, folds it quickly" elides the mechanics of how flame and paper separate, requiring inference. Clarity holds, momentum is sound, but the piece would benefit from cutting one or two synonym gestures (e.g., "empty wings" after "dead on the shelf") and varying the subject-verb openings in the setup.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of craft (lantern making, gem polishing, origami) with fantastical elements (detached shadows, dream recording, floating isles) feels specific and non-obvious. The "stairway that descends while ascending" and the split into flame and paper offer fresh physical metaphors for grief's duality. The piece avoids template mourning-quest beats by embedding technical detail (moonstone lenses, brass throats, mirrored veils) that grounds the fantasy. However, the core arc—retrieve lost loved one's essence via magical archive—is a familiar scaffold, and while the execution adds texture, the emotional destination (tears, return, communal lanterns) lands in expected territory. The risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative structure) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, earning a modest bonus within band. Transformation test: swapping lanterns for another craft and shadows for another lost essence would leave the emotional spine largely intact, signaling the premise leans on well-worn rails despite the vivid detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's choices drive every turn: she learns gem polishing, builds the recorder-lantern, travels to the basilica, climbs the spire, steps into the dream, and folds the crane. Setup occurs in paragraph two, development spans the journey and spire climb, and closure hinges on her split and fold. Causal pressure is high—without her agency, no shadow returns. The "crafty" attribute is demonstrated through lantern craft and origami rather than declared. Specificity (lantern maker) is irreplaceable; the story logic requires her technical skill. Cost is visible: she weeps, splits, and later hangs new lanterns for others, foreclosing solitary mourning.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The glass basilica appears by paragraph fourteen (past midpoint), is entered, houses the priests and Archive Spire, and provides the setting for the climactic projection. It shapes two beats (entry and spire ascent) and supplies the environment where the dream is replayed. However, it is not handled or used by Mira in the way a tool would be; it functions as location rather than object. The final image mentions "the basilica" when the shadow-bird circles it, recharging its role as witness. Late arrival (past 50%) and passive presence lower the score; if introduced earlier and its architecture (panes, prisms) actively constrained Mira's approach, it would score higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dream recording is seeded in paragraph six ("priests invented dream recording"), demonstrated in paragraphs nine ("lantern…can store a flicker of a dream") and twelve (lantern records shadows' "jittering nightmares"), and becomes the pivotal mechanism at closure: Jalen's final dream is projected, Mira steps into it, and the recording enables the shadow's return. Setup, development (recording skittering shadows en route), and payoff (projecting and entering Jalen's dream) are all present. The concept narrows Mira's tactics (she must find the dream, not the shadow directly) and the mechanics (gem polishing to store dreams) are specific and irreplaceable. Cost is tied to the concept: she must leave part of herself in the light to transform the recording. Minor deduction for the phrase "transform the recording into a new shadow" (paragraph eighteen), which introduces ambiguity about whether she creates or retrieves, though the ending clarifies.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The stairway "that descends while ascending" appears in paragraph fifteen, causes vertigo ("stomach knots"), and is reprised in the final paragraph as Mira returns "through the stair that still descends while ascending." Setup and payoff bracket the climax. However, the attribute does not visibly alter Mira's tactics or choices—she simply endures the vertigo without cost or obstacle. The spatial paradox enriches atmosphere and ties to the theme of dual states (grief/recovery, flame/paper), but it remains ornamental rather than causal. If the stairway's paradox had forced a choice (e.g., climb only if you surrender certainty, or the vertigo threatens the lantern), it would score higher. As written, it constrains sensation but not action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>"Transform" anchors the entire climax: Mira transforms the lantern into a recorder (paragraph ten), the priests say she must "transform the recording into a new shadow" (paragraph eighteen), and at the spire she "steps into the projection" and "with each crease she forces a different grief to fit inside a crane," transforming paper and dream into the shadow-bird (paragraphs twenty-three to twenty-five). Setup (lantern transformation), development (learning the method), and payoff (the crane/shadow transformation) are all present. The action is irreplaceable—without transformation, no closure. The mechanics (folding grief, splitting into flame and paper) are specific and visible. Cost is high: she splits, weeps, and later transforms her craft into communal lanterns. The action defines options and redefines the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Gem polishing is introduced in paragraph nine ("spent months learning gem polishing from a blind jeweler"), demonstrated in paragraph ten ("turning rough moonstone into lenses that bite light cleanly"), and enables the lantern's recording function. The method shapes Mira's preparation and is causally necessary—without polished gems, no dream storage. However, gem polishing itself does not appear during the climax; instead, the already-polished gem functions passively in the lantern. Setup and development are present; closure participation is indirect (the polished gem enables the projection but is not actively worked at the spire). If Mira had needed to polish a gem mid-scene or adjust the lens under pressure, the method would score higher. As written, it is preparatory rather than tactically live at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The floating island tea garden is introduced in paragraph two, houses Mira's workbench and cranes, provides the scent of jasmine that pulls the island toward the basilica (paragraph eleven), and is the site of Jalen's vanishing (paragraph three) and Mira's final act (hanging new lanterns, paragraph twenty-nine). Setup and closure participation are clear. However, the garden does not constrain or enable a middle choice—Mira's journey through it (paragraph twelve, detached shadows skitter) is observational. The setting supplies atmosphere and origin but does not pressure tactics. If the tea shrubs or floating mechanics had forced a navigational choice or resource trade, it would score higher. Micro-setting (workbench, lacquered box) is present but underused during peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after the shadow detaches" is established in the opening line and anchors causality (Jalen vanished "the night his shadow tore loose," paragraph three). Mira's months of learning (paragraph nine) and her evening crane-folding routine (paragraph four) establish temporal depth. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions during the main action—the journey from tea garden to basilica to spire unfolds "at dawn" to "by noon" to the spire's top without a live clock that pressures tactics. The "after" sets context but does not escalate; it is backstory rather than countdown. If the shadow's retrieval window were closing or if time pressure forced a trade-off at the spire, the timeframe would score higher. As written, it frames rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mira's desire "to fold grief into origami cranes" is introduced in paragraph four, demonstrated nightly, and becomes the literal climactic action: "with each crease she forces a different grief to fit inside a crane" (paragraph twenty-four). Setup, development (the cranes "look perfect, but they sit dead on the shelf"), and payoff (the shadow transforms the crane into a bird) are all present. The motivation is embodied rather than declared, and the friction between her grief and the cranes' emptiness drives her journey to the basilica. Cost is visible: she weeps when the shadow finally returns, and she extends the act to "other mourners" (paragraph twenty-nine). Minor deduction: the phrase "cannot remember the weight of his laughter" gestures toward emotion rather than dramatizing a failed attempt or contradictory impulse in scene, keeping the desire slightly more told than shown during setup.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The tone of "luminous torment" is established in the opening ("sky…stays too bright, as if daylight refuses to mourn") and sustained through paradoxes: dead cranes on bright shelves, "jittering nightmares" recorded as light, Mira's fear that "Jalen is trapped in such brightness," and the climax where she splits into "flame and paper." The tone modulates with pressure—grief is compressed into craft, the basilica's cold rain tempers the brightness, and the final shadow-bird is "lightless light." The ending anchors the tone explicitly: "luminous torment made useful," though this phrase risks slight label-speak. The tone charges the final image (glowing lanterns that hold ache) and is coherent through turns. Minor deduction for the repetition of "luminous torment" in paragraphs thirteen and twenty-nine, which edges toward stock phrasing rather than allowing the image to resonate without the label.</comment>
