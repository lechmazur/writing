<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is consistently embodied through micro-choices (pacing UNBIND, splitting bundles, performing panic) that align with the vowed historian role. Interior texture remains specific and contradiction-laden—"benevolently ruthless" drives the peak beat where the narrator rips cord and hides evidence while performing hired panic. The "survivor voice" and bridge trauma anchor present stakes, though the bridge backstory feels slightly inert; it primes the vow but doesn't friction the climax directly. Embodied emotion is strong ("ribs still remembered," "cold air rose") and the final act of freeing the archive while staging theater for guards shows earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator sets the pawnless board on the ledge and begins writing "not of rulers but of fingertips," crystallizing the shift from staged actor to public historian with the cost of imprisonment and the risk undeniably felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered gestures (tapping finger, tugged sleeve, heel clicks) and the unbinding action reweights all prior observation into published testimony. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (palace, interregnum, whispering gallery, crisis actor role). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist descends, rips cords, and the guards close in. Cost is visible: imprisonment, the satchel handed off, and the public turn from bloodlust to lawful succession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: whispers "skate along curved stone" to reach the farthest balcony, enabling eavesdropping and the paced-word unlocking method, and the hidden latch responds to heel clicks as "whispered prayer." The pawnless chessboard recurs with shifting charge (heirloom, proof of belonging, field after battle, finally placed on the ledge as the frame for the new history). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the historian's attention: "cold air rose… smelling of paper and dried violets," "mosaics," "curved stone." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the gallery floor, archive descent, and closet imprisonment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving small-gesture testimony against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the vellum arrives ("Unbind the archive before midnight") and guards thunder overhead. One meaningful escalation: the protagonist's paced unlocking and cord-ripping under immediate threat narrows options and forecloses the loyalists' rewrite with visible cost (imprisonment, reliance on the child attendant). Agency is clear: the decision to descend, split bundles, and hide the satchel drives the reversal. The final cost—imprisonment traded for public disclosure—lands on the page when broadsheets quote the archive and the crowd shifts. Coincidence (the attendant's success) does not resolve but enables the earned turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "absence can glow," "missing handprint on a rail," the pawnless chessboard, and the final writing of "fingertips, sleeves, blinks, and footsteps, luminous in their absence." The core concept (nomadic penumbra, small gestures vs. rulers) integrates through the historian's choices without overt thesis. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: binding memory by "unbinding it from lies," reweighting the interregnum through the archive's survival and the shift from crisis actor to public scribe. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the emptiness of the board's front rank, the child attendant vanishing "between doorways"). No moralizing; the final image lets "luminous absence" charge prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent diction and perceptual signature: the narrator notices gestures ("finger tapping twice, a sleeve tugged down") and filters setting through historian's bias. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—compressed urgency when ripping cords, expansive reflection in the opening. Free indirect voice is clean; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous in their absence") but remains voice-consistent and purpose-driven for a self-aware scribe. No dialogue on the page to judge. Minor register watch: "swore to become the historian" and "luminous absence" read slightly literary for mid-crisis thought, but the effect coheres with the character's articulate, archival lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, action, or motif. Opening sentence anchors voice and stakes in one move. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Two minor loops: "the method my mother taught for secret markets, a pattern of walking that spells words, each turn and pause forming a letter" slightly restates itself; "I listened to courtiers trade rumors… then marked each speaker not by names but by gestures" could be tighter. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("absence can glow," "nomadic penumbra," "whispering gallery answered") though "loyal to no crown, casting shifting shadows across the mosaics" stacks metaphors without sharp image. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacks. Final line recharges the chessboard and "luminous absence" motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis actor / real survivor, whispering gallery acoustics, and paced-word unlocking feels specific and non-obvious. The chessboard missing pawns as both heirloom and symbolic frame for small-gesture history is purposeful. The interregnum premise is familiar but transformed through the historian-of-gestures lens and the tactical use of the gallery's architecture. The turn from hired performance to real archive liberation and the final reconfiguration as public scribe grow organically from established traits. Emotional truth anchors the originality; the piece avoids template plot and stock resolution. One derivative note: the "lone archivist vs. erasure" premise has strong genre precedent, but the walking-word method and the dual-identity staging add fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crisis actor / real survivor duality shapes the protagonist's core choice: performing panic for guards while using "real survivor voice" to guide the child attendant. The bridge trauma seeds the historian vow and the pawnless board heirloom, both active in closure. The character's decisions (descend, unbind, split bundles, stage theater) create all key turns. Present in opening, middle choice, and ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in three beats: dawn carry (heirloom proof), beside the archive opening ("field after battle, all pawns gone, kings exposed"), and final ledge placement as frame for the new writing. Its emptiness "reminded me to watch the little people first" and charges the closure image thematically. Functional reprise with cost, but the object constrains choice weakly—its main role is symbolic rather than tactical. Two gates (setup, closure); middle use is observational.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nomadic penumbra names the drifting court and loyalists who threaten the archive, shaping the immediate danger (guards, loyalists intending erasure). The concept pressures the protagonist's need for stealth and the child attendant's ability to vanish "between doorways." Present early, frames the threat in the middle, and the attendant's penumbra movement enables the satchel handoff at closure. Functional role in two beats but slightly swappable with "unstable factions."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" drives the peak beat: "I was benevolently ruthless again, ripping the cord, splitting the bundles into my coat and satchel, leaving nothing for the loyalists to burn." The trait enables the archive-splitting decision under time pressure and constrains the protagonist to choose preservation over completeness—visible cost in the partial handoff and reliance on the child. Present in opening stance, enacted at climax, implicit in closure. Cost and causal pressure are clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unbind is the hinge action: the vellum command "Unbind the archive before midnight" sets the ticking clock, the paced-word method unlocks the latch, the physical unbinding (ripping cords, splitting bundles) enacts the turn, and the thematic unbinding ("binding the interregnum to memory by unbinding it from lies") lands in the final line. Three beats with strong causal pressure; the ending would fail without this exact action. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on unbind.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The walking-word method ("a pattern of walking that spells words, each turn and pause forming a letter in the dust") appears once in the middle beat to unlock the archive latch. Mechanics are shown: "I paced UNBIND across the tiles, and the gallery answered, carrying my heel clicks as if they were whispered prayer, until the hidden catch loosened." Functional and specific, but late signal (~mid-story) and no return or reprise. Missing setup gate; present in development and implicitly in closure (the archive is opened). Causal work is real but single-use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery supplies acoustic eavesdropping ("a word breathed behind a column reached the farthest balcony"), enables the paced-word unlocking (heel clicks carry "as if whispered prayer"), and shelters the protagonist's "real survivor voice" to guide the child. Present early, constrains middle choices, and the ledge placement of the chessboard in the gallery frames closure. Three beats with direct tactical pressure; the story's mechanics would break in a different setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The interregnum creates the power vacuum ("no successor rose"), the drifting loyalists who threaten erasure, the midnight deadline on the vellum, and the ultimate resolution (lawful succession demanded after broadsheets publish). Time pressure is live: "Unbind the archive before midnight," "Footsteps thundered overhead," "the next night the city woke to broadsheets." The timeframe tightens decisions and alters final tactics (new council frees the protagonist). Setup, development, closure all hinge on interregnum instability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The historian vow ("I swore to become the historian of small gestures") drives the opening stance, the eavesdropping and gesture-marking in the gallery, the decision to descend and split the archive bundles, and the final act of writing "not of rulers but of fingertips, sleeves, blinks, and footsteps." Friction is visible: the vow conflicts with the hired crisis-actor role and risks imprisonment. Cost is paid (imprisonment, reliance on the child) and the motivation shapes all three gates with on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" modulates tone through recurring images: "absence can glow," "missing handprint on a rail," the pawnless chessboard, "empty throne room fill with light as if the missing prince were already a ghost," and the final "luminous in their absence." Tone is coherent through turns, tensioning the urgent archive rescue with elegiac diction. The final image charges prior absences with thematic weight and conceptual cost. Consistent register and cadence shift at closure elevate the effect.</comment>
