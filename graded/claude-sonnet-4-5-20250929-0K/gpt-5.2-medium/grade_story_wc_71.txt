<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's character is embodied through her perception—"creeping normality noticer," sensitivity to object placement—and her motives are clear throughout. Her final realization ("A house lives when it can recognize itself") is earned through repeated tactile experiences with the orris shard and displaced objects. The inadvertent profundity trait is shown credibly in action rather than told. Minor: some internal beats lean slightly toward label ("the conversations made a gentle heat") rather than fully embodied sensation, but the embodiment in handling objects and the orris shard's physical warmth grounds her experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (orris shard, displaced objects, houses awakening) and culminates in a pattern-break when neighbors gather and restore keepsakes, reweighting the dominant stake (understanding house aliveness) with visible cost (Mara releases the shard, "softening even the arguments that would come later"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara tests her theory by moving the clock and the house drains; closure lands on-page when she sanctifies the shard at the tide line and writes her new rule. Cost is legible: she surrenders the compass-object and accepts future friction ("arguments that would come later").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quiet bay, boardwalk, Alderwick House, and tide line are vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting (the orris shard in her pocket, teaspoons and saucers, the clock's alcove) directly constrains Mara's choices and charges the final image when she sets the shard on a flat stone. Sensory details—violets, saltgrass, iris note, floorboards softening—are filtered through Mara's attention and reflect her stake. The "streetlights daydream" anchors time poetically and recurs to bracket the night work, though the mechanism isn't strictly causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Mara tests displacement (clock experiment drains warmth, proving attention's role). Pressure tightens through escalation: solo cataloging → nightly visits with shard-compass → storm blackout communal gathering where keepsakes are returned. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to sanctify via object placement and ultimately releases the shard with visible cost (losing her compass, accepting future discord). One meaningful tightening via the clock beat narrows her hypothesis and raises stakes for the communal restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (aliveness as attention stored in matter; belonging through objects in conversation) emerges organically from Mara's tactile experiments and the communal keepsake restoration. The orris shard and displaced objects constrain choices and charge closure without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: releasing the hush sanctifies the street, and Mara's marginal rule ("move nothing without listening first") reframes the city as a conversation that can "burn quietly with belonging." The "hushed blaze" paradox anchors the piece without moralizing. Final image (shard on stone, hush spreading) reweights prior material with conceptual cost: the compass is gone, future friction is acknowledged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "the hour when the streetlights daydream," "a shard of hush slid into her palm," "arranging kindling for a fire that made no smoke." POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Mara notices squeaks, wall-scars, objects yearning). Diction remains within her sensory-metaphoric register under pressure. Minor: a few constructions edge toward elevated literariness ("compact quiet that burned gently," "hushed blaze") that slightly exceed vernacular grounding, but the pattern is taught early and serves the accumulative lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; imagery is dense and purposeful ("faint drag of meaning," "wall-scar that fit its frame"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor issues: a few near-paraphrases ("aliveness was not magic but attention, and attention could be stolen by careless hands" restates the theme slightly) and the phrase "she finally understood" slightly scaffolds the realization. The orris-shard beats are vivid and propulsive. No loops that obscure causality; clarity remains high. The prose sustains the hushed-blaze tone without overwriting, though figurative density is consistently high—acceptable here because the pattern is taught and supports the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of perfume-fixing craft, object displacement, and house aliveness is fresh and specific. Mara's profession (Harbor Estate cataloger) and inadvertent profundity are organic, not ornamental. The orris shard as both perfume anchor and hush-trap transforms the familiar haunted-house trope through tactile, sensory grounding. The communal restoration during the blackout and the final sanctification (releasing the shard to spread hush across the street) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk: the lyric register and conceptual density could alienate some readers, but the piece commits fully and the closure effect is legible. The "conversations made a gentle heat" metaphor is original and integral to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's noticing drives every major turn: recognizing house aliveness, identifying orris shard significance, testing displacement (clock experiment), using the shard as compass, and orchestrating communal restoration. Her perceptual trait is causal, not ornamental. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle beats (cataloging, testing), and closure (releasing shard, writing new rule). Cost: she surrenders the shard and accepts future friction. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orris shard appears in at least four beats: discovery in cedar box, carrying back to Alderwick, using as compass across multiple nights, and final sanctification at tide line. Its properties (trapping hush, growing heavy near displaced objects) enable Mara's tactics and constrain her search method. The ending hinges on releasing it, spreading hush across the street. Setup, development (compass use), and payoff (sanctification) all present with visible cost. Irreplaceable: no generic object could serve the perfume-anchor and hush-trap dual function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" shapes stakes (Mara seeks to understand aliveness-as-attention) and tactics (the shard flares when objects match their proper places, guiding her restoration work). It is handled physically ("slid into her palm," "grew heavy," "flared") and its mechanics matter to plot progression. Present in inciting beat (cedar box discovery), middle escalation (compass nights), and closure (releasing hush to spread across street). The concept is embodied rather than abstract, driving choices with tangible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is shown on-page ("A home is what its tables are thinking about"; "A house lives when it can recognize itself") and creates social friction (coworkers tease her) that isolates her, later validated when neighbors don't laugh at closure. The trait enables her insight but also marks her as odd, a visible tradeoff. Present in setup (coworker teasing), implied in middle work (solo nights), and payoff (communal validation). Functional but slightly replaceable—another perceptual quirk could serve similar purpose with minor edits. Mid-band for clear cost but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Sanctify" drives two major turns: Mara sanctifies Alderwick House by returning displaced objects (middle escalation, proving her theory), and sanctifies the orris shard itself at tide line (closure, releasing hush across the street). The action redefines her professional cataloging as ritualized restoration with conceptual weight. Present in setup (implied in her cataloging habit), explicit development ("she began to sanctify the place"), and closure (shard sanctification). The exact verb and its dual application—houses and the shard—anchor the thematic resonance. Strong integration with visible cost (shard released, future friction accepted).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is the method signaled early (Mara's cataloging work, noticing objects "carried a faint drag of meaning") and its mechanics shape every escalation beat: testing via clock displacement drains warmth, shard compass detects misplacement, communal keepsake return restores aliveness. The method is irreplaceable—no other means (dialogue, research, mystical vision) could generate the same tactile, embodied pressure. Present in setup (cataloging job, orris discovery), development (clock test, compass nights), and payoff (communal restoration, marginal rule: "move nothing without listening first"). High integration across all gates with visible cost (time, effort, acceptance of future arguments).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay provides spatial anchors (boardwalk, Alderwick House, dockside, tide line) and atmospheric pressure (spring storm knocks out power, forcing communal gathering). The setting constrains Mara's movements (cataloging foreclosed cottages, walking tide line) and supplies the final sanctification site (flat stone at tide line). Saltgrass, bay wind, and gulls filter through her perception. Present in setup (opening boardwalk walk), development (Alderwick overlooks bay), and payoff (tide-line sanctification). The storm complicates middle action, driving neighbors to gather. Strong but not fully indispensable—another coastal setting could serve with minor edits. Solid integration with purpose-driven detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" brackets the opening and closing, creating temporal bookends (evening → dawn) and reinforcing the hushed-blaze tone. The phrase anchors time poetically but does not tighten decisions or create clock pressure—Mara's nightly visits span "night after night" without urgency. The timeframe contributes atmosphere and lyric coherence but is not causal to escalation. Present in setup and closure (reprise "stopped dreaming and surrendered to morning") with mid-band thematic resonance. Functional but replaceable with another twilight marker; no visible cost tied to this exact phrase.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to understand why some houses feel alive" is dramatized from the opening (noticing aliveness since childhood) and drives every choice: cataloging objects, touching the orris shard, testing displacement, using shard as compass, orchestrating communal restoration. Her motivation is conflicted—professional duty versus personal curiosity—and escalates when the storm blackout forces communal action, validating her insight with visible cost (she releases the shard, loses her compass, accepts future friction). Present in setup, development (every escalation beat), and payoff (final realization and marginal rule). Strong integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" coheres through the entire piece: "compact quiet that burned gently," "arranging kindling for a fire that made no smoke," "a city can burn quietly with belonging." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet cataloging, tactile shard discovery, urgent clock test, communal lanternlight restoration, dawn release—while maintaining the paradox of warmth-within-silence. The final image ("hush...spreading like cool fragrance...softening even the arguments") charges closure by crystallizing the hushed-blaze as both gift and acceptance of future cost. Tone is integral, irreplaceable, and shapes every beat's texture and the ending's resonance. Exceptional integration.</comment>
