<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rina's motive ("to find where unused courage waits") shapes her return and repair actions, though the language borders on abstract. Her memory of the betrayal and the child is embodied through the pillbox ritual, but the internal contradiction remains understated—she moves through scenes with more symbolic clarity than messy self-conflict. The final choice to leave the pillbox and rebuild the chain feels earned by her prior causality, but the arc reads more as thematic illustration than a protagonist wrestling with contradictory impulses in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist, codes, silver hush recur and reweight). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Rina's act of leaving the pillbox on the beam and walking back down constitutes Charged Poise—options crystallize, the relay is mended, and the cost (her burned status, the agent's death) remains visible without full resolution on the page. The escalation proceeds through discovery of Elsi, repair of the radio, and the successful warning, tightening pressure once with a felt cost at the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff, mist, snow, tide cave, and the shed anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The pillbox and solder constrain Rina's repair tactics, and the snow codes shape the reunion beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mist as erasure, salt sting, sea wind masking frequency), filtered through Rina's spy-tradecraft priorities. The final image of the pillbox on the beam charges the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is fixing the relay/mending courage; signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Rina's discovery of Elsi's paralysis, the radio repair, and the broadcast that saves villages. Rina's agency drives each beat (codes, solder, frequency tuning), and the cost—her burned status unresolved, the pillbox left as vow—is legible on the page. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens, and the price shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of repair, betrayal-as-neighbor-to-mending, and courage's return emerges from the pillbox's repurposing, Rina's confession ritual, and Elsi's breath. No thesis statement; the salt-and-solder particulars charge the concept. The final image—pillbox as vow, descent to rebuild—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "Unused courage" risks abstraction but is anchored in Elsi's tuning and Rina's burn-sting, avoiding pure label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Rina; psychic distance is stable and apt. Diction—"vouchsafed," "prudently daring," "silver hush"—is elevated and voice-consistent, though at times it leans toward lyric formality that may distance immediacy. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven ("You came back" carries subtext). The perceptual signature (spy tradecraft: "scanned the snow the way a reader scans a page") is character-specific and maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most sentences advance. However, several lines carry faint scaffold or paraphrase loops: "betrayal and mending can be neighbors" / "broken things ever return to use" restates the core metaphor with minimal added pressure. "Silver hush" recurs four times, teaching a pattern but risking decorative saturation in middle beats. Figurative language in high-pressure beats (cave, radio tuning) remains concrete and legible, avoiding mixed metaphors. Propulsion is strong overall, with minor template cadence in the backstory paragraph ("She had come back… The Director had offered… Her motive was…").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pillbox-as-repair-kit twist and codes-in-snow mechanics offer fresh inflection on the burned-spy return premise. Rina's motive ("unused courage") and the salt/solder particulars personalize the frame, though the spy-redemption arc remains recognizable. Emotional truth is present in the child-versus-cover choice and Elsi's paralysis, avoiding template resolution. Risk-taking (accumulative lens, object repurposing) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, meriting minor uplift within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rina (burned spy) drives all key turns: returns to bluff, makes snow codes, repairs radio with solder, tunes frequency, walks back down. Present in setup (cliff path), middle (cave/Elsi), and closure (vow/descent). Choices alter tactics at each beat; her burned status and tradecraft constrain method. Cost is visible (unresolved agency rejection, pillbox left behind). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pillbox appears in setup (pocket, initials, windrose), middle (shown to Tomas, solder extracted for radio), and closure (left on beam as vow). Used in three distinct beats with evolving function: confession/kit/vow. Causal: solder enables repair; symbolic charge deepens at ending. Irreplaceable: initials and repurposing (cyanide→repair tools) anchor Rina's arc. Cost tied directly to pillbox's history (agent's death) and final relinquishment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fixing-what's-broken shapes dominant stake and tactics: Rina fixes relay (chain of couriers), radio (solder bridge), and Elsi's paralysis (example/sting). Present in setup (motive stated), middle (radio repair), closure (vow to rebuild chain). Drives multiple beats; options narrow around repair versus revenge. Visible cost: Rina's burns, agent's death unhealed. Strong integration but risks thematic echo in "fixing" language.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" appears as label in paragraph four ("prudently daring enough to risk pain only where it mattered") and enacted when Rina shows burns to Elsi ("prudently daring act"). One on-page action (salt on burns) with cost (sting steadies her, models courage). Setup and middle present; closure implied in vow. Trait constrains method (selective risk) but swappable with similar courage-under-discipline labels. Lyric reprise without strong mid-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vouchsafe (betray via false passphrase) backstory in paragraph thirteen drives Rina's burned status and guilt. Present in setup (files "scorched"), developed in memory beat (child saved, agent died), and closure cost (pillbox vow). One major turn (her return motive). However, the act is summarized, not dramatized on the page; the child/alley beat is told. Setup→closure reprise reweights but lacks middle dramatized beat. Mid-high band capped by summary-only treatment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Codes-in-snow mechanics signaled early (paragraph ten: three dents/furrow/circle), used in middle beat (Rina makes codes, Tomas reads and later sweeps misdirection codes for patrols), and shape closure (successful communication enables warning). Method constrains tactics (silent, readable by one person, erasable by mist). Causal: codes enable reunion and misdirect enemy. Specificity: dent/furrow/circle system is irreplaceable. Cost: mist threatens erasure, adding pressure. Strong setup→development→payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff/mist anchor all beats: cliff path (setup), shed/crest (codes), stone steps/tide cave (Elsi), beam (pillbox vow). Mist as erasure threat pressures code-making; cave hides Elsi and radio; bluff's verticality (descent at end) charges closure image. Environment constrains method (snow for codes, sea wind masks frequency). Micro-setting (pillbox on beam) charges final image. Setup→middle→closure; strong spatial choreography and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tilt toward spring" appears in opening and closing lines as lyric frame. No on-page time pressure or deadline; mist/dawn mark atmospheric passage but do not tighten decisions. Setup and closure present; middle absent. Swappable with other seasonal metaphors. Lyric reprise reweights tone but does not constrain tactics or escalate cost. Mid-low band: poetic but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rina's motive ("find where unused courage waits") stated in setup (paragraph five), tested in middle (Elsi's paralysis, Rina's salt-sting example), and answered in closure ("unused courage rise… wait no longer"). Shapes stakes (repair over revenge) and tactics (modeling courage). Friction: Rina's burned status versus agency rejection. Cost visible (unresolved with Director, pillbox left). Language risks abstraction ("unused courage") but dramatized through Elsi's breath and Rina's sting. Strong setup→development→payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs in setup (sea/mist), middle beats (deepens between Rina/Tomas, quiet outside cave), and closure (mist thins, "quiet silver hush" on descent). Tone modulates with pressure: hush as threat (erasure), refuge (cave), and resolution (dawn walk). Coherent through turns; charges final image by reweighting earlier threat as earned stillness. Four mentions risk saturation but serve accumulative lens. Strong lyric payoff at closure.</comment>
