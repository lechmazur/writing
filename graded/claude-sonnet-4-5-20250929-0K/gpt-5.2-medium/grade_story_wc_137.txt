<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior emerges through concrete micro-choices—volunteering despite skepticism, agreeing to sit with Jory, offering the logbook to Leena—and her "sympathetic skeptic" stance is embodied in action rather than declared. The closing realization ("not convinced of miracles yet certain of meaning") earns its weight through accumulated pressure. Minor slip: Jory and Leena's interiorities occasionally blend with Mara's perceptual filter without clear dramatized cues, and the phrase "courageously kind" reads as authorial labeling rather than discovered trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (basalt headland, open tower, whale migration). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each transcription session deepens the entangled-memory pattern until Leena's arrival crystallizes the "deliberate silence" at closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the blank space in the star chart reweights all prior grief with undeniable conceptual cost. One causal seam: the whales' surface intervals matching "the sums along the tile's rows" is asserted late without prior groundwork, creating a convenience link rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The open tower, basalt headland, brass instruments, and the tile itself form a coherent micro-setting. The tower's roofless exposure to "salt wind" and the moon path below pressure Mara's choices to stay and witness. The tile's ceramic coldness and the pinned pages as "prayer flags made of math" charge the final image. The whale migration supplies temporal urgency but remains more atmospheric than a constraint that alters on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether shared transcription can hold grief without swallowing it. Escalation proceeds through Mara's agreement to sit with Jory, then inviting Leena, each choice narrowing her skepticism and opening her to "other lives spilling through." The blank space that forms in the star chart is a meaningful tightening that forecloses easy answers with visible cost. The whale-interval alignment feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven, softening the final turn slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief as shared, unfinished music rather than solitary closure—emerges through the tile, logbook, and "unheard symphony" without stating a moral. The final image of pinned squares as borrowable silence reweights all prior particulars with quiet resonance. The piece resists tidy resolution, offering a "deliberate silence" as answer. One slip: "the sea somewhere to think" edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than grounded image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature—"sympathetic skeptic"—shapes selective attention (polished instruments, grid numbers, "knot tug inside her"). Diction matches her educated, skeptical stance. Leena's whispered line carries subtext without exposition. Minor filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("she saw," "she understood," "she realized") slightly dulls immediacy during a high-pressure sequence but does not collapse voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the long opening establishes voice, later beats compress under pressure. Information density is high—each line advances character or concept. Two frictions: the phrase "she was a sympathetic skeptic, the sort who would hold your grief like a lantern while insisting the dark was real" front-loads metaphor in a way that risks overwriting, and the clause "mixing with your own until you could not tell which ache belonged where" near closure edges toward abstraction. No loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magic-square-as-grief-instrument premise is fresh and fully committed; "entangled memories" as stored breath rather than fairy-tale magic transforms a familiar trope. The tower's purpose—sculpting reflection space—and the whale-interval mirroring add specificity. Risk: the long first sentence and sustained figuration ("unheard symphony," "prayer flags made of math") elevate without obscuring. One proximity note: "space for reflection" and "quiet chamber inside the mind" echo therapeutic-language templates, slightly reducing the piece's idiosyncrasy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara ("sympathetic skeptic") is established early, her skepticism constrains her opening stance, and her choices—agreeing to transcribe, inviting Leena, closing the logbook—drive all key turns. Her final state ("not convinced… yet certain") reweights the premise. Present in setup, development, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tile appears in beat one (Jory presses it into Mara's palm), beat two (transcription shifts patterns), beat three (Jory's confession links it to his sister), and the closure sequence (the star chart forms). Its ceramic coldness and number grid constrain how grief is held. Irreplaceable and causally active across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is named early and demonstrated when Mara's hand responds to "pauses, pressure, and breath" and when Leena's fingertip triggers "a memory… not hers." The concept shapes Mara's decision to continue transcribing and the formation of the blank space at closure. Present in setup and payoff; middle beat involvement is implicit rather than dramatized as a distinct choice-altering constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is stated in paragraph one but not tested with visible cost until Mara invites Leena ("kindness here meant bravery") and allows "other lives [to] spill through." That moment carries cost but the attribute itself is labeled rather than discovered through contradictory impulses. Setup present, payoff legible, middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transcription anchors the plot: Mara draws the grid, the pattern shifts in response, she and Jory transcribe together, then with Leena, and the star chart emerges. Each transcription session narrows options and raises stakes. The action is irreplaceable—without it, the tile's effects and the closure's "deliberate silence" vanish. Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" is signaled when the square shifts "through forgotten patterns in her own hand" and recurs when the star chart resembles Jory's sister's sailcloth drawing. The method constrains how the tile responds and enables the blank space to form. Present in setup and closure; its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated as altering a middle choice, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tower is introduced immediately, its open rooflessness and brass instruments establish atmosphere, and it supplies the railing for pinned pages and the spiral stairs Mara leads Leena up. The setting's exposure to whale song and its function as grief-holding architecture pressure Mara's decision to stay and share the practice. Present in all three gates and integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Whale migration frames the story ("each autumn during whale migration") and the whales surface "in intervals that matched the sums" and "breached in a slow procession as if turning pages" at closure. The timeframe supplies atmosphere and a loose clock but does not tighten Mara's decisions with urgency—she could transcribe over any span. Setup and payoff present; middle constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jory's stated goal ("sculpt space for reflection… where sorrow could be observed instead of swallowed") becomes Mara's motive when she agrees to sit with him and later opens the practice to Leena. The motivation is dramatized in her micro-choices and conflicts with her skepticism, creating friction. Present in setup, development, and closure; cost is felt when "other lives spill through."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" is introduced when Mara hears "a faint rhythm… as if an unheard symphony were tuning itself," returns when Leena hears "the same inner music," and charges the final image ("that quiet, unfinished symphony"). The tone modulates from skeptical to open without breaking coherence. Present in all three gates and reweights the closure image, though the metaphor is asserted rather than discovered through sensory particulars.</comment>
