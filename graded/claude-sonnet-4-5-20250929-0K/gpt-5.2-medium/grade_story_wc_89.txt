<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-driven motivation is embodied through scarred hands and steady paradox, and her willingness to transform shows contradictory impulses. The final choice to become a silver-limned hound is earned by causal build-up and forecloses her human identity with visible cost. However, Sable remains more symbol than pressuring presence—his patient gold eyes and not-quite-smoke outline are described but he exerts no dramatized resistance or complication until the corridor offer. Internal conflict is declared ("every part of her resists") rather than shown through micro-choices that layer want against fear in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Mira's metamorphosis into a hound is a Decisive Change with visible cost (loss of human body and keeper role). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through spice-scent mapping, bark shiver, and the corridor reveal, then delivering a cadence shift when she "lets it fall away like shed bark." Orientation anchors (who, where, phoenix timeframe) arrive within the first 100 words. One meaningful turn—Sable's demand for equality—tightens stakes and forecloses her return to human form, meeting the 600–800-word sufficiency standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard under permanent moonlight supplies concrete resources (star anise, cardamom, saffron) that enable the conjuring and the oldest tree opens to provide the corridor, directly constraining Mira's path. Spatial choreography is clear: pear trees, bowls among roots, bark, blossoms, corridor. Sensory detail (sweetness stinging lungs, sap scent, mist threaded with cinnamon) is purposeful and filtered through Mira's beast-whisperer senses. The setting charges the final image—two hounds running among blossoms under permanent moonlight—meeting the 9+ quick test for environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforge bond beyond death) is signaled in the opening beat and Mira's agency drives escalation: she crushes spices, lays the fortune, breathes the conjuration, and chooses transformation when Sable demands equality. The corridor offer is a meaningful tightening that narrows options—cross as equal or remain alone—and her choice to let the human body fall forecloses the keeper role with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the spice-breathing and bone-loosening deepen pressure toward the climax. Coincidence (orchard's appearance after phoenix) complicates setup but does not resolve; resolution arises from Mira's acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief as a bridge, metamorphosis as the price of crossing, and listening (not commanding) as the true gift. The fortune's instruction, spice conjuring, and final realization ("her gift was never only to command but to listen until two worlds leaned close enough to touch") build a resonant answer without thesis statement. The ending image—two hounds circling, bond "steadier than any sunrise"—reweights the opening's "paradoxically steady" grief and the moon-tugged ocean metaphor, offering a non-literal resolution. Subtext operates in Sable's rustle-of-leaves answer and the corridor as "space between moments," avoiding overt allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scarred hands, beast-language whisper, hearing heartbeats woven through dark) but diction drifts toward elevated/poetic register ("paradoxically steady," "cosmic intimacy," "silver breath held over the world") that sometimes feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The prose modulates at key beats (bones loosen, skin thins to mist, voice deepens to chord) to reflect transformation. Filter verbs ("she feels," "she realizes") appear but are not stacked densely enough to flatten immediacy. No dialogue on page to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character state or plot). However, several paraphrase loops and figurative stacks blunt momentum: "paradoxically steady" appears twice (opening and final beat), "the way the moon looks calm while it tugs oceans" and "her pulse remains paradoxically steady, keeping time for Sable as if it were a leash" restate the same metaphor, and "reluctantly, toward the moon" / "reluctant metamorphosis finishes" recycles the reluctance label. Stock phrases ("phoenix bonfire," "oldest tree," "permanent moonlight") repeat without reweighting. The closure image is vivid ("two hounds circle once, then run among the blossoms") and free of artifact, limiting deduction per the closure-priority rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes beast-whispering, grief-driven conjuring, and metamorphosis-as-cost into a specific arc: using rare spices to summon a dead hound under phoenix-triggered moonlight, then transforming to meet him as equal. The fortune-from-cookie detail and the orchard as "a place where animals and constellations trade secrets" offer fresh texture. However, the core beats (summoning the dead, paying with transformation, crossing a threshold together) follow a recognizable quest-for-reunion template. Transformation is earned but the emotional calculus (tired of silent graves, choosing vapor-form companionship) trends toward expected fantasy resolution rather than a morally ambiguous or surprising stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira, the beast whisperer, is present throughout and her scarred hands and throat-language create two key beats: she crushes spices to conjure (setup), speaks beast-language to Sable mid-story (development), and her final choice to transform and enter the corridor as his equal (closure participation) completes the arc. Her decisions drive all major turns. Causal pressure is strong: she initiates conjuring, accepts Sable's terms, and lets her body fall. The whisperer identity is irreplaceable—swapping it for "grieving woman" would remove the throat-language mechanic and the orchard's response to her gift. Cost is on-page (foregoing human form and keeper role). Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity push the score into the 7.5–8.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fortune appears early (phoenix bonfire scene), warms in her pocket (development beat), and she lays it on the bark to begin the conjuring (closure setup). It states the rule ("conjure the bridge with breath of spice; accept the shape the bridge asks for") that governs the entire plot. However, it is not handled or referenced in the climax itself—after being laid on bark it "dissolv[es] into sap" in a summary sentence at the end. Two solid beats (pocket warming, laying on bark) plus clear causal role (provides the conjuring instructions) meet the guideline, but the dissolving is told rather than dramatically weighted, and the fortune could be swapped for an overheard rhyme or vision with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, but lack of charged reprise and moderate swappability limit the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis is the core concept and shapes stakes explicitly: Mira "every part of her resists becoming anything else" yet nods toward transformation, her bones loosen into new geometry, her skin thins to mist, and she becomes a silver-limned hound. The concept alters tactics (she must choose between remaining human-and-alone or transforming-and-reuniting) and is paid off with visible cost (losing her old body "heavy with years and duties"). Setup is clear by the fortune's instruction ("accept the shape the bridge asks for"), development includes the bone-loosening beat and Sable's equality demand, and closure is the completed transformation. Causal pressure is high and the concept is irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5, specificity +0.7. No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Paradoxically steady" is introduced early ("her grief has made her paradoxically steady, the way the moon looks calm while it tugs oceans") and returns at the transformation beat ("her pulse remains paradoxically steady, keeping time for Sable as if it were a leash"). It enables her to proceed through the conjuring without collapse and serves as a thematic anchor (steadiness born of grief). However, the trait is label-driven and metaphor-illustrated rather than tested by a visible tradeoff—what does steadiness cost her, or prevent her from feeling? The attribute constrains her emotional range subtly but is not irreplaceable (swap "steady" for "numb" or "focused" with minor edits). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, mild causal enable +0.4, closure link (final "steadier than any sunrise") +0.8, but ornamental quality −0.6, swappability −0.5, and label-only use −0.3 pull it down.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Conjure is the major action: Mira crushes spices, lays the fortune, breathes in sweetness until it stings, breathes out Sable's name, and thereby summons him. The action drives the entire middle (spice-map, bark shiver, Sable's outline appears) and enables the corridor to open, which leads directly to the transformation and final reunion. Setup is clear (fortune instructs "conjure the bridge"), development spans multiple beats (crushing, breathing, scent-flaring), and the conjuring's success unlocks the climax. The action is irreplaceable and specific (spice-breath mechanic). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.4 (breathing until sweetness stings, lungs flare). No significant frictions.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—via the scent of rare spices—is signaled early (fortune mentions "breath of spice"), prepared mid-story (orchard offers star anise and cardamom, Mira adds saved saffron), and executed at the conjuring beat ("via the scent of rare spices mixed with saffron...breathing in until the sweetness stings"). The mechanics matter: the spices create "a map, pointing toward the oldest tree" and their scent enables the summoning. The method shapes two attempts (gathering, then breathing) and is paid off in the closure setup when "the spices flare in her lungs" during transformation. However, after the transformation the method is not revisited—no scent charges the final hound-run image. Early signal +0.7, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.6, but no closure reprise −0.4, and slight swappability (could use incantation or touch) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is established in the opening sentence, supplies resources (spices among roots, oldest tree, corridor of moonlit sap), and charges the final image (two hounds running among blossoms under that same permanent moonlight). The setting constrains choices: Mira must go to the oldest tree, the orchard "answers" by offering spices, and the tree opens to provide the corridor. Setup is immediate, development includes the spice-gathering and tree-opening beats, and closure participation is strong (hounds circling and running "under permanent moonlight" bookends the piece). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity (moonlight "thickens like milk," blossoms show "small, private universe") +0.7. No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the phoenix rises for the first time in a century" is mentioned in the opening and again as a distant cause ("the phoenix's last ashes still drift" in the corridor), framing the orchard's return. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Mira's actions are not racing against phoenix-cycle timing or any deadline. The timeframe is more world-building context than pressure mechanism. Setup is present (first sentence) but there is no middle development beat where the timeframe alters tactics, and closure mentions ashes but does not hinge on phoenix timing. Ornamental use −0.8, no middle development beat (missing gate) caps at 3.4, but early signal +0.5 and mild closure thematic echo +0.3 lift slightly. Swappability is high (could say "after a rare celestial event").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to reforge a bond beyond death—is stated early ("she has come to reforge a bond beyond death") and dramatized through her choices: she walks the orchard listening for pawsteps, conjures with saved funeral saffron, and ultimately sacrifices her human form to meet Sable as equal. The desire is conflicted ("every part of her resists becoming anything else" vs. "tired of graves that only speak back with silence") and the friction between want (reunion) and cost (transformation) drives the climax. Setup, development (conjuring scene), and closure (transformation and corridor entry) are all present. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.6, but one instance of telling ("she is tired of graves") rather than full embodiment −0.3, and slight template quality (grief-quest) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone of "cosmic intimacy" is coherent: the piece blends vast scale (phoenix, constellations, permanent moonlight, corridor "between moments") with intimate physical detail (contact "intimate as breath shared between planets," paws pressing, pulse as leash). The tone modulates appropriately—opening is elegiac and measured, middle intensifies as spices flare and bones loosen, and the ending shifts to companionable stillness ("two hounds circle once, then run"). The final image charges the tone by fusing cosmic setting (orchard under moonlight, phoenix ashes drifting) with intimate bond (two hounds, reforged steadiness). Setup is immediate, development maintains the balance across transformation beats, and closure delivers the tonal synthesis. Early signal +0.8, coherence across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.4, specificity (unique phrasing) +0.6. Minor penalty for occasional drift into abstraction ("space between moments," "promise that endings can be rewritten") −0.3.</comment>
