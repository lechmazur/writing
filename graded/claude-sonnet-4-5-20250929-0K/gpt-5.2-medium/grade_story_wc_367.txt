<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator displays a coherent internal logic—laughter that stirs storms, prophetic speech—with embodied contradictions: joy mixed with the "familiar chill of accident." Motivation for "steering light" is clear and drives key choices (redirecting the beam, creating shadows). However, interiority occasionally trends toward poetic abstraction ("liturgy of angles, salt, and mirth") rather than concrete micro-choices under duress, and the climactic flood-warning sequence lacks visible internal conflict or cost beyond "throat raw," limiting depth at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening clause. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: escalation unfolds via density increase (prophecy → storm → shadow-casting) and cadence shift at closure. A clear Decisive Change occurs on-page when the narrator shifts from accidental prophecy to deliberate signal-making ("tried to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"), with visible cost (throat raw, routine unbroken, promise to choose words carefully). Minor wobble: the closing return to laughter slightly undercuts the mayor's warning without re-establishing cost, creating a micro-ambiguity in the closure's finality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, glass wick, and emerald shutters are richly specific and constrain key choices: the narrator uses the wick's polished length to redirect light inward, and the paper cutouts bleed green into their fibers. Sensory detail (salt spray, raw throat, "wet ink") is purposeful and embodied. The post-newspaper coastal setting matters to both stakes and atmosphere. The wick's "total internal reflection" charges the climactic sequence, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint, though broader spatial choreography (harbor mouth, dunes, hill) remains slightly generic in visual anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—warning the coast before the flood—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator's accidental prophecy forces immediate action. The protagonist's agency (redirecting light, creating moving shadows) drives the reversal, and a visible cost (throat raw, routine "unbroken") appears. However, the mayor's clearing of streets and fishermen turning boats occur off-stage via summary, diluting on-page escalation at the climax. The tightening forecloses the path of careless prophecy with a promise to "choose words carefully," meeting the band guardrail for 7+, but the lack of on-page friction or tradeoff during the storm sequence caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ancient communication versus new unreliability, laughter as creative force—emerges through concrete images (newspaper cutouts, glass wick, green-stained fibers) without overt moralizing. The final exchange ("saving could not be an accident forever") and the narrator's return to laughter offer a resonant, non-literal answer: hope as an ongoing, imperfect steering practice rather than mastery. The interplay of prophecy, routine, and laughter coheres across the arc. Minor slip: the phrase "ancient shadows" in the narrator's self-diagnosis trends slightly toward abstraction, and the closing beat's thematic echo ("not to predict, but to keep steering light… until the coast learned to read hope") brushes near a thesis statement without quite crossing into sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic diction ("green spear," "liturgy of angles"), intimate idiom ("dropped coins… stamped with dates"), and selective focus on ritual and light. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during crisis (compressed syntax at the climax). However, elevated register ("congregants," "liturgy," "choreograph") pervades even high-pressure beats, reducing variability under stress. The mayor's brief dialogue is clean but generic. Purposeful lyricism is legible throughout, yet the uniformly ornate voice in both reflection and action moments slightly flattens urgency at the flood's arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (glass wick "drank flame," beam as "green spear") is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high in the climax (lantern housing opened, wick half-withdrawn, shadows cast). Template-cadence artifacts appear: "I + [past verb]" stems recur across adjacent lines in the storm sequence ("I opened," "I had preserved," "I tore," "I admitted"), creating mild scaffold. Minor synonym churn ("turned," "shifted," "redirected") and one paraphrase loop ("trying to deny what it had summoned, broke into a brighter peal, shadowed elation") slightly dull momentum. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction, but cumulative line-level drag prevents entry to high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper as storm herald whose laughter summons weather, glass wick used for total internal reflection, newspaper silhouettes as emergency signals—is specific and non-obvious. The post-print-media coastal setting and accidental prophecy transformed into deliberate choreography offer fresh angles on familiar disaster-warning tropes. The ending turn (careless prophecy → promise of careful words → renewed laughter as steering practice) feels earned in hindsight. Minor limitation: the core emotional arc (accidental power → responsible use) follows a recognizable template, and the lighthouse-keeper-as-guide role, while executed with flair, does not fully escape archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laughing storm herald appears in setup (opening paragraphs), drives middle choices (laughing at the thought that summons prophecy, choosing to "choreograph" the flood), and shapes closure (returning to laughter "to keep steering light"). Specific cost: throat raw, promise to mayor, routine unbroken. The character's core trait—laughter as causal force—constrains and enables all key beats. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in setup (description of "clear rod threaded with tiny bubbles"), drives the climactic beat (narrator slides it halfway out, uses its polished length to redirect light inward via total internal reflection), and is present at closure (implicit in "steering light through glass"). Handled physically across multiple beats, its unique optical property (internal reflection) is mechanically essential to the resolution. Cutouts bleed green light "into their fibers," charging the final image. Indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine of climbing, polishing, and laughing" frames the opening and recurs at closure ("my routine unbroken," return to laughter). It shapes the narrator's identity and the stakes (routine as sacred liturgy vs. careless prophecy disrupting it). However, the routine itself does not constrain middle choices; the narrator breaks routine to redirect light and create shadows. Resonant reprise reweights the stake (routine as enduring practice despite chaos), but causal pressure in the middle is weak. Lyric-resonance allowance applies.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is signaled early ("my jokes landed like dropped coins… stamped with dates"), drives the inciting turn (narrator laughs, accidentally declares flood prophecy, feels "familiar chill"), and recurs at closure (mayor warns saving "could not be an accident forever," narrator promises yet resumes laughter). Visible tradeoff: the trait forces immediate action and earns a cautionary promise. Specific constraint across beats, with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Steer" (light) appears in setup ("learned to steer that borrowed fire through total internal reflection"), drives the climax (narrator steers the beam through the wick, makes shadows "crawl toward the harbor mouth"), and anchors closure ("keep steering light through glass until the coast learned to read hope"). Major turns trace directly to this action: the protagonist's agency in redirecting light saves the town. High specificity and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is signaled in setup ("bending the glow along the wick… through total internal reflection"), its mechanics matter at climax ("slid the glass wick halfway out, using its polished length to catch the beam and redirect it inward, so the light ricocheted, again and again, trapped by reflection"), and the method shapes the ending outcome (moving shadows guide boats and mayor). The physics of the method constrain and enable the resolution. Slightly less visible at closure than earlier beats, but causal necessity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse appears in setup and pressures choices throughout: green shutters turned, tower location enables signal visibility, "stood in spray like a laughing sentinel." The setting's vertical structure (spiral stair, keeper's room, lantern housing) supplies tactical resources (newspaper stack, beam height). "Emerald" color charges the final image (cutouts "bled green light"). Environment constrains action (narrator must climb, housing must be opened) and the lighthouse's visibility saves the town. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "After the last print newspaper" is signaled in the opening and the post-media context motivates the stakes (villages "lost their papers," distrust of screens). The yellowed newspapers in the keeper's room supply the climactic tool (cutouts). However, the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or tactics during the storm sequence; the flood arrives on a plot clock, not a time constraint imposed by this specific era. Thematic presence is strong, but causal pressure on pacing is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is articulated at climax ("I admitted the truth, that I had only tried to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") and recurs at closure (narrator continues "steering light… until the coast learned to read hope"). The desire drives the newspaper-cutout tactic and the promise to the mayor. Dramatized through action (tearing silhouettes, redirecting beam), though the phrasing itself arrives as self-diagnosis rather than earlier friction between want and cost. Clear presence across beats with visible cost (throat raw, promise extracted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" modulates coherently: joy ("laughing until the clouds answered") tempered by dread ("familiar chill of accident"), intensified at climax ("my laughter… broke into a brighter peal, shadowed elation, because if the flood was coming I could at least choreograph it"), and sustained at closure (laughter resumes "not to predict, but to keep steering"). Tone charges the final image by reaffirming laughter as both risk and tool. Consistent across turns and present in the ending, though the label "shadowed elation" itself is announced mid-story rather than emerging organically from rhythm alone.</comment>
