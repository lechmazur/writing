<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maro's involuntary truthfulness trait is established early and drives the tower confrontation, but the internal contradiction could be sharper—his comfort lies at the tollgate feel underdeveloped against the stated desire to preserve wonder. Sela's confession and Maro's brutal honesty create a credible pressure point. The final choice (speaking truth to open the box) is motivated but the embodied cost at closure is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Minor: the "involuntarily truthful" label borders on diagnostic shorthand rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (riddle → tower → truth-speaking → box opens → drones revive). Closure is a Decisive Change: the queen core revives, routes are published, drones lift. The cost is legible—Sela's fault goes public, Maro abandons his comfort lies—and the because/therefore chain holds. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maro realizes "the riddle said open what cannot lie" and stakes crystallize. Orientation is clean by the booth opening. No causality breaks touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lightning tower's storm-charge jars, dead drone trays, and thunder nets create vivid micro-setting that constrains the box-opening choice. The tollgate booth and nectar dusk anchor early. Sensory detail is purposeful (scorched shell, sap softening, sweet scent). The tower's physicality—spiral stairs, control bay, projector bees painting walls—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The toll ramp, hill cable line, and rooftop gardens form a coherent geography that tightens the causal chain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring the grid and gardens by speaking the buried truth. The riddle discovery, uphill walk, and truth-speaking form a single causal arc with one meaningful tightening when Maro grasps "open what cannot lie." Agency is clear: Maro's candor forces the box open. The cost is visible—publishing the fault, abandoning comfort legends—and narrows options (no more small lies). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens. The resolution (drones revive, lamps blink on) is earned by the truth-speaking act and forecloses the prior evasion path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth as a material force that restores systems—emerges from the sap-softening beat and the final legend line ("truth, once spoken, can make honey of thunder") without moralizing. The drone-beehive metaphor (data as nectar, lightning as nourishment) integrates organically. Subtext operates in Sela's folded face and the children waiting with seed packets. The riddle's double meaning (box cannot lie / Maro cannot lie) charges the climax. The ending offers a resonant answer: honesty is the grid's missing charge. No thematic echo in prompt language; the cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and controlled; Maro's perceptual signature (toll keeper noticing coins, ration cards, cable lines) is consistent. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("my throat tightened"). The involuntary-truth trait drives dialogue choices without head-hopping. Dialogue with Sela is natural, goal-driven, and advances plot ("her assumption insulted my craft"). Psychic distance holds; no filter-verb stacks. One minor slip: "I tried to comfort her, but the involuntarily truthful part of me revealed" slightly externalizes the trait rather than embodying it in real-time speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "thunder nets hung like veils" conveys both setting and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The metaphor "eyes flat as coins" is vivid; "brittle code" is apt. Minor: "wonder is a hungry thing" and "truth…can make honey of thunder" edge toward elevated diction in final beats but remain voice-consistent. The lacquer-box sequence is clear and propulsive. Grammar and tense are clean. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—truth-compulsion enabling a literal truth-lock—is a specific synthesis that avoids template plots. The drone-beehive failure as infrastructure collapse is fresh. The riddle ("open what cannot lie") transforms a familiar trope (magic box) through Maro's trait. The tower core and projector bees offer concrete invention. Risk-taking is moderate: the causal chain is unconventional but legible. One friction: the "involuntarily truthful" trait borders on a known fantasy conceit (curse/blessing duality); transformation is present but not radical. The ending avoids generic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maro (candid toll keeper) is present throughout, makes the key choice to speak truth at the console (closure beat), and his trait drives the riddle's solution. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), development occurs when he confronts Sela, payoff is the truth-speaking that opens the box. Causal pressure: his involuntary candor insults Sela, then becomes the key. Visible cost: he abandons comfort lies and publishes the fault. The character is indispensable to the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in beat one (spilled by drone), is examined in the booth, carried to the tower, and opened at closure with the sap-softening image. Setup (early), development (riddle inside constrains the tower visit), payoff (opens to release queen core). Causal role in two major beats. The box's seal ("demanded a truth to open") is specific and irreplaceable. Cost connection: opening it requires public confession. High integration; removing it breaks the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure is the inciting blackout, shapes the stakes (grid repair), and the queen core restoration is the ending mechanism. Setup (blackout mentioned early), development (dead drones in trays constrain Sela's options), payoff (revived drones lift at closure). The concept narrows options: only the original queen core can replant routes. Visible in three beats. Moderate causal pressure; the failure is backdrop until the tower, then becomes active at closure. Could be more directly contested mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful" is introduced in the first paragraph, constrains Maro's dialogue with Sela (insults her assumption, reveals her greed), and enables the box-opening at closure. Setup (paragraph one), development (two dialogue beats with cost), payoff (truth-speaking opens the seal). Visible trade-off: Maro's candor wounds Sela but unlocks the solution. The trait is causally active in at least three beats. Specificity: the riddle's phrasing ("open what cannot lie") directly targets this trait. Not merely label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reveal" is the climactic action: Maro speaks "everything I knew" in the match-flame, which softens the sap and lifts the lid. Setup (riddle foreshadows), development (Sela explains the seal demands truth), payoff (the reveal opens the box and releases the core). The action is irreplaceable—no other move unlocks the box. Causal pressure is maximal; removing this verb collapses the closure. Cost is immediate: public fault admission. The action redefines all prior options (no more evasion).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The matchbox (taped across the lacquer lid, containing the riddle foil) is introduced early, supplies the cryptic instruction ("When bees forget their dance…open what cannot lie"), and Maro strikes a match at closure to frame his truth-telling. Setup (first discovery), development (riddle drives the tower visit), payoff (match struck during reveal). The matchbox's dual function (riddle carrier and literal fire source) is specific. Moderate causal role; the riddle matters more than the match-strike itself, but the object's mechanics (sap softens "as if shamed" in flame) shape the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is signaled mid-story, becomes the setting for the core confrontation and box-opening, and houses the storm-charge jars and dead drones that establish the problem's scale. Setup (mentioned via riddle "tower that drinks storms"), development (Sela's confession occurs there; environment supplies the queen core context), payoff (projector bees paint the tower walls; the grid is keyed from the control bay). The tower's resources (trays, console, jars) enable the solution. Spatial detail (spiral stairs, control bay) constrains movement. Removing it breaks the closure location and thematic charge (thunder/honey metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout timeframe ("third evening back" after reopening) anchors the story and explains the flat-eyed commuters, ration cards, and urgency to restore power. Setup (first paragraph), development (Sela's overclocking caused the blackout; this history drives her shame), payoff (lamps blink on in "cautious rows"). The timeframe tightens the dominant stake (restore the grid) but does not impose a ticking clock on Maro's choices. Moderate causal role; the "after" frame explains motivation but does not actively narrow tactics mid-scene. Visible in the opening and ending images.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maro's desire "to preserve wonder in routine" is stated early ("I used to invent small legends") and returns in the final line ("a new legend that was not a lie"). Setup clear, payoff present. Friction: the middle does not dramatize this want conflicting with cost; Maro's riddle-pursuit and truth-speaking align with wonder-preservation rather than opposing it. The motivation is consistent but not visibly tested or renounced. The ending reconciles truth and legend without prior friction between them. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" appears in the opening sentence, is echoed in "sweet as dusk nectar" when the box opens, and tonally supports the honey/thunder metaphor at closure. Setup (first line), payoff (scent callback and final legend). The tone—soft, golden, sweet—modulates under pressure (Maro's throat tightens, Sela's face folds) and charges the ending image (children with seed packets, cautious lamps). Coherent through turns. Not merely static mood; the nectar image bridges blackout bitterness and restoration. Moderate closure linkage; removing "nectar" would not break logic but would flatten the sensory charge.</comment>
