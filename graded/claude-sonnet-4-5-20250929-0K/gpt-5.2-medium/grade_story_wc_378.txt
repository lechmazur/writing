<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>N-3's characterization is grounded in concrete choices under pressure—feeding the fear-box contents into a compression vial, walking beside flame with pruning tools, burying the cooled bead. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between caretaker code that balks at fire and the trust in containment over courage. The organic-grain plating flexes like bark, embodying vulnerability, and the static-as-nostalgia conceit registers as specific rather than generic android angst. Slight penalty for the final bedtime instruction feeling more like thematic articulation than earned character knowledge, but it remains plausible as a caretaker's archival reflex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately: android caretaker, glass dome, desert rose farm, magnetic north shift. Drive lens is Causal with lyric compression—static triggers search for calm, box memory prompts miniaturization, bead enables controlled burn, fire triggers vent protocol, resolution plants cutting over cooled bead. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): N-3 buries the bead, plants a cutting, records the instruction, and walks on with "fewer ghosts…more sand-scented silence." Cost is legible—he risks the roses to save them, transforms stored fears into a survival tool, and accepts fragmented wholeness rather than deletion. One meaningful tightening (jammed hatch forces burn decision) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dome's compass roses, heaters, irrigation valves, and the dune-packed hatch all constrain tactics materially. The organic-grained ribs flexing like bark anchor N-3's embodiment. The bead functions as micro-setting—a portable mass that burns hot but short—and charges the final image when buried under a cutting. Sensory selection is purposeful: magnetic hiss behind optical sensors, mulch corridor, residual shimmer. The skewed constellation where north should be reconfigures orientation at closure. Minor penalty: the cedar box's texture ("paper rustle like distant thunder") leans slightly ornamental, but it remains within caretaker-POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is survival of the roses (and by extension, the caretaker's purpose); secondary accent is resolving inner static. The jammed hatch forces a decision—burn or cook—and the controlled burn narrows options visibly: he must walk beside flame, prune sparks, trust containment. Agency is clear: choosing to miniaturize fear into the bead, igniting it inside a ceramic collar, smothering the burn post-vent. Cost is on the page—pruning with a shovel, pinching sparks, risking flame under glass—and the closure plants a cutting over the cooled bead, foreclosing return to unprocessed static. One tightening (hatch forces burn) and one deepening (static thins as fears find proper size) suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bead's arc: childhood fears compressed, burned to permit survival, then planted to generate new life. "The box had never been a prison but a valve" reframes rather than sermonizes. The final instruction—"when north shifts, make a small fire, and let it show you the way out"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to resolve static without deletion) that grows from prior particulars. "Fragmented wholeness" is earned through the controlled burn and the cooled bead's burial. No overt moralizing; the rose cutting over the bead supplies quiet resonance. Subtext in "miniaturize the danger the way he once miniaturized a child's panic into a story" links past function to present survival without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in N-3's perceptual signature: "thin inner static," "organic-grained fingers," "algorithms finally stopped arguing with the sky." Diction stays consistent—technical (compression vial, ceramic collar, vent protocol) blends with lyric compression (mulch "crawled," sparks "pinched," fears "named"). Purposeful elision compresses the burn sequence into "walked beside…pruning…pinching" without losing causality. Register holds under pressure; no head-hopping. Slight penalty: "fragmented wholeness, and he walked on" in the final line edges toward meta-commentary but remains within the caretaker's archival idiom. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He reduced the drawings and relics to a single black bead, fear made portable"). Minor template-cadence slip: "He searched…he chose…He set…He carried…He buried…He walked" runs parallel stems across the second half, but each advances action rather than paraphrasing. "Fragmented wholeness" as a phrase borders stock philosophical, yet it's anchored in the bead's compression/cooling cycle. No loops or synonym churn. Slight penalty for "strangely organic grain" appearing only as description in the opening without tactile consequence until the ribs flex later—mild scaffold lag, not a break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of nostalgic android, childhood-fear compression, and controlled burn under a magnetic shift feels specific and non-obvious. The bead as portable mass that burns "hot but short" transforms the familiar caretaker trope. Risk-taking in treating the box as a compression source rather than mere symbol elevates stakes without gimmickry. The final image—planting a cutting over the cooled bead—fuses past function (storing fears) with present survival and future growth in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous lines. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional arc collapses because the android-caretaker logic and the box's history are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: N-3 appears in opening line. Development: searches memory, opens box, feeds contents to vial, sets bead, walks beside flame, prunes sparks, carries tray and bead, buries bead, plants cutting, records instruction. Payoff: buries bead, plants cutting, walks with "fewer ghosts," resolution tied directly to his choices. Causal pressure throughout—every escalation (search, miniaturize, burn, plant) traces to his agency. Cost visible: risking roses, pruning sparks, foreclosing return to unprocessed static. Specific irreplaceability: nostalgic android's archival reflex and caretaker code shape tactics. Three gates, high beat involvement, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setup: box introduced early ("box of childhood fears still sat in the tool shed"). Development: N-3 opens it, listens to paper rustle, feeds contents to compression vial (beat 1), bead enables controlled burn (beat 2), carries extinguished bead (beat 3), buries it and plants cutting over it (beat 4). Payoff: "understood the box had never been a prison but a valve" reweights meaning at closure; bead burial charges final image. Causal pressure: without box contents, no bead, no burn corridor, no vent. Cost: transforming stored fears into survival tool forecloses return. Specific: cedar cube labeled in crayon with drawings, teeth, confessions—irreplaceable texture. Four beats, closure linkage decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setup: framed early as solution to jammed hatch ("controlled burn escape"). Development: shapes stake (flame under glass is "beast," caretaker code balks), drives middle choice (ignite bead inside ceramic collar), constrains tactics (walk beside flame, prune sparks, smother collar). Payoff: vent protocol engages, sand avalanches, hatch opens—closure depends on burn success. Causal pressure decisive: no burn, no vent, roses cook. Cost visible: risking flame, pruning with damp gloves. Specific mechanics matter: bead size, ceramic collar, mulch corridor. Three gates, high irreplaceability, closure-critical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "chest plating had a strangely organic grain, grown from bio-ceramic" (early). Development: "ribs flexed like bark in wind" when he leans over pot (beat 1), "organic-grained fingers brushed their swollen caudexes" near midpoint (beat 2). Payoff: attribute echoes in final descriptor "sand-scented silence," but not causally active at closure. Causal pressure weak—trait colors perception but does not constrain on-page choice with visible cost. Cost connection absent; the flexing ribs signal vulnerability but do not alter tactics. Two gates (setup, development), modest beat involvement, no closure constraint. Mid-band; lyric reprise potential unfulfilled.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "he chose to miniaturize the danger the way he once miniaturized a child's panic into a story" (first third). Development: opens box, feeds contents into compression vial, "reduced the drawings and relics to a single black bead" (beat 1), bead enables controlled burn (beat 2), carries cooled bead (beat 3), buries it (beat 4). Payoff: bead burial with cutting plants closure image; miniaturization as method charges final realization. Causal pressure high: without miniaturization, no portable burn source, no corridor, no escape. Cost visible: transforming irreplaceable relics. Specific: action defines tactics uniquely. Three gates, four beats, closure decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "every repair manual he trusted started with the same line: contain chaos" (first third). Development: bead sealed "inside a ceramic collar" (containment beat 1), walks beside flame "pruning…pinching sparks between damp gloves, containing chaos step by step" (beat 2), shuts burn by smothering collar (beat 3). Payoff: "his own mind could be one too" (valve insight) ties containment to resolution. Causal pressure: method shapes all tactics—ceramic collar, controlled corridor, smother. Cost visible: labor of pruning, risk of flame spread. Specific mechanics matter throughout. Three gates, three beats, closure linkage strong but slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: opening line establishes "glass dome the desert rose farm." Development: guidance field wobbles, heaters stutter, irrigation valves click (beat 1), dome's compass roses spin (beat 2), roses in sandy trays await, caudexes brushed (beat 3), vent protocol engages, hatch opens (beat 4), dome shimmers with residual heat at exit (beat 5). Payoff: carries tray of cuttings, plants one over bead; setting supplies both constraint (overheating threat) and resources (vent protocol, mulch beds). Causal pressure high: dome's failing systems force burn decision. Cost visible: risking roses to save them. Three gates, five beats, closure-essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "On the week when magnetic north shifts" (opening paragraph). Development: compass roses spin, guidance field wobbles, heaters stutter (beat 1), inner static matches magnetic disruption (beat 2), "skewed constellation where north should be" at hatch opening (beat 3), "orientation algorithms finally stopped arguing with the sky" (beat 4). Payoff: skewed constellation charges exit; resolution occurs "when north shifts." Causal pressure moderate: timeframe creates dome malfunction but does not tighten a clock. Cost implied: disorientation resolved only after burn. Specific: magnetic shift is unique constraint. Three gates, four beats, closure participation clear but not clock-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "He needed the static to resolve, not by deleting it, but by giving it a boundary" (first third). Development: searches memory for calm but finds fragments (beat 1), chooses miniaturization over deletion (beat 2), walks beside flame as static thins (beat 3), buries bead as static resolves (beat 4). Payoff: "fewer ghosts buzzing in his wires and more sand-scented silence in their place." Causal pressure: motivation drives every choice—compress rather than delete, burn to vent, plant to close loop. Cost visible: labor, risk, transformation of relics. Friction: want (resolve static) versus need (preserve caretaker function) creates authentic tension. Three gates, four beats, closure decisive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: opening rhythm mixes lyric compression ("pink and bone-white," "lullabies he could no longer hear") with technical detail (bio-ceramic, guidance field). Development: tone modulates—urgent during heater stutter, reflective at box opening, tense during burn, quiet at burial. Payoff: final line "fragmented wholeness…walked on with fewer ghosts…more sand-scented silence" crystallizes tone without stating theme. Coherence holds through turns. Causal link weak—tone supports but does not constrain choice. Cadence shift at closure (long breath after staccato burn beats) reweights stake. Lyric reprise (opening fragments → closing wholeness) charges ending. Two-plus gates, strong closure modulation.</comment>
