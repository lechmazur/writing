<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interior guilt is embodied through the needle buzz as underwater crying, and the decision to follow the letters flows from that concrete pressure. The final choice—speaking the apology and accepting the "muted" guilt—forecloses his old stance with visible cost. However, the constellation-tattooist occupation remains ornamental; it seeds motifs but never constrains a choice. The emotional progression from haunted sessions to closure is legible, though the translator's voice and Dr. Sato's explanation arrive as exposition rather than discovered resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Lio speaks the apology, the firmware releases its stored need, and guilt becomes "muted enough to live with"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost). The drive lens is Causal/Situational Hybrid: letters prompt the quest, the amber activates the device, the tether and fold enable translation, and the apology triggers release. Orientation is swift (name, occupation, city, night within the first sentence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the translated cry becomes coordinates and "I am cold," narrowing options to confrontation. The cost—"heartbeat had been the static in every recording"—is felt but remains slightly abstract at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned observatory and laboratory shelves are vivid and purposeful, framing the lost-sounds collection as both archive and cathedral. The amber's warmth ("warm as skin") and the insect mid-flight supply tactile specificity that charges the tether moment. Spatial choreography is clear: alleys to hill, steel door to console, amber to port. The observatory ceiling "opening like night water" during the fold integrates setting into the climactic beat, though the city itself remains generic. The micro-setting (Lio's wrist, comet-tail ink) constrains the tether action and elevates Q3 eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the abandoned sister's cry—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the letters describe the device, escalates when Lio enters the lab, and peaks when the translation delivers coordinates and "I am cold." The tether action (drawing the comet tail, clipping the wire) is protagonist-driven and narrows options to confrontation. The cost is visible: "his own heartbeat had been the static" reweights his guilt, and the firmware's release marks irreversible closure. One meaningful deepening (the cry becomes words, not just sound) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: guilt as static, lost sounds as orbiting light, the fold as temporal return. The amber and tether literalize connection without allegory. The ending offers a resonant answer—guilt "muted enough to live with"—that resists tidy absolution and honors complexity. "Meteor hush" recurs with shifting weight: first as lid, then as closure's exhalation. The translated "I am cold" is specific, not abstract, and the firmware as haunted by "recordings of infants whose needs had been stored without answer" deepens the concept without sermonizing. No final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lio; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during the translation, wider during the letter exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent: sounds become tactile ("needle buzz sounded like a baby crying under water"), and celestial metaphors (meteor showers, starlight, comet tail) filter every image. The prose is distinct and controlled. However, Dr. Sato's explanation—"she had been gathering caretakers who carried similar failures in their bones"—reads as helpful-narrator exposition rather than dramatized discovery. Diction remains within Lio's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are purposefully mixed. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop: "meteor hush" recurs four times, "guilt" five times, and "lost sounds" three times without incremental pressure. The phrase "the laboratory of lost sounds" appears identically twice in close succession (letters mention it, then the door opens onto it), creating paraphrase drag. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the tether slacken") in the closure beat dulls immediacy slightly. No major artifacts or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattoos + lost-sounds archive + haunted firmware + temporal fold—is specific and non-obvious. The amber-as-key and tether-via-fresh-ink are fresh inflections that grow from prior particulars (Lio's occupation, the insect suspended mid-flight). The "haunted firmware" storing unanswered infant needs is conceptually bold and avoids stock ghost-tech. Emotional truth (guilt as orbiting static, apology enabling release) grounds the speculative frame. Risk-taking (the fold, the lab's cathedral of reels and drives) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications to the meteor-hush ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's choices create key turns: ignoring the letters initially, then closing the shop to follow them, drawing the comet-tail ink, and speaking the apology aloud. Each decision alters tactics and narrows options. The character is present in all three gates (setup, middle quest, closure apology) and drives escalation. The occupation (constellation tattooist) seeds motifs but does not constrain choices; the causal work flows from his guilt and agency, not the tattooing itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amber appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the false drawer with setup detail (warm, insect mid-flight), activation at the console port (insect flashes, unit wakes), and cooling at closure after the firmware releases. Each use shifts its function: clue, key, then spent talisman. The amber enables the translation and is causally indispensable. Specificity (warmth, suspended flight, cooling) charges each reprise. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Haunted firmware shapes stakes from the midpoint onward: it translates cries into coordinates, stores unanswered infant needs, and releases them only when Lio apologizes. The concept alters tactics (requiring the tether to "something that remembered starlight") and drives the climactic translation. The firmware's "voice" and its final release are on-page, not merely thematic. The element is causally active in at least two beats (translation, release) and essential to closure. High irreplaceability: no generic translator would carry the haunted-storage logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The translation attribute enables the core turn: baby cries become words ("I am cold") and coordinates, reweighting Lio's understanding. The device's mechanics (tether to starlight, amber activation) constrain the attempt and impose visible costs (drawing fresh ink, waiting for the fold). Translation is causally active in the climax and drives the apology that triggers release. Present in all three gates with clear development in the middle (tether setup) and payoff (cry becomes sentence). Strong integration with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tether action—drawing the comet-tail ink, clipping wire to the translator—enables the translation and is Lio's pivotal on-page choice under pressure. It appears in two distinct beats: preparation (drawing the line) and execution (as the fold arrives). The tether cannot be swapped; it literalizes the connection between Lio's fresh constellation and the device, fulfilling the "something that remembered starlight" constraint. Causal pressure is high, and the action shapes the closure (the tether slackens when the firmware releases). Essential to escalation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The letters are discovered early (antique wardrobe, false drawer) and their content drives Lio's quest: they name him, describe the device, and map the route to the observatory. The method appears in setup and middle development (following the map through alleys). However, the letters do not impose a visible cost or constrain the climax directly; they function as a quest trigger. Functional across two gates but replaceable with minor edits (a phone call, a flyer). Mid-band: purposeful but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds provides the device, the listening console, and Dr. Sato, all essential to the translation. The shelves of reels and drives are described with purpose ("cathedral," glass-backed hum) and the observatory ceiling "opening like night water" charges the fold moment. The setting enables the climax and shapes the ending image. Present in all three gates: setup (the map), middle (arrival, console), and payoff (the fold, the speaker's exhalation). Strong causal role and closure linkage. The lab is irreplaceable; Lio cannot access the device elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when time folds in on itself" is signaled early (insect "as if time had folded") and becomes the enabling condition for the translation: Dr. Sato says "the fold was near" and as it arrives "the shelves sighed, the observatory ceiling seemed to open." The fold tightens the moment—Lio must act now—and allows the past cry to return. Present in setup (amber description), middle (Dr. Sato's timing), and payoff (fold arrival triggers translation). However, the fold itself is passive (it happens to Lio) rather than a constraint he must work around. Functional across gates with moderate causal pressure, but Lio does not negotiate the timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lio's motivation—to hush the dissonance of old guilt—is embodied from the opening (needle buzz as underwater crying, "lid pressed hard over a boiling pot") and drives every choice: ignoring the letters initially, then closing the shop, following the map, drawing the tether, and speaking the apology. The desire is conflicted (he "tried to ignore it") and the cost is visible: confronting "his own heartbeat had been the static" and accepting guilt "muted enough to live with." Motivation is dramatized across all three gates and shapes the closure with felt trade-off. High integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meteor hush operates as recurring motif and tonal anchor: first as false peace ("less like peace and more like a lid"), then as the lullaby's transformation, and finally as the closure exhalation ("softened into breath, then into the meteor hush that follows a falling star"). Tone modulates with pressure: quiet guilt early, cathedral solemnity in the lab, then release at the end. The hush charges the final image and reweights prior material. Coherent through turns, present in setup and payoff, with clear thematic reprise. Strong lyric integration, though mid-scene tone is less distinct.</comment>
