<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is consistently rooted in grief and her systematic, inventive personality. Her micro-choices under pressure—kneeling, adjusting the glass eyes, choosing to speak rather than run—embody contradictory impulses (tenderness and fury, longing and analytical restraint). The final choice to build a spellwork bridge and accept Orren as "reachable, though not retrievable" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of forced resolution with visible emotional cost. Minor weakness: some interiority leans toward abstraction ("a number between integers") rather than fully embodied perception, but it remains character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory pattern (the dripping intervals), ritual alignment (glass eyes on mosaic), and the incremental revelation of Orren's state. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lysa accepts that "love can continue without resolution," visibly paid by her repaired tile and carried optimism. The axiom she reaches reweights the dominant stake (ambiguous loss) with felt cost—she walks home without her brother but with a theorem that restructures grief. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly particular (stone branches, quartz pear, calcite trees, dripping stalactites as clock and nourishment) and constrains Lysa's conjuration method. The mosaic stepping stone functions as micro-setting: its chipped triangles become coordinates that she uses to open the seam of light. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens (conjurer noticing rhythm, patterns, alignments). The environment charges the final image when she repairs one tile with pear quartz, embedding her discovery into the physical world. Spatial choreography (kneeling, setting eyes, turning the ladder into a bridge) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding/reaching Orren within ambiguous loss) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the sequence reaches thirteen and the seam opens; Lysa's choice not to run but to "demand proof" and adjust the glass eyes introduces a meaningful trade-off between impulse and discipline. The final tightening occurs when she turns the ladder into a spellwork bridge, an act of agency that transforms grief into structure; Orren's refusal to cross and her acceptance of "reachable, though not retrievable" forecloses retrieval with visible emotional cost. One credible deepening that narrows options under the Accumulative lens suffices here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (unfinished stories, love without resolution, the mathematics of grief) emerges organically from Lysa's conjuration, the mosaic's broken proof, and the final axiom without thesis statement. The glass eyes and mosaic function as motifs that recur with reweighted meaning: initially tools for alignment, they become the bridge between longing and acceptance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"the unknown is not the same as the empty"—that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through image (the outline that leans but does not cross, the repaired tile) and the theorem she carries like a lantern. No diagnostic label-speak or overt allegory weakens the effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Lysa's perceptual signature: she notices rhythms, coordinates, patterns, and emotional equations. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dovetail," "bruise," "theorem," "axiom") with vocabulary fitting a secretive conjurer's worldview. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the seam-opening, slightly pulled back for the final reflection. Minor weakness: one phrase ("a door neither shut nor open") edges toward generic metaphor, and "tenderly furious" risks oxymoron without full embodiment. No head-hopping; interior access remains consistent. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and high information density (most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot). Figurative language is purposeful but dense: "hearts that felt like scattered seeds," "laugh close enough to bruise," "buried optimism like a lantern under her coat." In the peak beat (seam opening, Orren's outline), metaphoric layering ("a curve, a probability," "a fold of the cavern where time did not settle") risks slight opacity under pressure. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and pronoun references are clean. One small filter-verb cluster ("saw," "heard," "understood") in the seam sequence slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of conjuration-as-mathematics, grief-as-unsolved-proof, and the cavern orchard as both setting and metaphysical space feels specific and non-obvious. The mosaic stepping stone as spell anchor, the taxidermist's glass eyes as lenses for alignment, and the ladder-turned-bridge are fresh integrations that transform familiar "lost sibling" material. The final axiom ("love can continue without resolution") is earned through concrete particulars rather than assertion. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and metaphysical fold ("a third state, like a number between integers") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the "mathematics of emotion" frame edges toward abstraction but is saved by embodied conjuration beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa (secretive conjurer) is present throughout; her choices to kneel, set the glass eyes, whisper conjuration, adjust for proof rather than impulse, build the spellwork bridge, and accept Orren's non-crossing all create key turns. Early signal (opening paragraph), multiple beats (listening, kneeling, speaking lullaby, building bridge, repairing tile), causal pressure (her method opens the seam), and closure linkage (her final theorem and act of repair) all present. Irreplaceability high: her conjurer identity and inventive patience are inseparable from the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass eye pair introduced early (satchel description), used in two distinct beats (set on tile as lenses, adjusted to resolve Orren's laugh into a curve), and their function (aligning spells to what is missing) directly enables the conjuration. They shape the middle attempt and contribute to closure by translating Orren's touch "into numbers that told her he was reachable." Specificity (taxidermist's origin, cloudy green veined with gold, from a nameless fox) adds texture. Cost connection: they embody her method of measuring absence. Not merely ornamental; plot would fail without them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss (Orren's disappearance with no body, no farewell, "a door neither shut nor open") is the dominant stake from the opening. It shapes Lysa's tactics (conjuration to prove rather than retrieve), charges her emotional state ("tenderly furious at every equation that refused to balance"), and is directly confronted at closure when she discovers the "third state" and accepts "reachable, though not retrievable." The final axiom ("the unknown is not the same as the empty") explicitly reweights the concept with visible emotional cost. Early signal, causal pressure, closure centrality all strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is seeded early (childhood reeds into clicking abacuses, now turning patience toward mathematics of emotion) and enables on-page action: her method of using the mosaic pattern and glass eyes, building the spellwork bridge from "rungs of remembered days." The trait constrains her choice not to rush through the seam but to demand proof. Visible trade-off: gentleness delays reunion but earns understanding. Present in setup, middle (conjuration method), and closure (repaired tile as quiet invention). Not label-only; the attribute drives tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears once, explicitly, when Lysa's heart "began to dovetail with the pattern" after setting the glass eyes and whispering conjuration—a turning point where her internal state aligns with the mosaic coordinates and enables the seam to open. It marks the transition from preparation to breakthrough. However, it is summary-level (told alignment) rather than dramatized through distinct on-page beats. Present in setup (dovetail moment triggers sequence) and shapes closure (alignment persists as she builds the bridge), but the action itself is compressed into one sentence. Functional but somewhat abstract; more concrete dramatization of the dovetailing process would elevate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone introduced early (Orren laid it, its chipped triangles form "repeating triangles like a half solved proof"), used as the conjuration anchor (Lysa sets glass eyes on it, coordinates emerge, sequence taps out), and directly opens the seam. It returns at closure when she repairs one tile with pear quartz, embedding her discovery into the physical method. Three beats (setup/suspicion, conjuration anchor, final repair), causal pressure (the pattern enables contact), closure linkage (repaired tile symbolizes incomplete but continuing connection). The mechanics—chipped patterns as map/proof—matter and are irreplaceable. Specificity (Orren's hands, triangles, fractures) charges its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cavern orchard present throughout: stone branches with apples, dripping stalactites that nourish and mark time (midnight drop, measured intervals matching triangles), calcite trees framing the seam, quartz pear for the final tile repair. The setting supplies both atmosphere and resources that constrain Lysa's method (she listens for the drop, counts intervals, uses the mosaic path, harvests quartz for repair). Micro-setting (body anchored by kneeling, mosaic underfoot) alters tactics. Spatial choreography clear (roots, ladder against pear, central path). The orchard "responds as if it remembered sound," charging the conjuration. Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the orchard grew silent beneath the moon," Lysa listens for "the last drop that would mark midnight") is signaled early and tracked once (sequence reaches thirteen, seam opens). The midnight marker creates a ritual deadline that tightens the conjuration window, but the clock is not continuously live—no escalating pressure from time running out or immediate consequence if she misses it. Functional setup and contributes to tone (nocturnal, liminal), but the temporal constraint does not visibly alter her later choices or pace. Lyric reprise in mood (silence returns at end) but no mechanical payoff. Mid-band for setup + thematic color without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To understand the mathematics of emotion" is seeded early (Lysa believes feelings have rhythms that can be measured, turns patience toward emotional equations), dramatized in her method (counting drops, coordinates, curve of Orren's laugh as probability), and tested when the curve suggests "not death, not life, but a third state" and she must choose whether to name it or speak to it. Friction between want (retrieval) and cost (forcing an answer the world hasn't given) drives her final choice. The theorem she reaches at closure directly addresses the motivation with visible emotional cost. Multiple beats; causal pressure; closure centrality strong. Slightly abstract in phrasing but embodied through conjuration acts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Buried optimism" is present early (Lysa's belief that if longing can be counted, hope might be proved) and modulates with pressure: tender fury while conjuring, restraint when tempted to run, quiet satisfaction when building the bridge, and finally explicit when she walks home "carrying buried optimism like a lantern under her coat." Tone charges the final image by literalizing the metaphor as both concealed and sustaining. Coherent through turns (grief, discipline, acceptance) without flattening into single static mood. The ending reprise reweights the opening stance with cost (she leaves without Orren but with a theorem). Strong thematic and imagistic integration.</comment>
