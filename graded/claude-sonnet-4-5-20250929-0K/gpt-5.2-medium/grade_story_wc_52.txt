<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"inventory sorrow the way she once counted meat cubes"—and her motivations cohere around practical grief work. The embodied emotion is strong: "silence... pacing like a cat in corners," "pressed the crystals into fresh-cut grooves." Internal contradiction surfaces in "love could be both duty and release," and the final micro-choice to "build hands that open" is earned by the carving process. Minor slip: the phrase "hauntingly practical" edges toward label-speak, but it's dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Miriam, loft, post-Jory death) arrive by ~60 words. The piece accumulates via three carved lessons, each deepening her stance, and closes with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she lifts the panel into light, tastes "bitterness and sweetness together," and settles the lesson "what is here will go, so build hands that open"—a crystallization of grief as work with visible cost (the seven months, the empty cage, the deliberate containment). The cadence shift from rain-stitched opening to ember-glow ending reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible in the final image: she lets the lesson settle rather than claiming resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loft setting (rain-beaded skylight, single burner, worktable) constrains action: steam from the kettle activates the crystals, the skylight frames rust-hued light that charges the final image. The ash wood blank functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats (outline, channel-cutting, oil-sealing, lifting into light). Sensory details—"wet metal and tea leaves," "rust hued peace"—filter through Miriam's professional attention (lion tamer's widow, gate-latching precision). Spatial choreography is clean; the environment shapes choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming grief into teachable form, signaled early ("harvest lessons from loss"). Pressure tightens through the kettle's boil timeframe and three carved lessons, each narrowing her options from raw grief to deliberate containment. Agency is renunciation and construction: she chooses what to preserve and how, foreclosing passive mourning. The final act—lifting the panel, drinking tea—earns closure via visible cost: "what is here will go, so build hands that open" reconfigures her stance with the panel as proof. No antagonist needed; the accumulative design coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the crystals, the carved channels, the empty travel cage. The piece asks how to honor the dead through practical craft, and the ending offers a resonant answer in image—"the circle glow like an ember refusing to die"—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: "his fingers opening, palm up, offering calm as a tangible object." The "rust hued peace" and "bitterness and sweetness together" avoid sentimentality. The lessons are earned through specific memory and action, not asserted. The final line reweights prior material: "build hands that open" synthesizes duty, release, and forward motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "grief had made her hauntingly practical," "time was always measured in cues and breath holds." Diction is consistent—circus-trained precision mixed with lyric compression ("rain stitched," "rust hued")—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Minor slip: "both things that were here and gone in the same breath" and similar phrases occasionally edge toward writerly intrusion, but the voice remains coherent. No dialogue to evaluate. Elision (Jory's death summarized, accident details compressed) is purposeful and charges the present work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and varied sentence structure; opening "Rain stitched the skylight" and closing "ember refusing to die" frame effectively. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, emotion, theme). Minor artifacts: "here and gone" recurs three times in similar phrasing without taught pattern payoff at closure, trending toward loop (−0.3). "Rust hued" appears twice in close proximity. A few filter verbs ("she told herself," "she understood") dull immediacy in mid-beats. Figurative language (steam/crystals, ember/circle) is coherent and supports closure, avoiding muddle. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the recurrence and filters prevent highest band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystallized-time mechanic offers a fresh synthesis: magical-realist tool meets occupational grief (lion tamer's widow carving lessons). The premise avoids template plotting; the transformation of circus time-keeping into deliberate second-counting is specific. Emotional truth anchors the fantastical element: "Do not close your fist around fear" and "always leave room to fail safely" feel earned rather than convenient. Minor swappability: another craft or medium could carry similar beats with adjustments. The ending's "ember refusing to die" is resonant but not entirely surprising given the piece's metaphoric consistency. Risk-taking in blending lyric compression with magical-realist procedure elevates within band (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lion tamer's widow shapes the entire frame: her occupational knowledge (gate-latching, meat-counting, reading animals) informs the carving process and the lessons she extracts. Present in setup (seven months widowed), drives middle beats (carving channels, sealing with oil), and charges closure (lifting the panel as trainer). Decisions alter tactics: what to teach, how to contain memory. Visible cost: the empty travel cage, the deliberate containment of grief. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ash wood blank appears early ("On the worktable lay an ash wood carving blank"), is handled across multiple beats (tracing circle, cutting channels, sprinkling crystals, sealing with oil, lifting into light), and is present in the closure image ("the circle glow like an ember"). Its transformation from "pale and undecided" to finished panel tracks Miriam's arc. Cost: the labor, the choice of what to preserve. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; irreplaceability moderate (another material could serve, but ash wood's pale neutrality fits the blank-slate metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is stated explicitly multiple times and structures the stakes: "both things that were here and gone in the same breath," "love could be both duty and release, here and gone." It shapes her choice to contain transient memory in permanent form and charges the final lesson: "what is here will go, so build hands that open." Present in setup (Jory's death), middle (crystallized time captures fleeting thought), and closure (the lesson settles). Cost: accepting impermanence. Moderate swappability (another transience phrase could work), but the specific phrasing drives the carving logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is named early ("Grief had made her hauntingly practical: she could inventory sorrow") and dramatized through her methodical carving, crystal use, and lesson extraction. It enables the on-page action (measuring, containing, sealing) with visible cost: the suppression of raw emotion in favor of craft. Present in setup and middle, implicit at closure. Swappability moderate (another grief-management trait could serve). Label-only at first mention (−0.3), but subsequent beats show the tradeoff: control over catharsis.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Contain" drives the entire narrative engine: she learned to "contain a memory by pressing the crystals into fresh-cut grooves and sealing them with oil." Setup early, enables all three middle beats (each lesson contained in a channel), and shapes closure ("the panel would hang... as a quiet trainer, teaching"). Visible cost: grief transformed into portable pedagogy, foreclosing personal catharsis. Irreplaceable: no other action fits the crystallized-time mechanic and the lion-taming metaphor (cage, control, containment) as precisely. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystallized time is introduced early ("A perfumer friend had sent her a jar of clear crystals that formed only in steam, calling them crystallized time"), its mechanics explained ("each grain grew around whatever thought you held when the water turned to air"), and used across three beats (one per lesson). It enables the method of containment and charges the closure: "watched the crystals on the carving go clear again." Cost: the reliance on this fragile, steam-dependent process mirrors grief's volatility. Swappability low; the mechanic is specific and integrated with the timeframe (kettle boil).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft anchors who/where by ~30 words and recurs: "Rain stitched the skylight," "the rain on the skylight ticked like soft applause," "the rain kept beading and sliding." It supplies atmosphere (rust-hued light) and frames the work (single burner beneath skylight for kettle). Closure: she lifts the carving "into the light." Moderate constraint: the skylight provides the rust-hued illumination that charges the final image. Could be replaced by another intimate workspace with minor edits, but the rain/rust/peace triad coheres thematically. Present in setup, middle texture, and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "while the kettle boils" is stated explicitly ("While the kettle boils, she told herself, you can do one honest thing") and tracked: kettle murmur, steam rises, kettle whistle. It tightens the work into a single pressured window and enables the crystallized-time mechanic (steam activates crystals). Present in setup, middle (three lessons before whistle), and closure (kettle reached whistle, she poured tea). Cost: the urgency to complete before the moment passes. Swappability moderate (another short timer could work), but the steam/crystal interaction requires boiling water.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is named early ("she had decided to harvest lessons from loss instead of letting it rot") and dramatized through the carving of three specific lessons. Friction: the desire to honor Jory conflicts with the cost of containment (suppressing raw grief, accepting "here and gone"). Present in setup (decision stated), drives all middle beats (each lesson extracted), and resolves at closure: "knew the panel would hang... teaching newcomers that grief can be worked, minute by minute." Visible cost: the panel as substitute for mourning. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Rust hued peace" appears twice: "rust hued light" (opening) and "rust hued peace that let her breathe without permission" (middle). Tone is coherent—elegiac, measured, practical—and modulates with pressure: rain imagery, steam murmur, soft applause, ember glow. The tone charges the final image: "bitterness and sweetness together," "ember refusing to die." Swappability low for the exact phrase, but the elegiac register could be achieved with other color/mood pairings. Present in setup and middle; implicit at closure through the ember image. Cost: the peace is earned through deliberate containment, not resolution.</comment>
