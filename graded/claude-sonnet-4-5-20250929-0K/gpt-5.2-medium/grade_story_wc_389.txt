<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli and Mara both exhibit contradiction and agency: Eli's "variant allegiance" (reason vs. mysticism) drives his choices, and both commit to their final collaboration with visible cost (his solitude, her departure). However, interiority often tilts toward label-speak ("variant allegiance," "lyrically prophetic") rather than embodied conflict, and the secondary dynamic (crowd loyalty) remains abstract. The final renunciation—Mara leaves, Eli remains alone—is dramatized but the emotional progression feels slightly mechanical. Micro-choices at peak moments (rewiring the transmitter, working the puppet rods) are present but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (antennas, puppets, storm, broadcasts) toward a closure that reweights the premise—two isolated visionaries create shared communion through scrap-tech ritual. The final image (blank book, blueprint, "signal to answer") delivers Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (ongoing separation). One issue: the causal chain from "stealing words" to collaborative projection feels compressed; the reversal (conflict to alliance) happens rapidly without intermediate resistance, slightly weakening escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: cobalt portico, bent antennas, cloud ocean, and puppet stage all constrain choices (the portico sanctifies visitors, the dome becomes projection theater). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ozone, burnt coffee, old incense"). The micro-setting (puppet stage bolted to telescope) charges the closure by enabling the final broadcast. Spatial choreography is clear. One slip: "the museum crate he had looted for its ancient shadow puppets" introduces backstory without present anchor, slightly diluting momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—using ancient shadows and broadcasts to "shape a new dawn"—is signaled early and tightens when Mara arrives. The plan to project silhouettes on clouds raises conceptual stakes, and the final broadcast delivers a tightening (divided loyalties "folded into one shared breath"). However, the escalation feels more Accumulative than Causal; the story layers imagery rather than narrowing options through reversals. The conflict (Eli vs. Mara's rival sermons) dissolves into alliance without a costly pivot, and the price (ongoing solitude) is more stated than felt in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—collective meaning forged from fragments and solitude—emerges through imagery (shadow puppets, fragmented frequencies, scrap-built radios) without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the blank book and "blueprint" suggest iterative prophecy rather than fixed revelation. Subtext operates in gesture (Mara's "grimy whimsy," Eli's confession via "guilty fireflies"). One friction: "variant allegiance" is named too directly in the opening, slightly undercutting emergent discovery. The final line ("his new dawn had a blueprint") skirts thematic echo but stays grounded in the tool-building ethos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic ("the sky seemed to speak, a chorus of lost captains"), with Eli's perceptual filter (builder's idiom, mystical technician) maintained throughout. Free indirect style is mostly clean. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that feels less character-particular and more authorial ("lyrically prophetic," "variant allegiance"), and some figurative constructions ("blue bruise," "guilty fireflies") feel slightly imposed. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The rhythm modulates with pressure, though peak moments (the broadcast scene) could tighten further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, and many lines do double work (setting + character + theme). Rhythm varies, though some passages lean into lyric density at the expense of propulsion ("the stormlit observatory…shuddered like a tin lantern, its dome ringing with rain that never touched the world below"). No major loops or scaffolding. A few constructions feel slightly overwrought ("the rise of a prophet" is vague; "variant allegiance" and "lyrically prophetic" are label-heavy). The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor clarity issue: "across the rise of a prophet" is temporally imprecise, and some metaphors (cobalt glass as "blue bruise") strain coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lonely technician, mystical broadcaster, shadow puppets, and scrap-radio theology feels specific and non-obvious. The "gritty whimsy" tone (soldering iron on a chain, puppet stage bolted to telescope) is executed consistently. The frame—projecting silhouettes on storm clouds to unify divided crowds—offers a fresh angle on prophetic collaboration. However, the core arc (rival visionaries unite) is familiar, and the transformation relies more on poetic accumulation than a bold structural or moral gamble. Risk is present (lyric density, conceptual closure) but the ending's conceptual safety (blueprint, blank book) slightly hedges the boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli appears throughout and makes the key choice to confess his motive, then to collaborate with Mara. His loneliness and vision drive the plan. Present in setup, middle conflict, and closure. His decision to write "their next prophecy in plain instructions" shapes the ending. Causal involvement is clear, though his agency at the climax (working puppet rods while Mara sings) is somewhat passive. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, slight passivity at peak −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, rounded down to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The portico is described in the opening ("cobalt glass portico that framed the entrance like a blue bruise") and Mara stands beneath it ("her face tinted ocean blue"). It sanctifies visitors conceptually but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, no causal pressure, no closure linkage, ornamental use −0.7, swappable −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.2 = 3.2, slight thematic resonance (sanctification) +1.6 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is named early and shapes Eli's internal split (reason vs. mysticism, Mara vs. his own sermons). It drives the thematic question and the final collaboration, where "divided loyalties folded into one shared breath." However, it is more theme than on-page tactic; the concept is told rather than constraining choices in scene. Setup +0.6, one beat (Eli's confession) +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, label-only treatment −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, lyric reprise at end +1.2 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mara is described as speaking "lyrically prophetic" in Eli's perception ("Her voice was lyrically prophetic, turning traffic reports into psalms"). The trait enables the final broadcast (her sung messages) but the cost of this mode is not shown; it is descriptive rather than dramatized. Setup +0.4, one beat (broadcast) +0.4, enables tactic +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, label-only trait −0.7, no visible tradeoff −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears twice: Eli "began to unfold a plan he had never dared speak aloud" (the projection scheme) and the shadow puppets unfold on the clouds. This action triggers the major turn (alliance and broadcast) and shapes the climax. Setup (first third) +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, rounded to 7.8 with cost connection +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are introduced early ("he opened his receiver array…and listened through fragmented radio frequencies") and enable both Eli's surveillance of Mara and the climactic broadcast ("through fragmented radio frequencies the whole sky seemed to speak"). The mechanics matter: Mara rewires the transmitter to "braid her live voice with the scavenged fragments." Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, slight swappability (could be "signals") −0.9 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory is present throughout: its isolation shapes Eli's loneliness, the dome becomes projection stage, the storm pressures the broadcast scene. The setting enables the climax (projecting onto clouds) and the ending ("he would remain mostly alone above the clouds"). Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, irreplaceability +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, slight postcard description in opening −1.2 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" anchors the timeframe vaguely in Mara's ascent. The night of her arrival structures the main action, and "at dawn" closes the sequence. However, time does not tighten tactics; it provides duration rather than countdown. Setup +0.3, two beats (night, dawn) +0.9, no causal pressure, closure mention +0.4, vague tracking −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.0 = 4.0, clock does not alter moves −0.8 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eli's desire "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early ("so he confessed his motive") and drives the plan to project puppets on clouds. The motivation is tested when Mara challenges him, and it finds fulfillment in the collaborative broadcast and the "blueprint" ending. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, friction with costs +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, some telling rather than fully dramatized conflict −0.4 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is consistent throughout: "patched coat," "looted museum crate," "soldering iron on a chain," "grimy whimsy," "giants building a sunrise out of scrap." The tone modulates with pressure (storm intensity, climactic broadcast) and charges the final image ("plain instructions for building radios from junk"). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal coherence +0.9, closure linkage +1.5, modulation +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, slight label-reliance ("grimy whimsy") −0.7 = 7.4.</comment>
