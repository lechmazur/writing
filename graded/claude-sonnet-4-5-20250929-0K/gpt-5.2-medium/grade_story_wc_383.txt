<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's arc from skeptic to workshop-builder shows clear progression, with the shell-handling choice at the Memory Ward forcing her to reweigh attachment versus agency. Interiority is mostly concrete ("do not wait for me, but build your own door"), though the final paragraph's turn to "ghostly resolve" feels slightly label-heavy rather than embodied. The brother's recorded message earns the closure shift, but Mira's internal contradiction—charmed skeptic who still carries the shell nightly—could have acted more visibly in scene rather than being summarized in reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira seals the archive, learns the access protocol, and commits to building devices for quarantine returnees, foreclosing grief-hoarding with visible cost (the shell's silence, the sealed jar). Orientation is swift (garden, Conservatory, evening appointment). The causal lens holds: shell → resonance structure → decoded message → sealing choice → workshop plan. One meaningful tightening when Sol explains the unregistered memory forces the archiving decision, narrowing Mira's options and crystallizing her independence stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet garden, glasshouse Memory Ward, and copper-lattice setup provide spatial anchors and constrain the archiving ritual. "Lanterns floated low" and "black roses… drinking the remaining purple sky" filter through Mira's aesthete lens and pressure her choice by making loss beautiful yet contained. The shell itself functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket murmur, then table placement) and its resonance physically trembles the panes, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single location with minimal transit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's refusal to lose her brother twice versus the city's archival mandate—is signaled early and tightens when Sol labels the shell "unregistered memory… must be archived." The compromise (resonance-structure translation) narrows her options with visible cost: she hears the brother's goodbye, then chooses sealing over clinging. One credible reversal (agreement to archive after initial refusal) and the final workshop decision foreclose grief-hoarding, making "isolation… forged into choice" concrete. Agency is Mira's throughout; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transforming isolation into chosen independence—emerges through the shell-splitting image, the brother's "build your own door" line, and Mira's workshop plan, avoiding explicit thesis statements until the very last phrase ("memory safe enough to carry forward") which stays concrete. The resonance-structure ritual enacts rather than declares the theme: sealing the archive lets Mira mourn without leaking, love without clinging. The Memory Ward's "frequency of grief" jars and the brother's sunrise gesture resist tidy morals, offering a non-literal answer to whether memory infects or empowers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds steady; diction ("charmed skeptic," "tragically radiant") is elevated but consistent, fitting Mira's aesthete filter. Perceptual signature is evident in the way light and sound are registered ("thin murmur that sounded like his laugh trapped in salt"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Sol's "clinical" explanation contrasts his "softened eyes," showing subtext. Two slips: "ghostly resolve" appears as both diegetic brother-voice and Mira's own stance without clear transition, and the phrase "demanded action" in the penultimate beat edges toward thesis-voice rather than Mira's thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("quarantined from the day and released only under supervision"). However, minor loops appear: "tragically radiant" recurs three times across the text without clear reweighting, and the penultimate beat paraphrases the workshop plan twice ("translate… locked days into skills, maps, and plans" then "survival became a kind of independence"). The closure sentence ("memory safe enough to carry forward") is clean, but overwriting in the Memory Ward passage—stacked metaphors of jars, humming, frequencies, leaking—slightly blurs immediacy without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "quarantined memory" premise and resonance-structure ritual feel fresh, avoiding stock grief-archive tropes through the copper-lattice mechanics and the shell-splitting covenant. Mira's workshop plan—translating quarantine into skills rather than erasure—transforms the setup into a constructive stance. Risk-taking in the elevated, quasi-speculative register succeeds without gimmickry. Minor derivative note: the "dangerous memories as contagion" frame echoes recent SFF templates, but the brother's voluntary gate-entry and the resonance-mapping twist provide enough specificity to avoid pure replication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira ("charmed skeptic") frames the opening and makes two key decisions: bringing the shell to Sol and agreeing to archive it with learned access protocol, both altering tactics. Her skepticism is told more than shown—no on-page moment where she visibly doubts the city's infection theory in action—but the closure workshop choice flows from her stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in four beats: pocket murmur (para 1), table placement (para 5), resonance-structure translation (para 6–7), and final silence (para 9). Its properties (whisper, resonance, split covenant) drive the archiving ritual and charge the closure image ("shell's silence… like a completed sentence"). Removing it would collapse both plot and thematic hinge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Quarantined memory" shapes world rules (Conservatory, sealed jars, infection fear) and the central conflict (unregistered shell must be archived). The concept is present in stakes from para 2 onward and alters Mira's tactics (compromise translation, learned-access protocol). However, it functions more as setting/rule than active constraint in the climax—the sealing is procedural rather than a live dilemma about memory's contagion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears three times (lanterns, roses, shadows) but remains descriptive color rather than a trait that constrains choice. No on-page action hinges on something being tragically radiant; it enriches atmosphere without causal pressure. Swappable with "luminous" or "haunting" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archiving action is the story's pivot: Sol's explanation (para 5) forces Mira's choice, the resonance-structure procedure (para 6–7) reveals the brother's message, and the final sealing (para 8) enables the workshop plan. Every major turn traces to the decision to archive rather than smuggle or destroy. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resonance structures" are signaled in para 3 (Sol "built resonance structures that could map a mind"), demonstrated with copper rings and tuning fork (para 6), and produce the readable pattern that earns closure. The mechanics matter—without the lattice translation, Mira hears only murmur, not the brother's clear goodbye. Mid-scene use and closure participation present, though the principle could have been seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden frames the opening and closing, supplying the twilight-to-morning arc and the dew/dimming-lanterns detail that mirrors Mira's shift. It does not constrain a choice directly but anchors temporal passage and charges the final image. Postcard-leaning in para 1; functional reprise in para 9. The Memory Ward glasshouse does more causal work, but "velvet garden at twilight" as specified is present and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When the last star fades into morning light" appears as the brother's diegetic line (para 7) and is echoed in the final beat ("morning finally thinned the shadows," para 9). Time pressure is loose—no urgent clock tightens Mira's decision—but the twilight-to-dawn window frames the ritual and symbolically marks transformation. Lyric reprise rather than tactical constraint; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's drive "to translate isolation into independence" is stated in para 2, dramatized in the compromise choice (para 5–6), and enacted in the workshop plan (para 9: "translate their locked days into skills… survival became a kind of independence"). The friction between clinging (keeping the shell's whisper) and choosing (sealing with access protocol) creates visible cost. Motivation shapes all three major beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" modulates across the text: Mira's controlled grief (para 1), the brother's calm voice (para 7 "calm with ghostly resolve"), and Mira's final stance (para 9 "with ghostly resolve, thanked her brother"). Tone is coherent and charges the ending image, though the exact phrase's triple use borders on label-reliance rather than embodied tonal work. Present in emotional texture and final cadence without becoming static.</comment>
