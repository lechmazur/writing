<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jorin's choices drive key beats (agreeing to the show, reading the hidden message, repositioning the fireworks), but his interiority remains thin—chanting and "ambient awareness" are asserted more than embodied with contradictory impulses. The castellan and the child remain functional roles rather than pressure-sources with their own stakes. Emotional stakes (defying hopelessness) are declared but never tested by a visible internal conflict that forces Jorin to choose between competing goods with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Jorin finds the note → decodes the map → redirects fireworks → gate opens. Closure (the camps enter peacefully, Jorin hands the rag to a boy) reads as Decisive Change with felt cost (the fortress's proud isolation ends, hope is performed into being), and the because/therefore chain holds. However, the climactic gate-opening happens off-page ("Mirel ordered workers to clear the collapse") and the cost—what Jorin or the fortress forfeits by opening—remains abstract rather than viscerally legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming fortress wall gardens, "soot-gray cloud," courtyard, and river gate anchor space and mood consistently. The kerosene rag knot, clay filter pot, and mortars function as micro-setting tools that constrain Jorin's method (filtering powder, syncing fuses to chant). The final image of the river gate grounds the closure spatially. The environment shapes choices (collapsed masonry blocks entry, courtyard layout enables the diversion) and charges the ending with the contrast between blooming fortress and starving camps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake (opening the gate to relieve famine vs. fortress pride) is signaled early and tightens when Jorin reads the hidden note. The fireworks sequence escalates by redirecting attention from sky to wall to river passage, narrowing the council's options. Agency rests with Jorin's tactical reframing (serious playfulness as political lever). However, the climactic gate-clearing occurs off-page via Mirel's order rather than Jorin's on-page choice under duress, and the "not a mob, because the fireworks had turned the night into a stage with rules" reads as assertion rather than dramatized consequence with visible friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (performance as collective action, hope as defiance of gravity) emerges through concrete images—sparks climbing, arrows of light pointing to the gate, the rag knot passed to a trembling boy—without overt moralizing. The final line ("his work was not to brighten heaven but to show people… how to rise together") states the thesis rather than letting the image carry it, but the prior particulars (chant as ritual, filter as craft metaphor, blooming fortress vs. camps) earn the resonance. The kerosene rag knot's journey from passport to teaching tool reweights its meaning at closure without forcing symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization holds throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight during discovery of the tile, broader during staging). Jorin's perceptual signature (chant rhythms, filtering by "smell and echo," "ambient awareness") is asserted but inconsistently embodied—e.g., "his chant changed tempo, and his eyes caught on a single blue tile" names the method without showing the sensory filtering at work. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("why a fortress needed secret instructions from a child?") but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Syntactic variety supports rhythm, though some phrases ("serious playfulness was Jorin's trade") edge toward exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; clarity is generally high. However, several loops appear: "came up the last switchback" / "He chanted while walking," "not prayers exactly, but little rhythmic recipes" restates the same idea; "Tonight was the hush of a night with no stars, the sky a lid of soot-gray cloud" doubles atmospheric description. Stock phrases ("hope fell heavier than stone," "defied gravity more honestly than sparks that chose to climb") slip into forced lyricism without grounding in Jorin's idiom. Filter-verb stacks ("had learned to filter," "he filtered powder") accumulate in the middle third. The closure paragraph ("No stars appeared, yet the sky no longer felt empty") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise (fireworks as political tool, hidden child's map, fortress isolationism) synthesizes familiar elements—artist-as-catalyst, siege-and-relief tropes—through specific detail (kerosene rag knot, clay filter pot, blue tile shaped like a musical quaver). The "serious playfulness" frame and chant-as-ignition-cue offer fresh angles. The emotional arc (defying hopelessness through performance) reads sincere but not surprising. The tile mechanism and child-collaborator feel efficient rather than inevitable; swapping the tile for another hidden clue would not fundamentally alter the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jorin's choices create all major turns: agreeing to the show (setup), reading the hidden note and proposing a redirected display (development), and handing the rag knot to the boy while guiding the camps' entry (closure). His decisions alter tactics at each beat with visible cost (risking council rejection, defying proud isolationism). The wandering trait is asserted but not leveraged as a constraint or skill in the climactic beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in three beats: introduced as "passport" at the gate (setup), looped around Jorin's wrist during the show ("the smell of fuel steadied him"), and handed to a trembling boy at closure (payoff). The object's meaning shifts from survival credential to teaching tool, and its presence charges the final image. However, the middle use (wrist loop) is described rather than causally active—it does not enable or constrain a choice under pressure. The knot is specific and irreplaceable but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The note hidden in the mosaic tile drives the causal chain: Jorin's chant changes tempo → he kneels and touches the tile → it reveals the map and instruction → he repositions the fireworks → the gate opens. The concept shapes stakes (child's hidden resistance vs. council pride) and tactics (low bursts, arrows toward the river passage). Removing the note would collapse the plot's trigger and the child-collaborator frame. The blue tile "shaped like a musical quaver" ties to Jorin's chant method, deepening specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Chanting is signaled early ("He chanted while walking, not prayers exactly, but little rhythmic recipes") and returns in three beats: gate arrival, courtyard setup ("syncing fuse lengths to syllables, so that each spoken beat became an ignition cue"), and guiding the camps ("still chanting, letting the rhythm carry fear away"). The trait constrains Jorin's method (fuse timing) and enables the crowd-calming effect. However, the chant's mechanics remain asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost—no moment where chanting forces a tactical trade-off or fails under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Filter" appears in four beats: Jorin "learned to filter stories… by sifting what he heard through smell and echo" (setup), "filtering the fortress's moods" via ambient awareness, using the clay filter pot to strain river water for black powder paste (middle action), and "reading the crowd through ambient awareness, filtered panic into purpose" (closure participation). The middle use is physical and causally necessary (powder preparation), while the metaphorical sense frames his method. The action is specific and difficult to swap, but the powder-filtering beat is brief and could be replaced with direct mixing without breaking the gate-opening logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named twice ("let his ambient awareness do the work, filtering the fortress's moods" and "reading the crowd through ambient awareness") but never shown through specific sensory cues or a decision it enables. The method is asserted as Jorin's skill yet does not constrain a choice or shape an attempt—he reads the tile visually, not through ambient filtering. The concept remains decorative label rather than dramatized mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk anchors every beat: wall gardens exhale perfume (arrival), closed gates and famine camps ring the exterior (setup), courtyard staging (middle action), and river gate opening (closure). The setting pressures choices (collapsed masonry blocks entry, council isolationism vs. camp need, courtyard as performance stage) and supplies concrete resources (mortars, inner wall for low bursts, river passage). The dusk timing and soot-gray sky charge the mood and contrast with the fireworks' color. Removing the fortress frame would dissolve the plot's spatial logic and thematic tension.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "hush of a night with no stars" and "soot-gray cloud" are signaled at arrival and return in the final paragraph ("No stars appeared, yet the sky no longer felt empty"), bracketing the action and reweighting the metaphor. However, elapsed time during the fireworks show is vague—no clock tightens decisions or tracks duration. The starless night functions thematically (hopelessness / absence reframed as potential) but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure through a live deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Jorin's motivation ("to defy the gravity of hopelessness") is declared early and returns at closure ("his work was not to brighten heaven but to show people… how to rise together"). The desire drives his agreement to the diversion and his choice to guide the camps with chant and teaching. However, the motivation is never tested by a competing want or fear—no moment where defying hopelessness costs Jorin safety, pride, or another value. The friction between wants and costs remains abstract rather than dramatized in a micro-choice under duress.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is coherent throughout: Jorin jokes that the rag knot is his "passport," proposes a show to "make the council laugh for one breath, then look where the laughter pointed," and bows "with mock ceremony" to the child at closure. The tone modulates appropriately—solemn at the gate search, tactical during the courtyard staging, gentle when teaching the boy to spin flame. The final image ("a solemn grin that matched his") charges the ending with the tone's synthesis of gravity and levity, embodying the concept without stating it.</comment>
