<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motives are layered—surface conflict with Iven, deeper desire to map time's texture—and her micro-choices (touching the cicada, deflecting his demand with memory) show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is strong: Iven's thumb worrying the cloak seam, Mara's hand warming the cicada. The final choice to propose moving north rather than reveal her hidden copies feels earned, though the renunciation's cost could land harder on the page. Internal voice is concrete and character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the cicada's recurring use, and the thematic weight of "transition periods" until the final image—waves erasing footprints yet leaving the beach unchanged—reconfigures the opening question with felt cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's agreement with Iven to move north forecloses her solitary defiance while the hidden jars remain unspoken, a visible omission that charges trust's future cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph; causality under the accumulative lens is coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara foresees the harbor and Iven's shame, then chooses a shared path over solitary refusal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto's physical details—black rock opened like a book, starlight through a crack, trapped seawater pool—constrain the conversation's staging and charge the cicada's use. Micro-setting (the pool, dripstone) anchors Mara's perceptual signature and her tangential method. The tidal rhythm governs the scene's clock and mirrors the thematic "turn of tide" in the final image, which directly shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's autonomy over her records versus the council's harbor claim, signaled early through Iven's demand. One meaningful tightening: Mara foresees Iven's failure at council and her own obsolescence, then proposes relocation instead of confrontation—narrowing her options from hidden defiance to shared adaptation with visible cost (trust deferred, copies unspoken). The council pressure operates off-page, slightly limiting immediacy, but Iven's presence and Mara's internal stakes cohere. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—transition as passage, the paradox of leaving and staying—emerges organically from the tidal imagery, Mara's cicada-driven foresight, and her final choice to move rather than cling. The closing image (waves erasing footprints yet leaving the beach unchanged) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "the texture of time" without stating a moral. No thematic echo or moralizing; the jade cicada's warmth and Mara's journal entry layer subtext. The phrase "texture of time … like wet stone at the turn of tide" risks mild abstraction but stays anchored in concrete sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (warmly observant, noticing Iven's thumb, reading transition periods). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Mara's tangent ("whether he remembered the first pool") is evasion with subtext, and Iven's lines carry fear and shame. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful rhythm modulation ("the pause finally ended, not with surrender but with agreement to try"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "His eyes had hardened" shows reaction and stakes the pause). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid template cadence. Minor friction: "transition periods, the thin hours when tide turns and animals decide whether to hide or feed" leans expository mid-beat, and the phrase "not with visions, but with a sense of which choices could still bend" edges toward abstraction under pressure. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong. Figurative language (coral that cuts while it builds, time as syrup) is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The jade cicada as a tool for oblique temporal foresight is a fresh synthesis, and the "tangential approach" method feels specific to Mara's practice. The grotto-as-archive and tidal chronicler premise avoid stock template plots. Emotional truth (trust deferred, the friction between preservation and adaptation) anchors the speculative element. Mild proximity to "magical object reveals hidden knowledge" tropes, but the tactile handling and foreclosing cost in the final choice elevate execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—deflecting Iven's demand with memory, touching the cicada to foresee, proposing relocation rather than revealing her hidden copies—drive all key turns. Present in setup, middle foresight beat, and closure proposal. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the tidal-pool role shapes her perceptual method and stakes. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in four distinct beats: opening hold, pool discovery backstory, the foresight moment (belly-press triggers thickened time), and the warm pocket at closure signaling approval. Its mechanics—tangential questioning, moment-thickening—enable the key foresight turn and charge the final image with validation. Specificity (carved wings, equinox pool origin, warmth as feedback) and closure linkage are exemplary. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Transition periods" frame the dominant stake (Mara and Iven at the pause's turn), govern the grotto's tidal clock, and provide the thematic lens for Mara's foresight method and final counsel ("change is not an ending, it is a passage"). Present in title lesson, backstory, foresight mechanics, and closure image (waves at tide's turn). Shapes tactics, reweights meaning, and charges the ending. Conceptual cost is undeniable: trust and adaptation hinge on recognizing transition's texture. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is dramatized through Mara's noticing (Iven's thumb, hermit crab, starfish memory) and her choice to deflect conflict with a shared memory rather than confrontation. Enables the tangential method and middle turn. Present in setup and foresight beat; implied at closure when she reads Iven's fear. One causal trade-off: observation delays direct argument, risking Iven's hardening. Functional across two beats but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Foresee" is the engine of the middle turn: Mara touches the cicada, senses the harbor's inevitability and Iven's future shame, then proposes moving north instead of clinging or fighting. Present in backstory primer (hermit crab moment thickening), the key grotto beat, and implied in her final counsel. Mechanics (tangential trigger, "sense of which choices could still bend") shape her tactics and the closure proposal. Swapping for generic clairvoyance would lose the tangential method's specificity. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is seeded in backstory ("ask the charm about time by studying everything except time"), demonstrated when Mara uses Iven's starfish memory as a doorway to foresight, and echoed in her final indirection (proposing relocation without mentioning the hidden copies). Shapes two beats and the closure tactic. Mechanics are signaled and matter: direct demand fails, tangent succeeds. Specific to Mara's practice. Solid integration, just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The grotto stages the confrontation (black rock opened by low tide), supplies the trapped pool where Mara demonstrates foresight, and houses the starlight crack that draws the pale line across the water during the key beat. Tidal rhythm pressures the conversation's clock ("the tide began to creep back") and mirrors closure. Environment enables the cicada's use and the final image. Present in all three gates; constrains choices and charges the ending. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Across the pause in a difficult conversation" anchors the scene's real-time frame and tightens immediacy: Mara listens to dripstone, deflects, demonstrates foresight, and the pause "finally ended" with agreement. The tidal clock (low tide opening, tide creeping back) tracks elapsed pressure. Present in setup ("pause hung between them"), middle (conversation across beats), and closure ("pause finally ended"). Constrains one tactic (Mara's deflection) and shapes the ending's resolution tempo. Timeframe matters but could be generalized to "difficult conversation" with minor cost. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is Mara's secret motive, seeded early ("written nowhere in her journals"), dramatized through the cicada experiments and foresight mechanics, and conflicted against the immediate need to answer Iven and preserve her work. The final journal entry ("time had texture after all … like wet stone at the turn of tide") directly pays off this desire with cost: the answer is paradox, not mastery. Present in setup, foresight beat, and closure. Friction between wants (understanding time) and costs (trust, autonomy) drives the middle turn and ending choice. Essential.</comment>
