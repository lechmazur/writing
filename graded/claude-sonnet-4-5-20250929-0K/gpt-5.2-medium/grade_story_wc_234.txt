<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to "capture the density of presence" is established early and drives his choice to release the suns rather than license them, with visible cost (forgoing income, defying the Academy). The interior voice shows contradiction—"scientifically romantic," mixing equations with longing—and the final gesture ("We will be our own measure") flows from this stance. Toma's arc from Academy defector to co-conspirator is clean, though his interiority remains thin. The phrase "directed spontaneity" feels like a clever label rather than an embodied contradiction acting in scene, and emotional states lean toward poetic assertion over visceral embodiment under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (Lio, ember nexus, twilight, pocket-sun alchemist) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: releasing the suns through the shell's spiral transforms them from commodities into a protest ("They cannot patent what you give back"), reweighting the premise of ownership with visible cost (forgoing sale, defying the Academy). The tightening is legible: Toma's warning → Lio's decision to "return differently" → the colored suns as ground-level constellation. One meaningful deepening is present, and the final image charges prior material. Cost is felt in the shared refusal and the phrase "marking the cost of taking light."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vividly anchored—basalt ribs, red-breathing fissure, mica-dusted stone table—and constrains the climactic choice: Lio releases the suns *here* to make the Academy watchers see them. The shell curl's spiral grooves are handled on the page, guiding the solar dust into luminous stripes that alter each sun's character. Spatial choreography (rim walk, vents, distant towers) remains clear. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (copper smoke twilight, humming sun, warmth climbing wrists), filtered through Lio's alchemist lens. The setting directly enables the protest act and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Lio will commodify his suns or preserve their original purpose. Toma's warning ("They want you to license…I refused to sign") narrows options sharply, forcing Lio's agency. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens: Lio decides to "return differently," pours solar dust into the shell, releases each sun through it, creating a visible protest constellation. The cost is legible on the page—forgoing income, defying institutional pressure, binding himself to Toma's shared risk. One meaningful tightening (the decision to release "here, now") is present, and the Academy watchers' observation makes consequences immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the enacted conflict between commodification and gift economy, tested through Lio's choice to "return differently" rather than sell or merely release. The palette-of-resolve metaphor (shell spiral as decision map) is integrated into action—solar dust settles into stripes, coloring each vow—without overt thesis. The ending offers a resonant answer: "We will be our own measure," reweighting freedom and presence through the visible protest. Subtext operates in gesture (hand-pressing the glowing shell) and image (ground-level constellation vs. Academy towers). The phrase "art and science met here" nearly moralizes but is anchored to the physical act of releasing colored suns, keeping it on the acceptable edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Lio is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—alchemist diction ("density of presence," "trap noon," "palette of resolve")—and the prose modulates with pressure (short declaratives at the decision beat: "He would return…not as surrender"). However, the voice leans toward poetic assertion in high-pressure moments ("heavy as honeyed air," "the secret between them became a plan") where concrete embodiment would sharpen impact. Filter verbs ("felt again," "understood") appear but don't stack heavily. Dialogue is minimal; Toma's two lines feel natural and goal-driven. The final phrase "revalue freedom by returning differently" edges toward thematic summary but remains tied to the enacted image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph structure supports scene pressure. Information density is high in the closure sequence (shell mechanics, sun release, Academy watchers). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "directed spontaneity, the habit of planning a risk and then taking it as if surprised" restates itself; "mixing equations with longing, scientifically romantic to the core" is redundant within three lines. Stock metaphors cluster in early exposition ("copper smoke," "warm light folded in his coat pockets"). The phrase "the word sell fell like ash" and "emotionally romantic to the core" lean toward generic lyricism. Template cadence appears in the shell-filling sequence ("He poured…Toma steadied…Lio spoke…When the last stripe filled"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and stock phrasing; these do not touch closure directly but dull mid-scene propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist premise is fresh, and the nautilus-shell-as-filter mechanic offers a non-obvious synthesis of light physics and symbolic resolve. The choice to release suns *through* the shell to transform them (not weaker, "more specific, like a vow given color") is an earned, character-driven turn. However, the framing—artist vs. commodification, Academy as antagonist—follows a familiar template without much transformation. The phrase "scientifically romantic" and "palette of resolve" read as clever prompt responses rather than lived-in world logic. The closure image (ground-level constellation as protest) is visually striking and thematically coherent, lifting the score into the mid-6s. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode is present but execution leans toward poetic decoration in places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout; his choices (to bring the vials, use the shell, release the suns *here*, press Toma's hand to the shell) drive all key turns and the closure. Early signal, two distinct beats (decision to return differently; releasing suns through shell), causal pressure (narrows options under Academy threat), closure linkage (final gesture and shared stance), and visible cost (forgoing sale, defying institution). Irreplaceable: the alchemist trait enables the protest mechanics. Slightly swappable with "artist" or "craftsman" in broad strokes, limiting top-band eligibility, but the pocket-sun mechanics are specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shell appears early (Toma holds it), is handled in two distinct beats (its spiral bends twilight; Lio pours solar dust into its grooves), and its mechanics shape the climax (each sun passes through it, gaining colored stripes that mark resolve). Early signal, beat involvement (two), causal pressure (enables the transformation), closure linkage (shell becomes "a small map of decision" and is pressed into Toma's hand in the final gesture), specificity (columella curl's spiral grooves are unique), and cost connection (the shell's use binds the shared defiance). Near-indispensable; removing it would break the transformation mechanic and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept is signaled early ("to capture the density of presence") and returns at closure ("palette of resolve you could hold," "We will be our own measure"), reweighting meaning. It shapes Lio's stake (preserving presence vs. commodification) and the shell's use (sorting light "by pressure" mirrors sorting a moment). Present in setup and payoff, with thematic reprise at closure. However, middle development is thin—the concept is described more than tested—and it could be replaced with similar abstractions ("integrity," "commitment") without breaking structure. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability −0.6 and weak middle beat −0.4 limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The trait is signaled early ("he mixed equations with longing, scientifically romantic to the core") and constrains the final choice: Lio releases suns as both experiment and protest, refusing pure commerce. The Academy calls this "weakness," marking cost. However, the trait mostly functions as a label and thematic accent rather than forcing visible tradeoffs in scene. It's swappable with "idealist" or "unconventional." Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (shapes the refusal) +0.8, but label-only treatment −0.5 and swappability −0.6 pull it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The action "revalue" is signaled early (Lio must "revalue what his suns were for") and drives the climax: instead of selling or simply releasing, he revalues by releasing *through the shell*, transforming the suns into a protest. The final line ("revalue freedom by returning differently") ties the action to closure. Early signal, beat involvement (decision moment, release sequence), causal pressure (narrows options to this specific tactic), closure linkage. Slightly abstract—could be reworded as "redefine" or "reclaim"—but the mechanics (shell transformation) make it specific enough for high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled at the decision beat ("he would return the captured suns…but…by returning differently") and its mechanics are demonstrated on the page: passing each sun through the shell to add colored stripes before release. The method enables the protest's visibility (Academy watchers see a new constellation) and charges the closure ("They cannot patent what you give back"). Beat involvement (two: decision, execution), causal pressure (this tactic evades commodification), closure linkage, specificity (shell-mediated transformation vs. simple release). Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored early (basalt ribs, red fissure, twilight, stone table) and directly pressures the climax: Lio chooses to release the suns *here* so the Academy cannot ignore them, and the vents provide the dramatic backdrop for the ground-level constellation. Spatial details (rim, vents, distant towers) enable choreography. Early signal, beat involvement (provides resources and contrast), causal pressure (location choice is strategic), closure linkage (the setting charges the final protest image). Twilight adds atmospheric specificity. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("in the moment a secret is whispered between friends") is signaled early when Toma whispers his warning. The whispered secret (Academy's demand, Toma's refusal) triggers the climax decision and binds the two friends in shared risk. The moment is brief and pressured. However, "timeframe" as a duration is vague—most of the scene spans broader twilight rather than compressing into the whisper's instant. Early signal, closure linkage (the secret and friendship charge the ending), causal pressure. Swappability −0.4 (could be "the moment of reunion" or "a choice between friends") and weak middle tracking −0.3 limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation is signaled early ("to capture the density of presence…measurable in the way a friend looked up when you said their name") and shapes the dominant stake: Lio values gratitude and relational presence over sale. At closure, pressing Toma's hand to the glowing shell enacts this motivation. Early signal, closure linkage, thematic coherence. However, the motivation is mostly told and reflected upon rather than tested through conflicting wants in scene. The climax choice aligns neatly without much friction. Told-only treatment −0.6, weak friction −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone "directed spontaneity" is signaled early (Lio's "habit of planning a risk and then taking it as if surprised") and colors the climax: the sun-release feels both calculated (using the shell's mechanics) and improvisational (acting "now" rather than at a planned dawn). The tone modulates—reflective in setup, accelerating at the decision beat—and charges the final gesture. However, the phrase is more clever label than felt texture; the prose doesn't consistently embody the paradox in rhythm or diction. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but label reliance −0.5 and weak embodiment −0.4 place it mid-6s.</comment>
