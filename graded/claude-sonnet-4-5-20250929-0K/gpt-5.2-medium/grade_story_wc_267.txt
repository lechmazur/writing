<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bellhop protagonist shows clear internal contradiction—bound by policy yet morally troubled—and makes a decisive final choice to whisper "C" that forecloses the safe path with visible cost (the REMAIN alert, footsteps approaching). Embodied emotion is strong: "the cost of safety like cold metal under my tongue," "frost in her breath looked like a small flag of surrender." Edda's embodied struggle (cracked lips, trembling smile, numb fingers waking) creates genuine pressure on the protagonist's stance. Minor slip: the technician's badge "REMAIN" feels slightly convenient as exposition, but the choice itself is earned and the renunciation of enforced silence carries weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the bellhop notices the thumbprint, discovers the hidden stairwell, retrieves the bolt, installs it, which enables Edda's therapy, which leads to the whispered "C" that triggers surveillance and forces the final stance. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the protagonist chooses "a quiet that protected without erasing" with the director's arrival and hunters potentially outside—options are crystallized, cost is felt (the REMAIN alert, the risk), and the prior silent-choir policy is renounced in action. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening (bolt retrieval → therapy → whisper → surveillance response) sufficient for this length. The hunters' ambiguity ("might not exist at all") adds conceptual cost without resolving neatly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow pressing "like a white palm," ice tunnels, dusty spiral staircase with the ninth-step thumbprint, and the underground chamber with monitoring consoles create a coherent, oppressive setting that constrains choice (the silence policy, the surveillance grid, the wobbling piano bench). The bolt becomes micro-setting that enables the therapy scene. Sensory detail is purposeful: "oil and old varnish," "muffled hymn that had no voices, only humming pipes," frost breath as "a small flag of surrender." The setting directly enables the protagonist's discovery and final act. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the fortress exterior and snowfields remain abstract backdrops rather than active pressures on the page, but the interior spaces—staircase, chamber, therapy hall—all constrain or enable key moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether enforced silence will continue to erase suffering or whether the protagonist will risk speaking to support Edda's nerve recovery. Escalation is causal and tightens: Edda's mute question → the wobbling bench preventing therapy → the hidden discovery of surveillance machinery → the bolt repair → Edda's whispered note → the protagonist's whisper that triggers the REMAIN alert and approaching footsteps. The final image crystallizes the trade-off: "a quiet that protected without erasing, a frostbitten hope." Agency is present (the protagonist chooses to whisper, to guide Edda under the piano, to stand and meet the director's eyes). The cost is legible: surveillance activated, potential exposure to hunters or directors. One substantive pressure arc sufficient for this length. Does not reach 8.5 because the hunters remain abstract (we never see them test the protagonist on the page), so the final risk feels conceptual rather than viscerally immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—unpardonable silence as erasure versus protective quiet—emerges organically from the surveillance machinery reveal, the nerve-regeneration therapy that requires speech, and the protagonist's final stance. The bolt becomes a concrete particular: fixing the wobble allows Edda to sit steady, enabling the therapy that the silence policy would deny. "Frostbitten hope" charges the ending without moralizing. The phrase "unpardonable silence...the kind that fell when someone needed an answer and received only air" sets up the thematic question early and the ending image answers it through action: the protagonist offers "a quiet that protected without erasing." Subtext operates in the hymn of humming pipes (the choir is mechanical), the director seeing "only a stable bench and a patient resting" (surveillance missed the human exchange). Minor slip: "the cost of safety like cold metal under my tongue" verges on overt metaphor, but the image is specific enough to avoid pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: the bellhop notices "the slightest discoloration, a thumbprint of darker dust" and filters all action through the lens of enforced silence and institutional complicity. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "small flag of surrender." Dialogue is minimal and purposeful—Edda's cracked-lip question, the therapist's sign language, the single whispered "C"—each advances plot and subtext. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor issue: "the unpardonable silence" phrase appears twice in slightly different framings (opening and Edda's moment), creating a faint echo that risks over-emphasizing theme, but the second use is contextually distinct enough to avoid pure repetition. Pronoun clarity is maintained, tense is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates well under pressure (longer, layered sentences in discovery; shorter, tighter ones during the whisper and director's arrival).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances discovery, choice, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with pressure. The discovery sequence (thumbprint → hidden door → bin of hardware → surveillance chamber) is propulsive and clear. Strong specific images: "bolt glinting like a tiny star," "hymn that had no voices, only humming pipes," "frost in her breath looked like a small flag of surrender." Two issues prevent higher score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop in the therapy-hall paragraph: "the therapist signed in frustration that no repair request ever reached the maintenance office" followed shortly by exposition about the spiral staircase feels like backfill rather than forward momentum. (2) "Silent choir" metaphor is used three times with slight variations (opening, underground revelation, protagonist's role) without sufficient reweighting each time—reads slightly scaffolded. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat, so impact is contained. Proofreading is clean, syntax varies purposefully, and peak moments (the whisper, the director's entrance) are tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical silence (nerve regeneration requiring speech/touch) with institutional surveillance (safety through enforced muteness masking control) is specific and non-obvious. The bolt as the hinge object that enables therapy is a fresh inflection—small, mechanical, intimate—rather than a grand symbolic gesture. The reveal that the silent choir is machinery ("humming pipes") reweights the opening's "seraphically mundane" framing with conceptual irony. The protagonist's final stance—"a quiet that protected without erasing"—offers a third option beyond submission or open defiance, which feels earned. Minor deduction: the fortress-under-siege premise with unseen hunters and enforced silence echoes familiar dystopian templates; the story transforms it through the nerve-regeneration detail and the bolt's specificity, but the hunters' abstract threat keeps one foot in stock territory. The emotional specificity (Edda's pianist hands, the wobbling bench, the ninth-step thumbprint) lifts it above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bellhop's choices drive all key turns: noticing the thumbprint, pressing the hidden door, retrieving the bolt, installing it, and whispering "C" to Edda. Each decision narrows options and raises cost. The final choice to whisper and then stand before the director crystallizes the stance shift from passive choir member to active protector. Present early (paragraph one), shapes the discovery beat (staircase, chamber), enables the therapy beat (bolt installation), and drives the closure (whisper, guided hiding, meeting the director's eyes). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bolt is handled in three distinct beats: (1) discovered in the underground bin "glinting like a tiny star," (2) threaded into the bench "turning it until the wobble stopped," (3) used as a handle to pull the bench aside during the director's approach. Its absence prevents Edda's therapy; its installation enables the whisper; its final use shows the protagonist leveraging the repair for concealment. Charged reprise: from missing/needed to installed/functional to tactical tool. Early setup (therapy hall, wobble noted), middle causal work (retrieval, installation), and closure participation (bench-pull, director sees "only a stable bench"). Specific, irreplaceable mechanics. Minor deduction: the final handle-use feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable, but the bolt's causal chain is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence is named early and shapes the dominant stake throughout: Edda cannot ask her question, therapy requires speech but policy forbids it, the protagonist must choose between enforced muteness and risking sound. The concept drives the discovery (why is silence enforced?), the bolt repair (enabling speech therapy), and the final whisper (breaking the rule with visible cost). The ending image reweights it: "a quiet that protected without erasing." Present across all three gates (setup, development, closure). Minor deduction: the phrase "unpardonable silence" is stated twice in slightly expository framings rather than fully dramatized through action alone, which keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears once as description of the fortress life ("all slippers and soft lamps") but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. It colors the atmosphere and is echoed thematically in the final "quiet that protected," but the trait itself is label-only rather than a lived constraint the protagonist must navigate. Setup gate is met (first paragraph), but no middle development beat or closure participation where the trait materially alters tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Remain" is the order on the technician's badge, the REMAIN alert triggered by the whisper, and implicitly the protagonist's final stance ("remained standing"). It shapes two key beats: (1) discovery of the surveillance system where "REMAIN" governs everyone during sensor alerts, (2) the pager vibration with "REMAIN" after the whisper, forcing the protagonist to guide Edda under the piano. The ending reweights it: the protagonist remains but redefines what that means—standing, choosing "a quiet that protected without erasing" rather than passive obedience. Present by midpoint, drives escalation, and charges the closure. Minor deduction: the action is somewhat abstract (an order, a state) rather than a single decisive physical act, which slightly lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The discolored ninth step is the method of discovery: "the slightest discoloration, a thumbprint of darker dust where someone kept touching stone." The protagonist watches, presses it, and enters the hidden stairwell to find the bolt. Signaled early (spiral staircase description), mechanics are clear (press the mark, door opens), and it enables the middle causal chain (bolt retrieval). Does not reappear at closure or constrain the final choice, so closure gate is missing. Functional and specific, but the method could be replaced with another hidden-access device (loose stone, key under mat) without major structural change. Scores mid-band for strong setup and middle development but lack of closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress provides the ice tunnels (danger amplifies sound), the spiral staircase (discovery route), the underground surveillance chamber (thematic reveal), and the therapy hall (enabling space). Snow pressing against walls mutes the world and establishes the silence motif. The setting directly enables the bolt discovery and the therapy scene. Spatial choreography (staircase, chamber, hall, piano) is clear and each location constrains or enables a beat. Present early, shapes middle choices (staircase press, bolt retrieval, bench repair), and implicitly pressures the closure (the director's approach, the hidden Edda, the standing protagonist). Minor deduction: the exterior fortress and snowfields remain atmospheric rather than supplying a resource or constraint that the protagonist must navigate on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration establishes the need for speech and touch therapy ("patients had to wake deadened fingers and tongues"), creating urgency for Edda's recovery and the ethical conflict over the silence policy. The timeframe shapes two beats: (1) Edda's arrival with splints and the chart "DO NOT STARTLE," (2) the therapy session where "she should speak the name of the note to help her nerves rebuild." It justifies why silence is not just policy but harm. Setup is clear (early paragraphs), middle development is present (therapy scene), but closure does not hinge on a ticking clock or explicit nerve-regeneration deadline—cost is conceptual (will she ever play again?) rather than time-pressured. Functional and thematically integrated but replaceable with another medical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to understand the cost of safety drives the protagonist's investigation: noticing the thumbprint, exploring the hidden stairwell, discovering the surveillance machinery ("the fortress stayed safe by staying quiet, but the system demanded constant listening"), and recognizing that "the policy also let the directors ignore suffering in plain sight." The final choice dramatizes the friction: the protagonist whispers, accepts the REMAIN alert, and stands with "a quiet that protected without erasing"—weighing safety against erasure. Setup is implicit in the opening discomfort ("I felt the cost of safety like cold metal under my tongue"), development is explicit in the discovery beats, and closure crystallizes the trade-off. Desire is embodied in choices with visible cost (surveillance triggered, footsteps approaching). Minor deduction: the phrase "cost of safety" is slightly on-the-nose thematically, edging toward prompt echo.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frostbitten hope is coherent throughout: the fortress's cold ("snow pressed," "frost in her breath"), the oppressive silence, and the protagonist's cautious defiance. Tone modulates with pressure: meditative in the opening, tense during the staircase discovery, warm during the bolt installation ("the note felt like warmth spreading through ice"), taut during the whisper and director's arrival. The final image lands the tone precisely: "a frostbitten hope"—endangered, fragile, but present. The juxtaposition of cold/damage and warmth/recovery charges every beat. Tone is specific to this voice and setting, not a generic mood overlay. Reaches high band for coherence, modulation, and closure charge.</comment>
