<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The maintenance worker's interiority is present and drives choices (loosening bolts, following the sound, setting the sextant), but the motivation to "discover what trees witness" reads more as ambient curiosity than urgent need tested under pressure. The progression from grief-measuring to labyrinth-deconstruction feels elliptical; the emotional stakes of this shift remain abstract. Embodied emotion is thin—no contradictory impulses strain the worker in the moment of decision. The final choice to "reset the remaining stones into a smaller labyrinth" lands quietly but the cost (professional risk, reputation, the weight of unprocessed dreams) is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—maintenance worker, tower labyrinth, storm night—arrive early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief flakes, dream envelopes, and moonlit repairs accrue meaning until the sapling and sextant converge in a charged image. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth is remade to "lead outward instead of in," reweighting the quantified-sorrow premise—but the cost (municipal violation, personal exposure, the risk of discovered dreams) is felt rather than shown. The causal chain from pin-drop to sapling to roof-route to deconstruction holds under ellipsis; the moonlight-repair mechanism and dream-mapping feel more symbolic than procedurally grounded, which strains traceability at the climactic turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, moving-ink windows, wind-bent pines, and the improbable oak sapling in a floor drain create vivid, purposeful texture. The sextant resting on the sill under moonlight, the corridor breath-holding, and seawater-wet leaves all constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (internal labyrinth to pocket chamber to roof parapet) tracks cleanly. The tower's micro-setting—drain, sill, numbered stones—serves as infrastructure for the worker's discovery and deconstruction, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discover what trees witness—is clear, but escalation under the Accumulative lens feels diffuse: the pin-drop tightens silence, the sapling introduces weight, the sextant reveals a hidden route, yet each beat adds texture more than narrowing options. Agency is present (following the sound, setting the sextant, deconstructing stones) but the worker faces little opposition or visible cost on the page. The final reconfiguration (smaller labyrinth leading outward) closes the arc, yet the price paid—municipal defiance, lost job security, exposed dreams—remains conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief commodified vs. grief witnessed, institutional control vs. organic release. The sapling "drinks their sorrow," the pines "hold what we refuse to carry," and the final labyrinth redesign answer the thematic question without moralizing. The sextant's moonlight-healing and the dream-map method function as metaphor woven into world logic, avoiding overt symbolism. The ending image—resetting stones to lead outward, the corridor pin now "already answering"—resonates with prior particulars and reweights the quantified-sorrow premise. No diagnostic label-speak or thematic echo in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the worker's perceptual signature (arithmetic of sadness, private hunger, chalk lines, paper envelopes) is consistent and specific. Diction—"moving ink," "breath-holding corridors," "mundane miracle"—is controlled and voice-particular. The prose remains in free indirect style with clean filter-verb use ("I realized," "I understood") that fits the reflective, methodical character. No head-hopping. The lyric compression in the middle third (moonlight stitching metal, dreams as flakes, the sapling absorbing grief) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Mild register drift into elevated phrasing ("inextricable," "municipal instrument") in a few beats, but it reads voice-motivated for an educated maintenance worker with Rell's training.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative clauses) and information density is high. Several beats show paraphrase loops: "The maze was not for tourists; it was a municipal instrument" is immediately restated conceptually, and the sapling's grief-weight is described twice in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "I followed… I felt… I set… I waited… I realized… I worked." Filter-verb stacks ("I heard," "I felt," "I wanted," "I realized," "I understood") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy by −0.5. The closure beat ("I filed no report; I simply reset") is clean and propulsive. Total artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and cadence; −0.5 for filter stacks = −1.3, landing the score at 6.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—municipal grief labyrinth, quantified sorrow, a sextant that heals in moonlight, mapping scattered dreams to chart witness—synthesizes familiar genre elements (bureaucratic metaphor, broken-object repair, trees as memory holders) into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The worker's choice to deconstruct rather than smash, to free dreams as compass, and to redesign the maze outward rather than simply expose the clerks shows specificity and earned transformation. The concept of "quantified sorrow" and "what trees witness" avoids stock tropes, though the wise-astronomer mentor (Rell) and the pocket-chamber sapling lean toward familiar fantasy beats. Risk-taking (lyric density, moonlight mechanics, dream-mapping method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final "mundane miracle" reweights prior material in hindsight, meeting the 9+ quick test; score held to 7.8 because the core arc (discover hidden truth, reform system) maps onto a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The maintenance worker is present throughout; agency drives key turns (following the pin-drop, setting the sextant, deconstructing the maze stone by stone, resetting it outward). Setup by paragraph one, middle development in the pocket chamber and roof scenes, payoff in the redesign. The worker's private hunger and methodical skill constrain choices (chalk lines, bend numbers on wrist, tool belt). Cost is felt conceptually (defying municipal order, releasing dreams) but not vividly dramatized. Two gates met solidly, third (closure participation) present but light on visible price. Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph one (broken, pressed into hands by Rell), returns each full shift laid on the sill, heals in moonlight, ticks and shows "nights" when aimed at the sapling, and remains on the sill healing again at the end. Three distinct beats: introduction/healing mechanic, measurement of the sapling, final reprise. Causal pressure: the sextant reveals the hidden route to the roof, enabling the deconstruction. Closure linkage: resting on the sill in the final lines recharges the opening. Irreplaceable: its healing property and night-counting function are unique. Cost connection: the worker waits under the moon, tick by tick subtracting sorrow. Strong integration across setup, middle, and payoff. Score: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is introduced early ("municipal instrument for collecting grief," "fifty-four units") and frames the worker's private rebellion. It shapes the stakes—institutional measurement vs. witness—and the clerks' system is the obstacle the worker must navigate. The concept appears in the pocket chamber (the sapling's absorbed weight, the fifty-four-unit tag) and is directly reweighted in the ending ("grief be measured yet still heard"). It constrains tactics (the worker must work within the numbered-stone system to deconstruct it) and drives the thematic question. All three gates met. However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page pressure mechanism; the clerks never appear, and the worker faces no dramatized institutional resistance. Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "heals in moonlight" trait is introduced in paragraph one (the sextant "healed in moonlight the way some cuts close"), demonstrated each full shift (laid on the sill, metal stitching smooth by moon's clearing), and is causally essential in the pocket-chamber beat (the moonlight repairs the sextant fully so it can tick and reveal nights/routes). The trait enables the key action (sextant measurement) and constrains timing (the worker must wait for moonlight between lightning flashes). Setup, middle development (healing completes just as the moon brightens), and payoff (sextant resting on sill, healing again) all met. Cost: waiting under the moon, tick subtracting sorrow. Irreplaceable: without moonlight-healing, the sextant remains broken and the route is not revealed. Score: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Deconstruction is signaled in the worker's private desire ("I wanted the witness, not the sum"), becomes the explicit plan after the sextant reveals the hidden route ("I had to deconstruct the maze itself, not smash it"), and is dramatized on the page ("I loosened bolts, lifted panels, and wrote the bend numbers on my wrist"). The action drives the climactic turn (opening the hidden route to the parapet) and directly enables the ending (resetting stones into a smaller outward labyrinth). Causal pressure: deconstruction is the only way to reach the trees and release the dreams. Cost: the worker dismantles the municipal system stone by stone, a methodical defiance. Setup (desire to understand), middle development (plan formed), payoff (executed and redesigned). Irreplaceable: smashing or ignoring the maze would not yield witness or allow redesign. Score: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dream-mapping is introduced in paragraph one ("by mapping scattered dreams, you can chart where a mind has been"), practiced on the page (sweeping flakes into envelopes labeled with bend numbers), and paid off when the worker plots the sextant's nights "on my maintenance map beside the dream envelopes" to reveal the hidden route. The method shapes the middle beat (the drifting freed dreams form "a faint, practical compass") and is causally necessary for the ending (the dreams guide the worker). Setup, middle development, and payoff all present. However, the mechanics remain opaque—how do envelopes of sleep-flakes become a plotted compass?—and the method appears more symbolic than procedurally grounded. Cost is implied (collecting dreams is part of the worker's shift labor) but not visibly tied to a sacrifice. Score: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stormlit tower appears in the opening line, anchors every beat (internal labyrinth corridors, tower sill for the sextant, pocket chamber, tower roof parapet), and provides resources (moonlight for healing, the drain where the sapling grows, numbered stones to deconstruct). Moonlight is causally essential (heals sextant, enables measurement). Storm and lightning frame urgency and texture. The tower's architecture constrains the worker's path (internal labyrinth vs. hidden route to roof) and the final image (parapet where pines lean close). Setup (storm night, tower rounds), middle development (pocket chamber, sextant on sill), and payoff (parapet discovery, return inside) all met. Micro-setting (sill, drain, numbered stones) alters tactics. Cost: the worker must navigate the labyrinth's structure to redesign it. Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pin-drop timeframe is introduced mid-story ("At that moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, the maze always shifts") and marks the inciting reversal (chalk lines slide, the worker follows the sound to the sapling). It appears once as a trigger, returns conceptually in the ending ("I listened for the corridor pin and smiled"), but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions across beats. The storm and moonlight cycles provide loose temporal pressure (wait for moon to heal sextant, work through the night), but the pin-drop moment itself is more symbolic marker than time constraint. Setup missing (pin-drop not signaled early); middle development present (triggers the turn); payoff present but faint (mentioned in final beat). Swappable: another sound or threshold could trigger the maze shift. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The motivation is explicit in paragraph one ("I had a private hunger: to discover what trees witness") and drives every major choice (following the pin to the sapling, setting the sextant, deconstructing the maze, stepping onto the parapet). The worker's desire contrasts with the municipal duty (quantified sorrow vs. witness), creating friction. Setup, middle development (pursuit of answers via sextant and dreams), and payoff (reaching the pines, hearing their images) all met. However, the motivation is stated more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; the worker never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible emotional cost for prioritizing witness over duty. The ending fulfills the want without visible sacrifice on the page. Score: 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mundane miracles is taught early (sextant healing, dreams as flakes, numbered-stone system for grief) and sustained throughout (sapling in a drain, moonlight-stitched metal, dreams forming a compass, the final "mundane miracle that let grief be measured yet still heard"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: methodical and textural in the opening, breath-held in the pin-drop beat, charged at the parapet discovery, quiet in the ending. The final image ("I listened for the corridor pin and smiled") recharges the tone without shattering it. However, the tone reads more as consistent mood than dynamic charge that escalates with the worker's choices; the miraculous elements (sextant ticking, trees answering) are treated with calm acceptance rather than awe or cost. Setup, middle, and payoff met; tone constrains narration but does not dramatically tighten at closure. Score: 6.5.</comment>
