<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's chronological confusion is labeled but rarely shown to constrain on-page choices; the "yesterday arrives as a smell" phrasing reads more like ornamental lyricism than a functional impairment. Her motivation to negotiate with her ghost is clear, and the final choice to stop rewriting the night lands with visible cost (she gives up her images, her ambition fades). However, the ghost interaction feels more symbolic than embodied—internal contradiction and embodied emotion are present but not deeply particularized under pressure. The final renunciation earns the closure but doesn't reach the contradictory-impulses-acting-in-scene standard for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara collects fragments, the lagoon rearranges them, the ghost rises, payment is exchanged, the bolt is fixed, and the carousel settles—a meaningful deepening and tightening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara renounces the desire to rewrite the night and commits to small repairs, with visible cost (loss of her developed images and ambition). Orientation is legible by ~120 words (Mara on the stalled platform, kinetic lagoon, post-carousel-halt). The lens holds, and the cost is felt. However, the causality linking the ghost negotiation to the bolt repair feels slightly elided—Mara fixes the bolt "without spectacle" but we don't see her struggle with the tool or the decision in real time, which mutes the closure's immediacy and caps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is vividly rendered with specific, voice-filtered detail: "water looping in deliberate spirals that click like gears," "cloudlight is thin," "cloudcoat." Spatial choreography is clear—platform, railing, undercarriage—and sensory hierarchy fits Mara's scavenger focus. The lagoon constrains the ghost encounter (it lives in the mirrored water) and the final image charges when Mara "walks the rim of the kinetic lagoon above the clouds." The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting object that constrains choice (she clicks it to release fragments). Economy is strong; no tourist-catalog sprawl. Setting reaches the 9+ gate but a few generic phrases ("the park," "the ride") and the lack of tactile interaction with the bolt itself (we're told she fixes it, not shown the wrench or struggle) keep it just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mara wants to negotiate with her ghost to stop running in circles. The ghost demands payment; Mara offers her images; the ghost provides the missing bolt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost "tests whether Mara will flinch" and she does—raising the cost of the exchange. The resolution is earned by Mara's choice to give up her images and ambition, forecloses a path (no longer trying to be the park's savior), and carries felt cost. However, the escalation is more declarative than dramatized—we're told she "flinches," told her ambition "fades," rather than shown the internal struggle in real time. The bolt repair itself is summarized ("climbs under…fixes the bolt") rather than enacted beat-by-beat, which dulls the agency and caps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—regret, the cost of ambition, the choice between grand gestures and small repairs—emerges organically from Mara's choices and the lagoon's mechanics. The final image ("tend the small repairs that time allows") reweights prior material without stating a moral. The camera wheel and ghost motifs recur with shifting meaning: first tools of scavenging, then payment, then instruments of peace. Subtext operates in gesture ("the ghost…nods in three ages at once") and the lagoon's rotation resuming "not to entertain anyone, but to keep the park aloft." No thematic echo or explicit moralizing. However, the phrase "she is tired of running in circles that never move" borders on articulating the thesis, and the resolution feels slightly tidy—Mara's transformation is asserted more than we feel it degrade and rebuild on the page. Strong but not flawless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyrically controlled: "yesterday arrives as a smell and tomorrow as a bruise," "the horses settle as if released from holding their breath." POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and scavenger-tuned. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chronologically confused," "eroded into this careful scavenging," "fractured stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. The voice reads as authorial lyricism rather than Mara's internal idiom, and under peak stress (the ghost encounter) the prose maintains the same ornate texture instead of compressing or shifting. No dialogue to judge. The final image is strong but the register mismatch and lack of rhythmic modulation under pressure cap the score in the high-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and imagistic but heavily figurative throughout, with metaphor density high even in expository beats: "clouds rub their bellies against the struts," "developed later on the undersides of her eyelids," "where the cloudlight is thin." Several lines loop or restate: "she is tired of running in circles that never move" echoes "keep the horses circling forever and prove she could outrun loss." The phrase "the ghost rises as a wavering outline…and it speaks first with the bride's laugh" is then immediately paraphrased: "The ghost demands payment for peace." Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Once, before her ambitions…" / "Now she wants only…" / "The ghost lives…" / "Regret has taught her…" Clarity is serviceable but the figurative density and some paraphrase loops apply −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7. Strong imagery but not zero-artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, chronological confusion from mist, disposable camera wheel, and ghost negotiation offer a fresh synthesis. The concept of negotiating with one's past self through fragments and a living water mirror is specific and non-obvious. The choice to fix a bolt rather than restart the carousel is a quiet, particular turn. However, the "scavenger repairs magical ride" frame echoes familiar redemption arcs, and the ghost-as-younger-self confrontation is a well-worn device. The piece transforms these through the lagoon's mechanics and Mara's renunciation, but the transformation feels incomplete—the bolt repair is told, not shown, and the stakes (keep the park aloft) remain abstract. Originality is present but not fully earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (resolute scavenger) is present early, drives the ghost negotiation (middle beat), and makes the final choice to stop rewriting and tend small repairs (closure). Her scavenging method shapes tactics (she collects fragments, clicks the camera wheel, releases them to the lagoon). However, her agency in the bolt repair is summarized rather than shown, and her "resoluteness" is asserted more than demonstrated through on-page struggle. Two strong beats plus closure participation, but swappability (any determined character could negotiate) and summary-only bolt work lower the score. Round down to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel appears early (first third), is used twice (she "turns it one click for every story fragment" and "clicks the camera wheel" at the lagoon), and is pocketed at the end as a tool. It enables her to capture images that become payment. However, its mechanics are vague—how do "tiny shutters steal pale images from the lagoon" and why does the ghost want them?—and removing it would not break the story logic; she could offer memories directly. Two beats plus closure mention, but mid-band swappability and unspecified cost cap the score at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" is signaled early ("before her ambitions eroded into this careful scavenging"), shapes her present stance (no longer wants to run the carousel, only to negotiate), and is paid off at closure when "her old ambition fades further, until the desire to be the park's savior is only a dry taste." The concept constrains her options—she no longer pursues grand gestures—and the cost is visible (she gives up her images). However, the erosion is told rather than shown in a beat-by-beat struggle. Three gates met, causal pressure present, closure linkage strong, but summary-only development and some swappability (any regretful character) cap the score at 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is labeled early and given vivid imagery ("yesterday arrives as a smell and tomorrow as a bruise"). To keep footing, she collects story fragments—suggesting the trait enables her method. However, we never see her confusion constrain an on-page action with cost; she navigates the scene without temporal disorientation affecting her choices. The trait is ornamental: mentioned, explained, but not dramatically tested. Setup present, no middle development, no closure cost. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; subtract −0.4 for ornamental use. Round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Regret" is named early ("Regret has taught her to be precise"), motivates the ghost negotiation (she wants to stop rewriting the night), and is renounced at closure ("she will stop trying to rewrite the night"). The major turn—offering her images—traces to regret. However, the emotion is labeled more than embodied; we're told she "flinches" and "remembers the halt…as a lifetime" but don't see her wrestle with the memories in a beat. Three gates met, causal pressure present, but summary-only middle work and label-heavy execution apply −0.5 to −0.7. Eligible up to ~6.1 with all gates; round down to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By collecting fragments of overheard stories" is signaled early (end of first paragraph), used in the middle beat (she "releases into the water the fragments she has gathered"), and referenced at closure ("listening for the next overheard fragment that might keep her honest"). The method enables the ghost negotiation—she offers fragments, the lagoon rearranges them, the ghost responds. Her collection is ongoing and shapes her scavenger identity. Three gates met, causal pressure strong, closure linkage clear. However, we see only one act of collection (the fragments are already gathered when the scene starts), so the mechanics are told more than shown. Strong integration but one summary-only beat caps the score at 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is present in the opening line ("after the carousel halts"), is the site of the ghost negotiation (middle beat), and resumes rotating at closure to "keep the park aloft and the stories from sinking into silence." It constrains choice: Mara must wait for the hour when "the lagoon slows," kneels to address it, and the ghost "lives in the mirrored water beneath the platform." The lagoon's mechanics (clicking spirals, rearranging words) are specific and irreplaceable. Three gates met, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong, visible cost (the lagoon's rotation is the measure of peace). Strong integration; minor swappability (any magical water) and one late penalty (final rotation is told, not shown) apply −0.3 to −0.4. Round down to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" is the opening anchor and sets the story's present. Mara waits for "the hour that is both midnight and noon" to negotiate—suggesting time pressure. However, the timeframe is more poetic than functional; no ticking clock alters her tactics, and the "midnight and noon" convergence is a single moment, not a tightening window. The halt is the inciting condition but doesn't escalate. Setup strong, middle ambiguous (the hour is mentioned but not shown to constrain), closure absent (the carousel doesn't restart; time is static). Two gates (setup + weak middle) eligible to ~6.0; subtract −0.2 for vague clock. Round down to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To negotiate with one's own ghost" is stated early ("she wants only one negotiation"), drives the middle beat (she kneels, releases fragments, the ghost rises and demands payment), and is resolved at closure (she agrees to stop rewriting and the ghost nods). The motivation is tested: the ghost "tests whether Mara will flinch" and she does, raising the cost. Friction between want (peace) and cost (giving up her images and ambition) is visible. Three gates met, causal pressure strong, closure linkage clear, cost legible. Strong integration; minor summary-only work (the flinch is told) and some swappability (any regret-driven character) apply −0.2 to −0.3. Round down to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is signaled in the opening ("the park goes quiet enough to hear the clouds rub their bellies") and returns at the negotiation ("the hour that is both midnight and noon, when the lagoon slows and the air holds a fractured stillness"). The tone modulates: quiet at the start, charged during the ghost encounter ("the ghost rises…and it speaks first with the bride's laugh, then with the child's sob"), settling again at closure ("the carousel does not start, but the horses settle as if released from holding their breath"). Coherent through turns, charges the final image. However, the tone is more consistent than modulating—the prose maintains the same lyric register throughout, even under peak pressure. Three gates met, closure linkage strong, but static texture and some poetic redundancy apply −0.3 to −0.4. Round down to 7.3.</comment>
