<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's motivation is clearly established—exile for wanting "light without using fire"—and his final choice to work with children rather than return to the furnaces shows earned trajectory. The interiority carries distinct texture ("longing had led his mother to the furnaces and his father to silence"), though the generational-pattern meditation occasionally flattens into abstract philosophizing rather than embodied tension. The caretaker automaton's warning crystallizes the stakes, but Lior's response feels more considered than conflicted in the moment. Micro-choices (tightening knots, counting turns) anchor his internal state effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: Lior chooses the "slower transit" to the outskirts, forgoing immediate return and accepting generational timescale for change, visible in "the Garden watched their first wheel glow, troubling in its gentleness." Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—violet dust, falling petals, gear grooves, and radiance accumulate meaning through the transit, then the final image (children's shared wheel) reweights the premise with quiet authority. Orientation anchors early (Nebula Garden, exile context, calculating gear). One substantive deepening when the automaton warns of unintended consequences raises the conceptual price legibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Nebula Garden is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "violet dust hung like pollen," "blooms the size of sails," "wall of condensed starlight that approximates infinity." The hollow reed for sonar pinging and the gear carving "faint grooves that glimmered without heat" function as micro-setting that constrains navigation and becomes the story's central image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the transit (moth-harness, floating boulders, observatory clearing). The environment pressures the final choice: children "tended night seedlings" at the outskirts, a setting-detail that enables the ending and charges it with generational hope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: find a way to share light without repeating ancestral harm. The automaton's warning—"if he carried this radiance home, his people might replace their furnaces and forget the discipline that kept them from colder darks"—meaningfully tightens options and introduces trade-off cost. Lior's agency drives escalation: he builds the harness, follows the grooves, offers the gear, then chooses the slower path with visible consequence (foregoing immediate return, accepting generational timescale). One beat deepens under the Accumulative lens when the gear's radiance spreads and redefines what "sharing light" means. The resolution is earned by his renunciation of the furnaces with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—breaking generational loops through shared, gentle measure rather than individual fire—emerges from concrete particulars: the calculating gear that requires "many hands turned together," thesonar reed teaching, the night seedlings. The final image "promised a future that might finally break the loop" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Lior's choice to teach children rather than confront elders embodies the thematic question in action. The phrase "troubling in its gentleness" at closure reweights serenity and radiance with undeniable ambiguity, acknowledging cost without tidy resolution. Minor slip: "generational patterns were stitched into the place" drifts toward stated theme early, though subsequent imagery grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lior; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries distinct texture ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "believing light could be learned"). Perceptual signature is selective: he "felt each fall as a memory," reads "return notes in his bones," recognizes "the old pattern" in his breath's echo. Diction stays within the focalizer's register—elevated but consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Minor density slip: "repeating families, repeating errors" and the phrase "the quiet sigh of falling petals" recurs three times, the third instance ("Across the quiet sigh of falling petals, the Garden watched their first wheel glow") feeling slightly over-planted rather than earned reprise, though it does charge the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose carries high information density and vivid sensory specificity: "gliding moth," "grooves that glimmered without heat," "moonlit water." Sentence rhythm modulates effectively, and no major grammar or continuity breaks appear. However, three distinct artifact types lower the score: (a) mild paraphrase loop—"generational patterns were stitched into the place: starvines coiled as their ancestors had, and even the drifting spores pulsed in cycles" restates the concept across adjacent clauses; (b) the timeframe phrase "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times, the final use reading template-like rather than organically repurposed; (c) filter-verb stack in one passage ("believed," "felt," "recognized") dulls immediacy. Artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion in non-closure beats. Apply cumulative artifact penalty ~−0.8 and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb-stack rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of calculating-machine gear, sonar navigation, and generational teaching offers a specific, non-obvious angle on the "breaking cycles" premise. The image of children building "small gears in shared frames that made radiance only when many hands turned together" feels particular to this story's logic. Risk-taking in structure (extended lyric transit, personified Garden, automaton as thematic mirror) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Deduction: the premise—exiled idealist seeks gentler alternative, warned of unintended consequences, chooses grassroots change—maps closely to familiar template arcs; transformation is present but moderate, preventing top-band entry. Within-band risk bonus (+0.3) applied for the hollow-reed sonar and gear-as-radiance mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lior (otherworldly sentimentalist) drives key choices: building the harness, offering the gear, choosing the outskirts over the furnaces. Present in setup (exile context), development (the transit and automaton exchange), and payoff (teaching children). His sentimentalist nature is shown in action—listening to blossoms, trusting "simple arithmetic of rotation more than his longing," recognizing the "old pattern" and refusing to repeat it. Two substantive beats (offering the gear, choosing the slower transit) are character-specific. Mild swappability: "sentimentalist" reads more as label than irreplaceable trait shaping tactics; "idealist" or "visionary" could substitute with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, −0.5 swappability = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear appears in setup ("carried a single calculating machine gear in his pocket"), is handled in two distinct beats (set on stone and pressed to ear; tied to moth-harness and spun to carve grooves), offered as token to the automaton, then set into the automaton's chest to emit radiance—functionally four touches across beginning, middle, climax, and ending. Its properties (teeth, rotation, arithmetic, cool radiance) are irreplaceable and causally active: the grooves guide Lior, the radiance becomes the story's answer to "light without fire," and the children's shared gears in the ending directly reprise it. Cost: Lior relinquishes the relic. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4, −0.6 for late transformative use (radiance property emerges only in final third) = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generational patterns shape Lior's dominant stake from the opening: "every petal…carried the whisper of repeating families, repeating errors," his mother's and father's fates, his vow "not to repeat them," and the automaton's teaching that "every traveler arrived carrying an inherited wound." The concept drives two key choices: his refusal to return to the furnaces (avoiding repetition) and his decision to teach children (breaking the loop through shared practice). The ending image—"a future that might finally break the loop"—directly articulates the concept's reweighting with visible cost (generational timescale, uncertain success). Minor penalty: the concept is also stated abstractly ("generational patterns were stitched into the place") early, reducing its discovery through action. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, −0.6 for some ornamental/stated use, −0.3 for partial swappability (could be "cyclical harm" with edits) = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" anchors the setting ("a wall of condensed starlight that approximates infinity, extending beyond every ping as if the Garden had no edge") and recurs when Lior teaches children "to listen for the wall that approximates infinity." It functions thematically—marking an unreachable horizon that defines the Garden's limits—and guides sonar-pinging method. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Lior does not navigate around it or sacrifice an option because of it. The attribute is setting-specific and irreplaceable in texture, but its causal role is passive (backdrop). Score: setup +0.4, one beat (teaching mention) +0.4, thematic coloring +0.5, closure participation (children listen for it) +0.4, −0.5 for no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the attribute itself = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transit structures the entire middle: Lior plans it, executes it (moth-harness through dense nebula), and the journey delivers the automaton encounter that redefines his mission. Setup (planning the transit), development (sonar pinging, floating boulders, reaching the observatory), and payoff (returning "not to the furnaces but to the outskirts") all hinge on transit. The action is causally irreplaceable—without the journey, no automaton, no radiance-gift, no children. Cost: time, effort, the "slower transit" acceptance. Minor swappability: "journey" or "voyage" could substitute the word, but the function (crossing the nebula to find new knowledge) is specific. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5, −0.3 for word-level replaceability = ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is signaled in setup ("built a wand from hollow reed and used sonar pinging, clicking his tongue into the tube and reading the return notes in his bones"), used functionally in the transit (reveals "floating boulders wrapped in vine" and the infinity wall), and taught to children in the ending. Mechanics matter: it enables navigation where "sight failed." However, the method is not tested under pressure—no moment where sonar fails or forces a tactical choice with cost—and it could be replaced with another low-tech navigation tool (echolocation via hand-claps, a magnetic compass for nebula currents) with modest edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enablement +0.7, closure linkage (teaching) +0.6, −0.6 for moderate swappability, −0.4 for no moment where the method's limits create cost = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The Nebula Garden pressures every choice: violet dust and falling petals mark time and memory, "sight failed" forces sonar navigation, floating boulders and the infinity wall define the transit's challenge, the observatory offers the automaton and the radiance solution, and the "outskirts, where children tended night seedlings" enables the ending. The setting is causally active across setup (exile context, Garden serenity), development (dense nebula transit, observatory discovery), and payoff (children at the outskirts). Its properties are irreplaceable: no other locale supplies the starvines, spores, and cyclical imagery that ground the generational theme. Cost: the Garden's "troubling" serenity and its teaching that "every traveler arrived carrying an inherited wound" shape Lior's final renunciation. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, −0.6 for the Garden being partially backdrop rather than active antagonist in every beat = ~7.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times, framing the opening, a middle turn ("Each evening, across the quiet sigh of falling petals, he set the gear on a stone"), and the ending. It evokes a slow, generational timescale and charges the final image with melancholy patience. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or create a live clock—no moment where Lior must act before the next petal falls or where delay costs him an option. The phrase is more atmospheric cadence than functional constraint. Setup (present), lyric reprise (ending), but missing middle development as a pressure mechanism. Score: setup +0.4, closure reprise +0.6, thematic coloring +0.5, −0.7 for no causal constraint or tactic alteration, −0.5 for being descriptive rather than clock-driven = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to share light without using fire" is dramatized in action: Lior's exile for this desire, his belief the gear "could count the Garden's loops and find a gap where a new kind of light might enter," his offer of the gear to the automaton, and his teaching children to build shared radiance-wheels. The desire conflicts with inherited patterns ("longing had led his mother to the furnaces") and the automaton's warning, forcing him to choose a slower, uncertain path with visible cost (forgoing immediate return, accepting generational timescale). The motivation shapes three beats (exile setup, gear-offer, children-teaching) and charges the closure. Minor penalty: the phrase "share light without using fire" is restated almost verbatim, slightly reducing subtext. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, friction/cost +0.6, −0.4 for one moment of told-only restatement = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("the Garden offered serenity, yet its calm troubled him") and modulates purposefully: lyric melancholy in the opening, tactile focus during the transit, hushed exchange with the automaton, quiet resolve in the ending. The phrase "troubling in its gentleness" at closure directly names and reweights the tone, charging the final image with ambiguity (hope shadowed by uncertainty). However, the tone is mostly consistent rather than dynamically shifting under pressure—no moment where serenity breaks into urgency or trouble sharpens into dread. Score: setup +0.6, coherent modulation +0.8, closure charge +1.2, thematic integration +0.7, −0.6 for limited tonal range (remains in quiet-reflective band throughout), −0.3 for the final naming of "troubling" being slightly on-the-nose = ~6.9.</comment>
