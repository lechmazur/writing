<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession is rendered with vivid specificity ("brushing hair into flattering arcs after breath had fled"), and her motivation to capture sparks is established early. However, her internal contradiction remains largely assertion rather than enacted struggle—she fears the threshold "not for herself but for her clients" but this stance is never tested by competing impulses on the page. The final choice to release the spark into the aurora feels thematically apt but lacks visible cost; we don't see what she foregoes or what path this forecloses, only that she descends "with empty hands and a steadier breath."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mara learns that "attention can keep the crossing from being cruel" and chooses to infuse the captured spark into the sky rather than hoard it, reweighting her stance on preservation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and ritual detail rather than because/therefore linkage—and holds to the end. Cost is legible in the shift from fearful custodian to willing releaser, though the specific price (what she loses by not keeping the spark) could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora supply vivid anchors ("frost-slick stone," "stone bier rimed with ice") and the setting constrains Mara's ritual: only here does "the aurora's whisper meet the planet's silence without interference." The emerald chip on Orin's tongue catches the aurora light and scatters it into his throat, making the environment integral to the closure mechanism. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory detail (the "crackle" of static, the "radiant hush") modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake—capturing Orin's final spark before oblivion—drives the entire arc. The ritual's escalation (unpacking tools, placing the chip, drawing circles, counting crackles) tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, and Mara's final decision to release rather than hoard the spark constitutes a meaningful deepening of her stance. However, the stakes remain largely internal and abstract; no live obstacle or counterpressure tests her agency, and the cost of her choice (what she loses by not keeping the spark) is felt more as philosophical acceptance than as a trade-off with visible consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: "every life ends at a threshold of stillness, but attention can keep the crossing from being cruel." The emerald chip accumulates meaning across beats (pried from a saint's ring, placed on Orin's tongue, warmed by his final spark, released into the aurora), and the final image—green thread ascending into colored light—reweights the premise without stating a moral. The story resists tidy resolution; Mara's gift to the dark is an act of renunciation that transforms her practice without erasing the stakes. No thematic echo mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "beautician mortician" signals both profession and perceptual bias, and diction remains consistent ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush"). Psychic distance is stable; we track Mara's interior sensory processing (the hum like "distant radio snow," the corridor of pale faces) without head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure—short, percussive clauses during the ritual, then longer cadences at closure. Minor slips include occasional filter stacks ("she believed," "she understood") that slightly dull immediacy in a few lines, but these do not obscure clarity or flatten the peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Those shifting specks formed a map toward what she called the threshold of stillness" establishes method, stakes, and voice simultaneously). However, the prose carries noticeable overwriting in the first half: stacked metaphors ("pearl caught in a net of light"), elevated register ("lucidly watchful" repeated as both attribute and description), and paraphrase loops (the static becomes "clear enough to follow" after already being described as forming "a map"). The closure paragraph is cleaner, but the density artifacts in setup beats justify the deduction here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician-mortician, skyborne grotto, and static-as-navigation offers a fresh angle on threshold/farewell material. The emerald chip as vessel for a final spark, and the choice to release rather than hoard, feel specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in structure (sustained ritual without external antagonist) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the grotto-as-liminal-space and aurora-as-mystical-beacon are familiar fantasy tropes, and the piece does not fully transform them—removal of the skyborne setting would weaken atmosphere but not break the core logic of Mara's choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession shapes every beat: she unpacks tools "as if for a wedding," draws circles "that once coaxed life into dull hair," and braids Orin's hair "one final time." Her choice to release the spark into the aurora rather than keep it is the story's climactic turn and forecloses the path of hoarding. The beautician-mortician synthesis is indispensable to voice, ritual logic, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears early ("pried from a saint's ring"), is placed on Orin's tongue to catch aurora light, warms as it shelters his spark, and is released into the sky at closure—four distinct beats with escalating function. Its properties (size, color, origin, ability to hold a "stubborn glimmer") are irreplaceable: no generic token could perform the same causal work. Cost is tied to the chip's final use: Mara's satchel is "now heavier with borrowed light," then she chooses to infuse the stored spark into the sky, making the chip's trajectory essential to her arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Threshold of stillness" is signaled early as "the exact point where a soul stops trembling and slips into blankness," shapes Mara's entire method (counting intervals, tucking memories into brightness), and is explicitly articulated as Orin's last lesson at closure. The concept constrains her ritual tactics and reweights her understanding of her work. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" describes the dead in Mara's care in the opening, recurs as a trait of Orin's face during the ritual, and is negated at closure ("no longer lucidly watchful") to signal his transition. The attribute signals stakes and charges the ending image, but it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—Mara's actions proceed identically whether or not Orin appears watchful. It functions more as thematic marker than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Infuse" governs the story's climactic action: Mara "began to infuse the chip's glimmer into him by drawing tiny circles," and at closure she chooses to "infuse that stored spark into the sky." The verb recurs with escalating stakes (first into Orin, then into the aurora) and is irreplaceable—substituting "transfer" or "release" would flatten the alchemical texture that defines her practice. The action shapes both the ritual mechanics and the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is introduced early ("she learned to read it by finding patterns in static"), enacted on the page (counting crackles, following intervals), and resolved at closure when "the static in her head resolved into a new pattern, not a map to fear but a lullaby for endings." The method constrains her ritual choices and supplies the mechanism for capturing and releasing the spark. Removing it would require a completely different skill set and break the story's sensory logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is established in the opening line and justified as "the only place where the aurora's whisper met the planet's silence without interference," making it necessary for Mara's work. The stone bier and ice-rimed surfaces supply ritual staging, and the aurora actively participates (deepening during the ritual, accepting the spark at closure). However, the grotto could be replaced with another remote sanctuary without fundamentally altering the ritual logic—its elevation and aurora-proximity intensify atmosphere but do not impose unique tactical constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to capture one last spark before oblivion" drives every action: her climb to the grotto, the ritual preparation, the counting of crackles, and the final choice to release rather than hoard. The motivation is dramatized through conflicting pulls—fear of the threshold versus belief in preservation—and the ending reconfigures it from fearful capture to generous release. The cost (giving up custody of the spark) is legible on the page and tied directly to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is embodied throughout: the opening's "pearl caught in a net of light," the ritual's "quiet light," the moment when "a sigh of light...filled the grotto with a radiant hush," and the closure's aurora spilling "like colored water." Tone modulates appropriately—hushed reverence during preparation, intensified stillness at the peak, then gentle release. The phrase appears explicitly at the climactic beat and recurs in Mara's resolve to meet the next face "with the same radiant hush," charging the final image and making the tone indispensable to closure.</comment>
