<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular: her sleeplessness, the notebook pressed damp against her ribs, the inherited duty that makes her "shyly unstoppable." The descent to the Heart-Cistern shows embodied stakes—"fingers shook with all the nights she had not slept"—and her final refusal to claim credit is earned by established modesty. Minimal internal contradiction or visible flaw; she is competent and dutiful without struggle that complicates the choice. The elders and captains' grandchildren remain functional pressures rather than developed characters, fitting the scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly: Nacre, the shell, Mara's role. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered myth (Sea-Knife War, Iren's vanishing, the original armistice) toward the Heart-Cistern climax where the postcard's sacrifice and the lullaby's echo trigger the lilies' renewal—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the blossoms open, anger softens, the cycle renews) with visible cost (the postcard torn and sunk, Iren's message consumed). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the image of the postcard sinking and Mara's sleepless vigil continuing "into another century."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell's architecture—ribs, Spiral Atrium, Heart-Cistern—guides Mara's descent and the lullaby's resonance; the off-key wind that "threaded the passages" becomes a functional carrier. The pearl-colored pool and blackened root-hairs create vivid micro-setting. Sensory detail is purposeful: "the taste of the air" delivers Iren's message, and the blossoms' light "traveled through the city like dawn through kelp" charges the final image. The shell's physical properties (calcium ribs that hum, coiled passages that echo) constrain her method and anchor the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: renew the armistice before war returns. The drought-lean sea and blackening lilies raise urgency; Mara's solo descent into the Heart-Cistern tightens options (only she can deliver the message). The postcard's sacrifice—tearing and sinking it—is a visible cost that narrows tactics and triggers the lilies' revival. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through myth-layering and culminates in the sing-and-sink ritual that transforms the captains' grandchildren from anger to listening. One meaningful escalation; the final image of blossoms opening and anger softening forecloses the path to war with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "Peace is a plant that must be watered with memory, not fear" is delivered not as thesis but as sensory realization ("the taste of the air"). Mara's mission to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" integrates with the lilies' metabolic trick (salt and sorrow into sugar) without overt moralizing. The recurring motif of sleeplessness and the postcard's journey from heirloom to sacrifice charge the ending without stating a moral. The final image—blossoms rippling as "a postcard returned without paper"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of sustaining peace across generations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric—"reef-shadow joy," "ensconcing her in a cradle of calcium and tide"—creating a distinct texture that remains consistent under pressure. The narrative voice filters setting and action through Mara's quiet, poet's sensibility. No dialogue on the page; the lullaby and Iren's message are embedded perceptions rather than spoken lines. Psychic distance is controlled, though the high register risks minor ornamental drift in peak beats ("the taste of the air" works; "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" reads slightly precious but remains voice-motivated).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with purposeful cadence: "She did not claim credit; she only kept singing softly until the shell, the blossoms, and the people held the tune." Figurative density is high—"reef-shadow joy," "kelp-dreams," "blooded sea," "galaxy postcard, glossy as fish-scale"—and while most land cleanly, cumulative stacking in non-peak beats (e.g., "off-key wind" + "calcium and tide" + "ink to green thread" within two paragraphs) approaches overwriting without quite crossing into opacity. Minor paraphrase loop: "the shell hummed" / "the shell's walls" echo function across paragraphs. No major scaffold or template cadence; information density is strong. Deduct −0.5 for figurative density that slightly dulls momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bioluminescent diplomacy, inherited song-magic, and architectural mythos feels specific and non-obvious; the armistice signed "in living petals" rather than ink, and the metabolic conceit (salt/sorrow → sugar) offer fresh angles. The postcard as both relic and consumable message is a strong particular. The "reef-shadow joy" frame and the sleepless Night-Singer role avoid stock poet or diplomat tropes. Risk-taking in lyric density and the Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional arc loses its anchoring in Nacre's shell-architecture and the lilies' specific biology. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her descent + postcard sacrifice drive the climax. Setup: first paragraph. Development: she deciphers the embossed map and descends. Payoff: she tears and sinks the card, triggering the lilies' revival. Two gates clearly met; closure linkage is strong (her action enables the resolution). Causal pressure: her choice to sacrifice the heirloom postcard narrows options and forecloses Iren's direct answer. Cost is visible (the postcard destroyed, her sleeplessness continuing). Insomniac detail colors perception but does not constrain a key choice on the page; "poet" identity is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. Band guidance suggests ~6.0–6.5; settle at 6.2 for strong setup, middle action, and closure linkage with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard is introduced early (first paragraph: "kept it tucked against her heart") and handled in three beats: (1) studied for the embossed map, (2) floated on the Heart-Cistern pool, (3) torn and sunk to deliver Iren's message. Setup, development, and payoff all present. It drives the middle turn (deciphering the map) and the climax (sacrifice releases the hidden message). Causal pressure: the postcard's destruction is irreversible and triggers the lilies' renewal. Closure linkage: its sinking delivers the peace message and Mara imagines light as "a postcard returned without paper." Specificity: the galaxy spiral and blank-back embossing are unique properties. Cost: Iren's only relic is consumed. Strong across all three gates with beat involvement, causal work, and charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blossom armistice is the story's premise and dominant stake: the blackening lilies must be renewed to prevent war. Setup: second paragraph (enemy captains planted night-blooming mangrove lilies, swore peace). Development: the elders invoke it, Mara's mission is to reawaken the treaty. Payoff: the lilies burst into pale blossoms, captains' grandchildren soften. All three gates met. It shapes stakes on every page and the resolution depends on it. Causal pressure: the armistice's failure (blackening) creates urgency; its renewal alters the grandchildren's stance. The concept is enacted rather than merely echoed. Cost: the postcard sacrifice and Mara's continuing vigil are tied to sustaining it. Strong setup and closure; score ~6.4 for essential structural role with moderate tactical constraint in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "shyly unstoppable" appears explicitly in the first paragraph ("born shy, and she still spoke softly, yet the work in her chest made her shyly unstoppable"). Setup present. Development: her soft singing and refusal to claim credit reflect shyness; her solo descent and postcard sacrifice reflect unstoppability. Payoff: "she only kept singing softly" in the Spiral Atrium shows the duality persisting. Two gates met (setup and a lyric reprise at closure). The trait colors voice and choice but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with cost; she succeeds without friction from shyness. Label-only in setup; enacted quietly at closure. Band ~5.5–6.0; settle at 5.8 for early signal, closure presence, and modest causal shaping.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "ensconce" appears twice: (1) "the shell itself would… ensconce her in a cradle of calcium and tide" during descent, and (2) "to ensconce the hidden words among the roots" when she sinks the postcard pieces. Setup and payoff present; development is implicit (the shell's embrace enables her to reach the Heart-Cistern). Payoff drives the climax: ensconcing the words triggers the lilies' revival. Causal pressure: the act of placing the message among the roots is the story's decisive turn. Closure linkage strong. Cost: the postcard is consumed. Specificity: the dual use (spatial and ritual) feels purposeful but not irreplaceable—"place," "bury," or "deliver" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Strong closure work; moderate replaceability limits ceiling. Band ~6.5–7.0; settle at 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is introduced in paragraph four ("sang the way her mother had taught her… so the shell itself would repeat the tune") and used in two beats: (1) during descent, the spiral answers with echoes, and (2) at the Heart-Cistern, "the lullaby rose again, not from her throat now but from the shell's walls," triggering the root-hairs' brightening. Setup, development, payoff all met. Causal work: the lullaby's resonance is the mechanism of renewal. Closure: "she only kept singing softly until the shell, the blossoms, and the people held the tune." The off-key wind is a specific constraint that differentiates this from generic singing. Cost: ongoing effort,継続 vigil. Strong mechanical specificity and closure linkage; score ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is introduced in the opening line and structures the entire story: markets and nurseries in its chambers, ribs Mara walks, Spiral Atrium where elders meet, inner coil leading to the Heart-Cistern. Setup immediate. Development: the shell's passages carry the wind and echo her song; its architecture guides her descent. Payoff: the shell's walls amplify the lullaby, triggering the lilies' revival. The setting is not merely backdrop—its acoustic and spatial properties constrain her method and enable the resolution. Causal pressure: only by navigating the coil and using the shell's resonance can she deliver the message. Closure: the shell holds the tune alongside blossoms and people. Essential across all three gates with strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "across centuries of longing" appears in the second paragraph ("Across centuries of longing, her line had served the shell as Night-Singer") and echoes in the final line ("carry her, awake, into another century"). Setup and lyric reprise present; no middle development—the intervening action occurs within one night. The centuries frame intergenerational duty but do not create a live clock that alters tactics. The immediate urgency (blackening lilies, lean seas) drives pressure, not the deep-time scale. Cost: Mara's sleepless vigil will continue "into another century," a felt burden. Two gates (setup, payoff) with thematic resonance but minimal causal or tactical constraint. Band ~4.0–4.5; settle at 4.2 for early signal and closure echo with weak middle integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated explicitly in paragraph three ("she wrote to do the same, to photosynthesize pain into sorrow into sugar") and enacted through her mission: she descends to renew the armistice, sings to transform the blackened lilies, and imagines the blossoms' light reaching Iren. Setup present. Development: her apology to the water ("for wanting an answer") and the postcard sacrifice reflect the tension between personal longing (pain) and communal duty (beauty). Payoff: the lilies' transformation and Mara's feeling "useful rather than cursed" show the desire fulfilled. All three gates met. Friction: the cost of sleeplessness and the postcard's loss. The motivation drives choices and the resolution enacts it. Score ~6.7 for clear setup, middle friction, and closure satisfaction with moderate dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "reef-shadow joy" bookends the story: opening line and final paragraph ("The reef-shadow joy remained, because joy in Nacre was never bright without shadow"). Setup immediate. Development: the tone modulates through urgency (blackening lilies, lean seas), quiet descent (warm echoes, pearl pool), and climax (blossoms bursting, anger softening). Payoff: the phrase returns with added weight—joy persists "enough to carry her, awake, into another century"—reweighting the opening's premise. The duality (brightness/shadow) structures the emotional arc and charges the final image. Coherent across turns; purposeful cadence shift at closure. Strong setup and reprise with tonal control under pressure. Score ~7.3 for consistent modulation and closure charge.</comment>
