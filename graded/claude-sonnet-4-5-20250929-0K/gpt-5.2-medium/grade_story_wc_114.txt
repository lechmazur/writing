<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly embodied—fever breaking into clean perception, the weight of a swallowed truth lodged behind the tongue—and Mara's "peripherally aware" trait drives her gentle interrogation. The final confession to Eli arrives with visible cost (loneliness, the distortion acknowledged aloud) and forecloses the narrator's isolation. Minor slip: Eli's fury upon rescue is told rather than shown, slightly flattening what should be a high-pressure reunion. Internal contradiction (guilt as false reading vs. the loneliness it created) operates convincingly throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accretes pressure through layered reflection anchored to present objects (botanical illustration, smudged notebook, aurora) and micro-choices (pointing to a petal, speaking the confession aloud). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's certainties "sway without breaking" after the confession, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the false-certainty trap with felt relational cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One substantive tightening occurs when Mara smudges the field notebook, collapsing the binary of observation/confession and enabling the final truth-telling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The weather station supplies concrete constraints: iced door, rime-ice checks, radiosonde balloons, antenna mast. The botanical illustration with its penciled warning functions as micro-setting and recurs with reweighted meaning (chart of lungs, petal as moment of lie). The mountain and aurora are filtered through the narrator's feverish then clarified perception, grounding each turn. The smudged notebook is handled twice and alters the narrator's stance. Environment charges the final image: "auroral sorrow" and "stiff shoulders" under faint noon light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding and voicing the weight of the swallowed truth (the false wind report). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: fever-break clarity → Mara's gentle questioning → smudged notebook enabling ambiguity → final confession to Eli. One meaningful deepening: the narrator's realization that the secret's mass is loneliness, not meteorological guilt. Agency is renunciation of false certainty with visible relational cost. Minor gap: Eli's survival in a rock hollow arrives as summary convenience rather than earned complication, slightly softening the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth as pressure system, certainties that sway rather than break—emerges from concrete particulars: the smudged graphite fog, alternate sentence versions, the auroral metaphor for grief and forgiveness arriving "in fronts." The final image (certainties swaying without breaking under shifting auroral colors) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Mara's method of holding forecasts without forcing one to win subtly critiques the narrator's single false certainty. No thematic echo; the story trusts its images to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision laced with lyric metaphor (anemometer "returned…into my own ribs," truth "lodged behind my tongue"). Diction remains internally consistent—technical weather vocabulary blends with poetic register without jarring. Mara's speech ("truths behave like pressure systems") mirrors the narrator's idiom, acceptable within the station's shared professional context and the narrator's mediated recollection. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during fever-break and confession, slightly distanced when summarizing Mara's methods. One minor slip: "peripherally aware" is named rather than fully dramatized in every instance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and purposeful; figurative density is high but mostly coherent (aurora as sorrow-light, guilt as measurement, truth as swallowed weight). Two localized issues: "swaying and unmoored" in paragraph one is near-redundant with "swaying certainties" motif, creating slight synonym churn. The phrase "the night swung on" (hinge metaphor) competes with pressure-system and weight metaphors without clear integration. Information density is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion dips briefly in the mid-section summary of Mara's backstory method.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—weather-station setting, fault-tolerant oracle as confessor, graphite smudge as epistemological intervention—feels specific and non-obvious. The "swaying certainties" frame transforms a confession story by rejecting binary guilt/innocence in favor of held ambiguity. Risk: lyric compression and metaphor saturation could obscure, but the piece maintains clarity and stakes throughout. The botanical-illustration-as-chart-of-lungs and penciled warning "DO NOT TRUST THE WHITE" are fresh, purposeful details. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected. Transformation test passes: the story's emotional arc depends on this exact weather-station logic and imagery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (fault-tolerant oracle) appears early, asks the inciting question about swallowed truth, performs the notebook-smudging action, writes alternate sentences, and watches the final confession from the window. Her tolerance method enables the narrator's shift from single false certainty to multiple coexisting versions. Two distinct beats: interrogation and smudging; closure participation via window observation. Causal pressure: her intervention narrows the narrator's defensive options and opens confession. Slight swappability: another empathetic listener could fill the role with edits, though "fault-tolerant" and "occupying margins" are specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The botanical illustration of mountain avens appears in three beats: on the wall with penciled warning, traced by Mara as she discusses truth-as-pressure, set on the table as "chart of my lungs" for the petal-pointing exercise. Early signal (paragraph mid-first-third). Development: constrains the narrator's confession method (pointing to petal). Closure linkage: implied when "auroral sorrow" recalls the warning and petal metaphor. Specificity: the penciled note "DO NOT TRUST THE WHITE" and the petal-as-moment device are unique. Visible cost: pointing with trembling finger externalizes the narrator's vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is seeded early (fever-break paragraph), recurs as explicit stake ("my swaying certainties did not return solid"), and frames the resolution ("my certainties began to sway without breaking"). The concept drives tactics: Mara's smudging and alternate sentences are methods to induce sway rather than binary verdict. Closure: the final image depends on certainties swaying as forgiveness arrives. Causal pressure: the concept narrows the narrator's defensive single-reading and enables confession. Cost: accepting sway forecloses the false comfort of fixed guilt or innocence. Irreplaceable: no synonym for "sway" carries the same oscillation-without-collapse charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is attributed to Mara early, illustrated twice (catching tremor in hand, noticing unspoken clause), and applied at closure (watching "stiff shoulders" from the window). Development: enables Mara's method of reading the narrator's hover and tremble. Closure: her peripheral gaze frames the final forgiveness scene. Specificity: the trait justifies her oracle role. Cost: only obliquely shown—her peripheral stance might isolate her, but this is not dramatized. Swappability: "observant" could replace it with minor edits, though "peripheral" carries a margins-occupying resonance that coheres with Method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The smudge action occurs mid-story: Mara uses the pencil's blunt side to smear the line between observation and confession in the field notebook. Causal work: the smear "made room for what I would not name" and hides the false entry, enabling the narrator to later voice multiple versions instead of clinging to one. Development: directly alters the narrator's notebook (a record and symbol of fixed truth). Closure linkage: the ability to tell Eli "the whole thing…as a weather report that included my own distortion" flows from this enabling smudge. Irreplaceable: the physical graphite fog is tied to weather-station idiom and visual metaphor. Visible cost: erasing the clear line forfeits the narrator's defensive clarity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"By occupying margins where models disagree" is Mara's stated method, seeded early and applied when she writes alternate sentence versions in the botanical illustration's margins. Development: the margin-writing directly enables the narrator's shift to holding multiple truths. Closure participation: the method's fruit (swaying certainties) appears in the final image. Causal pressure: without margin-occupying, Mara's intervention would lack mechanics. Swappability: "holding ambiguity" could replace it with edits, though "margins" ties to the illustration's physical layout. Cost: implicit—occupying margins might mean forsaking center-stage certainty, but this is not dramatized for Mara herself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is established in the opening line and supplies tools (anemometer, radiosonde balloons, barometer, antenna mast, map table, radio), weather systems (blowing snow, rime ice, gusts), and the isolation that amplifies the narrator's secret. Setting constrains Eli's movements (door iced shut) and the narrator's confession timing (after rescue, at the station door). Closure: "faint noon aurora" and "station door" frame the final beat. Micro-setting: the wall-mounted illustration and notebook function as setting-objects. Irreplaceable: the weather-work idiom and pressure-system metaphor depend on this exact locale. Cost: isolation turns the lie into amplified loneliness.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After my fever broke" frames the opening and signals a clean-perception window. Timeframe tightens decisions: the narrator must reckon with the swallowed truth now that fever-distortion has lifted. Development: the fever-as-distortion backstory primes the present reckoning. Closure: "after the fever" logic carries through to the confession under "faint noon aurora." The clock is loose (blue hour to noon) but not vague. Cost: the post-fever clarity forecloses the narrator's feverish avoidance. Swappability: another recovery frame (sleep, storm-clearing) could replace it with edits, though fever ties to the body-heat and distortion motifs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is Mara's framing question (early signal), pursued through petal-pointing and margin-writing (development), and answered at closure: "the swallowed truth's real mass" is loneliness. The desire is dramatized in the narrator's hesitation to answer, the notebook smudging, and the final confession. Friction: wanting to name the weight conflicts with shame and the cost of admitting the lie. Visible cost: voicing the whole thing to Eli forecloses the narrator's defensive silence. Irreplaceable: "weight" and "swallowed" tie to the story's pressure and embodiment idiom. The motivation drives every major choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is seeded in the opening ("grief came with it, as if light itself remembered everyone it had lost"), modulates through the piece (aurora as metaphor for shifting certainties), and charges the final image ("as the sky's colors shifted with auroral sorrow"). Tone is coherent: elegiac, scientific, and tender without sentimentality. Modulation: tone tightens during the notebook-smudging and loosens slightly during Mara's exposition. Closure linkage: the tone's color-shift quality mirrors the swaying certainties and forgiveness arriving "in fronts." Specificity: "auroral" ties to the high-latitude weather station. Cost: the sorrow tone makes the forgiveness bittersweet rather than triumphant.</comment>
