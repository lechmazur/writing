<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leander's motivation is concretely tied to historical restitution and his renunciation is earned through the discovery. His "eloquently silent" trait operates consistently, shaping his method of influence without speech. Internal contradiction appears briefly in his scholar's hunger versus dynastic duty, though more friction would strengthen the middle beats. Embodied emotion remains somewhat muted; the key climax relies on presentation rather than visceral struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: intuition → hidden gramophone → Queen Nara's confession → abdication forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Leander abdicates, redirects the treasury, and marks the site for the next builder. Orientation anchors quickly (Leander, reading room, evening, search for proof). One meaningful tightening occurs when the standing-wave pattern points to the hollowed book, narrowing his path and raising the stakes of what he'll find.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room supplies the crucial hidden compartment and acoustic properties that enable discovery; the gramophone mechanism requires the room's architecture to function. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dust trembled," "pale ripples," "golden shadows" filter through Leander's scholar's lens. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cabinet to portrait to balcony. The room constrains choice by containing the secret, but does not pressure the climax action beyond serving as archive; a stronger tactile struggle with the mechanism or spatial obstacle would lift this into high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find proof to justify abdication) is signaled early and escalates through one major reversal: the standing-wave pattern redirects his search from aimless browsing to the specific book. The final choice—abdication with treasury redirection—emerges from his discovery and forecloses dynastic continuation with visible cost. Agency is clear: Leander's intuition-bridge and physical actions (cranking, adjusting horn, presenting evidence) drive each turn. Coincidence does not resolve; the hidden mechanism was planted by Nara for exactly this purpose, lending causal coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (restitution for foundational betrayal, breaking cycles by uncovering truth) emerges from concrete actions rather than statement. The bridge-of-intuition metaphor ties personal method to the stolen public-bridge plot, creating thematic resonance without overt claim. Queen Nara's final directive—"End us clean, and build what we denied"—risks moralizing but remains character-voiced command rather than authorial sermon. The final image (returning the crank handle "to mark where the next builder should begin") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material with quiet hope and visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Leander's perceptual signature: "eloquently silent way," scholar's idiom, intuition-bridging. Distance modulates purposefully from tight interiority ("intuition made a bridge inside him") to scene action. Register is consistent, though a few phrases risk elevated diction ("the dynasty ender," "the first widow of the dynasty"). No dialogue appears; the gramophone voice substitutes effectively. Rhythmic control under pressure holds, with sentence length compressing slightly during the discovery sequence, though the climax could tighten further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no significant template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high in the discovery beats (crank → notch → second gramophone → ledger → wax strip → voice). Minor overwriting appears: "eloquently silent" recurs three times, and "golden shadows" bookends risk decorative repetition. A few constructions lean ornate ("the first yawn of evening," "private bridge of intuition") but remain voice-motivated and legible. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the central sequence; the balcony scene summarizes the ministers' reaction rather than dramatizing resistance, a minor momentum dip before the quiet close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gramophone-as-room-recorder premise is fresh and the standing-wave visualization offers a non-obvious mechanism for discovery. Transformation of the "cursed lineage" trope through archival detective work and voluntary abdication adds specificity. The bridge-of-intuition / stolen-bridge pairing creates thematic synthesis. Risk: the narrative commits to its mechanical premise and follows through to abdication without hedging. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. The story would lose coherence with generic substitutions (e.g., a simple letter instead of acoustic playback), supporting originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leander (dynasty ender) is present throughout, his search frames the story, and his final choice to abdicate and redirect the treasury creates the decisive change. Setup: immediate. Development: intuition and search choices constrain middle beats. Payoff: abdication scene. Causal pressure is strong; closure depends on his role. Cost is visible (end of lineage, public admission). Swappability is low; removing "last prince" status breaks the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gramophone crank handle appears in at least four beats: discovery wrapped in velvet, insertion into portrait notch (unlocks compartment), winding the hidden gramophone (twice), and final return to the notch. Setup early, development in unlocking and playback, payoff in the marking gesture. Causal: without the crank, no discovery. Closure linkage: "returned the crank handle to the hidden notch… to mark where the next builder should begin." Irreplaceable; its specific mechanical function and symbolic return are integral.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bridge of intuition is named explicitly and shapes Leander's method: "intuition made a bridge inside him between this missing part and the sealed shelves." The metaphor parallels the stolen public bridge, linking personal process to historical crime. It enables the key turn (crank → portrait connection). Closure nods to it ("build what we denied") but does not return the phrase. Two gates solid (setup as method, development in the discovery choice); closure participation is thematic rather than direct, capping potential above 7.0 but strong within its band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is established early and recurs three times. It constrains: Leander does not speak to servants, and at the balcony "his silence, finally filled with truth, forced their attention more than any speech." Setup clear, development as trait-driven tactic, payoff in the climax. Cost: reliance on evidence over oratory; the trait enables a different kind of authority. Repetition risks label-only use in the middle, but the balcony beat dramatizes the tradeoff, supporting mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muse" (Leander "began to muse on its weight") triggers the intuition-bridge insight that leads to the portrait. Setup: early-middle. Development: the musing moment is brief but causal—it generates the connection that drives the next turn. Payoff: indirect; discovery follows from it. Swappability: moderate; "consider" or "reflect" could substitute with minor edits, capping above 7.0. The action's internal, contemplative nature limits physical specificity, but it does redefine options at a key juncture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through standing waves" describes the mechanism by which sound patterns in the room reveal the book's location. Setup: explained mid-story ("through standing waves it held the air"). Development: the dust ripples form the pattern that points to the engineering volume. Payoff: the method enables discovery, but once used it does not return. One gate strong (development/causal), closure participation absent. Mechanics matter in one beat; specificity is high (not easily swapped), but single-use limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sepia reading room is named in the opening line and houses all action until the balcony coda. Setup immediate. Development: the room supplies the hidden compartment, the acoustic properties for standing waves, and the archive that holds the ledger. Payoff: the room is the site of discovery; Leander returns the crank there to mark the spot. Causal pressure: without this specific space and its architecture, no discovery. Closure linkage: return gesture. Irreplaceable in function, though the sepia/golden palette risks decorative layer.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the first yawn of evening" / "golden shadows" / "as dusk deepened" anchor time poetically but do not create urgency or tighten decisions. Setup: opening line. Development: time does not constrain Leander's search; no clock pressure appears. Payoff: "dusk deepened" marks the end but passively. The timeframe is present and consistent, avoiding confusion, but lacks causal force. Swappable with any quiet time of day. Functional-replaceable band; no cost tied to the hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Leander's motivation ("to uncover a hidden truth buried in the family's own paper") is stated early and drives every choice: opening the cabinet, intuiting the portrait's secret, winding the gramophone, deciphering the ledger. Setup immediate. Development: the search is dramatized in multiple beats with micro-choices (which angle for the horn, pulling the book). Payoff: discovery fulfills the want and converts it into abdication. Friction: "needed proof stronger than rumor" creates a standard he must meet. Cost: finding the truth costs the dynasty. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening and returns near the end ("in the golden shadows of evening he felt the old room release its grip"). Tone is elegiac, contemplative, and sepia-toned throughout, modulating slightly as discovery nears but never breaking into sharp discord. Setup: opening image. Development: tone supports the scholar's mood and the archival atmosphere. Payoff: the golden-shadow reprise charges the moment of release. Coherence is strong; the tone does not pressure choices but does color the final image with continuity and quiet closure, supporting mid-to-upper 6s.</comment>
