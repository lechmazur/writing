<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradictions are present ("I see the next step and the last one, but never the whole map") and the motivation to be "worthy of being chosen" emerges clearly. However, the interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("Do you think you choose, or are you chosen by the choosing?") rather than embodied crisis choices under pressure. The final renunciation—accepting that "the walking walks you"—feels asserted more than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. The ash woman and dream sequences function more as symbolic guides than sources of genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist steps into the forest as the path "takes my weight like a handshake," crystallizing a shift from seeker to chosen walker. Cost is felt (leaving completes the bunker's purpose, foreclosing return) and the directive's decay pattern pays off. One meaningful deepening occurs when the blood-print unlocks the final map. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (rewilded forest, bunker, storm). The lens holds and closure lands with conceptual cost, though the "transcend" moment relies heavily on dream logic rather than concrete choice pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest constrain the protagonist's path: the wafer slot determines entry, roots and wires shape the dream-space, and storm pressure times the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven ("wet concrete and old batteries," "sweet, dusty scent"). The final image—"the path in front of me is new, pressed into wet leaf-mold, yet my feet know it"—charges the ending by making the environment active and complicit. The storm functions as both weather and deadline, tightening the window for action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering why paths choose walkers, evolving into proving oneself worthy of being chosen. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blood-print ritual grants the final directive ("WALK UNTIL THE WALKING WALKS YOU"), narrowing the protagonist's options to acceptance or refusal. The storm functions as temporal pressure. However, escalation relies more on dream logic and symbolic gestures than protagonist agency with visible tradeoffs. The ash woman's questions and the bunker's prompts guide rather than oppose, reducing friction. Cost is present but oblique: leaving completes the bunker's purpose and commits the protagonist to an open-ended walking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—whether paths choose walkers or walkers choose paths—emerges through the bunker's decaying directive, the crow's gift, and the forest's "patient will." The final image offers a non-literal answer: "foresight and hindsight meet in a present shaped by whatever chooses to walk with me," reweighting the binary into collaborative agency. The directive's decay parallels the protagonist's shift from command to surrender. Subtext operates through the ash woman's taunts and the forest's active selection. Minor slip: "transcend" in the final paragraph edges toward stating the thesis rather than dramatizing it, though the ending image largely rescues resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("limitation keeps me precisely playful, testing each fork like a joke with a blade hidden in the punchline"). Distance and focalization remain stable. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (dream corridors as "both hallway and river") support the accumulative design. Minor register drift occurs when interiority toggles between embodied ("grit in my teeth") and abstract ("transcend, through the same interpreted dreams"). Filter verbs ("I realize," "I understand") occasionally dull immediacy at peak beats, though the perceptual signature—dreams as interpretive tool—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several strong images ("vines have pushed through cracks, knotting around consoles like green fingers refusing surrender"). However, template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "I try to read... I lie down... I wake..." with repetitive first-person stems. Paraphrase loop: "my own memories wobble with it" immediately after "the directive is literally rotting, eaten by damp." The phrase "precisely playful" recurs as a label without evolving texture. Mixed metaphor: "words stuck like grit in my teeth" vs. "letters smear into mold" trades vehicles without coherence. Artifacts touch closure beats ("I do not command or surrender; I transcend"), applying −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rewilded bunker and dream-based wayfinding offer a fresh synthesis of post-collapse setting and spiritual recursion. The decaying directive—training walkers until one transcends—provides a non-obvious premise. However, the emotional arc (seeker → chosen) follows a familiar template of mystical acceptance without sharp resistance or subversion. The ash woman and crow function as archetypal guides rather than transformed tropes. Risk-taking in lyric structure and dream logic is present, but the closure's "transcend" declaration leans toward abstract resolution rather than grounded particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character "Foresight Hindsight Only" shapes the protagonist's interpretive stance and is named early. The trait enables dream navigation and the blood-print choice at the terminal. However, the character name functions more as thematic label than causal constraint; the limitation ("never the whole map") does not visibly block or complicate a choice on the page. Present in closure via the phrase "foresight and hindsight meet," but as summary rather than dramatized turning point. Two beats (dream navigation, terminal ritual) with moderate causal pressure. Swappability moderate: a near-synonym ("partial vision," "tunnel sight") could replace it with minor edits. No sharp cost tied to this specific limitation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wafer seal appears in three beats: discovery in crow's nest, insertion at the hatch, and blood-print reprise at the terminal. Each use advances plot: unlocks the bunker, then unlocks the final map. Causally essential to entry and the directive's final transmission. Specificity high: "soft as communion and hard as law" gives it ritualistic weight; the blood-print hybrid charges the second use. Closure linkage strong: the seal ritual directly enables the WALK directive and map. Minor swappability: another ritual object (key, token) could serve similar function with edits, though the communion/law duality is particular. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The decaying directive is signaled early ("directive painted on its walls is decaying now") and shapes stakes: the protagonist seeks to understand and complete it. The directive's fragmentation ("DIRECTIVE CONTINUES UNTIL PATH SELECTS WALKER") mirrors the forest's takeover and reweights the premise from command to collaboration. The final order ("WALK UNTIL THE WALKING WALKS YOU") alters the protagonist's options at closure. However, the directive functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; its decay does not block or redirect a specific choice mid-scene. Three beats (wall text, terminal scroll, final order) with moderate causal pressure. Closure linkage present but abstract: the concept charges the ending more than a concrete action does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "precisely playful" appears twice as a label: once in the opening self-description and once applied to the ash woman. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The phrase gestures toward the protagonist's testing of "each fork like a joke with a blade hidden in the punchline," but this remains metaphorical description rather than dramatized choice pressure. No middle beat where playfulness alters tactics or incurs a tradeoff. Ornamental use; high swappability. No closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The action "transcend" appears explicitly in the final paragraph: "I do not command or surrender; I transcend, through the same interpreted dreams." It names the closure shift from seeker to walker-in-collaboration. However, "transcend" is asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive physical or renunciatory act; the protagonist steps out, and the path responds. The blood-print ritual and dream navigation approximate transcendence but do not depend on the word itself. Swappability moderate: "merge," "yield," "become" could replace it with minor tonal edits. Closure linkage present but as summary label rather than irreplaceable action. Late explicit appearance (final third) and summary-only use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "through interpreted dreams" is signaled early ("my interpreted dreams insisted the answer waits") and recurs across three beats: the crow's nest vision, the bunker sleep sequence, and the final transcendence claim. Dreams enable discovery (seal location) and navigation (corridor-river walk), shaping tactics. The method constrains choice: the protagonist must sleep and interpret to access the directive's transmission. Closure participation: the final line invokes "interpreted dreams" as the means of transcendence. Specificity moderate: dream logic is particular to the piece but could be replaced by trance, ritual, or vision with edits. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker in the rewilded forest is introduced early and pressures every choice: the sealed hatch requires the wafer, vines and roots shape the interior space, the storm turns the ceiling into a drum. The setting's decay mirrors the directive's fragmentation and enables the dream transmission. The final beat depends on leaving the bunker and stepping into the forest path. Micro-setting (roots, wires, terminal) alters tactics during the sleep ritual. Three beats with strong causal pressure and closure participation. Specificity high: the bunker's dual nature (command post and organic reclamation) is irreplaceable. Minor swappability: another liminal ruin could serve, but the vine-draped detail charges the theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the storm approaches" is signaled early and recurs: lightning blinks rewrite the wall symbols, thunder drums the ceiling, rain seeps through cracks. The storm functions as deadline ("the storm is not only weather but a deadline") and tightens the ritual window. However, the storm does not force a specific tactical choice or create a live countdown; it atmospherically pressures without altering moves. Present in closure ("in the storm's first hard sheets I feel the forest taking my weight"), charging the final image. Two beats (realization of deadline, final departure) with moderate pressure. Swappability moderate: nightfall or flood could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths choose their walkers" is seeded early via the ash woman's whispered question and recurs in the terminal message and final reflection. It drives the protagonist into the bunker and through the ritual. The motivation shifts under pressure: "I understand my motivation was never curiosity alone but the need to be worthy of being chosen." This evolution shapes the blood-print choice and the acceptance of the final directive. However, the motivation is largely told through summary rather than tested by conflicting wants. Two beats (entry, realization of worthiness) with moderate friction. Closure linkage present: the final walk enacts the answer. Swappability moderate: "understand the forest's will" could replace it with edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone "ethereal grit" is sustained through diction: "wet concrete and old batteries" (grit) paired with "ash woman," "dream corridors," and "roots select water" (ethereal). The tone modulates coherently: concrete sensory detail anchors the lyric dream sequences, and the storm's physicality charges the abstract directive. The final image—"the forest taking my weight like a handshake"—fuses both registers. Tone shapes atmosphere but does not directly constrain a choice. Coherent across turns with purposeful modulation. Closure participation strong: the handshake image crystallizes the tone's fusion of material and mystical.</comment>
