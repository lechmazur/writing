<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Keir's interior stance ("serene anger," "consciously wild") is articulated but often told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The motivation to discover time-slowing is clear, but the character's journey from observer to actor arrives quickly without the embodied struggle that would earn the final resolve. Micro-choices exist (pouring ink, sending the drone, driving the knife) but feel more like plot functions than character-revealing decisions under pressure. The final promise reads as stated wisdom rather than a cost-bearing reconfiguration of his internal landscape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (Keir, post-eclipse encampment, mystery of time-slowing) and follows a clear causal chain: map clue → ink-pool travel → obelisk discovery → sabotage → return. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Keir returns with resolve and drone data, promising to "meet it awake" next time, foreclosing naive trust in authority with visible cost (the vanished proof, the need for future vigilance). The inferred lens is Causal with Situational pressure at the canyon; the escalation tightens options and the ending reweights his stance. One minor gap: the elders' demand for proof and Keir's workaround with drone data is compressed, slightly undercutting the felt cost of the evidence vanishing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, disappearing ink bottle, hummingbird drone, and canyon obelisk are rendered with specific, purposeful detail that supports the core action. The encampment anchors the frame; the ink pool becomes the method of travel; the obelisk is the constraint Keir must breach. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (cross-legged at camp, stepping into ink, emerging at canyon, returning via spirals), though the "corridor of slow-moving dust" and canyon replay lack grounding sensory detail that would charge the final image. The drone as micro-setting object constrains the climax choice (mapping the pulse, revealing the seam), meeting the 9+ gate test, but the canyon itself reads more as backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure escalates: Keir recovers the map, risks the ink-pool journey, confronts the obelisk replay under slowed time, and sabotages the device. The knife-strike is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the Council's control, a meaningful tightening with visible cost (he leaves evidence behind, elders demand proof he cannot give). The secondary layer (Council exploitation) converges cleanly at closure. One limitation: the obelisk's mechanics and the canyon ambush replay feel somewhat expository; the tension is declared ("slowed fighters blinked in stretched surprise") more than viscerally dramatized, reducing the felt weight of the confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: crisis as manufactured spectacle, power that profits from terror, the choice to meet fear with conscious calm. The final note—"Time slows because someone profits from terror, so we will learn to be calm and angry at once"—borders on direct statement but is contextualized as a fading message rather than authorial declaration. The story invites reflection on surveillance, exploitation, and the cost of clarity, though the thematic answer feels slightly over-articulated. The disappearing ink recurs with reweighted meaning (proof that vanishes vs. data that persists), a purposeful motif that charges the ending without becoming a checklist symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Keir throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated-lyric register ("serene anger," "consciously wild," "ephemeral patterns") that fits the tracker's reflective stance but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the world thickened and seconds stretched"). Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, zooming in for micro-choices and pulling back for the journey. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. At peak pressure (canyon sabotage), the prose maintains texture but leans on passive constructions ("was being used," "could have fled") that slightly dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (ink vanishing when truth approaches, arrows hanging like syrup) but could be more idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries notable overwriting in figurative clusters: "the world thickened and seconds stretched," "sky had become syrup," "someone else's fingers on his pulse," "shining black," "corridor of slow-moving dust" all appear within the first half without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphor: ink as "shining black" (visual) vs. "pool accepted him without splash, folding him away" (tactile/spatial) strain coherence. Template cadence appears in the opening: "came back," "sat cross-legged," "had trained himself," "kept a bottle"—multiple past-tense anchor verbs in quick succession. Paraphrase loop: "the archivists swore would fade only on command, yet in Keir's hands it vanished whenever truth approached" restates the same paradox without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the first third, reducing propulsion, but the closure beat is cleaner. Applying −0.8 for multiple distinct line-level issues (density, coherence, template stems) that do not touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of disappearing ink, time-dilation tech, and Council exploitation offers a fresh angle on crisis-as-spectacle. The consciously-wild tracker who steps through ink pools is specific and memorable, not a stock archetype. The obelisk pulsing to force time-slowing when fear spikes is a clever conceit, and the final turn (Council studying crises "the way gamblers studied dice") provides non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure (ink-pool travel, replayed ambush) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the premise leans on familiar SFF tropes (hidden tech, manipulative authority, tracker-hero) and the emotional arc (discovery → sabotage → resolve) follows a recognizable beat sequence. Transformation is present but not radical; the story executes its premise at a high level without fully transcending its template origins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Keir appears in every beat, drives the ink-pool journey, sends the drone, sabotages the obelisk, and promises future vigilance. His albinism is mentioned once ("the albino tracker") but does not constrain or enable any on-page choice; it reads as descriptor rather than functional trait. The tracker role is more active: he recovers the map, reads ephemeral patterns, and operates in the field. Removing "albino" would not alter logic, stakes, or closure. Setup present, development strong (middle choices), closure participation strong (final resolve), but the albino trait itself is ornamental. Scoring the role as tracker integrates well; the albino attribute adds ~0.0. Net: tracker choices essential, albino detail cosmetic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hummingbird drone appears in beat one (hovering, clicking), beat two (stirring ink whorls), climax (darting around obelisk, mapping pulse, revealing seam), and ending (perched on stake, data recorded). It enables the pivotal sabotage (Keir drives knife into "the inked seam the drone revealed") and provides the non-vanishing proof (drone data vs. disappearing ink). Setup early, development across three beats, closure linkage strong (data substitutes for vanished words). The drone's artificial/synthetic nature and "bright thought" metaphor charge its recurrence. Removing it would break the sabotage and proof mechanics. One limitation: the drone is described more than handled in tactile ways; its perching and data functions are told rather than shown through embodied interaction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is introduced in beat one (bottle, vanishes when truth approaches), drives the method (ephemeral patterns in spilled ink), appears on the raider map (water reveals faint patterns), is used twice for travel (ink pool journey, return spirals), explains the obelisk's stealth (commands written in vanished-script), and creates the final tension (elders demand proof, words evaporate, drone data substitutes). It shapes stakes (how to prove what vanishes) and tactics (Keir must use the ink's own logic to travel and sabotage). Setup immediate, development across all major beats, closure participation direct (the contrast between vanishing ink and persistent data charges the ending). The concept is irreplaceable and carries visible cost (no written proof, only recorded data). Specificity and causal pressure are high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is introduced early ("trained himself to be consciously wild, to let instinct run first but keep it leashed by choice") and referenced at closure ("his consciously wild heart chose a different risk" and "meet it awake, consciously wild"). It frames his stance but is mostly label-based rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The trait enables the risk-taking choice (not fleeing the canyon) but the cost is described ("serene anger stayed") rather than dramatized through visible tradeoff. Setup present, development weak (stated more than enacted), closure participation present (promise to be consciously wild again). The concept reads more thematic than tactical. A stronger embodiment would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Disappear" occurs three times: Keir steps into the ink pool and disappears from camp (beat two), the obelisk writes commands in disappearing ink "so no witness could later prove it" (climax explanation), and Keir steps through spirals to return, "leaving behind only a fading note" (closure). The action redefines options (travel via ink, stealth commands, return path) and is thematically charged (what vanishes, what persists). Setup in beat one (ink that vanishes), major turn at beat two (Keir's journey), closure linkage strong (final disappearance and fading note). Removing "disappear" would collapse the method and thematic spine. The action is irreplaceable and shapes all major beats with visible cost (evidence vanishes, trust in written proof is foreclosed).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—"through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink"—is signaled in beat one ("cartographers said a person could disappear through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink if the curves matched a hidden current"), enacted in beat two (Keir pours ink, drone stirs whorls, he steps in), and repeated at closure (spills ink, sketches spirals, steps through). The mechanics matter: the curves must match a hidden current, the drone's wingbeats create the whorls, water reveals patterns on the map. Setup early, development in travel sequence, closure participation direct (final spirals). The method is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it for generic "magic portal" would lose the tactile ink-and-pattern logic. One limitation: the "hidden current" is asserted rather than demonstrated, slightly reducing felt mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment frames the opening and closing, providing spatial anchor and return destination. Details (canvas bleached, rocks sculpted into ribs, firepits, dunes, perimeter) are vivid but mostly serve as backdrop. The setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; Keir's journey takes him away from the encampment to the canyon. Setup strong (immediate anchor), development weak (absent during climax), closure participation present (return location, elders' demand). The encampment could be replaced with another base without structural impact. Micro-setting elements (flat stone, bottle, drone stake) are more functional than the encampment itself. The setting is coherent and atmospheric but not essential to stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ended" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and recurs throughout: "during the height of the eclipse" (three nights earlier, raiders struck), "now that the sun was whole again" (present determination), "lingering eclipse-scar" (canyon), "after midnight, when the eclipse was only a memory" (closure). The eclipse marks the crisis window and the obelisk's activation period, shaping the investigation's urgency. Setup immediate, development present (eclipse-scar at canyon tightens the mystery), closure participation present (eclipse as memory reinforces that the acute threat has passed but the larger risk remains). The timeframe does not impose a live ticking clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics, but it structures the narrative arc and charges the "before/after" contrast. Removing the eclipse would weaken causality but not collapse the core journey.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why time slows in crisis"—is stated early ("determined to discover why time slows in crisis") and drives every beat: recovering the map, traveling via ink, confronting the obelisk, sabotaging it, and promising future vigilance. The desire is clear and under pressure (raiders' ambush, Council exploitation, elders' demand for proof). Setup immediate, development strong (each choice pursues the answer), closure participation direct (final resolve to "meet it awake" and "make the hidden hands show"). The motivation is dramatized through action, though internal friction (want vs. cost, desire vs. fear) is understated; Keir's "serene anger" remains relatively stable rather than conflicted. The stakes are conceptual (understanding vs. ignorance) rather than visceral (survival, loss), which slightly reduces felt urgency. Visible cost at closure (vanished proof, need for future action) elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is introduced in beat one ("sat cross-legged with serene anger in his chest"), recurs at the climax ("Keir's anger stayed serene as he stepped into the shining black"), and modulates at closure ("his anger cooled into a steady resolve"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, reflecting Keir's consciously-wild discipline. It charges the final image (calm readiness vs. reactive panic). Setup early, development present (tone remains stable under pressure), closure participation strong (anger cooling into resolve completes the emotional arc). One limitation: the tone is mostly described ("serene anger," "calm hand," "steady resolve") rather than enacted through contradictory embodied impulses or tonal ruptures under stress. A single static mood label trends mid-band; here the modulation (anger → resolve) and thematic payoff (calm-and-angry-at-once) push it higher, but it remains more told than shown in texture.</comment>
