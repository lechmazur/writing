<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and contradictory—touching the dried bouquet "too often, trying to feel anything other than the emotional void" is embodied grief work. Orin's confession "landed without drama, like a stone into snow" shows his moral ambiguity through metaphor and the narrator's decision to keep him despite his mandate history creates visible friction. The final choice to release the bouquet is earned by the accumulated ritual work, though the line "I understood that lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals its pattern early (the turbines' "remade hush," Orin's narrative reframing of chores) and deepens through repeated ritual beats until the bouquet release. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the petals scattering "with no surge of comfort, only the remade hush settling in my chest" reconfigures the premise with felt cost—grief permitted to move rather than cured. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening (the morning goat-milking that produces proto-laughter) tightens pressure and narrows the narrator's stance from frozen to willing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind turbines anchor the setting and constrain the narrator's sensory world ("I kept the windows shut... to muffle the blades"). The turbine shadows functioning as "slow clock hands" at the fence line and the "blade wash" scattering petals upward directly charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (farmhouse, kitchen, barn, fence line). The dried bouquet and cedar bird function as micro-setting that recurs with reweighted presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivate lightness in grief without lying about it, signaled in the co-op posting. The goat-milking beat produces the first "short sound... that might have been laughter," a meaningful tightening that shifts the narrator from purely frozen to capable of involuntary lightness. The bouquet release at the fence line is protagonist-driven agency (endurance and permission rather than cure) with visible cost—"no surge of comfort" but acceptance of grief's movement. Orin's presence applies continuous pressure through his confessed complicity, keeping the moral stakes live.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the turbines' "remade hush," the goat's spill, the petals rising into blade wash. The final image—"lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move, even through an emotional void"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, because it follows from the accumulated ritual work and the bouquet's physical release. Orin's moral ambiguity (mandate informer seeking redemption through one lighter household) deepens the theme without false equivalence. The phrase "remade hush... a silence rebuilt around sound rather than against it" reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the air in the rooms still carried her last laugh like a bruise" is grief-specific metaphor. Orin's theatrical diction contrasts cleanly with the narrator's spare interiority. The line "his blank face stayed still" maintains distance without head-hopping. However, "I understood that lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move" edges toward diagnostic articulation rather than staying within the grief-fogged register established earlier, a mild register drift under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: the long opening sentence establishes weight, shorter beats at the goat scene accelerate. "His confession landed without drama, like a stone into snow" is vivid and apt. However, mild scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "For the first time in months a short sound escaped me that might have been laughter" followed immediately by "Orin bowed as if the spill were the climax of a tragedy that ended in forgiveness"—the second restates the first beat's emotional resolution without advancing pressure. The phrase "remade hush" recurs five times but with purposeful reweighting, so no loop penalty applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of post-mandate performer and grief ritual through mundane-task narration is fresh and tightly synthesized. Orin's blank face and theatrical voice, his whittling of a cedar bird, and his confession of complicity create a specific moral texture rather than stock redemption. The goat's kick interrupting solemn narration is a non-obvious turn. However, the "Happiness Mandate" premise leans on familiar dystopian tropes (mandated joy, inspectors, morale artists) without transforming the apparatus beyond backdrop, limiting the premise's ingenuity even as character work elevates execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin (blank-faced performer) is introduced at dusk, proposes the ritual that shapes all subsequent beats, narrates the goat-milking that produces the narrator's first laughter, carves the cedar bird placed beside the bouquet, confesses his mandate history (which the narrator weighs before deciding to proceed), and accompanies the final bouquet release while narrating each step. His choices create multiple key turns and his presence is causally essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet is introduced early (kitchen table, from Lena's hospital bedside), touched repeatedly by the narrator "too often, trying to feel anything," receives the carved cedar bird beside it, becomes the object of the proposed ritual, is carried to the fence line, wedged into the post, and its petals scatter into the blade wash in the final image. It appears in at least four distinct beats and the closure image (petals rising) would collapse without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is introduced early as the effect of Orin's narration ("the rhythm of his words shaped a remade hush, a silence rebuilt around sound rather than against it"), recurs at the goat scene, and settles in the narrator's chest in the final lines ("only the remade hush settling in my chest"). It reweights the dominant stake (cultivating lightness) by naming the texture of permission rather than cure. However, it functions more as thematic refrain than tactical constraint—it does not narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orin's moral ambiguity (introduced as "he had once toured as a morale artist for the mandate, performing forced joy while quietly reporting households that did not clap") constrains the narrator's choice: "I should have sent him away, yet I kept thinking of Lena gasping under fluorescent lights while a mandated comedian cracked jokes." The narrator's decision to proceed despite his complicity creates visible cost and charges the ritual work. The trait is dramatized through confession and choice, not label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Whittling appears when Orin "began to whittle a block of cedar, turning it slowly, making shavings like pale ribbons," produces the cedar bird placed beside the bouquet, and the narrator notes "his hands were steady in a way that suggested practice with sharper work than art." It signals craft and ambiguity, enables the bird's creation (which accompanies the bouquet to the fence), but the final turn does not hinge on whittling itself—the bouquet release would function without the bird. One major beat involvement; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is introduced immediately when Orin asks "permission to narrate my evening chores as though they were heroic deeds," demonstrated through kettle-filling ("Behold the summoning of water from the deep well") and potato-peeling, produces the "remade hush" effect, is applied to goat-milking ("narrated the milking... as a treaty between species") where it generates the first laughter, and frames the final bouquet walk ("narrating each step as a pilgrimage toward a grave"). The method shapes every beat and the closure's ritual charge would fail without it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines anchor the opening ("my farmhouse sat under the rotating shadows of giant wind turbines") and the turbine shadows function as "slow clock hands" at the fence line where the "blade wash" scatters the petals in the final image. The turbines supply the remade hush metaphor (surf instead of machinery). However, the farmhouse interior (kitchen, stove, barn) could be any rural setting; only the turbines' shadows and wind are irreplaceable in the closure image. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the Happiness Mandate ended" frames the opening and Orin's backstory ("he had once toured as a morale artist for the mandate"), and "Lena died the week the inspectors stopped knocking" ties her death to the regime's end. The timeframe provides moral context (permission to grieve now allowed) but does not create urgent tactical pressure—no live clock tightens decisions. The mandate's end enables the plot but does not constrain the present action beyond thematic backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is stated in the co-op notice, tested through Orin's ritual ("we would do the smallest tasks with grand attention until the body believed... it was allowed to be gentle"), produces friction when the narrator "should have sent him away" but chooses to proceed, yields the goat-spill laughter, and is reconfigured in the final lines ("lightness was not happiness but permission to let grief move"). The motivation drives every beat and the closure would collapse without it. Slight dock for the final line's articulated insight rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Emotional void" is named early ("trying to feel anything other than the emotional void") and modulates through the piece: the therapist "had called grief an error, but grief stayed," Orin's ritual produces "a minute I heard the turbines as distant surf," the goat-spill yields "a short sound... that might have been laughter," and the ending settles into "no surge of comfort, only the remade hush." Tone is coherent and charges the final image by refusing tidy resolution, though the explicit phrase "emotional void" is used only once rather than recurring structurally.</comment>
