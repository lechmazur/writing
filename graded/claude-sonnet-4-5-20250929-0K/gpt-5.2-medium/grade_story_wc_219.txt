<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is dense and character-particular ("luminous skeptic," lab dyes, academically rebellious testing on self), with embodied perception ("teeth ache," blood answering the tower). The final theft is motivated by prior causality and forecloses the scripted pilgrimage path with visible cost. However, internal contradiction is largely absent; the narrator moves through discovery with scientific certainty rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, which keeps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern intensifies via signal→crystals→pedestal→shard, deepening the homecoming chemistry premise). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the narrator steals the shard and rewrites the pilgrimage script, reweighting homecoming as measurable chemistry rather than nostalgia. One meaningful deepening (signal becomes catalyst, footprints become microcrystals, amber warms, door opens) is present, and the cost (theft from the script, defiance of council management) is legible in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower, footprints, bronze door, and pedestal chamber are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rainwashed bronze, dusty glitter, terpene scent) filtered through biochemist POV. The fly amber vial and Pilgrim Salt crystals function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: cracking the vial opens the seam, breath shifts crystal color. Spatial choreography (gate→plaza→sculpture path→bronze door→chamber) remains coherent. The pedestal's glass and dripping rain supply the humidity that grows the crystals, directly enabling the narrator's final scalpel theft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand the chemistry of homecoming vs. council's scripted pilgrimage) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: signal→footprints→amber→door→pedestal. The narrator's agency drives escalation (listens unfiltered, follows off-path, cracks vial, cuts shard). One meaningful tightening occurs when breath reaches the crystals and lab dyes make the narrator "easier to read," narrowing options and forcing the theft. Cost is visible (defiance, theft) but the renunciation could be more viscerally felt; the piece leans analytical rather than agonized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (homecoming as measurable chemistry vs. myth/emotion) emerges through concrete particulars: terpenes, microcrystals, volatile molecules binding to childhood scents. The fly amber's warming recognition and the pedestal's Pilgrim Salt sampling embody the concept without stating it. Subtext operates in "academically rebellious," "without asking permission," and "any true return required theft from the script." The final image offers a non-literal answer: homecoming is convergence of molecules that can open doors, earned through defiance rather than pilgrimage. No overt moralizing; the theft reweights the council's script with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (biochemist notices terpenes, microcrystals, reaction clocks, tracer dyes). Diction matches the narrator's scientific lexicon ("volatile terpenes," "self assembling," "convergence of volatile molecules") without drift into therapy-speak or stock phrasing. Purposeful compression ("pattern too patient for weather," "bronze quiet") is taught early and legible. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "the chemistry of homecoming that the signal seemed to promise" edges toward abstract phrasing in the opening, but recovers immediately with concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift ("At the tower gate," "On the plaza," "When the pilgrims," "I realized"). Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, character stance, or atmosphere. Figurative language ("cooled bronze," "like tiny ladders," "deep" flash) remains controlled and coherent. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I followed," "I scraped," "I held," "I realized," "I took") clusters first-person stems but does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of signal-as-catalyst, microcrystal footprints, and scent-based homecoming is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock pilgrimage tropes. The fly amber detail (impossibly fresh resin) and Pilgrim Salt concept feel fresh. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and dense biochemical perspective heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "artificial pilgrimage" frame and first-contact setup echo familiar SF templates; transformation is present but not fully radical. The final theft feels earned in hindsight but not inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening ("luminous skeptic, a biochemist who refused to kneel"). The trait shapes key choices: listens without filters, follows off-path, cracks vial without permission, cuts shard free. Skepticism drives the turn from council script to personal investigation. Participates in closure (theft, "different chemistry" report). Two gates solid (setup, closure); middle development present when unfiltered listening reveals harmonics. Cost is visible (defiance). Just below 7.0 because the skepticism is more method than source of internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (tower gate scene). Handled in two beats: narrator meters it for volatile terpenes, then cracks it onto the footprint crystals to open the door seam. Returns with reweighted meaning: the amber's warmth signals recognition, and its scent acts as catalyst. Specificity matters (impossibly fresh, forest still breathing). Shapes one major turn (door opening). Present in closure frame (the catalyst discovery informs the final theft). Strong setup and development; closure linkage is indirect (enables access but is not held or mentioned at the end).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frames the premise and shapes stakes throughout: council's scripted pilgrimage vs. narrator's investigation. Constrains on-page action (pilgrims wear headsets, converge, halt as one). The pedestal plaque names "Pilgrim Salt, designed to bind to chemicals… from childhood rooms," making the artifice explicit. The narrator's final theft and decision to "report a different chemistry" directly rejects the pilgrimage script. Concept is causally active in middle beats (headsets guide, footprints persist) and reweighted at closure (true return requires theft from the script). All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("academically rebellious habit" of testing tracer dyes on self). Enables one key on-page action: the lab dyes make the narrator "easier to read" when breath reaches the crystals, which constrains the situation and forces the theft. Cost is present but oblique (visibility accelerates exposure). The trait is told more than dramatized in choice; removing it would weaken the breath-crystal beat but not break the plot. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pilgrims converge toward the garden in the middle beat, which the narrator follows. The convergence drives discovery (footprints, sculpture path, bronze door, chamber). Shapes two beats (pilgrims' movement, narrator's following) and indirectly enables closure (access to pedestal). However, the narrator's individual choices (cracking vial, cutting shard) feel more decisive than the collective convergence. The action is present and functional but somewhat replaceable with "followed" or "entered"; it does not uniquely redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early (narrator follows "via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path"). Mechanics matter: footprints persist despite rain, glitter pale powder, contain microcrystals arranged like ladders matching the tower signal. The narrator scrapes and slides them, discovering the pattern. Footprints enable the vial-cracking turn (terpene on crystals flashes, seam appears). Method shapes two beats (discovery, door opening) and is causally essential to access. Strong setup, development, and indirect closure linkage (access enables theft). Just short of 8.0 because the method itself is not present or reweighted in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Anchored in the opening line and repeated throughout (tower gate, plaza, garden behind tower, bronze door, pedestal chamber). The rainwashed stones and spring context supply humidity that grows the crystals, which is mechanically relevant. The tower itself emits the signal (first contact, pattern source). However, the tower functions more as location than constraint; the narrator moves through it without spatial pressure altering tactics. Micro-setting (pedestal glass, dripping rain) does constrain the final theft. Setup and closure present; middle pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Established in the opening line ("after making first contact"). The timeframe anchors the premise (signal already detected, council already organized the pilgrimage) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock; the narrator moves at will (follows, scrapes, cracks, cuts) without temporal pressure. The "after" frame is functional for context but easily replaceable with any initiating event. Setup present; middle and closure do not leverage time as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("I wanted to understand the chemistry of homecoming"). Shapes the narrator's investigation (refuses the council's script, listens unfiltered, follows off-path, scrapes footprints, cuts shard). The desire is dramatized through choice rather than told-only. Friction is present but mild: the narrator's scientific stance rarely conflicts with cost; curiosity drives action smoothly. At closure, the motivation is fulfilled (homecoming understood as molecular convergence) and redirected (theft enables independent report). Strong setup and development; closure participation is clear but the desire does not agonize or narrow painfully.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Introduced midway ("in that bronze quiet I heard my own blood and the tower answering it"). Tone is coherent: restrained, precise, slightly mystified but grounded in chemistry. The phrase "bronze quiet" charges one beat (headsets go silent, narrator listens to blood/tower). Modulates subtly with pressure (scientific observation→cautious discovery→defiant theft). Present in the final image frame ("walked homeward to report a different chemistry") as quiet resolve rather than triumph. Setup is late; development is thin; closure linkage is tonal rather than causal. Just above mid-band for tonal consistency and one charged reprise.</comment>
