<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper remains passive throughout, observing without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "loose grip on reality" is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The other keeper's appearance feels ornamental rather than generating pressure through status dynamics or relationship friction. Agency is limited to witnessing, which avoids the earned change or renunciation that would lift the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric density and a pattern of silence-as-regeneration. Orientation arrives adequately by ~120 words (overgrown library, chronicle keeper role). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the keeper returns to the library and accepts decay as script—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The swan-fold mechanism and the refuge visit function as a meditative loop rather than a causal tightening, leaving the before/after less decisive than the rubric requires for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (moss stitching shelves, volcanic stone drinking sound, paper with sheen of old bone). The swan's folds guide navigation, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. However, spatial choreography during the transit and in the refuge chamber remains vague, and the collapsed ceiling at the end arrives without prior set-up, weakening causality slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early but generates minimal pressure because the protagonist never faces a choice that would violate that vow. The journey to the refuge and back unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible cost. The other keeper's question ("what I would record here") is deflected rather than deepening conflict. One tightening moment (realizing silence is a workshop for self-remaking) shifts understanding but does not narrow options or foreclose a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from regenerative silence, decay-as-composting, and non-judgmental witness. The final image of spores blooming on parchment offers a resonant answer to the question of change and continuity. However, the piece veers close to stating its thesis ("witnessing was enough," "decay was also a script") rather than trusting the imagery alone. The other keeper's didactic unfolding lesson and the closing summary of "scholars or scavengers" flatten subtext into mild sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (reality as reeds bending, grief composted into soil). Psychic distance remains stable in first person. The dialogue with the other keeper reads functional but lacks subtext or character distinction—both speakers share the same elevated, philosophical register. Under peak pressure (the refuge encounter), diction does not compress or modulate, maintaining uniform texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking (moss stitching shelves, dust passing through light, fear breaking down like leaves to mulch), but metaphor vehicles occasionally clash or overreach (regenerative silence as "compost," air "repairing torn edges of memories"). Paraphrase loops appear: "witness change without judgment" echoes across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence and synonym churn ("drift of untold seasons" recurs verbatim) dull momentum. The closure beat is spared these artifacts, but their spread through earlier paragraphs triggers penalties here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—a chronicle keeper who travels via origami folds to observe a regenerative refuge—is specific and atmospheric. However, the frame leans on familiar fantasy-library and mystical-transit tropes without sharp transformation. The protagonist's stance (non-judgmental witness who never judges or intervenes) offers little moral calculus or surprise. The ending's spore-bloom image is evocative but predictable given the composting metaphor established early. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and frames the journey, but makes no key turn-driving choices. The decision to follow the swan and the refusal to "record" at the refuge are passive confirmations of an existing stance rather than alterations under pressure. Observation without agency keeps the character functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in setup (fragments written), development (journey destination), and payoff (the chamber encounter and realization). It pressures the keeper to articulate their method ("write nothing except the way the river kept moving") and anchors the regenerative-silence motif. However, the refuge does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it serves as setting for reflection rather than a tool or obstacle that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is seeded early ("remainder... regenerative silence"), recurs in the refuge ("stronger than in the catacombs"), and charges the ending realization ("silence was not emptiness but a workshop"). It shapes the keeper's understanding and the thematic closure. However, it does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options; it remains a thematic claim rather than a mechanical stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is declared in the opening and echoed when the other keeper "had stopped caring whether he was alive, and his loose grip on reality matched my own." It never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only, not dramatized through choice or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears in three beats: tracing folds to burrow inward, burrowing via the swan's folds to emerge at the river, and burrowing homeward through the folds. It defines the transit mechanism and is irreplaceable within the swan-fold logic. However, the action does not drive a major turn or redefine options; it is method rather than conflict.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The origami swan is seeded early (carried in pocket), its cryptic folds are explained as mirroring passages, and it is used twice on-page (pressed to forehead to travel, unfolded by the other keeper to teach a lesson). The swan enables the journey and charges the closure lesson ("each crease was a choice to return"). Its mechanics matter and its reappearance reweights meaning, meeting two gates and contributing to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The overgrown library is established early with vivid detail (moss-stitched shelves, paper softening to loam) and returns at closure (collapsed ceiling, sunlight on atlases, spores blooming). It supplies the keeper's role and the decay-as-script motif. The library does not pressure a mid-story choice, but its final transformation (sunlight, spores) charges the thematic payoff. Early seed and closure reprise lift the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears verbatim in the opening and again near the close, framing the keeper's patient witness over time. Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it remains atmospheric and vague. The timeframe supports tone but does not alter tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is articulated early and tested when the other keeper asks what the protagonist will record. The keeper answers that witnessing is enough, reaffirming rather than complicating the motivation. Desire is told and restated but never faces friction or cost on the page, keeping it functional but not deeply dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is seeded in the opening ("patient, crumbling peace") and modulates through the refuge's sound-drinking silence, the dawn calm, and the closing image of spores blooming on ruined atlases. Tone remains coherent and charges the final image with acceptance of decay. The piece does not test the tone under peak pressure, but the consistent modulation through lyric beats lifts it above mid-band.</comment>
