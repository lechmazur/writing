<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve"), with embodied perception under stress. The final choice to photograph evidence and leave the stamp carries visible cost (personal risk, isolation). Minor weakness: the internal arc relies on maintained calm rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats, and the trait "tranquilly perceptive" functions more as label than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost—Maren photographs evidence, conceals the discovery, and carries the proof out, foreclosing open action and accepting personal risk. Orientation anchors early (who, where, mission). One meaningful tightening occurs when the catalog code leads to the stamp, then the folio reveals the forgery, narrowing options to covert documentation. Cost is legible: "If the council learned I had found it, they would drown the evidence more thoroughly than the sea ever had."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains choice throughout: corroded doors, sediment, swollen catalog, oiled-cloth wrapping all shape Maren's tactics and slow her investigation. The stamp's velvet rot and the folio's fiber-memory are specific, purpose-driven details that charge the discovery beat. The blackout darkness recurs as both physical constraint (headlamp flicker) and thematic anchor. Spatial choreography remains clear across atrium, reading room, cabinet, and desk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trace honest map origins to expose forgery—is signaled early and drives the investigation. One meaningful tightening: the catalog-as-code reversal leads to the stamp, which unlocks the folio forgery, narrowing options to covert evidence collection. The final choice to photograph and conceal carries visible cost (personal risk, isolation from Guild protection). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the blackout and underwater setting maintain urgency without requiring multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed stillness and honest origins emerges through concrete action: Maren's indexing discipline, the blackout silence as opportunity, the stamp "waking memory" in the folio, and the internal lantern "lit by honest origins" at closure. The final image—carrying "only the images and the restored title, a quiet weight"—offers a resonant answer to the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in "dappled resolve," the library "listening," and the choice to leave physical evidence behind. No overt thematic statements flatten the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is character-specific ("let the darkness settle...so my thoughts would not chase fear"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful, with lexicon appropriate to an indexer ("tranquilly perceptive," "alternative hypothesis," "receipts for the stolen registry"). Minor slip: "dappled resolve" and "a new lantern inside" tilt slightly elevated without dramatic cost anchoring them in the immediate physical moment, though they remain voice-consistent and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high ("Each drawer was numbered, yet the order made no sense, as if someone had panicked and rearranged history"). Sentence variety supports rhythm. Minor template cadence in paired moves: "I readjusted my gloves, steadied my breathing" and "I sat...and let the darkness settle" recur as parallel constructions. A few filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") in mid-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken-library-as-code and stamp-as-memory-catalyst offer fresh inflections on investigative premises. Specific indexing discipline and the blackout-as-stillness frame distinguish the piece from generic underwater-ruin templates. The forgery revelation through pressure-impressed catalog cards is non-obvious. Risk is present but modest; the protagonist's calm competence and smooth problem-solving trend toward median safety rather than bold narrative gambles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's indexer discipline drives three key beats: decoding the catalog, applying the stamp to wake the folio, and reading pressure-impressions on blank cards. The choice to photograph and conceal evidence is a direct consequence of her methodical analysis and shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stamp appears in three beats: discovery in the locked cabinet, use to reveal the folio's hidden text, and the decision to leave it in place. Its unique property—waking memory in treated paper—is irreplaceable and charges the closure choice (concealment to protect evidence).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" shapes Maren's sensory strategy (listening for patterns, settling darkness to clarify thought) and frames the mission as opportunity. It reappears in the closure image ("new lantern inside"). However, it does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost on the page; it functions more as thematic resonance than plot lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is labeled early and motivates Maren's request to go alone and her ability to decode the catalog and read impressions. It does not visibly trade off against another trait or constrain a choice with cost; the story avoids dramatizing a moment where calmness fails or incurs a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice with functional weight: readjusting gloves before indexing signals discipline, and readjusting the cabinet back into place is the tactical choice to conceal discovery. The second use directly enables the covert-evidence strategy and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled early ("I used an alternative hypothesis: instead of missing books, the catalog itself had been repurposed as a code") and its mechanics matter: it redirects the search from shelves to the locked cabinet, unlocking the stamp and folio. Without it, the discovery chain breaks.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken library supplies four resources that alter tactics: the swollen catalog (code substrate), the locked cabinet (concealment), the oiled-cloth wrapping (preservation), and sediment (requires slow, methodical work). The blackout darkness and corroded doors tighten time pressure and constrain access. Micro-setting is integral to every beat and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout frames the mission, tightens urgency (headlamp flicker, shore darkness at exit), and thematically underscores "reclaimed stillness." However, elapsed time is not tracked; Maren's swim duration and investigation pace remain vague. The blackout is present at closure but does not visibly alter the final tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" drives every beat: decoding the catalog, revealing the folio's erased title, identifying council names on impression-cards, and the choice to carry only images. The motivation is dramatized through specific investigative actions and the closing image ("a quiet weight that steadied me... lit by honest origins").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is labeled once mid-story and modulates with pressure (calm indexing, headlamp flicker tension, final steadying weight). The tone coheres through turns but does not charge the final image with specificity; the closing "new lantern inside" shifts register slightly without direct callback to "dappled."</comment>
