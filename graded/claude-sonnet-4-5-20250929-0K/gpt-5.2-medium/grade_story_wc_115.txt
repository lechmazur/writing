<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I do not believe in absolution that arrives on a hymn"), with embodied contradictions—drowsy alertness pairs skepticism with compulsive exploration. Mara's motivations are dramatized through the hidden tag and her choice to burden the narrator rather than confess directly. The final decision to call Mara, "not to forgive her, but to stop her from hiding behind my silence," is earned by prior causality and forecloses complicity with visible cost. Minor slip: the dead man's gesture ("fingers worrying a badge as if it were a rosary") edges toward stock devotional imagery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change: the narrator turns the wheel back, sealing the bay, and chooses to call Mara—ending her own complicity with visible relational cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the tunnel-mouth paragraph. The lens reads Causal with clear because/therefore linkage: confession → tunnel → valve → passage → tag → call. One beat (the punch-clock confrontation) leans on external staging rather than protagonist choice, preventing full 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel environment—wet iron, dripping water, rusted pipe, bolted flange—constrains the protagonist's access and charges the closure: the beaded wheel must fit the spindle, and turning it back seals the ghost shift. The radio, tool roll, and valve wheel function as micro-setting objects that pressure choices. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The tunnel "breathed" and the passage "smelled of wool coats and cigarettes" anchor the ghost-shift bay in lived-in specificity that supports the protagonist's appraisal method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expose Mara's hidden truth or let it remain buried—is signaled early and tightens through the tunnel journey. The discovery of the note with Mara's handwriting reweights the confession from witness-failure to active crime, narrowing options. The protagonist's agency at closure (turning the wheel back and calling Mara) forecloses complicity with visible relational cost. One small gap: the ghosts "lean in, waiting" externalizes pressure that would land harder if the protagonist's internal conflict were more visibly torn in that beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the weight of swallowed truths and the cost of breaking silence—emerges through concrete particulars: the beaded wheel, the ghost shift's accounting labor, the tag hidden beneath paint. The radio calls about spirits and stuck secrets provide oblique subtext without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer: the protagonist refuses absolution-by-silence and accepts the social cost of calling Mara. The psychic's refrain "Name the weight, then turn the wheel back" skirts instructional obviousness but is integrated as overheard method rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: the narrator's idiom ("eyelids click," "appraise mysteries," "snort") and perceptual signature (filtering events through salvage-lot logic and radio subtext) remain stable under pressure. POV distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The drowsy-alert texture modulates naturally with rising tension. One minor slip: "the truth hit with physical heft" tells emotional impact rather than showing it through embodied perception or micro-choice, slightly dulling immediacy in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the tunnel and pausing at the punch-clock confrontation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Two friction points: "the room went so quiet I could hear my own eyelids click" is vivid but borders on stock hyperbole, and "the truth hit with physical heft" abstracts a pivotal beat that warrants more concrete embodiment. Figurative language (beads "caught my headlamp," tunnel "breathed") remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-shift labor, talk-radio psychics, and salvage appraisal feels specific and non-obvious, transforming haunting-as-accounting into a fresh angle. The beaded valve wheel and the radio method are idiosyncratic enough to avoid template plots. Risk-taking (the drowsy-alert narrator, the unconventional ghost rules) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One cap: the framing device (confession at the start, phone call at the end) follows a recognizable arc; the middle journey, while well-executed, doesn't fully escape the "descend/discover/decide" structure common to reckoning narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reckless abandoned-mill explorer trait is present by the opening line and drives the protagonist's choice to enter the tunnel after midnight. The decision to appraise the ghost shift through salvage logic and radio subtext is key to the middle turn, and the final choice to call Mara rather than run alters tactics with visible cost. The trait shapes at least three beats and is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in Mara's confession, is handled on the protagonist's lap, pressed onto the spindle to open the passage, and turned back to seal the bay at closure. The beads feel "warm, as if many hands had worried them," adding tactile specificity. Removing this exact object would break the story's central mechanism and the closure action. The wheel's dual function (opening and sealing) charges both the discovery and the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is the core concept: it redefines the haunting as labor-accounting rather than punishment, shapes the protagonist's appraisal method, and provides the setting for the climactic discovery. The ghosts "never quite touching the ground" and the punch clock create the specific rules that pressure the protagonist's choice. The concept is indispensable to stakes, tactics, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The religiously skeptical trait is present by the third line and constrains the protagonist's initial framing: "I do not believe in absolution that arrives on a hymn." It enables the choice to interpret the ghost shift as appraisal-worthy pattern rather than spirit-world miracle. The "snort" at the chalk cross mid-tunnel reinforces the trait under pressure. One gap: the trait could exert more visible friction at closure, where the protagonist accepts the ghost-shift evidence with less resistance than the opening skepticism implies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The appraise action is signaled early ("It was my method to appraise mysteries") and drives the middle beat: the protagonist treats the ghost shift as "a salvage lot," listening to radio and scrape to line up two stories. The final turn—calling Mara—grows from this appraisal logic. The action shapes at least two beats and contributes to closure, though the appraisal itself is more observational than decisive in the tunnel; the call is the true turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The talk-radio psychics method is introduced early ("by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, I could hear what people tried to hide") and recurs in three beats: the basement-door caller, the factory-machines caller, and the "Name the weight" caller. The radio provides oblique guidance that shapes the protagonist's reading of the ghost shift. One friction: the method is more atmospheric than mechanically decisive; the protagonist's choice to call Mara could occur without the radio's final prompt, though the pattern is well-seeded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is present by the midpoint and supplies the rusted pipe, bolted flange, and brick seam that constrain the protagonist's access. The tunnel "breathed" when the wheel turned, and the protagonist walks the ties, tracking water and spatial layout throughout. The setting is indispensable: the valve mechanism and the hidden passage could not exist elsewhere, and the tunnel's physicality charges the closure action (sealing the bay).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" is present in the opening beat and frames the protagonist's choice to drive out "after midnight." The hush creates initial pressure, but once the tunnel journey begins, the timeframe loosens; no live clock tightens decisions in the middle or at closure. The overnight setting supports the drowsy-alert tone and the talk-radio element, but the hush itself does not constrain tactics after the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized early: Mara wants the protagonist to "find the weight of that swallowed truth, something solid enough to set on a table between us." The protagonist's journey into the tunnel, discovery of the tag, and final choice to call Mara all trace to this desire. The motivation is tested under pressure (the ghosts "lean in, waiting") and forecloses complicity at closure with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The drowsy alertness tone is present from the opening line ("my drowsy alertness sharpened") and modulates with pressure: the protagonist keeps the heater low "so my half sleep would not turn into surrender," and the "heavy lidded calm" at the punch clock contrasts with the sharpened perception at the tag discovery. The tone charges the final image—turning the wheel and making the call—by sustaining the half-awake appraisal logic throughout. The tone is voice-specific and indispensable to the story's texture and closure effect.</comment>
