<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's agency is clean and embodied: she waits, decodes, improvises traps, and carries weight with visible cost. The chain as vow rather than trophy anchors interior contradiction, and the boy-teaching moment at the end reframes burden as grace. Minor slip: the militia's confusion feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by her trap's mechanics. Interiority is concrete and action-particular, avoiding therapy-speak even under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure lands as Decisive Change (seeds spill into hands) married to Resonant Reconfiguration (her staggering grace becomes a plan for everyone), with visible cost: the trembling chained wrist, the drag through crowds, the forfeit of safety. Orientation anchors quickly (wall down, carnival center, militia threat). One meaningful tightening when engines arrive forces the false-key trap. The cost is legible in the final image: exhaustion transformed into collective future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carnival prize center is not postcard—it supplies the piano, bench, keys, and bear that enable her tactics. The chain becomes a tool (handle-wrap), the arrow wedges pedals, the stuffed bear hides drums. Micro-setting (piano bench arrangement) constrains the vault decoding and charges the closure by transforming toys into resistance infrastructure. Sensory detail (grime, sunbleached plush, tin-and-hope smell) is selective and mood-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (plant resilience) is signaled early and tested once meaningfully when engines arrive. Her response—false key arrangement, piano wedge—narrows militia options and buys time with visible cost (trembling wrist, dragging weight). The escalation is clean under a causal lens: rumor → decoding → discovery → militia → improvised impediment → escape with seeds. No coincidental save; her patience and prep enable the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the chain as chosen burden, seeds as future made tangible, the boy's hand learning weight-as-grace. The final image—seeds spilling into farmers' hands, her staggering grace becoming everyone's plan—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The closing line reweights "staggering" from exhaustion to shared transformation. Subtext operates in the arrow's carnival-foil fletching (beauty weaponized) and the bench-as-confession motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric texture: "dust rises like a curtain," "moves as quietly as falling ash," "thunder learning its name." Perceptual signature is consistent—tactical, image-weighted, compression-charged. Minor dip: "her staggering grace becomes a plan for everyone" in the final line shifts briefly toward external observer certainty, a small distance wobble. Dialogue absent; not required. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences breathe with scene pressure. Information density is strong (arrow threaded, chain wrapped, bench wedged). Two friction points: "the kind of person who waits in a doorway until the right footsteps pass" is scaffolding that could be cut; "her motivation is simple enough to carry in one palm" borders on abstract. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs three times without on-page reweighting between uses. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language is dense but mostly clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-Wall seed vault hidden in carnival prize center, decoded via piano-bench key arrangement, escape via stuffed-bear smuggling—feels specific and earns its beats. The chain-as-tool-and-vow motif avoids trophy cliché. Risk: the lyric compression and mosaic texture (wall falls → vault raid → teach boy → seeds spill) could have fragmented, but the piece holds coherence. The arrow's carnival-foil fletching and piano-as-barricade transform familiar elements into tactical specifics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all major turns: she decodes, hauls the panel, sets the false arrangement, wedges the piano, hides drums in the bear, crosses the border, and opens the drums with farmers. Setup immediate, development across three beats (decode/retrieve/impede), payoff in the spill-and-teach closure. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable. Cost visible: trembling wrist, dragging weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arrow appears twice: recognized on counter, threaded through belt; then used to wedge piano pedals during the militia impediment beat. Setup early, middle use functional, closure absent. The strange fletching (copper and foil) is noted but its properties don't alter tactics beyond the wedge. Swappable with another rigid object for the pedal task; specificity (fletching) doesn't constrain the choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The seed vault is the story's engine: Mara's goal, the whispered riddle, the hidden drums, the militia's burn threat, the final spill into farmers' hands. Setup in opening lines, development through decoding and retrieval, payoff as closure image. Removing it collapses all stakes. Causal pressure maximal; cost tied directly (trembling wrist, pursuit risk). Closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is dramatized: she waits for right footsteps, listens for militia, decodes keys deliberately, and does not rush when engines arrive—she sets false keys and jams the piano instead. Setup early (doorway-waiting), development in decoding beat, payoff in the calm impediment choice under pressure. Cost visible: the gamble that confusion buys enough time. One beat short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Impede" is the climax turn: when militia arrives, she sets false key arrangement and wedges the piano with arrow and bench, buying time to carry drums up. Without this action, capture is immediate and the seed transfer fails. Setup (militia threat), development (the improvised trap), payoff (escape while they curse). Causal, costly (brief mercy), irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decoding the piano-bench key arrangement unlocks the vault: three north, two crossed, one alone = the door. Setup when she finds the nest of keys, development as she interprets and taps the mural, payoff when the seam opens. The method is specific and non-swappable; removing it breaks access to the seeds. Mechanics matter and shape the retrieval beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The carnival center provides the piano/bench (decoding tool), the mural wall (vault door), the stuffed bear (smuggling container), and the aesthetic camouflage (looted toy store) that lets her pass militia. Setup immediate, development across decode and impediment beats, payoff in escape. Micro-setting alters every tactic; without it, no vault access, no false-key trap, no bear-cart cover.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" frames the opening and the closing border-crossing; the fallen Wall enables her breach and the crowd cover. Setup in first line, implicit pressure (transitional chaos), payoff when she crosses "the new open border." Time itself isn't a ticking clock, but the historical moment shapes access and urgency. One causal link shy of essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>To plant resilience in dry soil drives every choice: decoding the vault, risking militia, carrying drums, teaching the boy, opening seeds with farmers. Setup early ("her motivation is simple enough"), development through retrieval under threat, payoff in the riverbed spill and "plan for everyone." Cost legible (trembling wrist, dragged weight). Removing it voids all stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Staggering grace modulates across the piece: lyric compression in early images ("dust rises like a curtain"), tactical patience in the decode, trembling-yet-steady during the drum-carry, and the closing reframe where exhaustion becomes shared plan. Tone charges the final image ("her staggering grace becomes a plan") and coheres under pressure. The phrase recurs three times; final use reweights prior mentions with closure cost.</comment>
