<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior is consistent and character-specific, showing a scholar's bias toward patterns and margins. The crystal becomes an embodied focal point for attention under pressure. However, key motivations remain stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene—the desire to "decode the pattern" never conflicts meaningfully with another want or fear on the page. The apprentices' choices feel more asserted than earned through prior causality, and Lysa's "weathered innocence" reads as a label rather than a dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the suspended hush shifts from curse to cradle, and the crystal's echo becomes a teaching tool. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—three "sequence" shards build density toward a cadence shift at the testimony table. The cost is conceptual and social (the Council wanted blame; the narrator offers a map and plea), legible in the final image. However, the sequences feel more like reported discovery than lived pressure, and the transition from scholar-observer to active witness lacks a single on-page moment where refusal was possible and foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library and crystal anchor setting as micro-objects that constrain choice: the crystal maps by echo, the maintenance stair reveals the hidden corridor, the paper skins and compost build world logic. Spatial choreography is clean across all three sequences. The "after the last dictionary" frame provides a coherent rule-set (words grow without fences), and the sensory detail—"cold as a tear," "damp earth and beginnings"—is filtered through the scholar's POV. The crystal's sonically reflective property charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the pattern, protect the apprentices, testify without offering blame—is signaled early. The three sequences tighten knowledge: Lysa tapping, the childlike laugh, the hidden door. However, escalation reads as accumulation of discovery rather than narrowing of options under protagonist agency. The narrator never faces a live choice where one path is foreclosed with felt cost; instead, all moves are investigative and retrospective. The Council's demand for blame could have forced a higher-stakes choice on the page, but the narrator's "plea to listen" arrives without visible friction or cost in the testimony scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—language as living growth, silence as cradle rather than void—emerges through the vine code, the compost lexicon, and the crystal's echo without overt statement. The final image (crystal tapped once, echo showing the hidden door) reweights the suspended hush as generative space. However, the thematic answer feels too complete and declarative: "not a curse but a cradle, a pause in which language could change without violence" borders on summary. The particulars (paper skins, root lexicon) are vivid, but the resonance leans explanatory rather than irreducibly image-driven at the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent: formal, margin-dwelling, anchored in a scholar's perceptual filter. The "fractured sequences" structure is taught in the opening and maintained. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush... you could lean on"). The apprentices' direct speech is minimal, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the reflective mode is purposeful, but the narrator's voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm—syntax is polished but not character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and legible with strong imagery (chandelier as nest, vines shaped like letters, paper skins shedding). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "suspended hush" recurs without evolving function, and "the suspended hush was not a curse but a cradle" in the final paragraph restates theme rather than trusting the image. Template stems appear: "Sequence one," "Sequence two," "Sequence three" are functional but scaffold-like. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I showed," "I saw," "I heard") in the sequences dull immediacy. Information density is high, but the closure beat leans on summary ("So I testified that...") rather than concrete action, reducing propulsion at the pivot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-dictionary library where words grow as vines and silence becomes a refuge—is specific and non-obvious. The crystal's sonic reflection is a fresh tool, and the "root lexicon" compost offers a concrete image of language decay and renewal. However, the emotional arc (scholar decodes, testifies, reframes the hush) follows a familiar investigation-to-testimony template. The transformation test flags some swappability: the same discovery-and-advocacy structure could work with different metaphors. The piece takes conceptual risk but stops short of a fully embodied, character-specific inflection that makes the synthesis feel inevitable to this narrator alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The reticent scholar frames the testimony and guides all three sequences, but key choices are observational rather than decisional. The narrator shows Lysa the crystal, climbs the maintenance stair, and opens the door—functional moves, but none forecloses a path or alters tactics under visible cost. The final testimony choice (offer a map, not blame) is stated rather than dramatized as a renunciation with friction. Present across all beats, causally involved in discovery, but decision-making remains passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal is introduced early (taken from the chandelier, carried for months), used in sequence one to map by echo with Lysa, pressed to the keyhole in sequence three to decode rhythm, and tapped once at the testimony table to reveal the hidden door. Four distinct beats with evolving function. The crystal enables discovery and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: its sonically reflective property is the mechanism. Minor cap: the crystal's role in the middle sequence (pressed to keyhole) is briefly mentioned rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The suspended hush appears in the opening as the central mystery, recurs when the narrator describes cutting the vines ("a hush you could lean on"), shelters the missing apprentices ("kept them unafraid"), and is reframed in the testimony ("not a curse but a cradle"). Present across all three gates. Shapes the dominant stake (decode the hush, protect the apprentices) and is reweighted at closure. However, the hush constrains choice indirectly—it tempts people to hide losses, but the narrator never faces a live trade-off where the hush's pressure forces a visible cost. Thematic centrality is high; on-page tactical constraint is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is the crystal's defining trait, introduced early and used twice on the page: in sequence one (Lysa's tapping bounces off the crystal, mapping the stacks) and sequence three (crystal gathers creaks, arranges them into rhythm). The trait enables discovery and decoding. However, the attribute does not impose a visible cost or trade-off—its function is purely beneficial. Present, causally enabling, but no friction or price tied to the reflective property itself. Functional across two beats and linked to closure; irreplaceable within the crystal's role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Testimony frames the entire narrative (opening and closing), shapes the "fractured sequences" method, and motivates the retrospective structure. The Council's demand for testimony creates the occasion, and the final act—tapping the crystal to show the hidden door—completes the testimony. Present in setup and payoff with clear causal role. However, the act of testifying itself does not create a meaningful turn or foreclosure on the page; the narrator's stance (offer a map, not blame) is declared without visible friction. Essential to structure, moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through fractured sequences" is announced in the opening ("My testimony would not come as a clean narrative... but through fractured sequences") and delivered via three labeled segments. The method shapes the telling and reflects the narrator's memory under fear. However, the sequences function more as organizational scaffold than as a mechanic that constrains or complicates the testimony—they do not impose cost or alter the Council's response. Present in setup and method, but the fracturing does not create friction or charge the closure. Functional, teachable, but ultimately ornamental to the central conflict.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn anchors all action: the chandelier supplies the crystal, the stacks hold the vines, the maintenance stair conceals the door, the botany alcove accelerates growth, and the long table stages the testimony. The setting supplies resources (crystal, hidden corridor) and pressures choices (where to search, what to reveal). Dawn arrives in the final line, marking temporal closure. The library is irreplaceable and multi-functional, shaping discovery and testimony. Strong setup, development, and payoff. The "at dawn" timeframe charges the opening and closing but does not tighten decisions mid-sequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last dictionary is printed" is introduced early and establishes the world rule (words grow without fences, library becomes greenhouse). The premise frames the conceptual stakes and explains the vine growth. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the post-dictionary era itself. The setting rule is vivid and thematically resonant but functions as static backdrop rather than escalating constraint. Present in setup, informs world logic, but does not alter tactics or narrow options across the sequences.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to decode the pattern is stated early ("I believed it could help me decode the pattern of growth") and motivates all three sequences: tracking Lysa, interpreting the vines, opening the hidden door. The narrator's investigative moves are consistent with this want. However, the motivation is never tested against a competing desire or fear on the page—there is no moment where decoding costs the narrator something tangible, or where another want (protect the apprentices, satisfy the Council) creates friction. Present, causally consistent, but frictionless. Told more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is attributed to Lysa ("the look of someone too young to be tired, yet already devoted to a quiet duty") and echoes in the apprentices' awe. The phrase captures a tonal register—a mix of inexperience and burden—that recurs in the vine-tending imagery. However, the tone is applied as a descriptor rather than modulated through pressure or embodied in syntax and rhythm. The final image (crystal tapped, echo brightening as dawn arrives) shifts toward hope but does not distinctly reweight "weathered innocence" as a tonal charge. Present thematically, static in execution, moderate coherence across the arc.</comment>
