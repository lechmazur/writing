<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior texture is distinctly rendered through her relationship with coins and prophecy, treating static as "broken syllable[s] in a language spoken backward" with consistent perceptual bias. Her "quiet enthusiasm" manifests in concrete micro-choices (casting coins, calibrating feeds, locking the transmitter despite doubt). The final laugh and realization feel earned by prior contradiction between her method and the crew's fear. Minor: the chief engineer and crew remain functional pressure-appliers without distinct voices, but at this length and with clear spatial choreography, headcount does not harm clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the edgewise coin falling blank reweights prophecy from certainty-engine to alignment-permission, and Mara's laugh crystallizes her shift from seeking external validation to accepting self-originated purpose with visible cost (fuel spent, trembling deck, crew doubt). Causal lens holds: coin prediction → split dish → signal sent → receiver confirms in past tense, each step tightening options. Orientation anchors (Mara, ambered deck, post-contraction sky) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy "becomes personal" and forces the edgewise-coin interpretation, narrowing her choice and raising stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck, contracting sky, and museum coins function as micro-setting that constrains choice: amber panels "glow as if sunlight has been remembered," coins "click...like stubborn little planets," and the edgewise coin's roll becomes spatial proof of time choosing. The split dish and thin power reserves impose material limits that Mara must work around. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: visual (bruised sky, amber glow) and tactile (coins in palm, deck tremble) dominate high-pressure beats, while the void's "stuttering" static provides auditory specificity filtered through her professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wavelength align with purpose to send a signal through contracting walls—is signaled early and tightens when the backwards prophecy "becomes personal," forcing Mara to choose split-dish despite strain and doubt. The tightening forecloses the core-vs-rim binary and raises cost (cracked bearings, thin reserves, possibility of "hearing its own ghosts"). Agency culminates in locking the transmitter and distilling fuel into a single capacitor burn, a renunciation of safety with visible cost (trembling deck, crew stares). The prophecy complicates rather than resolves; Mara's choice to act despite uncertainty drives closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—purpose as loop rather than monument—emerges organically from the backwards prophecy's structure and Mara's museum-coin metaphor ("every empire thought its face would be final"). The ending's non-literal answer: "becoming aligned enough to act anyway" reweights prior doubt without moralizing. The edgewise coin's blank face and Mara's small laugh charge the final image with earned ambiguity. Subtext operates cleanly in the prophecy's recursive instruction ("send...and you will become the reason you were told") and the coins' "stubborn little planets" echoing collapsing constellations, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature ("quiet enthusiasm," treating static as backward syllables, seeing coins as permission) is character-particular and voice-consistent. Diction elevates purposefully in conceptual beats ("wavelength align with purpose," "distilled chord") without breaking her technical idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during coin-casting and prophecy interpretation, slightly wider when observing crew reaction. Minor: "stellar doubt" as phrase risks over-literalizing the tone in "every hope into stellar doubt," but the rest avoids thematic echo. No dialogue present; interiority remains compressed and goal-driven under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative density ("bruise lit from within," "footprints that form behind a walker," "sacrament made of chemistry and fear") stays controlled and advances image or stakes without muddle. Information density is high: most sentences multi-task (e.g., "Tonight the receiver spits short static bursts..." anchors time, action, and problem). Minor loop: "quiet enthusiasm" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing; "distill/distilled" appears four times across key beats, risking synonym churn. The final paragraph's "edgewise one has begun to roll, slowly, as though time is finally choosing a side" lands cleanly, but the preceding "decides purpose is not a monument but a loop" edges toward thematic summary. Overall propulsion strong; line-level clarity high.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara as "cast lots decision maker" drives all major turns: coins determine dish direction, the edgewise fall forces split-dish choice, and her final lock of the transmitter enacts the closure. Her role is causally indispensable; no scene advances without her interpretation of prophecy and coin-fall. Introduced in the opening line, active in middle beats (calibrating feeds, guiding engineers), and decisive at closure (locking transmitter, watching the edgewise coin roll). High irreplaceability: her method is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The foreign coins appear in four distinct beats: opening description (planets, permission), console casting (two heads up, one edgewise—predicted pattern), mid-scene reflection ("every empire thought its face would be final"), and closure (edgewise coin rolls to blank face, charging Mara's realization). They enable the split-dish choice, link to theme (monuments vs. loops), and reweight at the ending. Strong causal role and closure linkage. Minor: the coins' museum origin is mentioned but not leveraged as constraint; their foreignness matters thematically more than tactically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Backwards prophecy" is introduced early (~second paragraph), shapes every major beat (announces results before reasons, predicts edgewise coin fall, delivers recursive instruction "send...and you will become the reason"), and grounds the closure's conceptual repricing. It changes Mara's options by turning "every hope into stellar doubt" yet providing alignment permission. The prophecy's mechanics—static bursts as broken backward syllables—are dramatized on the page and constrain her method. Indispensable: remove it and plot, stakes, and closure collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is signaled in the opening ("quiet enthusiasm that does not match the cold in her suit") and recurs twice more, shaping her stance under crew doubt and at closure ("her enthusiasm stays low and steady"). It enables her to persist through the split-dish strain and laugh at the blank coin face. Visible tradeoff: her enthusiasm isolates her from the crew's fear. Middle-band score: the trait constrains one major choice and charges the ending, but remains partly label-reliant rather than fully embodied in contradictory action across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Distill" as action appears three times with escalating stakes: distilling static bursts into three stable frequencies (map), distilling fuel into capacitor charge (sacrament), and the final "distilled chord to the past." Each use narrows options and raises cost. The fuel distillation is the irreversible commitment that triggers the signal and closure. Causal centrality high; swapping "distill" for a generic verb would lose the story's chemical-precision idiom and thematic link between refinement and purpose. Strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's method—"understanding static bursts by treating each cluster as a broken syllable in a language spoken backward"—is introduced early, demonstrated in the prophecy's operation (announces results then reasons), and drives the middle turn (boiling jitter to three frequencies) and closure (aligning twin feeds until bursts form a chord). The method is mechanically specific and constrains her choices (she must calibrate, not guess). Without this exact approach, the backwards prophecy remains inert noise. High irreplaceability and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" anchors all action, provides the console for coin-casting, houses the split dish and capacitor banks, and its trembling deck and glowing amber panels become sensory proof of the signal's discharge. The amber light charges the coin-spin moment and final glow ("as if sunlight has been remembered"). Setting supplies material constraints (thin power reserves, cracked bearings risk) that Mara must navigate. Strong spatial coherence and closure linkage. Cap: the deck's amber quality, while evocative, does not mechanically alter a choice as directly as the dish or fuel.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After the universe contracts" frames the entire scenario: sky constellations flicker and collapse, the galactic core is compressed, the universe has "folded in on itself," making any decision a guess and enabling backwards causality. This timeframe justifies the prophecy's existence, the contracting walls the signal must pierce, and Mara's acceptance that "purpose might still be reachable." Present in opening, middle (universe folding justifies prophecy), and closure (stars "keep doubting themselves"). Causal necessity high, but the contraction operates as constant backdrop rather than ticking clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to wavelength align with purpose itself" is introduced early, dramatized through her coin-casting (seeking permission/alignment), prophecy interpretation (method of alignment), and fuel-distillation choice (committing to alignment despite doubt). Internal conflict appears when "doubt bites" over strain and ghosts, yet "her enthusiasm stays low and steady." The motivation drives the climactic lock-and-burn and is reweighed at closure: alignment is "not a monument but a loop." Friction between wanting certainty and acceptingループ-purpose is enacted with visible cost. High causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" as tone is established in the opening (sky "unsure [constellations] should exist," prophecy "turns every hope into stellar doubt") and modulates coherently: crew fear, Mara's "doubt bites," and closure's "stars keep doubting themselves" even as the chord is heard. The tone charges the final image by sustaining ambiguity—Mara laughs at the blank coin, accepting doubt as condition rather than obstacle. Coherent through all turns and integrated with theme. Minor: the phrase "stellar doubt" appears explicitly once, risking on-the-nose labeling, but the doubt-texture pervades without mechanical repetition.</comment>
