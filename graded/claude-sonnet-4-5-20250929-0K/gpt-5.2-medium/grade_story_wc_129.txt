<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sava's interiority is rendered through concrete choices—offering to join the search, asking to be taught kinship, weaving the arbor—but her interior contradictions remain muted. The phrase "ache of being unclaimed" verges on label-only sentiment; embodied emotion is stronger when she "soaked them in crater mist" and physically grafted the lattice. Secondary characters (Oren, Ilya, the council) apply pressure but function more as witnesses than agents with their own stakes. The final choice to dedicate the arbor is earned causally, though the cost (social vulnerability, permanent commitment) is implied rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates kinship imagery—tags, kin maps, woven reeds—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) when Sava extends the kin map with empty spaces and asks to be named as maker. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost (public vulnerability, permanent social claim), though the felt price is oblique. One tightening occurs when the search pivots to the arbor discovery, reweighting the artist's purpose from wayfinding to belonging-craft. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater-edge setting constrain Sava's choices: she uses marsh reeds (her idiom) to graft the arbor to crystal trees, a micro-setting move that charges the final image. Sensory details—"rain on stone," "craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin"—are selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean across the orchard-to-arbor walk. The setting functions as both crucible and resource, with the arbor's obsidian beams holding reed impressions that reweight Sava's loneliness into address. The "shimmering crater" recurs purposefully, though its physics (ice-sheets over shimmer) remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: grafting onto community. The search for the tag provides coherent pressure; the pivot at the arbor (tag = invitation, not signature) narrows options and reweights the task. Sava's agency is clear in offering the search, weaving the arbor, and asking to be named, with the final act foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the artist "had been building a new kind of orchard" and commits her craft. Cost is legible but muted—she risks refusal and binds herself permanently—though the price is conceptual (social exposure) rather than viscerally felt. No antagonist; coincidence complicates (arbor discovery) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as craft, kinship extended by choice—emerges from particulars (reed lattice, kin map, loop-and-thorn recontextualized) without explicit thesis. The final image (council answering with nods, loop reappearing on Sava's reeds in winter) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture: Ilya's crystal fruit, Oren's map-song, the empty space for the lost child. "All signs were mortal and that was why people had to return to one another" risks overt statement but ties to the arbor's ephemeral-permanent paradox. The piece invites reflection on constructed versus inherited kinship without flattening into allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Sava's perception. Voice is distinct—lyric compression, elevated diction ("luminescent ache," "wound trying to heal")—but register occasionally drifts into poetic ornament that slows momentum ("Beyond the murmur of lost languages" reads atmospheric yet vague). Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("she asked to be taught who belonged to whom"), carrying subtext in the council's surprise. Free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature is evident in Sava's attention to reeds, spirals, and lattice-making. Under peak stress (arbor discovery, final dedication), diction remains elevated without collapse, though the prose never varies cadence to reflect urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Figurative language is frequent and mostly coherent ("craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin"), but density risks overwriting in non-peak beats—"luminescent ache filling the arbor" stacks modifier on abstraction. Template cadence appears twice: "They paired… and together they began… At dusk they walked…" and "Ilya stepped forward first… and Oren added… and the council answered…" (−0.4). No paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary. The final image ("everyone followed it to one another, not away") lands cleanly. One continuity slip: the "tag" is described as "ink-black" then "carved," muddling medium.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—kinship maps literalized as woven infrastructure, street art recontextualized as invitation architecture—feels specific and non-obvious. The marsh-reed sculptor grafting ephemeral craft onto crystalline permanence is a fresh angle on belonging narratives. The arbor's reed impressions and the tag's dual function (wayfinding + kinship-making) avoid template plotting. Risk-taking is evident in the lyric compression and elevated register, which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece resists generic "found family" beats by foregrounding craft and material (reeds, crystal, obsidian) as agents of connection. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sava shapes all major turns: offering to join the search (setup), interpreting the arbor's invitation (middle turn), weaving the lattice and asking to be named (closure action). Her craft idiom (marsh reeds) is irreplaceable. Cost is visible—social exposure, permanent commitment—and tied to her specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arbor appears at midpoint, anchors the discovery beat, holds the kin-map slate, receives Sava's woven lattice, and is named in the final dedication. Its obsidian material (reed impressions in glass) charges Sava's loneliness-to-address shift. Reweighted meaning: safe-path marker → kinship scaffold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kinship webs shape Sava's dominant stake and tactics throughout. The kin-map slate is the arbor's conceptual anchor. Sava's question ("who belonged to whom") drives her pairing with Oren and Ilya. The closure image extends kinship by craft, not blood. Not merely thematic echo—it alters on-page choices and options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is signaled when Sava offers to join the search and asks for kinship teaching instead of payment. The trait enables her pairing and softens council suspicion. Label-only in the phrase itself; dramatized in the search offer. Cost is mild—she risks refusal—but the tradeoff (vulnerability for access) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dedication redefines the arbor's function, extends the kin map with empty spaces, and asks for Sava to be named as maker—the closure action. The council's response (crystal fruit, map-song, nods) and winter's loop reprise trace directly to this act. Swapping "dedicate" for "offer" or "give" would weaken the permanence and public claim that charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shared search structures the first two-thirds: Sava is paired, they walk and scan nightly, report to council. The tag's discovery and reinterpretation (loop = person with no branch, thorn = make room) pivot the story's meaning. Mechanics matter—cutting reed spirals, following coordinates—and the method's failure (tag isn't wayfinding) generates the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard's crystal trees and crater rim supply the arbor site and the material contrast (ephemeral reeds vs. permanent crystal) that Sava bridges. The crater's ice-sheets and shimmer establish seasonal stakes (child fell, winter returns). Micro-setting: reeds soaked in crater mist, woven to link arbor and trees. The setting constrains craft choices and charges the final image when the loop reappears on Sava's reeds in winter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" anchors tone but does not function as a timeframe. The seven-day search provides weak episodic structure, and "last season" / "next winter" frame urgency loosely. No live clock tightens decisions. The temporal vagueness fits the lyric mode but does not pressure tactics; time is atmospheric, not constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sava's desire to graft onto community drives every choice: the search offer, asking for kinship teaching, weaving the arbor, requesting to be named. Friction is visible—she carries "the ache of being unclaimed," risks refusal, and faces council judgment. The want/cost tension peaks when she speaks "simply" and asks to be named "not as guest but as maker," a vulnerable public claim with permanent stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is coherent across the piece—loneliness softened by beauty, yearning textured by the crater's glow. Tone modulates: tentative in the search beats, hushed at the arbor discovery ("A hush settled, luminescent ache filling the arbor"), elevated at closure ("nods that needed no language"). The final image (loop on reeds, following to one another) sustains the ache-charged-with-hope cadence without resolving into simple satisfaction.</comment>
