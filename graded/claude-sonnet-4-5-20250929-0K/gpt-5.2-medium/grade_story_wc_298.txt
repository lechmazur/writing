<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's "fiercely gentle" characterization is consistently embodied through micro-choices: bandaging a thief, refusing to brighten the lantern, choosing suffering-as-lock over theft. Her final bargain—trading her ability to forget pain—arises from established traits and forecloses a path with visible cost ("woke each morning with yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn"). Internal contradiction operates cleanly when she steadies "the old loss flare" with "dusky resolve," showing contradictory impulses in scene. Minor slip: Jory remains a passive beneficiary rather than a pressure source, reducing relational crucible potential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Mira, catacomb orchard, "tonight") land by line three. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Mira binds Jory's destiny to hers by trading her ability to forget pain, and the silver thread settles into her skin. Cost is legible on the page ("woke each morning with yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn"). The causal chain holds: first bargain failed because someone harvested pieces → Mira discovers the thread → new bargain with irreversible cost. One meaningful tightening (discovery of the harvested thread) narrows options and forces the final trade. The piece teaches its lyric-textural pattern early (roots as runes, bones as punctuation) and pays it off at closure when "the skull apples stopped clacking."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains Mira's navigation ("when a femur pointed east, she turned east") and charges the closure: the silver thread caught among roots becomes the tactile site of her final bargain. Micro-setting (tarot card burning on tomb lid, ash falling "like dark pollen into the bones") integrates action and atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's divinatory bias. The half-lit corridors function as both spatial constraint (she refuses brighter light to avoid waking the dead) and tonal anchor. One small distance slip: "lanterns hung in their branches" introduces new light sources without explaining how they coexist with the earlier warning about bright light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Jory's wholeness) is signaled in paragraph seven and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the harvested thread, narrowing her options from "demand the trade be mended" to accepting a new, harsher bargain. Agency is choice: she rejects the broker's "cruel option" of stealing a stranger's destiny and instead offers her own ability to forget pain, with visible cost that forecloses the path of future relief. The escalation is causal (first trade slipped → discovery of theft → second trade with permanent cost) and the final price is legible: she will carry all pain forward without reprieve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the cost of fierce protection, the ethics of bartered futures, and the choice between theft and self-sacrifice. The burned tarot card (The Star, "its promise blackened but not erased") recurs with shifted meaning at closure when Mira burns it completely "like dark pollen," sealing the irreversible lock. "Inlaying meaning everywhere" operates as character worldview and structural method, grounding divination as concrete practice rather than metaphor. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "the holes she had feared became seams she could live with"—acceptance without moralizing. No thematic echo or prompt-label speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-limited POV anchored in Mira's divinatory perceptual signature: "reading the angle of roots as runes and the bone heaps as punctuation." Diction remains character-particular ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle") and lexicon stays consistent. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext (Vey's "only renewed" deflects responsibility; Mira's "you owe my brother his soul" asserts moral claim). Two register slips: "barrow a strangers clean destiny" (likely "borrow," though "barrow" could be voice-motivated archaism—unclear) and "trammel" used twice in different senses (first as verb meaning constrain/bind, second possibly meaning transfer), which may confuse rather than enrich. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "Tree roots snaked between bones, lifting skulls like pale apples" establishes setting and introduces the orchard's eerie biology). Rhythm modulates well between lyric description and scene pressure. Two patterns reduce momentum: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs 7–8 ("holes in his soul" / "whatever was missing" / "patch, a stitch") and template cadence in the Vey exchange ("Vey traced... then tapped... and the clearing seemed"). "Trammel" used in different senses (line 4 vs. line 24) risks lexical confusion. No filter-verb stacks or major loops in closure beats. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "dark pollen" effectively recharges the organic imagery at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of destiny-brokerage, catacomb orchard, and divination-as-navigation feels specific and earned rather than trope assembly. The "fiercely gentle" trait transforms the self-sacrifice archetype by making suffering itself the lock mechanism, not martyrdom. Fresh inflection: the revelation that someone else harvested Jory's restored future adds a third-party exploitation layer absent from standard bargain narratives. The piece commits fully to its lyric-divinatory premise without retreating into explanation. Minor proximity note: the burned tarot card and soul-patching share conceptual space with established mystical-bargain fiction, but the catacomb setting and "inlaying meaning everywhere" as method provide sufficient differentiation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's recklessness (coming alone, refusing brighter light, making escalating bargains) drives all three major beats: initial descent, discovery of the harvested thread, and final trade. Her idealism (bandaging thieves, rejecting theft of a stranger's destiny) constrains tactics and forces the costlier personal sacrifice. The trait is causal and shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in three beats: pocket (proof of first bargain), set down before Vey (evidence demanding repair), and burned completely on the tomb lid (sealing the new bargain). Its state evolves (edges curled → completely ashed) and its meaning reweights from "promise blackened but not erased" to irreversible lock. Specific properties (The Star, its burn scar) matter. High causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bartered destinies structures all stakes: the premise is explained by paragraph ten, drives Mira's first and second trades, and supplies the silver thread mechanism that Mira physically handles at closure. The concept constrains tactics (broker's "cruel option" vs. Mira's self-sacrifice) and delivers the final cost (destiny bound to hers "so no one can harvest it again"). Indispensable to logic and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is embodied in three constrained choices: refusing to brighten the lantern (gentle to the dead), bandaging a thief before calling a guard (backstory anchor), and rejecting theft of a stranger's destiny while accepting personal suffering (closure choice). The trait enables the self-sacrifice path and forecloses the exploitation path with visible cost. Label appears once; subsequent actions demonstrate it. Strong causal role, though one instance is backstory summary rather than on-page dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears twice: once as the elders' warning (bright light "trammels the dead into waking") and again when Vey offers to "trammel" a stranger's destiny onto Jory. The term signals the world's binding mechanics and recurs at a key choice point, but Mira's final act is described as "bind" rather than "trammel," slightly weakening closure linkage. Present in setup and middle choice; somewhat diluted at payoff. The action shapes one turn (Vey's offer) but could be replaced with "bind" or "transfer" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is signaled early (paragraph 14: "reading the angle of roots as runes and the bone heaps as punctuation") and demonstrated in two navigation beats (femur pointing east, root crossing like an X). It returns implicitly at closure when Mira "placed her fingers on the thread" and reads the exploitation, then uses ash "falling like dark pollen" as a sealing symbol. The method shapes Mira's approach and worldview but does not strictly constrain a choice that couldn't occur without it. Solid thematic and textural integration; causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard supplies navigation logic (roots and bones as directional runes), the clearing where Vey brokers, and the physical substrate (silver thread caught among roots) that Mira handles at closure. Setting pressures Mira's choices (refusal to brighten the lantern) and delivers the final image ("skull apples stopped clacking"). Present in setup, middle navigation, and closure. Removes it and the story's spatial logic and ending image collapse. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" anchors the opening and sets a dim, liminal tone that persists throughout. "Tonight" signals a discrete visit distinct from the first bargain. However, no clock or urgency tightens tactics on the page; Mira's descent and negotiation feel deliberate rather than time-pressed. The timeframe is present and coherent but does not escalate pressure. Functional setup; minimal middle or closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Holes in his soul" (Jory's hollowness) drives all three story movements: Mira's first bargain (traded her joy), tonight's demand for repair, and the final trade (binding destinies to prevent further theft). The motivation is dramatized in the discovery beat ("something leaked through him, and his shadow no longer matched his feet") and contested at closure when Mira chooses permanent pain over allowing continued exploitation. Friction between want (restore Jory) and cost (her future suffering) charges the ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" appears as a phrase once (paragraph 22) but operates throughout: Mira's refusal to brighten the lantern, her steadying of "the old loss flare," and her acceptance of lasting pain all embody dim, steady determination rather than bright heroism. Tone modulates subtly (lyric description → tense negotiation → quiet acceptance) and charges the final image: "her resolve stayed dusky but steady, and the holes she had feared became seams she could live with." Coherent and purposeful; not indispensable to logic but strongly integrated with theme and closure.</comment>
