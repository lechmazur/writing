<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is specific (escape the photographic curse) and the journey through the funhouse carries embodied fear ("old drowning fear pry at my ribs"). However, interiority leans heavily on ornate metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"Fear had learned my outline" reads as poetic assertion more than lived contradiction. The final renunciation (clasp drinks the luminance) feels somewhat mechanical; the cost is conceptual but the protagonist's internal conflict never truly competes with itself on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure—the protagonist tricks fear by making the light fail, leaving the curse broken and the funhouse dark. Orientation anchors (funhouse, after resuscitation, photographic curse) land early. The escalation is a deepening through recursion (mirrors, photo strips, final booth) rather than causal turns, which fits the lens. Cost is legible: the advisor dissolves into "my own breath," fear "slid off," and the funhouse goes dark—a before/after is clear. One persistent issue: the paradoxical instruction sequence feels slightly telescoped; the dream dictionary's margin note arrives and solves in quick succession without prior friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The funhouse is vividly rendered ("mirrors mottled with fungus," "flash bulb swollen like a maggot") and constrains the protagonist's path through discrete chambers (Hall of Snapshots, Tilted Corridor, final booth). The opera clasp functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting, sipping light and charging the final act. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting pays off at closure: the booth's mechanics (countdown, flash, clasp activation) directly enable the curse-breaking. Minor: some description edges toward ornamental ("cold perfume") without altering choice in those lines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and urgent: break the photographic curse before fear consumes the protagonist. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens—each encounter (photo strips, advisor, booth) layers dread. The final booth confrontation narrows options decisively: press the clasp during the flash or remain cursed. Cost is legible (advisor revealed as self, fear departs, funhouse darkens) but feels somewhat abstract; the protagonist's agency is a ritual act rather than a wrenching trade-off between goods. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length, but the escalation lacks visceral friction—no live option is visibly foreclosed with pain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fear as attention-net, light as bait, the paradox of being "unseen by being perfectly seen." The dream dictionary's margin notes avoid overt moralizing and instead offer gnomic instructions that the protagonist enacts. The final image (dull photo strip, dark funhouse, fear sliding off) reweights the curse without stating a lesson. However, "fear, deprived of its shining proof" verges on thematic summary, and the advisor-as-self reveal feels slightly allegorical rather than earned through prior cues. The resonance is strong but not fully oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, psychic distance consistent. Perceptual signature is gothic-lyric: "moonlight filtered through spoiled milk," "repulsive allure." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unbosom," "cognizant paradoxical notes") that strains the voice's natural lexicon under peak stress. The advisor's whisper is well-staged ("hissed from a cracked clown mouth"), but its speech ("Keep your eyes soft, and keep the clasp close") reads slightly generic. Internal syntax remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Elision is purposeful (what the resuscitation entailed) and does not withhold known stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, creating atmospheric texture but occasionally blurring propulsion: "footsteps pulled squeals," "mirrors…breathed," "luminance…gathered into a bead," "fear pry at my ribs." In the climactic booth sequence, metaphor stacks without clear causal linkage—"be unseen by being perfectly seen" and "swan's twisted neck…bit skin" occur in rapid succession with minimal concrete grounding. Minor loops: "lingering luminance" appears four times in similar phrasing. Sentence openings vary well, and no major grammatical errors. The overwriting does not fully obscure closure but dulls immediacy at the peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of photographic curse, funhouse mirrors, paradoxical dream-dictionary notes, and an opera clasp as light-siphon is specific and non-obvious. The emotional core—fear learning one's outline—feels fresh. However, the gothic-carnival frame is familiar, and the advisor-as-self reveal echoes common psychological-thriller tropes. The resolution (make the photograph fail by draining light at capture) is clever and earned in hindsight by the clasp's prior function. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than causal) and the sustained metaphorical register heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Whispering advisor appears early ("Keep your eyes soft"), guides to the Hall of Snapshots, prompts the margin-reading turn ("Read the margin, not the meaning"), and is revealed as "my own breath" at closure. It enables two key beats (Hall and Tilted Corridor navigation) and participates in the closure reconfiguration. However, its "decisions" are more observational nudges than choices that alter tactics; the protagonist drives all turns. Swappable with a similar disembodied guide without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Opera clasp introduced early (throat, then wrist), used in at least three beats: gathering luminance into a bead (mid-funhouse), functioning as hinge (Tilted Corridor), and biting skin during the flash to drink the light and break the curse. Causal pressure is strong—the clasp's mechanics directly enable closure. Specificity (swan with twisted neck backward) matters. Cost connection: the bite and light-siphoning are visceral. Minor gap: between first mention and wrist-repositioning, the clasp is passive description for several paragraphs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is the curse's mechanism, signaled in the opening ("thin glow…clung to my skin…made every shadow…look hungry"), drives the photo-booth climax (the glow must fail to break the curse), and shapes the dominant stake throughout. Causal pressure is clear: the luminance is the bait in fear's net. Closure hinges on making the light "fail" via the clasp. However, after the first third the concept recedes into atmosphere until the final booth; its tactical constraint is more told ("taught the net where to close") than shown in moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Photographically cursed is the premise, introduced immediately ("any camera that captured me kept the image glowing…people in those photos later died of panic"). It constrains the protagonist (must avoid being photographed or trick the curse) and enables the final turn (deliberately photograph oneself with the clasp active to neutralize the glow). Cost: past victims died; present cost is the protagonist's isolation and fear. Trade-off is conceptual rather than on-page physical struggle. The trait could be summarized as "haunted by light"; specificity lifts it slightly but involvement is mostly framing rather than repeated beat-by-beat enabling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unbosom" appears once: protagonist opens satchel "to unbosom the thing I hated carrying: a dream dictionary." This is the moment the paradoxical notes enter play, leading to the margin-reading turn and the final instruction. However, the action is brief and largely decorative; the dictionary could be retrieved with any verb. The word choice is voice-specific (archaic diction) but the action itself does not redefine options—reading the margin does. The beat is functional but the exact verb is swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paradoxical notes in the dream dictionary are signaled early via backstory (father's insomnia annotations, "walk deeper into flames"), demonstrated mid-story ("traced a line under FEAR," margin instructs "photograph that cannot keep you"), and supply the final instruction ("be unseen by being perfectly seen"). Mechanics matter: the protagonist reads, interprets, and enacts the contradictions. The method shapes two beats (margin reading, booth recitation) and is causally essential to closure—without the paradoxical instruction, the protagonist would lack the tactic. Early signal, middle use, payoff present; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival funhouse frames the entire piece, supplies distinct chambers (Hall of Snapshots, Tilted Corridor) that organize escalation, and provides the final booth whose mechanics enable closure. The mirrors multiply the glow, the photo strips pulse with "repulsive allure," and the advisor's painted clown mouth stages voice. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting's gothic decay charges atmosphere and its photo-booth infrastructure is indispensable to the curse-breaking. Minor: some description (fungus mirrors, rubber tiles) is atmospheric without altering choice in those lines, but overall the funhouse constrains and enables throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and establishes urgency (paramedics warned rest, protagonist cannot sleep due to glow). The resuscitation primes the protagonist's access to paradoxical notes ("after I was pulled back, the notes began answering me"). However, time does not tighten on the page—no clock, no deadline, no race against a consequence. The "after" is backstory framing rather than a live constraint. The piece could occur at any post-resuscitation point without loss. Present but not pressure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to "trick fear into revealing its weakness" is stated early and drives the funhouse journey. The protagonist's choices (enter funhouse, read margin, step into booth, press clasp) all serve this desire. Internal friction is mild—dread competes with determination but does not fork into contradictory wants. Cost is legible: the protagonist risks another photo (potential panic-death) to test the trick. The desire is more instrumental quest than conflicted yearning, which keeps it in the functional-essential band rather than the indispensable range where competing wants wrestle on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Repulsive allure is embodied throughout: "sickly and seductive" glow, photo strips with "repulsive allure" that invite staring, "nauseating second" of the flash. The tone fuses dread and fascination, modulating as pressure rises—early claustrophobia, mid-story mesmerism, climactic visceral charge ("swan…bit skin"). The final image sustains it: dull photo as charm, funhouse dark, "even the shadows had lost interest"—a shift from allure to exhaustion that reweights the tone without abandoning its dual charge. Coherent, modulated, and charges the ending.</comment>
