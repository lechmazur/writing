<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marin's dual occupation (columnist/exorcist) is well-established and her motives are clear—guilt over June's death drives the apology. Interiority is concrete ("rumor is a nail") and embodied through her shop-work approach. The final choice to write the correction is earned by the prior memory sequence and ghostly exchange, with visible cost (the perfume bottle cracks, the orchard will still fall). Minor: the metaphor-advising trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Marin's setup of the copper-wire apparatus because-therefore enables June's arrival, memory floods judgment, apology triggers the fuse-pop micro-turn, then the decision to publish the correction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): Marin commits to the correction knowing it won't save every tree but will preserve meaning—felt cost in the cracked bottle and the chainsaws rehearsing. Orientation anchors early (archive, Marin, pre-orchard demolition). One meaningful tightening through the induced-current séance that narrows options to this singular act of restitution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive's metallic shelves, old security current, and spatial layout (stacks, folio table, windows facing the orchard) all enable Marin's wire-loop setup and constrain her method. Sensory density is high—dust, ozone, pear-and-smoke scent, emergency bulbs—and filtered through her exorcist's practical lens. The perfume bottle and copper wire function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. The orchard's red-marked trees provide urgent atmospheric pressure and symbolic counterpoint. The one slip: "the kind of silence that had a name" is an elegant but vague opening anchor; full spatial grounding arrives a beat later.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: deliver the apology to June before the archive (and orchard) are erased. Pressure tightens through the wire setup, the memory flood that tests Marin's resolve, and the fuse-pop that forces her to commit via the correction. Agency is Marin's throughout—her shop-work exorcism, her spoken apology, her decision to write the retraction despite knowing it won't save all the trees. The cost is visible: bottle cracks, chainsaws rehearse, and Marin is left "gritty with sweat and holy smoke," knowing her act is partial and imperfect. One micro-turn (fuse pops, June's warm breath) sharpens the final choice without breaking the causal thread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "imperfect miracles" concept: restitution is costly, partial, and leaves scorch marks. The perfume bottle, copper wire, and orchard trees recur with shifting valence—preservation versus loss, delayed versus timely action—charging the ending without overt moralizing. Marin's reflection on metaphors ("rumor is a nail," "grief is a river") is character-specific shopwork wisdom, not authorial intrusion. The final image—writing the correction on the back of a score while chainsaws rehearse—answers the story's question (Can an apology redeem?) with a resonant "yes, imperfectly" that reweights prior material. No false equivalence or tidy moral; the orchard will still fall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marin's practical, metaphor-laden perspective. Diction is elevated but character-consistent ("half columnist, half exorcist," "shopwork miracles"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Marin notices wire, current, scent, and séance room cues—and stays consistent under pressure. One brief register slip: "the kind of silence that had a name" reads slightly abstract for Marin's otherwise concrete voice, but it's an opening flourish that the rest of the prose corrects. No dialogue is present; all internal and sensory work carries the voice load successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, information-dense, and propulsive. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. The long opening sentence and the final compound sentence both modulate breath purposefully. Minor density issue: the phrase "half columnist, half exorcist" and "shopwork miracles, imperfect by design" border on decorative but are integrated enough to serve character. One paraphrase loop: "imperfect miracle" is used twice in close succession (once as concept label, once as June's answer); the second feels slightly redundant. Overall clarity and momentum are strong, but the figurative load is high in the first third without full payoff until the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-as-exorcist synthesis is fresh and the "shopwork miracles" framing avoids both clean-lightning cliché and New Age abstraction. The induced-current method is specific and grounded in the archive's security system, not a generic séance. The orchard-as-living-archive metaphor deepens the apology stake beyond personal guilt to cultural loss. Risk: the story commits fully to its metaphor-laden voice and elliptical memory structure without hedging. One familiar template note: the "apology to the dead" frame is well-worn, but the perfume-bottle vessel, copper-wire apparatus, and imperfect-miracle ethos transform it into something particular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marin's dual role drives the entire plot: she brings exorcist tools (wire, perfume bottle) and columnist guilt to the archive, performs the séance, and commits to the correction. Present in setup, development (wire loop, memory), and payoff (writing the correction). Causal pressure is high; the story would collapse without this exact character. Cost is tied directly to her columnist shame and exorcist method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The perfume bottle appears in setup (estate-sale rescue), development (placed atop catalog notes, fogs from within during séance), and payoff (cracks, leaks scent onto notes "like a tear"). It carries June's essence (pear and smoke), serves as a séance anchor, and its destruction at closure visualizes the imperfect miracle's cost. Irreplaceable; another object could not carry the same biographical and sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" frames Marin's exorcisms as "shopwork miracles, imperfect by design, the kind that left scorch marks," directly shaping her method (induced currents, not clean lightning) and her acceptance of partial success at the end ("it would not save every tree, yet it might save what the trees had meant"). Present in her self-description, her tactical choices, and the closure's conceptual repricing. The concept is not merely thematic decoration; it constrains how she works and what she accepts.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marin delivers two on-page metaphors ("rumor is a nail," "grief is a river") as self-coaching before the séance. The trait establishes her voice and worldview but does not constrain a choice or create visible friction. She abandons poetry at the climax ("delivered the overdue apology without poetry"), which is thematically apt but undercuts the trait's causal role. Present in setup and mid-development; absent from closure participation. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the story's engine: Marin intends to reconnect only long enough to apologize, the induced current pulls her into memory, June's voice arrives, and the reconnection triggers the fuse-pop and warm-breath answer. The action defines the séance beat, the memory flood, and the final commitment to the correction. Removing "reconnect" as the goal would collapse the causality. Cost is immediate (fuse pops, bottle cracks) and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The induced-current method is signaled in setup ("coax induced currents into loops that would hum like a tuning fork for the dead"), executed in development (wire clipped to shelving, breaker closed, shelves tremble with "soft metallic choir"), and pays off at closure (currents surge, popping a fuse). The method is specific to the archive's security system and irreplaceable; a generic séance tool would lack the same grounded logic. It shapes Marin's tactics (wire placement, breaker timing) and the sensory texture of June's arrival. One minor: the exact mechanics are impressionistic rather than fully legible, but the effect is coherent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sheet music archive provides the security-system infrastructure (metallic shelves with low current) that enables Marin's method, the catalog notes that anchor June's presence, and the folio table where she works. The orchard beyond the windows supplies the ticking-clock pressure (chainsaws at dawn) and thematic counterpoint (June's living archive versus developer's erasure). Setting is present in setup, development (shelves, wire, notes), and payoff (emergency bulbs, chainsaws rehearsing). Micro-setting objects (bottle, wire, score) charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "hush before the orchard's trees were cut down" establishes urgency in the opening line; "saws coming at dawn" and "chainsaws revved in the distance as if rehearsing" tighten the window in development and closure. The timeframe forces Marin to act now and charges her partial victory with inevitability—she knows the correction won't arrive in time to save every tree. Present in setup, shaping middle pressure (the petition "unsigned in Marin's drawer"), and audible at closure. The exact countdown isn't tracked beat-by-beat, so the clock is felt rather than forensic, but it meaningfully constrains her tactics and acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The apology is the story's spine: Marin carries it in the perfume bottle, her guilt "had begun to rattle the stacks at night," the memory sequence replays her choice of "a sharper line because readers wanted blood," and she delivers it aloud during the séance, then commits to the public correction. The motivation is dramatized through her shop-work preparation, the memory flood that tests her resolve, and the final decision to write the retraction. Friction is high—she must face the cost (bottle cracks, orchard falls, reputation risk) and accept that restitution is imperfect. Irreplaceable; no other motive would generate the same causal chain or thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" coheres throughout: dust drifts "like pale pollen," the séance setup is "shopwork miracles" with copper wire and breakers, June's answer is "an imperfect miracle, a single warm breath," and Marin ends "gritty with sweat and holy smoke." The tone balances the mystical (foggy bottle, ghostly chord) with the tactile and pragmatic (wire clips, emergency bulbs, chainsaws). It modulates under pressure—lyrical in setup, urgent and embodied during the séance, elegiac at closure—without breaking voice. The final image (writing on a score back, chainsaws rehearsing) fuses both registers and charges the ending.</comment>
