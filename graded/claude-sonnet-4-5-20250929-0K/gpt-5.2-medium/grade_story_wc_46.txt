<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout—his guilt over the lantern accident is embodied through the scale metaphor and anchored in sensory memory ("the smell of smoke and the sound of people running"). His choices track causally from vow to action: the decision to polish rather than simply take the glass, and the choice to breathe apology into it, show internal conflict manifesting as deliberate micro-choices. The final shift from "punishment into purpose" is earned by prior causality, though the adult child's whispered reaction edges toward convenience resolution. Minor issue: the transformation feels somewhat linear without sustained contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memory resurfaces → polishing → installation → teaching). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Lio's vow shifts from punishment to purpose with visible cost (he can finally look at neighbors without flinching, foreclosing his isolating guilt). The final teaching beat extends the closure effect with conceptual cost—communal vulnerability replaces individual penance. One meaningful tightening occurs when he breathes apology into the sphere, narrowing his internal options and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's serpentine corridors and tide pools constrain Lio's search and supply the sea glass, directly enabling the plot. The scale anchors his ritual gesture (weighing the glass "until the beam hovered perfectly level"), and the meeting hall replaces the lantern space with purposeful contrast. Micro-setting: the wet sand and powdered shell are present in the polishing action, though their properties don't alter tactics. The mist recurs at opening and closure ("patient as the mist"), charging the final image with tonal coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and drives all major beats: the search, the polishing ritual, the installation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio realizes "his fear of fire had also been a fear of failing again," which narrows his emotional options and charges the polishing action with visible cost (he breathes apology, foreclosing pure avoidance). The resolution is earned by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each polishing circle loosens memory, and the final teaching turn reweights the stake from solitary penance to communal practice. Pressure coheres throughout without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—transforming guilt into purpose through patient, fire-free light—emerges from the concrete particulars of weighing, polishing, and breathing apology into the sphere. The pearl of stillness shifts meaning from legendary object to communal practice ("countless steady hearts"), and the ending offers a non-literal answer: the sea did most of the work, he only listened. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (the adult child's whisper, Lio's inability to look at neighbors until the pearl is hung). Minor slip: "the night itself had learned to smile" edges toward overt poeticism, though it remains image-based.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (Lio filters everything through star-watching metaphors and guilt-weighted physicality). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight during the polishing ritual, slightly wider during the communal teaching epilogue. Diction remains within Lio's lexicon—"zephyr bloom," "sealed ink"—though some phrases ("reflectively vibrant," "breathing line up with the waves") read slightly elevated for sustained crisis-state compression. The adult child's dialogue is functional but brief, limiting voice-distinction tests. Rhythm control is strong through turns, with sentence length varying to match pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, minor scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "with each circle he worked, more of his buried recollections loosened" immediately followed by a colon-list that re-states "recollections"; "weighed that guilt the way he weighed his brass star charts" loops the weighing metaphor within one sentence. The phrase "reflectively vibrant" appears twice in identical form (sea glass, then pearl glow). Template cadence in the teaching epilogue: "to gather… to weigh… to polish" reads mechanical. Apply −0.6 for loops and template phrasing touching multiple beats but not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of star-watching, fire-guilt, and sea-glass-as-pearl transforms familiar redemption material through the specific constraint (light without burning) and the ritual of weighing/polishing. The ending's quiet teaching turn—"the sea had done most of the work"—is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars. However, the core arc (guilt → redemption via craft) follows a well-traveled template, and the pearl-of-stillness legend feels slightly convenient as validation. The piece commits fully to its premise and the grotto-to-village structure is clean, but the emotional trajectory is more durable than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's choices create all key turns: he travels to the grotto (setup), he decides to polish rather than simply use the glass (middle development), and he chooses to teach the village rather than hoard the technique (closure participation). His agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Causal pressure: his breathing apology into the sphere narrows his internal options and charges the final installation. Strong closure linkage: the teaching turn would fail without his prior transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three distinct beats: discovery in tide pools (setup), polishing ritual (middle development with visible cost—edges round, memories loosen), and final installation as the pearl (closure participation—it becomes the light source). It evolves functionally: raw shard → polished sphere → communal teaching material. Causal pressure: its "odd heaviness… a pressure that quieted his thoughts" enables the ritual choice. High irreplaceability: no other material would carry the sea's patient work as thematic anchor. Cost connection: visible in the polishing labor and the foreclosure of fire-based light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness is signaled early (elders' legend) and shapes stakes: it names what Lio seeks and validates his sea-glass discovery. Middle development: realizing "the sea glass might be its raw beginning" reframes his goal and drives the polishing choice. Closure participation: the finished pearl's "calm, reflectively vibrant glow" fulfills the concept and enables the communal light. It changes options on the page—without the concept, the sea glass would remain decorative. However, the pearl remains slightly abstract (a named quality rather than a mechanical constraint), preventing top-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" appears twice: the sea glass "flashing green-blue even in the fog as if it had swallowed dawn" (setup) and the final pearl's glow (closure participation). Middle development: the trait enables Lio's recognition that the glass holds potential beyond mere brightness. However, the attribute functions more as description than constraint—no on-page action depends on the reflective quality versus simple luminescence. Swappability: "luminous" or "radiant" could replace it with minor edits. The cost is tied to the object, not specifically to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Weighing appears in three beats: Lio sets the portable scale and balances the glass against a lead sinker (setup with specificity—"until the beam hovered perfectly level"), the prior weighing of guilt "the way he weighed his brass star charts, palm to palm" (middle motif), and the final weighing of the pearl "not for grams but for balance" that shifts his vow from punishment to purpose (closure participation with clear reweighting). Causal pressure: the ritual of weighing enables the polishing decision and shapes the internal transformation. Strong irreplaceability: no other action would carry the balance/judgment metaphor as precisely. Cost connection: the time and attention required.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early via the portable scale (setup of intent), executed in detail ("turning the shard on a pad of wet sand and powdered shell, patient as the mist, letting the edges round"), and its result—the smooth sphere—enables the final installation (closure participation). Middle development: the polishing mechanics matter—each circle loosens memories, showing process as transformation. Causal pressure: the method's patience requirement aligns with Lio's internal shift. However, the specifics of wet sand and powdered shell don't constrain later choices; the work could theoretically use other abrasives. Strong closure linkage prevents top-band cap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto supplies the sea glass (setup), its "deepest coil" locates the discovery, and the mist recurs as tonal anchor ("patient as the mist" during polishing). Middle development: the corridors' shape (like a sleeping serpent) and the tide pools enable the search, though the setting doesn't actively constrain Lio's choices—he could gather glass elsewhere. Closure participation: Lio returns villagers to the grotto for teaching, completing the spatial arc. The mist charges the final teaching image but doesn't alter tactics. Micro-setting (tide pools) qualifies as choice-enabling, lifting the score above postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" frames the timeframe and recurs throughout the polishing sequence: "with each drip of water, he remembered… with each circle he worked, more of his buried recollections loosened." Setup: memories are cued by the grotto. Middle development: the resurfacing paces the polishing ritual and drives the realization about his fear. Closure participation: the shift from punishment to purpose completes the memory arc. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions with urgency—there's no live clock forcing faster choices. The pacing is reflective/accumulative rather than deadline-driven, fitting the chosen lens but limiting this element's constraint function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation—to share light without using fire—is signaled in the opening paragraph ("he swore to share light without using fire, even when the nights felt like sealed ink"), dramatized through the grotto search and polishing ritual (middle development with visible cost: labor, confronting memories), and fulfilled in the installation and teaching (closure participation). Friction between wants and costs: "his fear of fire had also been a fear of failing again" shows internal conflict driving the vow. The motivation shapes all major beats and the ending reweights it from punishment to purpose. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability: remove this motivation and the plot collapses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone—"zephyr bloom of salt and fern that kept him gentle"—is established early and modulates across beats: gentle opening, patient polishing ("patient as the mist"), and quiet communal teaching. It charges the final image: "light resting like morning on water" and "zephyr-light from countless steady hearts" reprise the opening tone with closure reweighting. The tone remains coherent through turns without flattening into static mood—pressure rises during the memory-confrontation beats, then softens at resolution. However, the modulation is subtle rather than stark; the piece stays in a contemplative register throughout, preventing top-band distinction.</comment>
