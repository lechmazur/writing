<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The narrator's professional identity as an "obituary writer for the living" grounds the opening, and the queen's grief is embodied through gesture ("fingers curl toward that warmth") and the physical pressure at the narrator's ribs. However, interiority remains thin—the narrator's micro-choices (wrapping the thread, guiding the projection) lack visible internal conflict or cost that would test competing impulses. The ending question ("what I sought in such work") arrives as a prompt-echo rather than an earned revelation from prior dramatized tension.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors quickly (traveler, palace garden, queen) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the garden description, the thread as relic, and the projection method layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the queen "leaned into me as if my ribs were a railing." The closure reweights the narrator's search for "the geography of healing" through the red thread as "payment and a compass," offering Charged Poise with felt cost (intimacy, shared breath). One meaningful deepening occurs when the projection lets the queen feel the boy's humming, narrowing her grief from wound to map. Cost is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final two paragraphs rather than crystallized in a single image.</comment>

<comment>The shadowed garden is rendered with purposeful detail—"crooked pear tree shedding copper leaves," "hedges swallowing their own shadows"—that mirrors the queen's lonesome splendor and charges the closure atmosphere. The carpet thread functions as micro-setting, handled twice (wrapping the narrator's finger, then placed in the palm as payment) and its "softness" recurs to anchor the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, shoulder proximity, sleeve brushing wrist) and the dusk timing modulates tone without clutter.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—providing the queen an "explained absence" that turns "a missing son into a map rather than a wound"—is signaled early and drives the projection method. One meaningful tightening occurs when the queen asks the narrator to "write her son dead without killing him," forcing a moral calculus that the projection answers by relocating the absence "between the garden gate and the far horizon." Agency rests on the narrator's choice to guide the projection "gently so the absence would be explained instead of reopened," and the cost is felt in the intimate weight ("my breath stutter"). Escalation is modest—pressure deepens rather than reverses—but fits the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>The theme of healing as geography emerges concretely through the boy's habit of listening to soil for water's path and the narrator's trade of mapping absences. The final exchange—"I traveled to understand the geography of healing, the routes by which people return to themselves after the last ship sails"—verges on thematic echo but is anchored by the red thread as both payment and compass, a specific image that reweights the premise without moralizing. The projection method (borrowed breath, warmth at shoulder) avoids symbolic convenience by integrating early and paying off at closure. Subtext operates in the queen's question and the narrator's realization that "another human body could stay."</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>POV distance is stable, single first-person, with perceptual signature evident in metaphors like "dark lantern," "loom remembering the tension," and "wet stones under moonlight." The queen's single line of dialogue—describing the boy's habit—carries subtext and specificity, though more exchange would test voice distinction. Diction remains elevated throughout ("lonesome splendor," "sorrowful perfume," "borrowed breath") without modulating under peak pressure; the rhythm is lyric-consistent but does not tighten when the projection forms. Free indirect style for the queen's interiority is absent, appropriately, as the narrator cannot access it.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence in the garden scene carries metaphor ("shadows swallowing," "palace itself tighten," "ribs were a railing")—without pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates peak beats from setup. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "I opened my notebook and described… Then I asked her to speak… She said he used to kneel… I tied the carpet thread…" creates a rhythmic flatness. Two instances of paraphrase loop: the notion of "explained absence" recurs in minor variations without added pressure, and "lonesome splendor" is declared then illustrated redundantly. Information density is strong in the opening, but the projection beat summarizes ("I let her borrowed breath cross it until the air beside us took on his height") rather than showing the mechanics in action.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The guild occupation "obituaries for the living" and the method "projecting presence" offer a fresh synthesis of grief ritual and embodied craft, avoiding stock metaphors. The carpet thread as anchor—"red as a cut lip and soft as hair"—is specific and its dual function (relic, payment) feels earned. However, the core frame echoes familiar templates: a traveler arrives at a palace to help a royal mourn an absent child, and the emotional arc (intimate contact, shared breath, departing with a token) follows a predictable shape. Transformation occurs through the geography-of-healing lens and the tactile projection method, lifting the piece above generic consolation, but the stakes and closure do not take an unexpected risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The traveler/obituary-writer appears in the opening line and frames the method, but key turns belong to the queen's request and the projection's effect rather than the narrator's choices. The narrator decides to "guide the projection gently" and projects their own presence briefly, altering the queen's isolation—two functional beats—but these decisions feel reactive rather than testing competing wants. The closing realization ("I traveled to understand the geography of healing") is told rather than earned through a prior on-page dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The weft thread is introduced early as a relic and anchor, handled in two distinct beats (wrapping the narrator's finger to feel "the palace itself tighten," then placed in the palm as "payment and a compass"), and its red color and softness recur to charge the final image ("mark my skin, a reminder that every departure can be woven into meaning"). The thread's dual function—ritual object and literal bridge for borrowed breath—gives it causal pressure, and its reprise at closure reweights the opening metaphor of weaving grief into pattern.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The concept "explained absences" is declared in the opening and operationalized through the projection method: the narrator turns "a missing son into a map rather than a wound" by placing the absence "on the map she already carried, between the garden gate and the far horizon." It shapes the central stake and the obituary's content, driving the queen's request and the narrator's response. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what distinguishes an "explained" absence from an "unexplained" one is told rather than shown in contrasting choices or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The attribute "vividly descriptive" is performed throughout (garden imagery, sensory anchors) but functions as a stylistic mode rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The narrator's guild method requires descriptive lines to "give those absences names that could be carried without shame," but no on-page beat shows the narrator choosing between vivid and restrained description, or paying a price for over- or under-description. The trait reads as a label for the prose itself rather than a character choice-driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Intimacy drives two major beats: the queen sits "so near that my sleeve brushed her wrist, an intimate contact permitted only because we both needed it," establishing the precondition for borrowed breath, and later "leaned into me as if my ribs were a railing," the moment when the projection completes and the narrator projects their own presence to stay. The action redefines the narrator's role from detached professional to co-griever, visible in "the intimate weight of her grief made my breath stutter." Removing this action would collapse the projection's embodiment and the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The method "projecting presence" is introduced early as a guild technique ("standing close enough to someone to borrow their breath and then shaping that breath into the outline of who was gone") and executed in one sustained beat when the narrator ties the thread and lets borrowed breath cross until "the air beside us took on his height." The mechanics matter—proximity, the thread as bridge, the queen hearing the boy's humming inside her chest—but the method is not tested against failure or constraint. It appears once, succeeds without friction, and does not shape earlier attempts or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established early with purposeful detail (black netting over roses, bench wet with leaf decay, crooked pear tree, river running black) and the dusk timing modulates the projection beat. The setting supplies the bench for intimate proximity and the twilight atmosphere that charges "lonesome splendor," appearing in the closure ("the garden's long twilight") to anchor the narrator's departure. However, the garden does not constrain a choice—the projection could occur elsewhere with minor edits—and no environmental feature (weather, access, social rule) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after the last ship sailed" anchors the opening and establishes the boy's irretrievable departure, but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the scene. The projection occurs at dusk, a mood marker rather than a deadline. No clock pressure forces the narrator or queen to act before a window closes, and the pacing is reflective rather than urgent. The phrase recurs in the closing line ("after the last ship sails") as thematic bookend but does not track or compress time within the narrative present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is stated twice—in the narrator's reflection mid-scene ("he believed healing was a geography, not a miracle") and in dialogue at the end ("I traveled to understand the geography of healing")—but is not dramatized through conflicting choices. The narrator's professional detachment and the moment of projecting their own presence hint at friction between observation and participation, but this tension is not foregrounded or tested with visible cost. The desire shapes the thematic arc but remains largely told rather than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The tone "lonesome splendor" is embodied in imagery throughout—"eyes bright with lonesome splendor, like wet stones under moonlight," "garden's long twilight," "sorrowful perfume"—and modulates subtly as intimacy increases ("the intimate weight of her grief made my breath stutter"). The elevated, lyric register remains coherent across beats and charges the final image when the thread's "softness mark my skin" recalls the opening metaphor of weaving grief into pattern. The tone does not shift sharply under peak pressure, maintaining a consistent melancholy elegance, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits dynamic range.</comment>
