<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior journey from fear to courage is traced through embodied moments—shaking hands, heavy feet, the dog's weight against her—and her reflections on broken leashes gain micro-choice friction when she chooses the darkest descent. However, the guides remain wise-elder archetypes without contradiction or embodied struggle; their patience and wisdom are asserted rather than tested. The closing image of holding the leash loosely earns some cost, but the epiphany about "unused courage" skirts therapy-speak. Interiority is occasionally generic ("fear turns her feet heavy") and the emotional arc resolves tidily without the grit of genuine flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vigil, indirect routes, and recurring star-punch motif build density toward a final reconfiguration where Mara trusts her own steps. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis tinged with Charged Poise)—she clips a new leash but holds it loosely, aware of the lesson. The cost is visible: she has traversed fear, rescued the dog with her own hands, and accepted that courage was waiting inside her. Orientation anchors (dog bolts, Mara at tide line, guides appear) land cleanly by ~10% of text, and the two-shard structure (shore/crossing, ridge/rescue) coheres under one window with a single transition. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara chooses the darkest descent after the vigil, narrowing options and paying off prior patience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting elements—shingle, fog, old pier, heather-and-cloud ridgeway, bracken thicket—anchor each beat and shape Mara's choices: the tide line stops her chase, the skiff crosses without oars (world logic), the cairn fire provides a vigil site, and the fallen fence enables the final descent. The ticket punch as micro-object constrains action (she uses it to bite open wire) and charges the final image (one last star punched as keepsake). Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's urgency (surf as lullaby, scree underfoot, wire tangle), and the guides' knowledge of terrain (indirect routes, easier crossing) pressures her path. The veiled ridgeway and shoreline recur to bookend the journey, modulating from liminal threat to trusted ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the lost dog and confronting her own paralysis—is signaled early and deepens at the vigil when Mara remembers other broken leashes, reweighting the search as internal test. One on-page tightening occurs when she hears the yelp and chooses the darkest descent despite fear, narrowing options and escalating risk. The rescue itself (using the punch to free the dog) provides a visible agency moment with cost: her hands shake, but she acts. However, the guides solve logistical problems (finding the thicket, knowing the fence route) without Mara's direct input, softening her agency in the approach. The ending forecloses the path of tight-holding control, accepting looser trust as price and gain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—courage as waiting presence rather than forward charge, and the necessity of indirect, patient seeking—emerges through particulars: broken leashes, the star punch that marks time and opens knots, the guides' refusal to take straight roads. The vigil in twilight dramatizes "staying awake to signs," and Mara's final loose grip on the leash enacts the lesson without stating it. The shoreline lullaby and star-stamp motifs recur with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the ending image. One slip: "unused courage waits" is articulated by the guide in near-prompt language, bordering on thesis statement, though it is embedded in the story's action and immediately tested. The piece resists tidy moral by leaving the lesson implicit in gesture and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds Mara's perceptual signature consistently: metaphors drawn from the sea (frayed like seafoam, oilskins faded to moonlit kelp), and her attention filters setting through fear and memory. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the vigil reflection, pulled back during the crossing—and no head-hopping occurs. The guides' speech carries faint archaic texture ("You are here to find…") that distinguishes them from Mara's modern interiority, though their voices converge slightly in wise-elder register. One line—"and in that sound she hears the quiet part of herself that always waits"—edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds her terror-narrowed state. Filter verbs ("she understands," "she begins to believe") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats (short breaths during the chase, longer braided sentences during the vigil) and sensory detail is textured ("heather and cloud braid together," "scree," "bracken"). However, multiple sentences open with similar stems ("The guides…," "Mara…") creating template cadence in the middle third, and synonym loops appear: "gently persistent" is stated then echoed with "gently persistent even in silence" two paragraphs later without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("fog rolling," "eyes hold maps that do not look like maps") and one mixed vehicle ("star on the punch flashes once, like a small promise"—stars flash, promises don't) blur specificity. The vigil section compresses transit efficiently, and the final line lands with clean propulsion. No severe opacity, but the piece would gain density by trimming paraphrase and tightening figurative logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—search for lost dog becomes internal quest via liminal guides and ritual vigil—offers a fresh synthesis of folktale structure and contemporary psychology, avoiding both pure allegory and pure realism. The ticket punch as tool (both stamp and wire-cutter) and the indirect-routes method provide specific, non-obvious mechanics. However, wise-elder guides and the symbolic journey pattern closely match template quest structures; the transformation relies on making the familiar particular through setting (shoreline, ridgeway) and object (star punch) rather than reconceiving the core frame. The emotional truth—fear as paralysis, courage as patient presence—feels earned, and the loose-leash ending resists tidy closure. Risk is moderate: the piece commits to its lyric-folkish register without retreat but does not radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides appear early (~15% mark), frame the crossing and ridgeway journey (setup, development), and deliver the final punched fare with instruction at closure (payoff). They make two key decisions that alter Mara's tactics: opening the gate to invite traverse and choosing indirect routes that force patience rather than panic. The taller guide's knowledge of the fallen fence enables the descent, and the shorter guide's persistent tapping and pressing of the fare into Mara's palm push her through hesitation. However, Mara herself chooses the darkest descent and uses the punch; the guides enable rather than decide the climax. Their wisdom is asserted more than tested under pressure. Swappability is low—remove them and the vigil/ferry structure collapses—but their archetype is familiar. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability push the score above 7.0; the lack of internal contradiction or visible cost on their part holds it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ticket punch with star stamp appears early (guides offer it at ~20%), recurs in at least four distinct beats (initial offer, tapping rhythm at vigil, Mara uses it to open wire, final punch at pier), and charges the closure when the taller guide punches "one last star" and instructs her to keep it for next time. Its dual function—ritual marker and practical tool—is specific and irreplaceable: the star stamp tracks patience and time, then becomes the instrument that frees the dog, star by star. The punch constrains action (Mara must use its small bite to work the wire knot) and reweights meaning (from fare to keepsake of earned courage). Visible cost: she must trust the small tool under stress. The object passes all three gates, appears in the closure unit, and drives two major beats (vigil rhythm, wire rescue). High causal pressure and closure linkage justify the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vigil in twilight occupies the center third of the story, providing the structural hinge where searching shifts from running to staying awake. It is set up early (guides mention it at ~40%), developed through the cairn-fire scene where Mara sits and reflects, and its lesson (patience, attention to signs) directly shapes her choice to descend after hearing the yelp. The vigil changes options by teaching her to listen rather than chase, and the guides' perimeter walks and punch-clicking enforce the ritual's discipline. However, the concept could be replaced with another pause-and-reflect structure (e.g., shelter from storm, guided meditation) without breaking the plot; its thematic resonance is strong but not mechanically unique. Causal pressure is moderate: it deepens Mara's stance but does not narrow physical options. Closure linkage is oblique—she returns to the shore with the lesson internalized, but the vigil itself is not reprised at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to the shorter guide early (~25%), demonstrated when he taps the punch in slow rhythm to coax Mara's name and again when he presses the punched fare into her palm without words. The trait enables two micro-choices: Mara finally speaks ("I lost him") and later accepts the fare as talisman, both of which advance the emotional arc. However, the attribute is more method than constraint—it facilitates rather than trades off—and its cost is invisible (the guide is patient without evident struggle or sacrifice). The phrase is repeated verbatim late ("gently persistent even in silence"), which reads as label reinforcement rather than evolved understanding. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect (the lesson of patience echoes in Mara's final loose grip). The trait is somewhat swappable with "patient" or "insistent," though "gently persistent" carries specific rhythm. Mid-band score reflects functional but limited causal pressure and no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears early as the guides' invitation (~20%), recurs as verb and concept (traversing the channel, traversing the slope, taking indirect routes on return), and structures the entire journey: crossing thresholds (shore to ferry, ferry to ridge, ridge to hollow, hollow to shore). The action is irreplaceable—remove traversing and the piece becomes a static meditation. It drives at least three beats: the ferry crossing that swallows Mara's footprints, the ridgeway ascent through indirect routes, and the scree descent to the thicket. The method of traversal (indirect, patient) constrains choices and differentiates this journey from a simple chase. However, the action itself is broad; "traverse" functions as organizing principle rather than single decisive move. Closure linkage is strong: the return traverse integrates the lesson, and Mara's final state ("trusting her own steps") echoes the action. High beat involvement and structural necessity justify 8.0+; slight swappability with "journey" or "cross" and the breadth of the action hold it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is introduced early (~30%) when the guides explain their method ("courage likes corners, not straight roads"), demonstrated across multiple beats (sheep tracks that double back, gullies, angled descent around the direct gully, return via non-straight paths), and thematically charged at closure when Mara internalizes patience over urgency. The method constrains tactics: Mara cannot run straight to the dog; she must follow the guides' slow, looping path, which builds her capacity to "walk beside the fear until it tires." Mechanical specificity is high—fallen fence, perimeter walks, angled scree route—and the method is irreplaceable without losing the vigil's teaching. Causal pressure is strong: the indirection forces Mara to endure rather than sprint, altering her internal state. However, the method resolves a problem it helped create (guides choose slow routes, then solve terrain obstacles), slightly lowering swappability cost. Closure linkage is thematic rather than mechanical: the lesson echoes but is not reprised as action. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and specificity push above 7.0; the lack of direct closure reprise holds below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway appears at ~35%, provides the spatial frame for the vigil and search (heather-and-cloud braid, cairn, gullies, scree slope, bracken thicket), and supplies resources that alter tactics: the cairn becomes vigil site, the ridgeline offers vantage, the hollow hides the dog, the fallen fence enables descent, and the thicket traps the wire. The setting constrains choice—Mara cannot see far through the veil, must navigate loose scree, and needs the guides' terrain knowledge—and charges the ending when she returns to the pier, the ridgeway now behind her as completed threshold. However, the setting could be replaced with another liminal landscape (moor, forest, clifftop) without fundamental plot breakage; its function is atmospheric-liminal more than mechanically unique. Sensory specificity (heather, scree, wire in bracken) is high, and spatial choreography is clean. Causal pressure is moderate to strong, and closure linkage is solid but metaphoric. Three-gate passage and tactical constraint justify 7.0+; some swappability and the fact that the setting pressures more than it uniquely enables hold it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the leash breaks" anchors the story's inciting incident immediately (first sentence) and sets the search in motion. Time pressure is implied—dog is injured, night is falling, dawn arrives at the end—but is not tracked tightly or used to force choices. Mara's urgency relaxes during the vigil (by design), and the guides' patience overrides the clock, so time functions more as atmospheric arc (dusk → twilight → dawn) than constraint. The timeframe shapes mood and closure (dawn as renewal, "only a pale seam") but does not narrow options or impose a ticking cost. Setup gate is met; development is passive (time passes); closure linkage is thematic (return at dawn). No major beats hinge on running out of time. The element could be replaced with "after the dog vanishes" or "in the wake of the accident" with minor tonal shifts. Functional but replaceable; mid-band reflects presence across structure without driving causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is stated explicitly by the shorter guide (~50%), but it is dramatized throughout: Mara's early paralysis at the tide line, her reflection on other broken leashes, her choice to descend the darkest slope, and her final acceptance of loose-grip trust. The desire is conflicted—she wants to find the dog but fears the dark and her own inadequacy—and the resolution (using the punch to free the dog, feeling the courage in her ribs) embodies the earned shift. However, the phrase "unused courage" is articulated by the guide in near-prompt language, edging toward tell rather than pure dramatization. The motivation shapes multiple beats (vigil pause, descent choice, wire-rescue action) and is central to closure (loose leash as proof of change). Cost is visible: she must act despite shaking hands and confront her habit of over-control. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; slight reliance on articulated statement rather than fully embodied friction holds it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone "shoreline lullaby" is introduced early (first paragraph: "sea keeps breathing a shoreline lullaby") and recurs at key beats (vigil, descent, return), modulating from eerie-liminal during the fog and crossing to steadying-ritual at the vigil to resolved-trust at closure ("listening to the shoreline lullaby and trusting her own steps"). The tone is coherent through turns—never jarring—and charges the final image by completing the auditory motif. However, the phrase itself is stated rather than purely enacted; the lullaby quality is asserted and then supported by rhythm and diction (long sentences, soft sibilants, gentle verbs) rather than arising organically from syntax alone. The tone shapes mood and thematic resonance but does not constrain plot choices. Setup, development (vigil calm), and payoff (final line) gates are met. Strong closure linkage and coherent modulation justify upper-7.0 band; the reliance on direct naming and the fact that tone guides rather than forces choices hold it below 8.5.</comment>
