<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nerin's motivation is grounded in embodied grief (the weight-drop sensation carried upward) and his internal conflict between measurement and compassion is concrete. The sister Mara is felt through memory arranged into present pressure ("placing her laughter beside his guilt"), and his micro-choices—wiring the seed, releasing the light—show hierarchy of values with visible cost. One slip: the "kindly methodical" attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page contradictory impulses in a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Nerin renounces holding the warmth, writes the guide, and plants the seed—a crystallization of stance that forecloses chasing Mara back, with felt cost ("needs it to become comprehension" → letting light pass). Orientation anchors appear promptly (magnetic arbor, Nerin, notebooks, infirmary below). One tightening: the arbor's field snaps a warning, narrowing his choice from chasing warmth to releasing and recording. The cost is legible in the shift from ambition to teaching future mourners. Minor slip: the causal link between wiring the seed and hearing Mara's memory-arrangement reads slightly elided—motive ellipsis is acceptable under accumulative design, but the mechanism remains oblique enough to nudge the score below 7.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor constrains choice (the field snaps when he tightens grip, warning against possession) and charges the final image (planting the seed between magnetic roots). Sensory selection is purposeful: cold iron and apple skin taste, the weight-drop sensation, the seed's hum. Spatial choreography is clear (observatory ring among ironwood trunks, platform, infirmary below). Micro-setting qualifies: the seed in the glass dish and the horn used for calibration are handled, not merely described. Tool and body constrain tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: can the physics of transition be understood without trapping the dead? One meaningful tightening: Nerin's ambition rises again to chase warmth, the arbor's field snaps a warning, and he chooses to let the light pass—narrowing options from possession to observation with visible cost (he plants the seed rather than holding it). Agency is renunciation that forecloses chasing spirits back. The stakes remain abstract ("comprehension" vs. "madness") more than viscerally immediate; foregrounding a sharper trade-off at the peak beat would lift this into the 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the seed as bridge, the spirit as script lifted from clay, transition as conjugation rather than rupture. The ending offers a non-literal answer—planting the seed trusts that understanding grows after departure—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the arbor's warning and Nerin's release of warmth. Minor slip: "the two no longer fight for the same room" edges toward articulated insight rather than pure image; the line is embodied enough to stay above 8.0 but slightly more oblique phrasing would secure the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority in grief beats, slight remove in observatory description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: translator's analogical thinking, tactile attention to clay and copper. Diction remains consistent ("wedges on clay," "conjugation," "grammatical marker") and voice-motivated. One slip: "the one thing a spirit carries across" momentarily adopts an omniscient certainty not strictly POV-modest; the beat recovers quickly but the lapse nudges the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; figurative language is purposeful (script/clay, stylus, parchment dipped in ink). Rhythm varies and paragraph cuts are clean. Two issues cap the score: (a) minor paraphrase loop—"he cannot bear for it to remain only grief; he needs it to become comprehension" restates the same motive within adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.3); (b) elevated diction ("conjugation into another state," "the two no longer fight for the same room") occasionally drifts from the tactile translator voice toward abstract philosophizing in a high-pressure beat (−0.4). No artifacts touch the closure image itself, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues → −0.7 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform translation, magnetic physics, and spirit observation is non-obvious and specific. Analogical thinking ("spirit as script lifted from clay") transforms the haunted-observatory trope through Nerin's occupational lens. The seed as a bridge between memory and departure is particular to this world. One friction: the "knowledge fruit seed" feels slightly ornamental in its fantastical naming without full transformation into lived detail; the piece compensates by making the seed functional (it hums, warms, pulses), but the slight decorative layer prevents the 8.5+ band. Risk-taking in the non-linear, lyric structure is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nerin is present throughout and his choices drive key beats: he wires the seed, speaks Mara's name for calibration, releases the light rather than holding it, and plants the seed. His translator identity shapes perception (analogical thinking, tactile care). Setup clear; middle and closure participation strong. One friction: the "kindly methodical" trait is asserted more than dramatized in a constrained choice with visible cost; the methodical work is shown, but the "kindly" remains label-only. Two beats (wiring, planting) + causal pressure + closure linkage lift the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The seed appears in setup (glass dish beside coils), middle (wired into circuit, pulses with his breathing, warms under fingertips), and closure (planted between magnetic roots). It enables the observatory function (bridge between memory and transition) and the final act trusts its growth. Three beats + closure participation + causal role (the seed answers and arranges memories) place it solidly in the 7+ band. One friction: the seed's mechanics remain slightly oblique (how it "hears him think" or arranges memories is asserted rather than shown through prior world rules), preventing the 8.5+ irreplaceability tier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" shapes stakes throughout: Nerin's ambition to map departure initially sounded noble but now haunts him, the previous abbot was driven mad by his own haunted ambitions, and at the peak Nerin's ambition rises again (tempted to chase warmth) before he renounces it. The concept constrains choice at closure—he writes a guide for future mourners rather than owning the spirit. Setup, middle conflict, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure and cost connection lift the score into the mid-6s. One friction: the concept is more thematic echo than unique-property irreplaceability; swapping "haunted ambitions" for "dangerous obsession" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is signaled in setup ("kindly methodical cuneiform translator") and his methodical work is shown (dusting grit from wedges, tightening copper bands with patience, cleaning lenses). The methodical trait enables his observatory work. One beat clearly demonstrates the trait (careful wiring and calibration); the "kindly" half remains label-only and does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup + one functional beat + causal role place it in the mid-5s; lack of cost connection and partial label-only use prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Reestablish" is the dominant action: Nerin came to reestablish the old observatory, cleans abandoned instruments, wires the seed to reestablish function, and by closure reestablishes the observatory's purpose by writing a guide. Two major beats trace to this action (instrument prep, writing the guide) and the final image (planting the seed) trusts future growth of understanding. Setup, middle, and closure all hinge on reestablishment. Causal pressure + closure linkage + irreplaceability (the story is about restoration vs. possession) place it near 8.0. Minor friction: the word "reestablish" is used three times, risking slight repetition, but the concept itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Analogical thinking is signaled early ("translating between worlds as he always has") and shown in action: spirit as script lifted from clay, arbor as stylus, arc curvature as grammatical marker, transition as conjugation. The method shapes his tactics (he sketches the arc and treats it as grammar) and enables comprehension at closure. Two beats (arc observation, final translation into plain ink) employ the method with visible mechanics. Setup + middle + closure participation + specificity place it in the 7+ band. One friction: the method is more lens than constraint; removing "analogical" and keeping "translator" would alter tone but not break the plot, preventing the 8.5+ irreplaceability tier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is present in setup (lattice of levitating boughs, hidden currents that tug at souls), constrains middle action (knowledge fruit grows only where magnetism and cloudlight meet, boughs align when coils energize, field snaps a warning against holding too tightly), and charges closure (seed planted between magnetic roots). Three beats + causal pressure (the arbor's magnetic field warns and enables observation) + closure linkage + specificity (magnetism as soul-tugger is unique to this setting) place it in the high 8s. The arbor is indispensable: removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the spirit leaves" is the story's premise and anchor: Nerin stands where his sister had been, carries the weight-drop sensation upward, observes the pale vector of light from the infirmary after departure, and plants the seed trusting that understanding grows after the spirit leaves. The timeframe shapes stakes (can he understand what happens after departure without trapping the dead?) and the title phrase bookends the story (opening air description, closing trust in growth). Setup, middle observation, and closure participation all present. Causal role + closure linkage + thematic charge place it at 8.0. Minor friction: the timeframe is conceptual anchor more than live clock; no ticking urgency alters tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the physics of transition" is dramatized throughout: Nerin believes transition can be understood through analogical thinking, he wires instruments to compare it to known forms, he sketches the arc and treats it as grammar, and at closure he writes a translation-guide for future mourners. The motivation is conflicted—he values measurements yet fears he valued them over Mara's fear; his ambition rises again to chase warmth but he renounces it. Two beats (wiring/calibration, final writing) stem from the motivation with visible cost (he lets the light pass rather than holding it). Setup + middle + closure + friction between want (comprehension) and cost (releasing Mara) place it in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Touching distance" anchors the tone: Nerin holds Mara's fingers at touching distance from his lips, stands close enough to feel the last warmth, hears her arranging memories, and the arbor's warning teaches him that holding too tightly becomes noise. The tone is elegiac and restrained, modulating with pressure (grief in the infirmary beat, methodical focus during wiring, temptation at the peak, acceptance at closure). The phrase "touching distance" reappears at the emotional fulcrum and charges the final image (planting rather than grasping). Setup + middle modulation + closure charge + specificity (tone as measured proximity rather than overt sentiment) place it in the mid-7s. The tone is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
