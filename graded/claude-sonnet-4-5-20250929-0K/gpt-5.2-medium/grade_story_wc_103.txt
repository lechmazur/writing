<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently layered—"I had come to discover the texture of time, not merely to guide feet" shows both professional identity and conceptual hunger without label-speak. Motivation evolves from hired task to existential complicity when she realizes freeing the woman requires "let[ting] the photographs finish fading," a choice with visible cost (the dust, Lio's lost memories). Embodied contradiction appears when she traces maze lines that "pull at my fingertips, inviting me," desire and compulsion fused. Lio remains a functional secondary whose retrocognitive trap adds pressure, but his sudden vocal shift ("voice suddenly young, then suddenly absent") feels略 asserted rather than causally grounded on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors POV, bridge-garden setting, and hired task by the second sentence; no delay. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through hyperbolic geometry, fading photos, halo-fragment use, until the final tightening ("maze was smaller, simpler") reweights the dominant stake (time's texture discovered through release, not preservation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis variant—protagonist renounces clinging to fixed images, the woman disintegrates, and Lio emerges clear-eyed; cost is legible (photos to dust, woman to flecks). One persistent constraint (the bridge "punishes those who stare directly") shapes tactics throughout (indirect viewing via fragment, hyperbolic curves).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge is tactile and rule-governed: "vines braided into arches that flexed…every leaf held a tremor," "bridge responded, thickening its tendrils into angled corridors." Hyperbolic geometry micro-setting constrains the protagonist's planting choices and enables the maze's multiplication effect. The halo fragment's "ringed shadow that did not match the lamplight" charges both middle investigation and the final circling gesture that tightens corridors. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (geometry, growth rings, hedge lean) without tourism. Spatial choreography stays coherent across entrance, center, and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering time's texture without cutting the bridge—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the protagonist learns she must "let the photographs finish fading" to free the trapped designer. Agency drives escalation: planting in hyperbolic geometry, carrying the fragment to the maze entrance, guiding it in a circle at the center. The final tightening ("every corridor toward a single impossible point") forecloses the path of preservation, and visible cost appears (photos to dust, woman disintegrates, Lio's voice "suddenly absent"). Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist's geometry and fragment use produce the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: time as "bark" (growth rings, organic layering) rather than line, memory that must "rejoin the living bridge" instead of being hoarded. The halo fragment's warming and the woman's "silver grains and paper fibers" literalize entrapment between glance and gaze without thesis statement. The final image—"pressed the halo fragment into the soil so it could rust into light"—offers a non-literal answer (release through decay, light through corrosion) that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the woman's grainy hand guiding the circle, the empty photograph as "final lesson," and the closing phrase "rough, tender grain of now."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with perceptual signature rooted in design vocabulary ("curves that folded back on themselves," "hyperbolic geometry," "finite deck could hold an endless drift"). Diction stays voice-consistent even under peak stress: "syrupy" air, "gentle vertigo that shook my teeth," "bark" metaphor. Lio's two brief speech acts ("whispered," names "without sound") carry goal-driven subtext (warning, trapped knowing). One brief elision—how the protagonist learned hyperbolic math—does not harm causality and keeps momentum high. Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer complex sentences during investigation, shorter fragments at the center turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Syntax varies and propels: "She told me she had designed the first maze, seeking the same texture of time, and the bridge had answered by trapping her retrocognitively inside the image of her attempt" compresses backstory efficiently without scaffold. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (e.g., "halo fragment threw a ringed shadow…inside it the fading photographs brightened, then began to move" = object, discovery, motion). Minor filter-verb cluster in paragraph two ("I traced," "felt," "heard") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across the piece. Read-aloud ear test passes with natural rhythm variation and strong paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry + living architecture + retrocognitive photo-trap feels specific and inevitable in hindsight; the protagonist's training shift from "stone cities" to organic math seeds the solution early. The woman "made of silver grains and paper fibers" and time as "bark" avoid stock metaphor. Risk-taking in structure (single long-form scene with embedded mini-narrative, high figurative density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: swapping names/places would hollow the story; the geometry, fragment mechanics, and photo-fade causality are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced sentence one as hired role; shapes three beats: sketching curves (early choice), planting hyperbolic geometry (middle enabling), guiding fragment in circle at center (climax action). Professional identity constrains approach ("not of straight corridors but of curves") and the final simplification of the maze validates the role's success with visible cost (photos gone, woman freed).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Halo fragment present by paragraph four; used in four beats: Lio's warning, table investigation (brightens photos), maze entrance (opens ringed shadow), center climax (warmed, guided in circle). Mechanics matter throughout (ringed shadow, light-throw, warming) and the final burial ("pressed…into the soil so it could rust into light") charges closure with irreversible cost. Swapping for generic talisman would break the light/shadow causality.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fading photos introduced paragraph three, reappear in five beats: donation context, halo-brightening, path-tracing invitation, maze-path matching, final disintegration to dust. Stakes hinge on them: protagonist must release them to free the woman, and their fade-to-blank directly alters Lio's state and the maze's form. Removing them collapses the retrocognitive trap mechanism and the closure's cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap assigned to Lio in paragraph four ("his gaze fixed behind his eyes, retrocognitively trapped") and to the woman at center ("trapped retrocognitively inside the image"). Constrains Lio's speech (names without sound) and the woman's half-printed form. Visible at closure when Lio emerges "clear-eyed," but the trait itself does not drive protagonist decisions—she acts on the fragment and geometry, not the trap mechanism. Functional accent, not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Disintegration occurs at climax: woman's body "disintegrated into a swarm of bright flecks that sank into the hedge roots," photos "turned to blank pulp, then to dust." This action is the irreversible cost that frees memory to rejoin the bridge and clears Lio. Swapping for "vanished" or "faded" would lose the material specificity (grains, flecks, dust) that ties to the paper-fiber imagery and the soil-burial of the fragment. Shapes the ending's physical and conceptual stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry signaled in paragraph six ("the only stable math…where a finite deck could hold an endless drift of paths") and applied immediately in planting. Mechanics recur: hedge corridors multiply, "each turn multiplied corridors until my sense of distance disintegrated," final tightening "angles…tightened, drawing every corridor toward a single impossible point." The method enables the maze's response and the closure's convergence. Swapping for generic "curved design" would lose the infinite-in-finite logic that justifies the bridge's dream-loop problem.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living bridge garden present sentence one; pressures choices across the arc: bridge "dreaming in loops" (inciting problem), "thickening its tendrils" in response to geometry (middle feedback), "quake in reverie" at climax, final state "smaller, simpler, more humane." Provides rules (punishes direct staring, responds to hyperbolic curves), resources (hedge cuttings, trellis), and the closure's physical transformation. Body and tool (fragment) also function as micro-setting. Removing this setting collapses the story's spatial and causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated paragraph two ("I had come to discover the texture of time") and dramatized through choices: rejecting straight corridors, tracing photo-paths, planting hyperbolic curves, final acceptance that "memory could rejoin the living bridge." Friction appears when discovery requires releasing fixed records (photos, woman) rather than preserving them, a trade-off the protagonist enacts with visible cost. The closing line "listened for the rough, tender grain of now" confirms the desire satisfied through renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone present from sentence one: "living bridge garden breathed," "every leaf held a tremor," river "sounded like pages turning," garden "hummed," final "quake in reverie." Coherent through investigation (syrupy air, gentle vertigo) and climax (garden "dreaming itself awake"). Modulates with pressure: tactile and sensory during setup, intensifies to "vertigo that shook my teeth," softens to "rough, tender grain of now" at closure. The quaking/breathing motif charges the final image when the bridge achieves simpler form.</comment>
