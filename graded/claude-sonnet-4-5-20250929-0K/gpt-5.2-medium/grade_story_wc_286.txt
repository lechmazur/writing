<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Galen's characterization is embodied and specific: "held the lantern the way he held unfired bowls, with sharp gentleness" grounds his potter's identity in gesture. His motivation to understand resistance is enacted through concrete micro-choices—rotating the lantern, testing shadows—rather than declared. Sera is more thinly sketched but applies immediate pressure. The final choice (centering the lantern) feels earned by prior causality, and the cost is legible: the oasis moves, the preserved combs crumble into "honest dust."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late situational tightening. The piece stacks fractured-timeline images (footprints, shadows, Sera's two faces) that build density toward the climax. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (potter, wasteland, oasis, dusk). The closure—rotating the lantern until "overlaps narrowed" and the oasis "chose a timeline"—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Decisive Change) with visible cost: combs crumble, the spring clears, the refuge releases into mortality. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis is vividly particular: "broken hives stacked like little kilns," "palms burned black at the tips," "brick chimney...shimmer, showing the same chimney built, burned, rebuilt." Micro-setting and recurring object (lantern, chimney, spring) constrain the protagonist's choices: he uses sun patterns traced on bricks to rotate the lantern, and the spring's state signals the final shift. The environment charges the closure image decisively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why places resist change. Pressure escalates through accumulative density (fractured shadows, overlapping timelines) and tightens when Galen meets Sera, whose dual states embody the fracture. The final act—rotating the lantern by sun patterns—narrows options: the oasis must choose a timeline, and the cost (loss of refuge, crumbling combs) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: "resistance can be a refuge until someone arrives gently enough to let it move." The lantern's response to kindness, the stacked timelines as shared heat, and the final centering all embody the question without assertion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the chimney smoke lifting and combs crumbling—concrete particulars that reweight the premise. No moralizing; the insight is earned through Galen's hands-on choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Galen; perceptual signature is consistent (potter's analogies: "hives stacked like little kilns," "held...the way he held unfired bowls"). Diction remains character-specific and controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Sera's line "she hated it for refusing to die" carries subtext and advances the thematic question. No head-hopping, and the voice modulates appropriately with intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: "the thrum steadied, answering his touch like a creature phototropic to kindness" does triple work (lantern behavior, character trait, thematic seed). Minor figurative density in the opening third ("chimney smoke flattens against a low sky...pressed-gray lid") borders on overwriting but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence; propulsion is strong through the closure beat. One small register note: "phototropic" is precise but slightly technical for the established idiom; it works because it's a concept-element, not a casual diction choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—fractured timelines as stacked pottery sharing heat, kindness as alignment that lets time center—is specific and non-obvious. The beekeeping oasis setting transforms the familiar "ruins in wasteland" trope through the preserved wax combs and the lantern as diagnostic tool. The closure (rotation via sun patterns, thrum as alignment tone) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present: the piece commits fully to its metaphysical premise without hedging, and the final insight (resistance as refuge awaiting gentle arrival) avoids platitude through grounded, hands-on resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Galen's choices drive key turns: offering water to Sera brightens the lantern and eases fractured air; rotating the lantern by sun patterns narrows overlaps and selects a timeline. His potter's gentleness is enacted in gesture (holding the lantern "with sharp gentleness") and causally shapes the ending. Present in setup, middle (water offer), and payoff (rotation). Cost is visible: the oasis releases its refuge state.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern glass is handled across beats: lifted (thrum begins), brightened when water is offered, rotated in the chimney to align the timeline. It returns with reweighted meaning at closure: the thrum becomes "a single note," and the overlaps narrow. Setup, development (brightening), and payoff (rotation) are present. Specificity (faded, scratched, soot-clouded) matters; its "memory" and response to kindness are irreplaceable. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape stakes and tactics on every page: footprints that "began, ended, then began again," shadows that "disagree," Sera's dual faces. Galen's method—testing sun patterns, marking shadows—depends on the fracture mechanic. The oasis stores "every version of itself, stacking timelines" like pottery in a kiln. The concept drives the climax (choosing a timeline via alignment) and the cost (losing refuge, crumbling combs). Setup, development, and payoff are present; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" constrains action: the lantern "answered his touch," brightened toward Sera's hands when he offered water, and the thrum responded to his gentle handling. The trait enables the key tactic (alignment via softness) and is paid off at closure when "softness is a kind of alignment." Setup (lantern responds to gentle touch), development (brightens for Sera), payoff (centering). One friction: the trait is labeled rather than shown via multiple distinct physical responses; the water-offer beat is the clearest on-page instance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The thrum signals fractured timeline overlaps ("pulsed whenever he looked at the odd overlaps"), warns ("thrum rose to a warning"), and guides the resolution ("thrum matched the shimmer...became a single note"). Major turns trace to the thrum: it centers the lantern's diagnostic function and the final alignment. Setup (soft thrum from memory), development (warning pulses), payoff (single note at closure). High causal pressure; swapping for another sound would require restructuring the alignment mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sun patterns are signaled early ("by following sun patterns, he tested the place"), shape tactics (marking shadows, watching them disagree), and drive the climax ("by following sun patterns traced on the bricks...he rotated it"). The method is specific and irreplaceable: the beekeepers' traces enable the rotation. Setup (testing), development (shadow marking), payoff (rotation). One friction: the beekeeper connection is introduced late (final third), but the method itself is seeded early and causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The oasis pressures choices throughout: broken hives supply the kiln metaphor, the brackish spring's state signals timeline fracture, the brick chimney becomes the centering apparatus. Spatial particulars (shed, hives, spring, chimney) alter tactics and supply resources. Setup (arrival at dusk), development (meeting Sera at the spring, walking through hives), payoff (chimney as alignment site). Micro-setting (lantern, chimney, wax combs) charges the final image decisively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" recurs twice, framing the opening and the resolution ("when the chimney smoke finally lifted and rose"). The timeframe tightens the window subtly: dusk arrival, night work implied (lantern glass "once made honey-gold circles for night work"), and the smoke's eventual lift marks the closure moment. Setup and payoff are present; middle pressure is less explicit. The timeframe shapes the ending image (smoke rising "like it meant to") but does not constrain tactics beat-by-beat. Solid lyric reprise with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation ("to understand why some places resist change") is dramatized through Galen's testing (sun patterns, shadow marking) and his dialogue with Sera ("he did not come to break it, only to understand"). It conflicts with Sera's hatred of the oasis's refusal to die, creating friction. The final realization—"resistance can be a refuge until someone arrives gently enough to let it move"—answers the question with visible cost (combs crumble, spring clears). Setup, development (testing, guiding deal), payoff (understanding earned through action).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is embodied in gesture ("held the lantern the way he held unfired bowls, with sharp gentleness"), modulates through pressure (offering water, rotating the lantern), and charges the final image (softness as alignment, "time, too, can be centered"). The tone is coherent across turns: precise but tender in description ("preserved like pottery shards"), firm in Sera's bitterness, resolving into quiet clarity at closure. The phrase appears once but the quality permeates diction and rhythm.</comment>
