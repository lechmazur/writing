<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motive is clear and her choice to filter rather than erase shows genuine moral calculus under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic description ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than embodied contradiction or mistake-prone thought under stress. The final choice—carrying the warning privately—feels somewhat convenient; we don't see her grapple with the cost of becoming the sole keeper of dangerous knowledge in real time. Micro-choices exist but the internal texture remains more lyrical than psychologically grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, why by ~100 words). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Liora maps silence, the prophecy rises as ripples, she chooses filtration over erasure, and the final image (blank petals, resolved to speak plainly) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she walks away with private knowledge, forecloses the weapon hunt, accepts the burden—though the cost is more implied than felt in a specific moment. The because/therefore linkage is looser than full causal; the turn hinges on her insight rather than external pressure forcing her hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, brook, stones, and alder shadows anchor the scene consistently. The flat stone and brook mist serve as micro-setting that constrains her summoning method (drawing intervals with twig and water). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "terrestrially cosmic" stones prime the closure (the joined crane dissolves into them) but their mechanical role—grounding the prophecy—arrives late and feels more decorative than constraining. Sensory detail is vivid yet sometimes ornamental ("sky pricked with cold stars") rather than filtered through urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hush the prophecy before factions weaponize it—is signaled early. The prophecy rising from the brook creates one meaningful complication: erasing it would silence the warning about poisoned wells. Liora's choice to filter rather than erase narrows options and shows agency, but the execution feels more like insight than a forced trade-off; no live opposition tests her resolve on the page. The final act (guiding the wings to meet, carrying the warning privately) reads as a decisional deepening but lacks a visible price paid in the moment—patrols arrive after she's gone, so no immediate consequence materializes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—secrets as mercy, the tension between silencing and speaking—emerges organically from the filtration act and the final image of blank petals. The crane's origami wing and "smoothed hush" recur with shifted weight at closure. Liora's choice to "speak plainly to the city before code could teach it to burn" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the phrase "resolved to speak plainly" in the final paragraph edges toward a thematic summary rather than letting the image carry all the work. No overt label-speak in peak beats, but the terrestrially cosmic phrasing occasionally inflates register without deepening meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") and mostly consistent, though phrases like "data of it" and "private current" feel slightly out of register for a summoner in a mythic nocturnal setting. The perceptual signature—mapping silence, feeling ripples as data—is character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose occasionally tilts toward narrator commentary ("as if grateful that secrets could sometimes become mercy") rather than pure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "smoothed hush" appears three times, "terrestrially cosmic" twice; "code" and "prophecy" cycle through adjacent lines without added pressure. The metaphor "a silence polished until it could slide between syllables" is vivid, but "tranquil blaze, like a hearth seen through gauze" mixes warm and obscuring registers without clear physical logic. Template cadence appears in the backstory block ("Her teacher had called it…" / "To make it, she worked by…"). The crane-wing mechanics (missing half, second wing made of quiet, joining) are poetic but not entirely legible as action. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—summoning attention as a "smoothed hush" to filter rather than erase a prophecy—offers a non-obvious angle on the silence-versus-speech dilemma. The origami crane split into two wings (paper and quiet) and the terrestrially cosmic stones are specific, though the mechanics lean more toward poetic invention than grounded ritual. The choice to filter instead of erase, preserving the warning while dulling the weapon map, avoids binary convenience. Emotional specificity is present in Liora's moral calculus. The final turn—carrying the warning as "private current" and walking away alone—feels earned in hindsight, though the lack of immediate external consequence slightly softens the risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout; her choices (to map silence, to filter rather than erase, to join the wings, to carry the warning privately) drive every major turn. Early signal by name and role; mid-scene she decodes the prophecy and chooses the third path; at closure she walks away resolved to speak plainly, altering her own stance and the story's outcome. The decision to filter is pivotal and irreplaceable. Cost is conceptual (she becomes sole keeper of dangerous knowledge) but felt. Solitary status constrains her—no collaborator to share the burden.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears early (in her satchel, described in detail) and is used in three beats: set on the stone to prime the summoning, pressed to the water to drink the code, and joined with the second wing (made of quiet) to lift and dissolve the prophecy. The missing half motif is introduced early and paid off at closure. Removing it would break the filtration mechanism and the final image. Strong causal linkage and closure participation. Specificity (folded from river reed paper, sealed with ash) matters to the ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is introduced as Liora's art, explained via her teacher's phrase, and enacted on the page through mapping silence and drawing intervals. It shapes her tactic (filtering rather than erasing) and is named again at closure when the haven "kept its smoothed hush." Present in all three beats (setup, method, payoff). However, the mechanics—how silence slides between syllables—remain more poetic assertion than visible constraint. The concept drives the action but its cost and limits are not tested by opposition. Mid-high band for thematic integration but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears twice: describing the stones' pull in paragraph one and again at closure when the crane dissolves and the stones "ground" the prophecy. The trait primes the setting's mythic quality and is invoked at the ending, but it does not constrain any on-page choice or tactic. Liora does not interact with the stones beyond setting the wing nearby. The phrase reads as atmospheric label rather than actionable attribute. Present in setup and closure mention, but ornamental rather than causal. Swappable with "ancient" or "sacred" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Flow" governs the brook throughout: it carries the prophecy as ripples, Liora uses brook water to draw intervals, she presses the wing to the water to drink the code, and at closure the brook "continued to flow in simple syllables." The element is sustained across all three beats and directly enables the filtration act. However, "flow" as a specific action is somewhat diffuse—water is the medium, but the verb itself is generic. Strong participation in setup, method, and payoff, but not irreplaceable (another medium could substitute). Still, removing the flowing brook would require significant rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named as Liora's method and demonstrated on the page: she listens for gaps between cricket calls and drips, measures intervals, and draws them as lines with a twig and brook water. The method is signaled early, shapes the middle summoning beat, and is echoed at closure when the brook flows "in simple syllables." Present in setup and development, with lyric reprise at the end. However, the act of drawing lines does not face any on-page friction or failure; it succeeds as described. Functional and specific but not tested under pressure. Mid-band for presence and coherence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook anchors every beat: Liora arrives, works at the flat stone, uses brook mist and water, and the haven remains at closure. The setting enables her method (brook water for drawing, mist to bead on the wing, ripples spelling the prophecy) and the stones ground the dissolved crane. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting is irreplaceable—no other locale supplies the flowing water and cosmic stones needed for the ritual. Strong setup, sustained middle use, and closure linkage. Cost is implicit (she must leave the haven to speak to the city). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" frames the story's atmosphere and Liora's urgency (she follows rumors, fears the prophecy will spread), but the timeframe itself is vague. No live clock tightens her choices on the page; patrols arrive "at dawn" after she's already gone, so the deadline does not test her. The phrase "whispered secrets" recurs as mood rather than pressure. Present thematically in setup and echoed at closure ("the haven kept its smoothed hush"), but does not constrain tactics. Functional as context but replaceable and not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Liora's motive—to hush the prophecy before it becomes marching orders—is stated early and drives every choice: why she came to the haven, why she summons the smoothed hush, why she chooses filtration over erasure. The motive is tested in the middle beat when she discovers the buried weapon and the cracking wells, forcing a moral trade-off. At closure she internalizes the warning and resolves to speak plainly, a direct consequence of the motive. Visible cost (she carries the burden alone) and friction (erasing risks poison, revealing risks war). Strong causal linkage across all three beats. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is invoked explicitly when the summoning circle closes ("the air warmed in a tranquil blaze, like a hearth seen through gauze") and the tone modulates across the piece: quiet nocturnal opening, rising tension as the prophecy appears, calm resolution at closure. The phrase captures the paradox of warm serenity amid high stakes. However, the tone does not shift sharply under pressure; the crisis beat (choosing whether to erase) reads contemplative rather than urgent. Present in setup, named at the key turn, and sustained at the ending. Coherent but not indispensable—removing the phrase would not break the arc. Mid-band for thematic fit and mood control.</comment>
