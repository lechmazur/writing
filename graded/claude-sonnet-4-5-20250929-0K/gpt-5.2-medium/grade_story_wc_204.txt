<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is consistent—distrusting perfection yet maintaining it—and his final choice to rupture the catalog is earned by the spiral frost and Mara's whisper. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: he likes the system yet knows it hides a seam. The embodiment is strong (uncorking the vial, aligning whisper with frost), but the climactic lever-pull lacks visceral embodied tension or micro-hesitation that would elevate the cost. Mara remains abstract; her presence charges the stakes but her shape never resolves into contradictory impulse on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The frost spiral signals the destabilization, Mara's whisper articulates the new contract, and the press-rupture reorders reality. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio freezes Mara's return in the mirror, compressing eternity into one irreversible instant. Orientation is swift (glass orchard, letterpress operator, negotiable reality by line three). Cost is legible in "cannot be renegotiated" and the library's shudder, though the mirror-image closure feels slightly oblique—undeniable pressure, but the exact forfeit (his own future negotiation? the catalog's function?) could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard is vivid, purposeful, and charges the final image: transparent boughs, frost patterns, thin bark at the westernmost tree. The frost constrains Lio's choice by spelling the press's demand, and the clouds-as-mirror transformation at closure reweights the entire setting. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony, aisles, westernmost tree). Sensory selection is filtered through Lio's craft (proofs, spacing, glyphs) without catalog tourism. The setting is integral to closure; removing the glass-tree structure would collapse the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: stop the constant bargaining and hold Mara. Pressure accumulates through the spiral frost, catalog flicker, leaning aisles, and the whisper's directive. The rupture decision narrows options with cost: breaking the seal lets books reorder by desire rather than title, and the mirror-instant forecloses further negotiation. One meaningful tightening (frost spiral to rupture) is sufficient for this length. The vial-under-platen mechanics feel slightly convenient—why this object at this tree?—but the causal chain from frost-demand to Lio's action holds under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: negotiation versus fixity, perfection hiding seams, compressing infinity to preserve loss. The bottled whisper and frost patterns recur with reweighted meaning. The final image—Mara frozen stepping back—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: eternity compressed into an irreversible moment. No thesis statement; the press-as-contract and catalog-as-order metaphors remain embodied in action. Slight deduction: "turning certainty into rumor" and "margin waiting for a title" edge toward overt poeticism that slightly dilutes thematic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("chiming with pressure changes," "draft of a new contract"), matching the surreal librarian's craft. Perceptual signature is clear: Lio reads frost like proofs, feels letters in the rollers' click. The ending's "present tense" phrasing and "mirror of that shifting sky" sustain voice under pressure. Minor deduction: "Each dawn, when the library cooled" and "Those patterns always began" slip into habitual summary at the outset; the urgency of this morning arrives late (line eight). No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high (every line advances world, character, or pressure). Minor loop: "the catalog lights flickered" and "The aisle lights went out, then returned" restate illumination-change without new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He uncorked…," "He followed…," "He carried…," "He slid…" creates a four-beat "He [verb]" run that flattens propulsion during escalation. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "clouds become a sea again, then a field, then a mirror" lands cleanly. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress operator printing reality-contracts in a glass library—is specific and non-obvious. The "bottled whisper" and frost-as-demand are fresh inflections. Risk-taking (surreal setting, accumulative structure, abstract stakes) heightens without obscuring clarity. The concept of negotiable reality feels slightly adjacent to established SFF templates (consensus reality, typographical magic), but the glass orchard, Mara's indexed-cloud quest, and the vial-under-platen rupture transform the premise into something memorable. The final mirror-step image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio (cryptic letterpress operator) is present throughout, makes the key choice to rupture the catalog, and his craft (printing agreements, reading frost proofs) shapes every beat. Setup immediate, middle development via frost-reading and vial alignment, payoff at the lever-pull. Causal pressure high; his decision alters reality and compresses Mara's return. Cost is legible (catalog seal broken, books reorder by desire, moment cannot be renegotiated). Strong irreplaceability: the press and glyphs are his tools, and no generic protagonist could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bottled whisper (Mara's captured breath) appears in beat one (apron pocket), middle (uncorked to deliver the contract message), and climax (slid beneath the platen to print the rupture). Early signal, two distinct functional beats (message delivery, press substrate), closure linkage (the vial's whisper enables the final imprint). Causal pressure: without it, Lio cannot articulate the new contract. Specificity high; a generic note or memory could not perform the same ritual compression. Cost connection visible (aligning it risks shattering the catalog).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" frames the orchard's daily animation and the climactic moment when "the orchard rustled awake around him, pages fluttering." Setup in beat two ("soundless stir, a rustling awakening"), payoff when the library's agreements shudder and books reorder. It shapes tactics obliquely (the frost spiral is a kind of awakening signal) and charges the closure image (the library waking to desire). Not indispensable—removing "rustling" would not collapse causality—but it coheres the surreal premise and reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is articulated in beat one ("he distrusted perfection because it always hid a seam that could split") and embodied at climax ("a single wrong letter destabilizes perfect systems, turning certainty into rumor"). Setup early, middle development via the spiral-as-destabilization signal, payoff when the rupture breaks the catalog seal. Causal: the attribute explains why Lio acts and why the press-bite shatters agreements. Cost visible (books reorder, definitions struck). Swappability low; a protagonist who trusted perfection would not rupture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rupture (breaking the catalog seal) is the climactic act. Setup via "rupture meant breaking the catalog seal" (middle third), payoff when Lio pulls the lever and "the library's agreements shuddered." It redefines options: books become "whatever it wanted," reality reorders, and the mirror-instant locks Mara. Causal: without the rupture, no closure. Cost unmistakable (definitions struck, aisle lights shift, infinite negotiation ends). Irreplaceable; no other action could compress eternity into one moment within this logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" appear in beat two (dawn frost on glass trunks read like proofs), escalate in beat three (spiral frost replaces grid), and guide the climax (spiral dots at westernmost tree spell the press's demand). Early signal, two distinct beats (diagnostic reading, then specific glyphic instruction), payoff when Lio aligns the vial with the spiral dots. Causal: the frost method teaches him where and how to rupture. Cost tied to it (following the spiral risks breaking the seal). Specificity high; generic divination could not provide the press's glyph-sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library (floating on clouds) is present throughout, shapes the stakes (maintaining catalog agreements in negotiable reality), and charges the closure (clouds become mirror, Mara steps back onto balcony). Setup immediate (line one), middle development via the westernmost tree's thin bark and cloud-light margin, payoff when the sky-mirror reflects the frozen instant. The glass structure enables the frost-patterns method and the balcony-cloud indexed quest. Removing the orchard would collapse the frost mechanic and mirror-closure. Not swappable with a generic library.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After reality became negotiable" frames the premise (line one) and the stakes (printing agreements to prevent drift). It enables the catalog-seal rupture and the final reordering by desire. Setup immediate, thematic presence throughout, but no middle beat that dramatizes time-pressure or tracks a ticking constraint. The timeframe is conceptual (post-event state) rather than a live clock. Contributes to closure (the irreversible instant ends negotiation) but does not actively tighten decisions or alter tactics mid-scene. Functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lio's motivation (compress eternity into a moment to hold Mara) is articulated in beat four ("compress eternity into a moment, before the moment negotiates you"), shapes the middle choice (follow the spiral to rupture), and drives the climax (pulling the lever to freeze the instant). Early signal via "he might hold Mara again, even if only as a present tense," middle friction (rupture means breaking the seal, cost visible), payoff when the mirror captures Mara stepping back and "eternity compressed into one moment that could not be renegotiated." Cost legible; irreplaceability high.</comment>
