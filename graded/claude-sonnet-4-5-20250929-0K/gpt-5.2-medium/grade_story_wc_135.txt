<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is consistently rendered through her archival lens—she sees absence as navigable reefs, turns the valve to understand silence as record. Her micro-choices (spacing Sorrel's visits, copying missing page numbers, orchestrating three evenings to cool anger) demonstrate a coherent methodology under pressure. The characterization of secondary figures (Sorrel, Ilven) remains functional but thin; their transformation is told more than embodied. Minor deduction for the boy's question feeling like a convenient prompt for Mara's thematic articulation rather than organic resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first sentence (who: Mara; where: ivory harbor quay; when: after exile ends). The accumulative lens is signaled early through "navigated absences" and "staggered intervals," and the piece teaches its mosaic pattern across Captain Sorrel's three visits and Mara's interstitial walks. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ilven's restored trumpet sounds not an order but "a tremulous invitation" while Mara writes to compile fragments—the final image reweights silence and sound with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: the community's anger must cool across three evenings, omissions carry bearings, and the valve's absence shaped survival. The lens holds. Deduction for the summary compression of key beats (Sorrel's confession, the three evenings) that deserved fuller dramatization at this word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's sensory signature—wet salt, crushed lime, rain-bright stones—recurs purposefully and filters through Mara's archival attention. The brass valve functions as micro-setting: greened by seawater, stamped with the old court seal, it constrains Mara's understanding (the missing note is itself a record) and charges the final image when Ilven raises the restored trumpet. The corroded trumpet, weathered notebook with torn pages, and bell tower anchor tactile choices. Spatial choreography (quay, doorways, tower) remains coherent across moves. The harbor setting pressures closure: the decree traveled mute, silence became a corridor for doubt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments so the town can exhale a future—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's method: spacing intervals to let memory thaw, copying even missing page numbers, assembling townsfolk across three evenings to cool anger. One meaningful escalation occurs when Sorrel's confession (Ilven secretly removed the valve) reconfigures Mara's chart: the council relied on sound for obedience, and Ilven drew a corridor of silence. The valve restoration and trumpet's first note constitute the closure turn. Deduction for the summarized three-evening assembly and the townspeople's responses (some thanked, some slammed shutters) that remain abstract rather than viscerally tested on the page; the peak choice feels more methodical than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the valve's mechanics: a trumpet without this part cannot speak, a town without its broken pieces cannot exhale. The premise—navigated absences as bearings—resists moralizing; Mara shows the boy the valve rather than offering platitude. Ilven's sabotage (removing the valve so the decree would travel mute) deepens the thematic question: authority relied on sound for inevitability, and silence preserved doubt. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the restored trumpet sounds not an order but invitation, and Mara writes to compile "the sound and the silences both." The quiet ending reweights prior material without stating a moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mara's perceptual signature (charting what was missing, seeing gaps as reefs, adjusting her map of losses on the spot) is consistent and character-specific. The phrase "reactively visionary, not by prophecy, but because each new shard of story sparked a fresh pattern in her mind" maintains voice-motivated register. Purposeful compression (summarizing the three evenings, Sorrel's three visits) serves accumulative design. Minor deduction for two moments where diction elevates slightly beyond immediate embodiment: "navigated absences, the art of charting what was missing" reads slightly expository in the opening, and "meaning assembled slowly, through staggered intervals of listening, revisiting, and letting grief settle between questions" tilts abstract when anchored only to the council's erasures. Both remain voice-plausible but test the upper limit of psychic distance during scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (the valve is greened, stamped, found in a net; Sorrel's notebook has pages torn at regular gaps). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Two line-level issues prevent higher scoring: the phrase "navigated absences, the art of charting what was missing so the living could steer around it" contains a mild paraphrase loop (absences/missing), and the summary compression of key beats (the three evenings, Sorrel's three visits) substitutes synopsis for scene where dramatization would sharpen pressure. No loops or scaffold mar the closure image. The final sentence ("while Mara wrote, to compile fragments into meaning, the sound and the silences both") delivers clear propulsion and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist who charts absences after exile, using a herald's valve to understand how silence itself was a record—offers a fresh synthesis of archival work, political erasure, and sound/silence as resistance. The valve's mechanics (without this part the trumpet cannot speak) ground the metaphor in concrete causality rather than ornament. Mara's method (spacing visits so memory can thaw, marking omissions with the same care as storms) transforms the stock "post-conflict reconciliation" frame through specific occupational logic. The final turn (Ilven's note is invitation, not order) grows inevitably from the valve's sabotage. Minor deduction for the boy's thematic question and Mara's answer feeling slightly pedagogical rather than fully dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (ocean-spray archivist) drives all major turns: she spaces Sorrel's visits (setup), adjusts her map when his confession arrives (middle), assembles townsfolk across three evenings, and asks Ilven to wait before sounding the trumpet (closure). Her archival methodology constrains tactics (copying missing page numbers, reading names aloud) and her final action (writing while the trumpet sounds) charges the ending image. Irreplaceable; the occupation shapes every choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in beat one (Sorrel hands it over), reappears when Mara realizes the missing note is itself a record, is carried to the bell tower where Ilven tries to fit it back, and sounds in the final image as a tremulous invitation. It enables the central discovery (Ilven removed it to make the decree travel mute), constrains Mara's tactic (she asks Ilven to wait, assembles townsfolk first), and charges closure. Specific properties (greened, stamped, without it the trumpet cannot speak) are causally active across three beats. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Navigated absences frames the story in the opening (the art of charting what was missing so the living could steer around it), shapes Mara's method (she pencils intervals, copies missing page numbers, marks omissions with the same care as storms), enables the key turn (the missing note was itself a record navigated by rumor and fear), and charges the final image (compiling fragments into meaning, the sound and the silences both). The concept constrains on-page tactics: Mara spaces visits to let memory thaw, reads recovered names aloud, orchestrates three evenings to cool anger. Felt cost: the hardest absences to navigate are Sorrel's blank months of compliance. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reactively visionary is defined in the opening ("not by prophecy, but because each new shard of story sparked a fresh pattern in her mind, and she adjusted her map of losses on the spot") and demonstrated twice: when Sorrel's confession makes her see a new chart (the council relied on sound, Ilven drew a corridor of silence), and when she reacts by spacing the three evenings. The trait enables middle tactics but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost; Mara's adjustments feel methodical rather than trading one option for another. Present across beats but lacks a sharp tradeoff moment. Mid-band for functional integration without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hearten appears when Mara walks to doorways and "tried to hearten them by reading aloud the names she had recovered"; it prompts the boy's challenge, which leads to her valve explanation, and it underlies the three-evening assembly where "strangers spoke to each other." The action shapes the middle tactic and primes closure (the trumpet's invitation is the final form of heartening). Cost is implicit: some slam shutters, resistance must be met. Not easily swappable (other verbs—comfort, console—would lack the specific breath/voice connotation that links to the trumpet's exhale). Two-gate presence with closure linkage; lacks a third dramatized beat to reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Staggered intervals is signaled early (Mara pencils intervals into her tide table: seven days, then fourteen, then twenty-one), drives the middle structure (Sorrel's three visits space memory to thaw in layers), and shapes the closure tactic (three evenings to let anger cool before Ilven sounds the trumpet). The method's mechanics matter: spacing allows memory and emotion to settle, and the intervals are marked with the same care as storms. Visible cost: the process is slow when people want swift closure. The method is irreplaceable; collapsing the intervals would collapse causality. High causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain anchors sensory detail (wet salt, crushed lime, rain-bright stones, gulls relearning the shoreline) in setup and closure. Mara walks its stones between visits, meets Ilven at the bell tower, and the trumpet sounds "across the ivory harbor after rain" in the final line. The setting supplies social pressure (families waiting at doorways, the council's erasures) and the quay anchors Mara's record-keeping. Micro-setting (the valve, the corroded trumpet) constrains choices more directly than the harbor itself. The harbor's post-rain atmosphere charges tone but does not alter a tactic. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) with thematic weight; lacks middle constraint to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>After the exile ends is established in the opening sentence, frames the dominant stake (people want swift closure, but meaning assembles slowly), and drives urgency: boats return in cautious file, the decree is lifted, Ilven returns from hiding. The timeframe tightens decisions—Mara must navigate the gap between the council's erasures and the present need to exhale—and the first trumpet note after exile charges the closure image. Cost is visible: blank months of exile are the hardest absences, and the process (three visits, three evenings) unfolds against communal impatience. Strong setup and closure linkage; the timeframe shapes all tactics. Slightly below top band because the clock itself does not narrow a single on-page choice with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning is Mara's explicit goal, stated in the final sentence and dramatized across every beat: she notes empty berths, charts losses, spaces Sorrel's visits, copies missing page numbers, reads names aloud, assembles townsfolk. The desire conflicts with communal impatience (people want swift closure) and the boy's challenge (why bother with lists when the sea has taken what it wanted). Visible cost: some slam shutters, the process is slow, and Mara must show the valve to justify the work. The motivation drives causal pressure (her method shapes all tactics) and charges the ending (she writes while the trumpet sounds). High irreplaceability; no other motive would generate these specific choices.</comment>
