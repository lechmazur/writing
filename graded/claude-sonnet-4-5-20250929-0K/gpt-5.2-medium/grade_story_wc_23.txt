<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The navigator's identity is richly embodied through "patchwork navigator, sewn together from old charts, borrowed languages, and the scars of every route I have survived." Motivation deepens organically from guiding outward caravans to navigating "the geography of loss" for returners, with micro-choices (building the armillary, plotting numbers against star positions) revealing values under pressure. The final recognition—"what I have built is not a machine but a promise"—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of mechanical navigation with visible relational cost. Minor slip: Sera's emotional arc (leaving her son, the reunion) could show more contradictory impulse in the moment of recognition; the "half prayer, half wound opening" gesture skirts label-only emotion but the boy's patient hands anchor it just enough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the armillary transforms from navigational tool to relational promise) with visible cost: the protagonist shifts from technical guide to emotional anchor, and the midnight caller is revealed as the boy seeking return. The causal lens holds: hydraulics fail → manual instrument building → cryptic calls → armillary guidance → reunion at the aqueduct. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (station, salt flats, hydraulics dead). One meaningful tightening occurs when the censer foot's lunar fluctuation validates the caller's numbers, narrowing the navigator's method and raising the stakes of trust. The boy's agency (sending calls, repairing radio) creates the reunion rather than chance, satisfying causal requirements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The signal station's frozen dish and jammed doors establish resource scarcity that drives the floor-built instrument. The censer foot's weight fluctuation with moon phases constrains the armillary's directional shifts, directly altering the safe passage each night. Spatial choreography remains clear (station → salt flats → aqueducts → camp), and the aqueducts' collapsed canals embody the reversal of infrastructure that once "carried life by force of hydraulics." The final camp setting charges closure by providing the reunion space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "lanterns look like a second sky" and the boy's "patient hands" echo the father without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating returners safely through altered terrain—is signaled early and tightens when the censer foot validates cryptic numbers, forcing the navigator to trust an unknown caller. One meaningful escalation: the full-moon weight swing points toward aqueducts, compelling the night journey that risks the group. The reunion resolves through protagonist agency (building the armillary, following the numbers) and the boy's parallel action (sending calls), not coincidence. Visible cost: the navigator shifts from solitary technician to communal promise-keeper, foreclosing the option of mechanical distance. Sera's search for her son provides secondary pressure that converges cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—loss as navigable terrain—emerges through concrete particulars: the censer foot's tidal memory, the armillary's nightly shifts, the caller's relay through broken towers. The final image answers the central question non-literally: navigation tools become relational promises when hydraulics (mechanical certainty) fail. Subtext operates in Sera's "half prayer, half wound opening" and the boy's patient hands that echo the father without naming him. The piece resists moralizing; "loss has a terrain, and if we read it carefully we can cross it without falling in" admits uncertainty ("I do not know whether the midnight caller is saving us or counting us") while offering raw solace. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph; the promise image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "patchwork navigator" filters experience through cartographic metaphor (plotting numbers against star positions, "geography of loss"). Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure: "raw solace," "grief," "half wound opening" avoid therapy-speak while maintaining emotional honesty. Distance modulates purposefully from technical ("hydraulics dead, roof lens will not raise") to relational ("what I have built is not a machine but a promise"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate for naturalism or subtext. Minor slip: the single-sentence structure "I stay anyway, because I am…" and "I give her the raw solace I can, admitting…" share a stem pattern that slightly flattens rhythm, but the effect remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, plot, or atmosphere without padding. Sentence rhythm varies effectively between long accumulative clauses ("families streaming to the coast when the inland wells turned brackish, but now the tide has eaten the ports and the people are coming back") and shorter declarative beats ("I stay anyway"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor deduction for two instances of participle-led long sentences that slightly compress causality without obscuring it: "With the hydraulics dead I cannot raise the roof lens…" and "When the migrants reach the station…" both stack multiple clauses that could breathe more. The closure line—"what I have built is not a machine but a promise"—lands cleanly with propulsion intact. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reverse-migration frame transforms the familiar "guide the refugees" trope through specific inversion: ports eaten by tide, people returning inland, navigating not toward safety but toward lost persons and places. The censer foot's lunar-weight fluctuation offers a fresh constraint that drives the armillary's nightly recalibration. The midnight-call relay through broken towers avoids convenient radio-fix; the boy's agency (remembering the navigator, sending numbers) earns the reunion in hindsight. Emotional specificity in "grief" as shifting passage and Sera's "half prayer, half wound opening" avoids generic templates. Proximity check passes: no close echoes of famous lines. The synthesis—navigation instrument as relational promise—feels inevitable rather than clever, though the core "guide returns home" arc remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is signaled in the opening paragraph, drives middle beats (building the armillary, plotting numbers, interpreting the censer foot's fluctuations), and delivers the closure realization ("what I have built is not a machine but a promise"). Key decisions—trusting the cryptic caller, leading the group to the aqueducts—create turns that narrow options. Removing this character would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot is introduced early as the navigator's kept relic, reappears when its weight fluctuates with moon phases to validate the caller's numbers (middle constraint), grows "heavy as a stone" under the full moon to direct the aqueduct journey, and anchors the armillary that becomes the closure's promise-instrument. Its tidal memory—"as if the metal remembers tides"—charges the reversal theme. Removing this object would break the navigational method and the thematic linkage between loss, memory, and guidance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reverse migration shapes the dominant stake from the first paragraph: "the tide has eaten the ports and the people are coming back… asking me to navigate the geography of loss." It constrains tactics (old routes swallowed by sinkholes, aqueducts reversed) and drives the climax (returners seeking lost kin rather than fleeing). The boy's reason for calling hinges on this concept: "he wanted someone to guide them back." The closure—navigation as relational promise—is inseparable from the reversal of exodus. Swapping this for standard migration would require fundamental restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lunar fluctuation is introduced in the first night with the censer foot's warmth and weight changes, constrains the middle plotting (matching the caller's numbers to moon phases), and culminates in the full-moon "heavy as a stone" swing that compels the aqueduct journey. This trait enables the armillary's nightly recalibration, directly altering safe passage. Visible cost: the group must move at night following a shifting path rather than a fixed route. Removing the lunar tie would require a different constraint mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Build" is signaled early ("I begin to build a new instrument on the floor from scrap wire, cracked glass, and the… censer foot"), drives the middle progression (constructing the armillary, integrating the foot as anchor), and delivers the closure image: "what I have built is not a machine but a promise." The action transforms from mechanical necessity (hydraulics failed) to relational commitment. At least three beats trace to this action. Swapping "build" for "repair" or "find" would break the scrap-assembly logic and the thematic shift from tool to promise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cryptic midnight phone calls are introduced on the first night post-failure, recur across three nights with escalating information (numbers, riddle, sinkhole warnings), and are revealed at closure as the boy's relay "through whatever towers still breathed." The method shapes tactics: the navigator plots numbers against star positions and validates them via the censer foot. Removing phone calls would require a different communication mechanism and break the boy's agency. The midnight timing ties to the lunar constraint, charging the pattern.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored in the opening line, supplies the resource constraint (frozen dish, jammed doors, dead hydraulics) that forces floor-based instrument building, and provides the "station stars" that guide the final journey. The station's history (guiding outward caravans) contrasts with its new role (guiding returners), charging the reversal theme. Spatial micro-setting (floor space for the armillary, lanterns arriving like "a second sky") alters tactics. Removing this setting would require a different navigational hub and weaken the mechanical-to-relational shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" anchors the inciting constraint in the opening line and tightens the timeline: first night (call one), second night (call two, moon fattens), third night (call three, understanding), full moon (aqueduct journey), dawn (reunion). The timeframe compresses decisions across a lunar cycle, forcing nightly recalibration. However, specific hour-to-hour pressure within nights is not tracked; the "after" framing is more causal marker than live clock. Removing this frame would weaken the urgency but not collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Navigate the geography of loss" is dramatized in the opening beats (returners "asking me to navigate… the places where houses were, where names belonged") and drives the protagonist's choices: building the armillary, trusting the caller, leading the group despite uncertainty. Friction appears in "I do not know whether the midnight caller is saving us or counting us" and "I give her the raw solace I can, admitting I do not know." The closure crystallizes this motivation as relational promise rather than technical service. Visible cost: the navigator foregoes mechanical distance for emotional entanglement. Swapping this for generic "guide people home" would flatten the theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Raw solace is embodied in "I give her the raw solace I can, admitting I do not know… but I also tell her that loss has a terrain, and if we read it carefully we can cross it without falling in"—honest uncertainty without false comfort. Tone modulates from technical restraint (hydraulics, roof lens) to relational warmth (Sera's "half prayer, half wound opening," the boy's patient hands) and charges the closure: "what I have built is not a machine but a promise." Coherent across turns. However, the tone is stable rather than dynamically shifting with pressure peaks, landing it in the functional-strong band rather than indispensable.</comment>
