<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's widowhood and grief function as embodied motivation that shapes her archival method—reading "what people did not write"—and her choice to draft a careful note rather than overwhelming Josie. The motives feel earned and her micro-choices (cutting twine, copying the letter in her neat hand) carry visible weight. However, interiority occasionally tips toward label-speak: "her grief shift from a weight into a lens" and "her own heart, not healed, but moving" read as therapeutic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Minor embodiment gaps prevent entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly: Mara and Josie leave the button on the table "like a pebble that could start a ripple," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes options and reweights Mara's grief-lens with visible social and emotional cost. The inferred lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the dust pattern → Cabinet H → bundle → letter sequence drives discovery (causal), while the button and Lottie's name accumulate meaning across the arc. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara finds the bundle and realizes "the dust map and the button had refused the erasure." Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The ending cost is felt but not decisive action, holding the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room's "metal cabinets that sweated in summer and sang in winter," the dust pattern as "a quiet map of absence," and the button "warm from her skin" all anchor setting through tactile, purposeful detail filtered by Mara's archival attention. The dust rectangle and Cabinet H drawer constrain her search path, and the "sour smell of smoke and river mud" charges the moment she unfurls the papers, directly shaping her realization. The micro-setting (button, dust, twine) functions as environment and constraints that alter tactics. Strong integration across beats, though the room itself remains somewhat static beyond the opening image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why Josie's file ended with a blank page—is signaled early and drives Mara's archival detective work. Pressure tightens when the dust pattern leads to Cabinet H, the bundle's discovery narrows options (she must decide whether to contact Josie), and the button forecloses easy erasure. Josie's arrival crystallizes the relational cost: "eyes guarded," she asks "why a soldier would write such a thing," and Mara's answer—"sorrow makes people cruel, but sometimes it also opens a door"—reweights the premise with visible interpersonal stakes. One meaningful deepening under the hybrid lens; the cost is clear but not a decisive confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—small kindnesses that resist institutional erasure—emerges organically from the dust map, the button-as-promise, and the final image of the button left out "like a pebble that could start a ripple." Mara's realization that "this was history no monument bothered to carve, a kindness stitched into bureaucracy" integrates the historical premise with her personal grief without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: her heart is "not healed, but moving," a quiet reconfiguration earned by the specific encounter with Lottie's name and Eli's confession. No thematic echo; the particulars (boiled rags, bread at dawn, the lightning-vein crack) anchor the abstract. Excellent thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Mara's archival attention: "she learned to read what people did not write" establishes perceptual signature. Diction is controlled and rhythmic—"a nickname scratched in pencil, a blot where a tear had fallen"—and carries Mara's voice consistently. Josie's brief dialogue ("why a soldier would write such a thing") is naturalistic and goal-driven. However, two passages drift into elevated summary: "her motive became simple and stubborn, to magnify small kindnesses that might keep the next heart from breaking" and "feeling her grief shift from a weight into a lens" read as authorial restatement rather than Mara's own idiom under pressure. Minor register slips prevent entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: "the pattern was a quiet map of absence" and "a sour smell of smoke and river mud rose as if the war itself had been folded up and shelved" are vivid, specific, and do double duty. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and information density is high throughout. Two minor frictions: "a broken-hearted archivist, newly widowed" front-loads summary in the opening, and "her grief shift from a weight into a lens" and "her own heart, not healed, but moving" are stock metaphors that flatten peak moments. No loops or template cadence; clarity and momentum remain strong. High information density with one figurative slip in a closure beat holds the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-emancipation foster care records, Civil War guilt, and archival dust-mapping is specific and non-obvious. The button as both trophy and promise transforms the soldier-redemption trope, and the dust pattern as investigative tool feels fresh. However, the emotional arc—widowed archivist finds meaning through helping another—is a familiar frame, and the story executes it well without bold structural risk. The ending image (button as pebble) is resonant but not startling. Strong originality in premise and detail; safe framing and resolution prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Mara is named and characterized in the opening sentence. Development: she makes the choice to bring Josie's file to the table, cut the twine, draft the note, and meet Josie—each decision narrows options and advances the arc. Payoff: in the final scene, Mara places the button between them and offers her answer about sorrow and small kindnesses, directly shaping Josie's realization and the story's closure. Three distinct beats; strong causal pressure; closure linkage clear. Her decisions drive every major turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: the button rolls into Mara's palm in the discovery beat, "warm from her skin," with stamped number and crack described. Development: it is mentioned as Eli's keepsake and Lottie's teaching tool in the letter; it anchors Mara's realization that someone "had once chosen mercy." Payoff: Mara places it between them in the final scene, and it becomes "a pebble that could start a ripple"—the charged final image. Three beats; causal pressure (it proves the erasure failed); closure participation strong; irreplaceability high (the crack and stamped number are specific). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "unknown histories" is named in the opening and frames Mara's archival method ("she learned to read what people did not write"). Development: the blank page and dust map are literal unknown histories that Mara must decode; the element shapes her investigative tactics. Payoff: the closing phrase "the examined unknown of that room" reprises the concept and charges the final image. The concept constrains her approach (careful not to snap edges, drafting a note "with just enough detail") and alters Josie's options (she can now know Lottie was real). Strong thematic and tactical integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "tactfully hopeful even when hope hurt" appears once in the discovery beat. Development: Mara's choices to copy the letter and draft a note "with just enough detail to honor the truth without overwhelming it" enact tact under pressure; the trait constrains her communication strategy. Payoff: her answer to Josie—explaining sorrow and small kindnesses—demonstrates tact in action. Two beats; one clear cost (she withholds overwhelming detail, risking incomplete disclosure). The attribute is enacted rather than merely labeled, but only one strong causal moment (the note drafting) ties cost to the trait. Mid-band for partial causal work and one visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "unfurl" is prepared by "she cut the twine, then began to unfurl the brittle papers within, careful not to snap their edges." Development: the unfolding releases the smell of smoke and river mud, and the letter's contents drive Mara's realization. Payoff: the act of opening the bundle is the inciting discovery that enables the entire closure sequence. One pivotal beat; strong causal pressure (without this action, the letter and Lottie's name remain hidden); irreplaceability high (the care taken and the sensory result are specific). The action is load-bearing for the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "accumulated dust patterns" and "a rectangle of cleaner wood marked the space where another folder had once rested" appear in the discovery beat. Development: the dust map functions as the investigative method that leads Mara to Cabinet H; the method matters tactically. Payoff: later Mara reflects that "the dust map and the button had refused the erasure," crediting the method in her realization. Two beats; causal pressure (the method enables the discovery); specificity high (the cleaner rectangle is concrete). The method shapes her investigative path and is reprised thematically at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "foster care file room, where metal cabinets sweated in summer and sang in winter" anchors setting immediately. Development: Cabinet H, Drawer 4 provides the physical constraint that Mara must navigate; the long table is the workspace where she examines the file and later meets Josie. Payoff: "in the examined unknown of that room Mara felt her own heart, not healed, but moving" places the closure moment within the setting, and the room's archival pressure (dust, cabinets, twine) charges the final image. The setting supplies resources (dust map, hidden drawer) and pressures choices (archival care, spatial choreography). Strong integration across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "after the emancipation, when the county promised to keep records so the freed families could one day find one another" frames the temporal context in the opening. Development: the timeframe explains why Lottie's foundling (Josephine) entered foster care and why Eli's letter references "any child left behind after emancipation." Payoff: the historical context charges the closure (small kindnesses across a racial and temporal divide). The timeframe provides backstory that justifies the archive's existence and the stakes of the blank page, but it does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions tactically. One thematic reprise; moderate causal role; no tactical urgency. Mid-band for context that shapes meaning without pressing choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "her motive became simple and stubborn, to magnify small kindnesses that might keep the next heart from breaking" is stated early. Development: Mara's choices—brushing off dust, cutting twine carefully, copying the letter, drafting a measured note—enact the motive under pressure. Payoff: her answer to Josie ("sorrow makes people cruel, but sometimes it also opens a door where small kindnesses walk through") and the decision to leave the button out dramatize the motive at closure. Three beats; friction between grief and hope is present (her own loss drives the care she extends); visible cost (emotional labor, risk of overwhelming Josie). Strong dramatization with minor label-only framing in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "examined unknown" is present in the archival attention from the opening ("she learned to read what people did not write"). Development: tone modulates as Mara moves from cataloging to discovery to realization—controlled, meditative, then quietly charged. Payoff: the closing phrase "in the examined unknown of that room" names and crystallizes the tone, and the final image (button, heart moving) sustains it. Coherence across turns; the tone charges the final image by naming the method and stance simultaneously. Strong tonal control with a purposeful reprise that reweights the ending.</comment>
