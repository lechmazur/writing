<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ivo's mailman role is richly embodied through his careful ink, polite bows, and satchel as parcel metaphor. His decision to foster Nela and to confront the smugglers shows genuine cost (signing the guardian form, risking treason). The "looking for where broken promises heal" sometimes reads abstract rather than grounded in micro-choice, and Nela's thinness and envelope simile verge on symbolic convenience. Still, the guardian promise altering his tactics ("even if councils called it treason") forecloses a path with visible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation early (cobalt arcade, twilight, daily mail drop) and teaches a Causal lens: linking absences → discovering the Mendery → confronting smugglers → thunderstorm → drone reply → tomorrow's gate crossing. The closure is Charged Poise: Ivo steps toward the clinic gate with renewed purpose, having delivered Nela's plea and received the mother's note; the cost is legible (risking treason, one letter he can keep). One tightening pressure point (smuggler confrontation) narrows options. The drone-reply mechanics arrive somewhat late but are motivated by prior linking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade's shattered skylights, sensor towers, and rooftop staging constrain the smuggler confrontation and charge the opening/closing images. Nela's thinness and the bottle's rattle supply tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is mostly clean (stairwell, cart block, drone in arms). Timeframe (twilight at daily drop) tightens the smuggler launch window. Setting participates in closure (arcade recurs, clinic gate as destination) but does not directly alter the final choice beyond framing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Ivo's search for where broken promises heal, braided with Nela's immediate need. The smuggler confrontation is a clear escalation driven by Ivo's agency (blocking the stairwell, uncorking the bottle, negotiating passage). The drone-reply beat narrows options (mother's directions, tomorrow's gate crossing). Cost is visible: he risks treason and shoulders foster responsibility. One meaningful tightening (linking absences to missing block to smuggler timing) forces the rooftop choice. The thunderstorm intervention feels somewhat convenient but is primed early.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme—healing means delivering what is owed, not undoing—emerges through Ivo's mail logic and Nela's mother's work at the Mendery. The bottle as metaphor (bending rules without breaking believers) and "absences" as thematic motif add resonance. The penultimate realization ("healing did not mean undoing, only delivering") risks slight over-articulation but stays grounded in the mother's note. The final image (stepping toward the gate by linking absences and weather) reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Ivo's respectful-rebellious stance. Diction is lyric but consistent ("brittle hush," "thin as a folded envelope"). Brief register elevations ("intercepted mail," "linking absences") fit the mailman's methodical voice. No dialogue is present. The bottle and Nela micro-moments ground perception. Some metaphoric density in opening lines ("cobalt arcade breathed") borders on decorative but does not obscure focalization. Perceptual signature (noting which houses stopped receiving post) is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well and information density is high in mid-section beats (linking absences, drone timing). Opening and closing paragraphs stack figurative language heavily ("brittle hush," "thin as a folded envelope," "fragile parcel," "whatever absences and weather he had to link") without always grounding them in action. Two minor paraphrase loops: "broken promises heal" echoed without added nuance, and "absences" recurs formulaically. No major causality breaks, but the metaphoric overlay in peak beats (thunderstorm release, final gate step) risks slight opacity. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mailman-as-healer synthesis and "linking absences" method offer a fresh angle on border-crossing stories. The thunderstorm bottle is inventive if borderline magical-realist. The piece commits to its lyric premise and the foster/delivery parallel feels earned. However, the smuggler-confrontation structure and drone-reply beats echo familiar checkpoint-narrative templates, and the Mendery reveal arrives late. The respectfully-rebellious trait and absences-as-map logic provide specific inflection, elevating the familiar disputed-territory frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ivo is present throughout, drives the rooftop confrontation (blocks stairwell, uncorks bottle, negotiates passage), and makes the foster choice that alters his stakes. His linking-absences method shapes the discovery of the Mendery. The final walk to the clinic gate is his decision with visible cost (treason risk). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage all present. Unique role (mailman as healer) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bottle is introduced early ("thunderstorm in a bottle, a relic"), used once at the climax (uncorked to down the drone), and recorked in the penultimate beat. Two beats (introduction, use). It enables the smuggler resolution but does not constrain earlier choices. Specific properties matter (cloud and lightning, rule-bending without breaking believers) but the payoff is somewhat convenient. Closure reprise (recorking) is brief. Mid-band for beat count and causal enable, capped by limited constraint and late payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The smuggling drone border is signaled early (sensor towers, smugglers' silent rotors) and structures the central conflict: Ivo fights theft by linking absences, confronts smugglers on the arcade roof, uses a downed drone to cross the border, and receives the Mendery reply. It shapes tactics (timing discovery, borrowed codes) and the closure (crossing the clinic gate). Three beats (theft context, rooftop confrontation, drone flight). Causal pressure is strong; specificity (codes, tower schedule) is high. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" is signaled early (bows to soldiers, eyes on people) and manifests in the rooftop negotiation (polite greeting to lookout, then blocking the stairwell and demanding letters back). It constrains his method (no guns, careful ink on guardian form) and enables the foster choice. One visible trade-off: risking treason while maintaining official stamp. Two beats (soldier interactions, smuggler confrontation). Causal role in ending (steps toward gate despite councils). Mid-band for beat count and cost, capped by modest constraint depth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The foster action is signaled midway (Nela asks, Ivo signs guardian form), redefines his stakes (one letter he can keep), and drives the closure (bringing Nela to clinic gate, reading mother's note). It transforms the mailman-as-healer theme into embodied responsibility. Two beats (signing, final walk). Causal pressure is strong (alters tactics, forecloses paths). Specificity (temporary guardian form, coat as carrier) is high. The action shapes the ending's emotional charge and reweights prior mail-delivery particulars. Essential across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Linking absences" is introduced early (noting which houses stopped receiving post), drives the discovery of the Mendery location (three envelopes to vanished block), and enables the smuggler-timing insight (gaps in tower schedule). Two beats (mail log, rooftop confrontation). It shapes attempts and reappears in the closing image ("by whatever absences... he had to link"). Causal pressure is moderate; the method is specific but could be replaced by another detection logic with some edits. Closure linkage lifts the score into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is anchored early (twilight, neon signs dead, tiled floor) and houses three key beats: Nela's arrival by coin changers, mail sorting under cobalt beams, rooftop smuggler confrontation. The shattered skylights and sensor towers frame the drone border. Spatial details (stairwell, cart block) enable tactics. The arcade recurs in the penultimate beat (recorking the bottle). Two to three beats. It constrains choices (rooftop access) and charges the opening/closing images. Mid-7s for beat count and spatial constraint, capped by limited resource-supplying depth at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"At the day's lone mail drop" is signaled early and tightens the smuggler-launch window (they hide in the shift change). One beat where time matters (linking drone timing to Ivo's drop schedule). The timeframe does not constrain later decisions (rooftop confrontation, next-day gate crossing). It supplies logistical context but is replaceable with minor edits. Moderate causal role in one beat; closure does not depend on the once-a-day constraint. Mid-5s for single-beat involvement and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivo's search "for where broken promises heal" is introduced early, dramatized through the mail he carries (apologies, vows, drawings) and his linking-absences method, and reweighted at closure (healing means delivering what is owed). Two beats (carrying letters, final realization). The mother's note and Mendery directions concretize the search. However, the motivation sometimes reads abstract ("if such a place still existed") rather than viscerally conflicted. Friction between duty and risk (treason) adds cost. Mid-6s for beat count and thematic charge, capped by modest on-page friction depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" anchors the opening (cobalt arcade, neon dead) and recurs after the thunderstorm burst ("in the brittle hush that followed"). Tone modulates with pressure (polite greeting, storm release, quiet walk home) and charges the final image (stepping toward the gate). Two beats (opening frame, post-storm silence). Coherent through turns; specificity (brittle, not merely quiet) is high. The reprise reweights the opening's fragility with earned resolve. Mid-7s for beat count, tonal control, and closure linkage.</comment>
