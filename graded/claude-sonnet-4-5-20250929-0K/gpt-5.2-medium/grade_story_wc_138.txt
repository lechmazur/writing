<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilias's interiority is concrete and character-particular: boredom as "cowardice, an endless refusal to risk losing himself" carries embodied weight. His micro-choices (pressing the amulet, stepping through the slit) arise from contradictory impulses—curiosity versus self-preservation—and the final renunciation forecloses immortality with visible cost. Maris's confession and her pale knuckles anchor emotion physically. Minor slip: "intrigue was the only emotion he could still manufacture on demand" edges toward diagnostic label-speak but remains within the immortal's weary voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands on the page: Ilias steps through and his immortality peels away, a Decisive Change with felt cost ("space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains"). The Causal lens holds—each beat (amulet fragment → magnetic fields → corridor mutiny → prismatic council → threshold crossing) narrows options through because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (escondite, solar storm, Ilias + Maris) arrive early. One meaningful tightening: the mutiny forces a leader and Ilias accepts the amulet's rewriting. Cost is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite constrains choice: the building's magnetic lattice responds to the amulet, corridors slide through themselves, and the hexagon heart chamber becomes the decision site. The solar storm tightens urgency by overwhelming shields and waking the mutiny. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"ozone and old letters," refracted light curtain—filtered through Ilias's dimensional awareness. The amulet fragment (micro-object) charges the final image by completing itself around his heart. Spatial choreography (corridor tilts ninety degrees, doors open onto nonexistent rooms) remains legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. One meaningful tightening: the corridors' mutiny forces Ilias to choose, and his decision to hold the fragment aloft and step through narrows all options. The cost is legible: his immortality peels away on the page. Agency is protagonist-driven; Maris's backstory and the storm complicate but do not solve. The trade-off between eternal safety and honest goodbye forecloses the immortal path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core question—what happens after goodbye when a connection is severed and a world chooses without you—emerges from concrete events rather than statement. The amulet's curse (forcing the user to become the goodbye) reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains." Thematic complexity: boredom as cowardice, the mutiny as allegiance-choosing, farewells collecting like dust. No sermonic intrusion; the ending invites reflection through the protagonist's transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Ilias; perceptual signature is distinct (dimensionally aware, translating invisible lines, feeling space twitch). Diction matches the immortal's weary register: "intrigue was the only emotion he could still manufacture," "goodbye had never been real for him while he stayed." Maris's dialogue ("don't provoke them") carries natural rhythm and subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens at the threshold crossing. Minor convergence: "hushed thunder" and "ozone and old letters" risk elevated diction but remain within the speculative frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, perception, and world-logic. Rhythm varies purposefully; the final paragraph compresses to match Ilias's dissolution. Zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("sky pulsed like a bruise," "immortality peeling away like a coat in rain") is coherent and image-specific. Minor artifact: "each one looking away at a different goodbye" in the reflection passage risks slight abstraction, and "hushed thunder" borders on oxymoronic poetics but reads intentional. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity and propulsion hold through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—immortal protagonist using a cursed amulet to navigate a dimensionally unstable refuge during a solar storm—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the goodbye concept (not sentimental but dimensional severance) and the mutiny metaphor (corridors choosing allegiance) avoid template territory. The amulet completing itself "not as metal but as acceptance" charges the final image with fresh inflection. Risk-taking (dimensional awareness, magnetic fields as agency, suspended farewell moments) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise coheres; removing any core element would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilias (bored immortal) drives two key turns: holding the amulet fragment at the wall and stepping through the slit of darkness. His immortality and dimensional awareness shape tactics (translating routes, enduring the mutiny). Present in the closure: his immortality peels away. Causal pressure is strong; the choices narrow all options and impose visible cost. Introduced early, involved in setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cursed amulet fragment appears in four beats: palm introduction, wall interaction, chest pressing + route mapping, raised aloft at the council, completing around his heart at closure. It tug on the magnetic lattice, hums in counterpoint to thunder, forces the user to become the goodbye, and drives the final transformation. Irreplaceable: its broken state and curse are essential to Ilias's choice and the ending's cost. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny shapes stakes and tactics on the page: hallways slide sideways, doors open onto nonexistent rooms, the corridors demand a leader. The mutiny tightens pressure by forcing Ilias to choose which dimension wins. Present in setup (storm wakes corridors), middle (Maris grips railing, corridors tilt), and ending (mutiny quiets into a single path). Causal: the mutiny is the problem Ilias must resolve. Specificity: the concept of space defecting is unique and shapes every turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware enables Ilias to feel space twitch, translate invisible lines into routes, and perceive overlapping Maris reflections. Constrains a choice: he follows the amulet's mapped lines into the tilted corridor. Present in setup, middle navigation, and implicit at closure (his dimensional sense dissolves as space stops obeying him). Cost is visible: the trait that gave him mastery is relinquished. Slight swappability: "spatially gifted" could substitute with minor edits, capping mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Intrigue motivates Ilias's presence at the escondite (curiosity is the only emotion he manufactures) and his pressing the amulet to the wall. It frames his weary stance but does not drive the major turns—those arise from the mutiny's pressure and the amulet's curse. Present in setup and one middle beat but absent from the ending action. Swappable: "curiosity" or "fascination" could replace with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Magnetic fields appear in three beats: the fragment tugs the building's magnetic lattice, the storm's magnetic fields shape the mutiny (compasses spin, corridors respond like iron filings), and the amulet drinks the storm's fields at the council to quiet the mutiny. The method is signaled early, shapes middle tactics (Ilias listens to the fragment's hum to map routes), and enables the closure choice. Specificity: the physics of magnetism anchor the speculative logic. Cost linkage: the fields force the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite supplies resources (magnetic shields, folded corridors, glass prisms) and pressures choices (the mutiny, Maris's guardianship, the heart chamber as decision site). Present in setup (refuge built from prismatic glass), middle (corridors slide, railing becomes ladder, overlapping reflections), and ending (hexagon of spinning glass prisms). The building's defection toward a neighboring dimension is the core problem. Irreplaceable: remove the escondite and the spatial mutiny collapses. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The solar storm tightens decisions: it wakes the corridors, overwhelms shields, and intensifies through the action (compasses spin, air carries hushed thunder). Present in setup (pulsing sky, dimensional twitch), middle (storm intensifies, Maris whispers the building is defecting), and ending (amulet drinks the storm's magnetic fields). The storm is the catalyst that forces the mutiny and the choice. Specificity: the magnetic interaction with the escondite is unique. Time pressure is legible: the storm's escalation drives urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The motivation (to discover what happens after goodbye) is dramatized in Ilias's one purpose statement, his holding the amulet (testing the severed connection), his realization that boredom is cowardice, and his final step through the threshold. The desire conflicts with his immortal refusal to risk loss. Present in setup, middle (asking Maris about the amulet's curse), and ending (he says goodbye "for the first time in centuries" and steps through). The final image delivers the answer with cost: space stops obeying, he becomes part of what remains. Irreplaceable and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears in the opening ("air carried a hushed thunder") and modulates through the action: the fragment hums in counterpoint to thunder, the mutiny gathers "like a council," the final field is "vast" and suspended. Tone is coherent through turns—restrained awe, quiet pressure—and charges the ending image (no corridor, only suspended moments). The tone supports the dimensional frame and Ilias's weary stance. Slightly static in the middle beats but returns with force at closure. Minor swappability: "quiet tension" could substitute, capping mid-7s.</comment>
