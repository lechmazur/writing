<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("landscape astrologer" anchors a distinct perceptual signature), and her micro-choices—tapping walls, using the hairpin—feel purposeful under pressure. Jonah's confession ("counting days like bolts") embodies loneliness concretely. The final shift from solitary wandering to shared map-making earns Mira's sense of belonging with visible emotional cost, though the arc feels slightly accelerated in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: algae-zodiac, fireflies, and the burnt feather accrue symbolic density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mira and Jonah walk together, reweighting "belonging" from solitary wandering to shared witnessing. The cost is felt—Jonah's fear of sunrise, Mira's invitation that forecloses her prior isolation—and the feather-as-oath lands cleanly in the final image. Orientation anchors early (Mira, underwater facility, nightlong window); the single scene with purposeful flashback holds the lens to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater facility is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "screens leaked cold algae-blue," "jellies drifted in ceiling cracks like slow thoughts." The cracked dome and algae currents constrain the firefly release and charge the final walk. Spatial choreography (service shaft, atrium, lab, dome, drowned streets) tracks cleanly. The burnt feather and terrarium function as micro-setting objects that alter tactics and the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's constraint requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's search for "the rhythm of belonging"—is signaled early and tightens when Jonah's loneliness intersects her mission. The terrarium clamps and firefly release form one meaningful on-page turn that narrows Jonah's isolation and reweights Mira's solitary practice into shared witnessing. The sunrise deadline creates temporal pressure, and the final walk forecloses Mira's prior stance ("you do not find a constellation alone") with felt relational cost. One clean deepening under the Accumulative lens suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the algae-zodiac, burnt feather, and fireflies without thesis statements. "You do not find a constellation alone; you found it by pointing together" is stated but immediately dramatized through the clamp-opening and shared walk, earning the insight. The ending—feather as quiet oath, belonging "in time with another heart"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of solitary versus shared meaning-making. Minor thematic echo in Mira's dialogue lowers slightly from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Mira's perceptual signature ("tapping walls to map hollow spaces," algae as "submerged zodiac") is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("leaving felt like admitting the city had truly been forgotten"). The register occasionally elevates ("shadowseamed," "softly ingenious") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's idiom under stress, and Jonah's voice converges slightly with Mira's lyricism at the dome. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with strong openings ("Mira Lorne called herself a landscape astrologer") and a charged final image. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, figurative language clusters densely in some beats ("slow thoughts," "shadowseamed," "stitched the darkness," "luminous respite") without always advancing pressure, and a few phrases ("softly ingenious care," "quietly oath") feel slightly overwritten. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of "landscape astrologer," underwater facility, and algae-as-zodiac is specific and non-obvious, transforming the mentor-technician trope through lived detail and occupational logic. The burnt feather as warrant and the terrarium-as-family-memory add fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and shadowseam wonder tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels singular rather than template-derived, though the solitary-wanderer-finds-connection arc is familiar; the execution's specificity transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices—tapping walls, unfolding charts, loosening clamps, inviting Jonah to walk—create key turns at the lab and dome. Her decision to open the terrarium and propose the shared walk alters Jonah's isolation and reweights her own solitary practice. Present early (title, opening), active in middle (chart-reading, hairpin use), and decisive at closure (walk invitation). Two beats plus closure participation; causal pressure narrows Jonah's options and enables the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three beats: warrant introduction, lab table (silver line as compass), and final image ("quiet oath"). It reweights from proof-of-death to shared commitment. However, its mechanics—why it catches algae-light as a compass—remain vague, and its middle use feels more atmospheric than tactically constraining. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is weaker. Lyric reprise with cost, but swappability to another token slightly limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" directly names the moment when fireflies "stitched" darkness, creating "shadowseam wonder" and a space for confession. It shapes the emotional stake (Jonah's loneliness vs. fleeting light) and the thematic closure (belonging requires shared witnessing of transient beauty). Present in concept throughout but named explicitly only at the climax. The respite enables Jonah's confession and Mira's invitation, altering tactics. One strong beat plus thematic closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" is used twice: once as label ("softly ingenious care") and once as demonstrated action ("softly ingenious hands steady" while opening clamps). The second instance shows the trait enabling a risky task under pressure, but the cost is environmental (pressure groans) rather than personal tradeoff. Early signal is vague; the clamp scene provides one visible enactment. Mid-band for one on-page demonstration with modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Captivated despite himself" marks Jonah's turn from refusal (cannot open terrarium) to participation (follows Mira to dome). This action redefines his options, moving from solitary tending to shared witnessing. It drives the firefly release and the final walk. Present at a pivotal beat and causally necessary; without Jonah's captivation, the terrarium stays closed and the closure image fails. Two beats (captivation, walk) plus closure linkage; some swappability ("intrigued," "drawn") slightly lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" is the method that breaks Jonah's isolation and enables the confession. Signaled early (Jonah's memory of family summers) and enacted at the dome as the terrarium opens. It shapes the attempt (clamp-opening) and delivers the respite that allows the final walk. Present across setup, middle action, and closure participation. One strong causal beat; modest cost (emotional vulnerability) is implied rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The facility supplies resources (cracked dome, algae currents, terrarium, maintenance ladders) and pressures (water above, distant groans, emergency-lamp failure) that shape every major choice. Mira's wall-tapping, the algae-zodiac reading, and the dome climb are impossible elsewhere. The drowned streets enable the final walk. Early anchor, sustained across all beats, and essential to closure—the facility is irreplaceable. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is stated early ("here until sunrise, when the Council's skiff would return") and recurs at Jonah's confession ("feared sunrise because it would pull her away") and the ending ("dawn brightened the surface"). It tightens Mira's decision to walk with Jonah and frames the night as a bounded window for connection. However, the clock is not actively tracked beat-to-beat; urgency is felt more at the emotional than tactical level. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated in the algae-zodiac scene and dramatized through her invitation ("you do not find a constellation alone"). It conflicts with her prior solitary wandering and costs her the safety of detachment—the final line ("belonging beat in time with another heart") signals the trade. Present early, drives the chart-reading and walk invitation, and shapes closure. Friction between want (connection) and habit (solitude) is visible; felt cost at the ending elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" is coherent throughout: emergency lamps failed yet algae glows, fireflies "stitched" darkness, the facility turns from tomb to wonder. Tone modulates from Mira's careful observation (opening) to shared awe (dome) to quiet intimacy (walk), charging the final image. The coinage "shadowseamed" recurs and the prose maintains lyric texture under pressure without obscuring clarity. Present early, sustained through turns, and amplifies the closure effect. Strong tonal control with modest register elevation in peak beats.</comment>
