<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's "brazen calm" and systematic approach show consistent character-particular traits, and her decision to remodel the orchard despite dying demonstrates agency under pressure. However, interiority remains somewhat distant—her embodied experience of illness is largely absent except for "her chest ached," and the monks' opposition dissolves too easily without forcing a meaningful trade-off that tests her commitment. The final choice to "lay down between the warm pillars" reads more as acceptance than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains accumulative/textural coherence throughout. The closure offers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara's death becomes meaningful because the orchard continues translating its script—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the seed pods, reweighting the temple's purpose from human worship to interspecies nursery. However, the monks' resistance folds without causal friction, weakening the tightening that should narrow her options before the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living stone pillars function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's choices—the hidden channels guide her remodeling plan, and their warmth returns at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: rain turning the courtyard into a mirror triggers the discovery, copper conducts mist to let oaks "sense" currents, and the pillars "sweating less" shows environmental consequence. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard, courtyard, and center court, with the flagstone hollow providing a physical anchor for thematic revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara discovers the seed pods, reweighting the temple's architectural purpose. Her remodeling work creates visible pressure (chest aching, monks complaining), and the gathering at the end forces communal commitment. However, the monks' opposition dissolves without forcing Mara to pay a tactical price or make a hard trade-off; their conversion after watching crabs feels convenient rather than earned through escalating conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: figs feeding ants that save the figs, channels guiding water, copper arches directing crabs away from seedlings. The seed pods offer a non-literal answer to the architectural secret—the temple as distributor rather than hoarder—without moralizing. The final image of the orchard "translating its living script from species to species" resonates because it grew from established pattern. Minor weakness: the gathering's explicit vows ("promised to") edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the remodeled space speak for itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Mara's perceptual signature—"gently systematic," noticing which moss quieted bees—filtering all observations. Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding register drift. The dialogue in the gathering scene carries clear subtext (naming ignored species = public commitment) and advances plot. Weakness: the prose occasionally slips into elevated register during peak beats ("architectural secrets were not about hiding treasure but about distributing it") that feels more authorial than character-bound, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "veined with lichen and warm to the touch" gives texture and foreshadows the final image). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor template cadence in the gathering sequence: "a monk promised... a fisherman promised... a child promised" uses parallel stems without variation. The phrase "as if she were daring her own cells to quit" borders on overwriting for this POV's established register, though it doesn't obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of dying caretaker, architectural secret as interspecies nursery, and copper-guided remodeling feels specific and non-obvious—transformation arises from grounded botanical observation rather than mysticism. The orchard-as-script concept is fresh, and Mara's response (physical remodeling rather than human-only ritual) subverts expected spiritual epiphany. Risk-taking in the copper-wire mechanics and crab choreography heightens stakes without gimmickry. The gathering's explicit vows slightly reduce boldness by spelling out what the remodeled space already demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all major turns: tracing the channels triggers discovery, designing the copper arches creates the remodeling action, prying up the flagstone yields the seed-pod revelation, and calling the gathering transforms private work into communal commitment. Her decision to work "with a brazen calm" despite chest pain shows agency under the timeframe constraint. The final choice to lie down between the pillars completes her arc, though it's more acceptance than active decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diary appears in three beats: keeping it (past habit), sketching the remodeling plan "beside pressed leaves," and placing it on the altar at the gathering. It stores her systematic knowledge and legitimizes her argument to the monks ("reading them entries"). However, its role remains largely utilitarian—a record rather than an object whose properties constrain choices. Removing it would weaken her authority but not break the plot, as the visible arches and crabs provide on-page proof.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Architectural secrets shape every major beat: the channels in the pillars prompt Mara's realization, redefine the temple's purpose from human worship to interspecies communication, and directly motivate the remodeling plan. The concept reweights at closure when the seed pods prove "the temple had always been a nursery." The secret's mechanics (channels guiding water, pillars "sweating less") alter tactics on the page and charge the final image of the continuing translation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears in the opening framing ("gently systematic in her notes") and manifests in her methodical observation (which fig fed which gull, which moss quieted bees) that enables the remodeling plan. It constrains her approach—she works through pattern recognition rather than sudden insight—and the diary structure embodies the trait. However, the phrase itself is label-only; the trait's cost (slower discovery, monk resistance to her empirical method) remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Remodeling drives the entire second half: the copper-wire plan arises from the channel discovery, the physical work tests her declining body ("chest ached"), monk complaints create friction, and the resulting canopy reorganizes the orchard ecosystem. The action is irreplaceable—meditation or teaching would not produce the tangible arches that guide crabs and birds. The remodeling's success (pillars sweating less, species following new paths) provides closure evidence that her intervention worked. Swapping it for another action would require rewriting the architectural-secret mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Copper wire appears in the remodeling plan ("sketched in the diary"), its conductive property is explained (lets oaks sense currents the stone sensed), and the resulting arches guide crabs at tide change. The method is specific and irreplaceable—fiber or metal rods would not conduct mist. However, the actual wrapping and installation happen off-page ("She worked at dawn"), so the method's mechanics during execution remain summarized rather than dramatized in action beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars constrains every major choice: the pillars' channels enable Mara's discovery, their warmth charges the final image, the orchard's circular layout conflicts with the monks' straight-line prayers (establishing friction), and the space's interspecies ecosystem justifies the remodeling. The setting provides resources (figs, ants, crabs, bees) whose relationships Mara studies and then reshapes. Removing this exact setting—stone that guides water, trees rooted in pillar hollows—would collapse the architectural-secret concept and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis frames the opening and returns at closure ("her remaining weeks"), creating urgency for the remodeling work. Physical decline appears on-page ("her chest ached") during the ladder-climbing, and the timeframe forces the gathering before she dies. However, the clock remains vague—no specific weeks or months track her decline, and the monks' resistance dissolves without testing whether she has time to overcome it. The ending's "finally lay down" implies timeframe pressure, but the exact tightening from diagnosis to death stays abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fostering interspecies respect drives Mara's systematic observation ("species watched one another"), motivates the remodeling (arches low enough for goats, high enough for cranes), and shapes the gathering's explicit goal (name an ignored species, promise to listen). Her desire faces friction when monks resist bending "sacred trees," forcing her to prove the orchard's interdependence with diary entries. The motivation charges closure when the orchard continues translating "from species to species" after her death. Minor weakness: the vows at the gathering tell the respect rather than letting the remodeled space dramatize it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" appears three times: when she receives the diagnosis, during the ladder work ("as if daring her own cells to quit"), and implicitly in her final rest between the pillars. The tone remains coherent across pressure points—neither panicked nor resigned, but deliberate and risk-accepting. It modulates with physical cost (chest aching) without breaking into fear or despair. However, the tone functions more as consistent character texture than as a dynamic element that reweights at closure; the ending's calm mirrors the opening's calm without transformation.</comment>
