<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's arc from self-contained archivist to vulnerability is earned through concrete micro-choices: refusing weapons, stitching photos, admitting fear to Lio, and naming her cruelties at the hatch. Her motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, though the pacifism/"end the chain" explanation reads slightly over-articulated for the moment. Embodied emotion is strong—floating when happy, gripping handrails—and the shadow work beats ground interiority in tactile action. The ending choice flows from established causality with visible cost (confronting envy, cruelty, love), meeting the 9+ test, but minor therapy-speak ("shadow work," "forgive herself") in reflective beats nudges the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a Causal lens: Mara's search → photograph sorting → quilt stitching → vial application → hatch opening follows motivated linkage. Orientation anchors (spaceship Orison, hydroponic bay, archive) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Mara stepping through with Lio—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (naming her cruelty, accepting buoyancy, pushing "steady as prayer"), satisfying the 9+ quick test. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quilt's silver threads align and the hatch recognizes her honesty. Minor penalty: the seam-finding mechanic (shimmer on photos) is set up but the exact process of alignment feels compressed in the final third, slightly muting escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is vivid and particular: patched hull plates, municipal scrap, air recyclers hissing like surf, repurposed solar tiles. Setting constrains choice (oxygen waste, ceiling pipes, welded hatch) and the narrow chapel remnant charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Micro-setting (the quilt, the vial warming in her pocket) acts as functional geography. However, spatial choreography in the climax—Mara rising, forehead touching hatch, Lio at the doorway—could be more precisely staged; the mist corridor beyond reads as atmosphere rather than tactile space, slightly weakening the final beat's grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to restore births—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's shadow work: each memory she confronts narrows evasion and brings the seam closer. The final tightening (naming cruelty/envy/love at the hatch) forecloses retreat and the cost is legible: she must accept buoyancy and vulnerability. Agency is decision and renunciation (letting herself lighten, no longer suppressing joy), meeting the 9+ quick test. Minor gap: the story tells us the seam "responds to honesty the way metal responds to heat" rather than dramatizing failed earlier attempts that taught Mara this rule, slightly reducing earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—confronting personal shadow to unlock collective renewal—emerges organically from Mara's tactile work: stitching tear-tracks, pouring the vial, naming her failures. The kwan yin's tear motif (compassion condensing from breath) recurs with shifting meaning, and the final image (quilt threads lifting into sky, stepping into a future "that can be born again") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Shadow work avoids becoming a thesis statement because it's enacted through photograph sorting and the climactic naming. Slight deduction: "shadow work" as a named concept appears twice in exposition, edging toward thematic echo; the piece would be stronger trusting the dramatized confession alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the hatch, wider in exposition). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "gravitationally lighter when happy," "ghostly resolve," "shadow work" as navigation metaphor. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices salt tracks, seams, the ship's recycled history. Minor slips: filter verbs ("feels," "watches") cluster in mid-story reflective beats without voice-motivated need, slightly dulling immediacy. Lio's brief dialogue ("why she never fought back") advances plot and revelation, but the exchange risks convenient timing; Mara's answer feels rehearsed rather than wrung from the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "the ship grows still, as if all recycled metal is holding its breath" conveys atmosphere and marks the beat). Opening and closing images are strong. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: repeated "and" constructions in the first half, filter-verb stacks in reflective passages, and minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "the dimension's lock slides open" after "the hatch vibrates…from recognition"). The climax beats are clean, so non-closure accumulation caps the deduction at −0.8. The phrase "ghostly resolve in her posture" in paragraph 7 reads as mild overwriting for internal narration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—last-human premise + shadow work as literal navigation key + gravitational joy as constraint—feels specific and non-obvious. The stitched-quilt map and kwan yin's tear as mechanical elements transform the "confronting past trauma" trope into tactile puzzle-solving. The ending avoids easy sentiment by grounding renewal in Mara's willingness to name cruelty and accept buoyancy. Minor deduction: the "locked dimension" and "future that can be born again" framing edges toward YA/aspirational template language; the story's best originality lies in the quilt/shimmer mechanic and embodied pacifism, which could carry the premise without the dimension rhetoric.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's pacifism (refusing stun rod, vow to "end the chain," not fighting the mutiny) shapes her approach across beats: she sorts by hand, stitches rather than fights, and her final act is a steady push, not force. The trait drives the climactic choice (naming failures vs. kicking/prying) and charges the closure image. Present in setup (paragraph 2), middle choice (confession to Lio), and ending (steady push). High causal pressure and irreplaceability; her pacifism is the story's moral spine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vial appears in paragraph 5 (setup), warms in her pocket as she works (paragraph 13, development), and is poured onto the quilt to activate the seam (paragraph 18, payoff). It constrains her method—she cannot brute-force the hatch—and its warming signals readiness tied to her emotional state. The liquid runs along seams "like mercury," turning salt into silver thread, a specific, irreplaceable mechanic. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; the vial's properties (compassion condensing from breath) tie directly to Mara's arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named twice (paragraphs 11, 14) and enacted across multiple beats: sorting photos pulls up memories she'd "rather eject into space," she admits fear of self-forgiveness to Lio, and the climax requires naming "her cruelty, her envy, her love, without flinching." The concept shapes tactics (she must confront rather than evade) and the seam responds to honesty. Setup clear, middle development present, payoff causal. Moderate causal pressure; the concept could be implicit without the label, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's lightening when happy appears in paragraph 6 (setup), constrains her behavior (she keeps her face calm to avoid floating into ceiling pipes, paragraph 7), creates a reversal when she laughs soundlessly after confessing to Lio (paragraph 16), and is accepted at the climax ("this time she lets the buoyancy take her," paragraph 20). The trait imposes visible cost (suppressing joy, wasting oxygen if she drifts) and enables the final push (forehead touching hatch while rising). Three-beat involvement, high specificity, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stitching drives the entire second half: Mara stitches photos into a quilt (paragraph 12), the seams align shimmers into a map (paragraph 12), and the quilt receives the vial's liquid to activate silver threads (paragraph 18). The action is irreplaceable—no other method could integrate the tear-track mechanic—and the final image (threads lifting into sky) depends on it. Early signal, high beat involvement, causal pressure, and indispensable closure linkage. The story's central problem-solving method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shimmer mechanic is introduced in paragraph 8 ("seam visible only via the faint shimmer of long dried tears on faded photographs"), guides Mara's sorting in paragraph 9, and the alignment of shimmers into a map (paragraph 12) enables the climax. The method constrains her approach (hand-sorting thousands of photos) and the vial's liquid follows the shimmer-seams (paragraph 18). Setup clear, middle use present, payoff causal. Moderate irreplaceability; the "salt track that glints" could be simplified, but the shimmer-to-silver transformation is specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The Orison is introduced in paragraph 1 (setup), its air recyclers and spin gravity constrain Mara's choices (oxygen cost, floating risk), and the welded hatch in the chapel remnant is the literal obstacle at closure. The ship's recycled, tomb-like quality charges tone and the hydroponic bay anchors the inciting promise. Spatial details (ceiling pipes, handrail, narrow chapel) ground action. Present across all three gates, moderate causal pressure; the ship functions as constraint and atmosphere but could be abstracted slightly without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" frames the premise (paragraph 3) and Mara's promise to the child motivates her search, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no countdown or urgency beyond Mara's internal drive. Lio is "now a quiet teenager" (paragraph 15), suggesting years have passed, but this does not alter tactics. Setup present, thematic resonance clear, but no middle or closure pressure from time itself. Lyric function rather than tactical constraint; replaceable with "in humanity's final days."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's promise to find "a door that was not only another airlock" (paragraph 3) hardens into her drive to "push open a locked dimension" (paragraph 4), shapes every beat (sorting photos, stitching the quilt, confronting memories), and the climax enacts the phrase literally ("the dimension's lock slides open," paragraph 20). The motivation is dramatized through conflicted choices (admitting fear to Lio, naming her cruelties) and the cost of self-honesty is on the page. High causal pressure, early signal, indispensable closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is named in paragraph 7 and enacted throughout: Mara keeps her face calm (paragraph 7), her posture is steady and prayer-like at the hatch (paragraph 21), and she moves without kicking or prying (paragraph 21). The tone modulates with pressure—tightens during shadow work, softens when she laughs soundlessly—and charges the final image ("steady as prayer"). Setup clear, middle coherence strong, payoff present. The phrase "ghostly resolve" itself edges toward label-speak, but the tone's execution across turns justifies mid-high scoring.</comment>
