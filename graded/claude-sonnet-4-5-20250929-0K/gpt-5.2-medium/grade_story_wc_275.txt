<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maris's decision to sheathe her father's rifle and force him into attention shows agency with cost, and Tarek's shift from bounty hunter to planter is grounded in the roses' trained refusal. The interior life is handled largely through action rather than label-speak. However, the opening establishes Maris as "senselessly perceptive" and able to "hear thirst before the leaves curl," yet this trait never constrains a choice or creates friction—she moves through the dome without struggle. Tarek's transformation occurs rapidly within a single scene; while the roses provide external pressure, his internal conflict between order-hunger and paternal receptiveness could be more contradictory and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Maris, Tarek, Lio), where (glass dome, desert), and when (third dusk after the tower falls) early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the layered images of roses, militia trucks, sheathed rifle, talisman, and kneeling, culminating in Tarek's decision to protect rather than capture. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Tarek stays, unbuckles his gunbelt, and plants archive seeds—a decisive reweighting of his role with visible cost (foregoing the bounty, defying the militia). The cost is legible on the page in his staying and planting. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maris sheathes the rifle and the roses refuse to open, forcing Tarek's stance shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, copper gutters, sand beds, and roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the roses' trained refusal to open when hands hold weapons directly shapes Tarek's decision. The dome's "calm that felt like an oath" and the filtered sun create a coherent atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear—Maris leads Tarek between beds, to the workbench, to the central bed—though the militia "outside" and Lio "from the shade of the water tanks" introduce a slight positional ambiguity about the dome's permeability. The setting charges the final image (planting at the dome's rim) and the sensory detail (soot like dark snow, roses burning orange and white) is filtered through the thematic lens of continuity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maris protecting Lio from capture while changing her father's stance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through the militia's approach ("engines through the sand like distant drums") and Tarek's reflex reach for his rifle. The roses' refusal to open is the key reversal that narrows Tarek's options and forces him to kneel, a tightening consistent with the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible: Tarek abandons the bounty, defies the new council, and stays to plant seeds. However, the militia's withdrawal feels slightly convenient—"unsettled by the roses flaring like a tranquil blaze" reads more metaphorical than tactical. The final act (planting archive seeds) is earned by Tarek's prior causality and forecloses his bounty-hunter path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—continuity versus chaos, quiet as resistance—emerges organically from the roses trained to open only for empty hands, the engraved talisman "QUIET IS A KIND OF BRIDGE," and the archive seeds planted in rings "that left no plant alone at the edge." The final image (Tarek planting seeds, Maris breathing "certain that continuity could be grown") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The roses function as a recurring motif that constrains choice and charges closure rather than ornament. However, the line "because the dome held a calm that felt like an oath" and "weave continuity through chaos" edge toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. Subtext operates well in the roses' silent lesson and Tarek's wordless kneeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited through Maris with clear focalization. The perceptual signature is distinct—"senselessly perceptive attention," "watched his shoulders soften," "seeing without sensing why"—and vocabulary fits an artisan's idiom. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register: "inculcating plants with values," "a way to weave continuity through chaos," "the need for builders, not trophies" all read slightly above Maris's embodied voice under pressure. Tarek's dialogue to the militia leader is summarized rather than quoted, which avoids the test of voice distinction. The final paragraph's certainty ("certain that continuity could be grown") asserts resolution rather than letting the image carry it. Psychic distance is otherwise consistent and narrative stance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The single-sentence paragraph structure creates both visual rhythm and comprehension drag: multiple 150+ word sentences stack clauses with semicolons and commas, forcing re-reads. "She is the bounty hunter's pacifist daughter, raised on campfire tales of captures and gun smoke, yet she practices a quieter craft: inculcating plants with values, whispering patience into seedlings, coaxing mercy into thorns, so their blooms can tutor anyone who enters" exemplifies overwriting—figurative density without clear propulsion. Template cadence appears in the opening's list structures and in "came...meant to drag...did not argue...led...watched" chains. The phrase "senselessly perceptive" is striking but never unpacked. Stock metaphors: "dark snow," "hunger for order," "distant drums." Information density is high but clarity suffers; the piece would gain momentum from breaking the longest sentences and pruning modifiers like "tranquil blaze" that work against each other.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter uses roses trained to refuse violence to convert her father—is specific and non-obvious. The premise of "inculcating plants with values" as living record and tactical tool offers a fresh angle on post-collapse resilience. The emotional arc (Tarek's shift from hunter to planter) and the thematic question (can continuity be grown through quiet resistance?) cohere into a singular vision. However, the core scenario—conflicted parent arrives to enforce the new regime, child intervenes—is a familiar template, and the militia's easy retreat undercuts the boldness of the premise. The roses' refusal is an earned turn, but the story hedges slightly by making Tarek already receptive ("shoulders soften") rather than forcing a harder rupture. The final image (father and daughter planting together) is satisfying but predictable once the roses refuse to open.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris frames expectation early (pacifist daughter, tending roses), drives two key beats (sheathing the rifle, guiding Tarek to kneel), and shapes closure by giving Lio the scrap and planting seeds with her father. Her choices—leading Tarek through the dome, removing his rifle, making him kneel—narrow his options and enable the final reconfiguration. The cost (risking militia confrontation, trusting the roses' lesson) is visible. The character is irreplaceable: remove her agency and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears early at the workbench as talisman with engraved words, Tarek holds it during the militia encounter, and Maris gives it to Lio at the end with instructions to engrave his own quiet. It functions across three beats and its meaning evolves from personal object to transferable practice. However, its causal pressure is moderate—it prompts Tarek to pause ("his eyes stopped scanning") but does not directly constrain his choice; the roses' refusal does that work. The scrap is present in closure but secondary to the planting action. Swappable with another engraved object without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept "engraved quiet" (via the talisman inscription "QUIET IS A KIND OF BRIDGE") is signaled early and returns at closure when Maris tells Lio to "engrave his own quiet on the new panes." It shapes the thematic stakes (quiet as resistance) and the roses' trained behavior (opening only for empty hands) embodies it tactically. However, it operates more as metaphor than on-page constraint—no choice hinges explicitly on "quiet" versus noise or speech. The final instruction to Lio extends the concept but does not test it under pressure. Present across beats, thematically resonant, but causally secondary to the roses and rifle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is introduced early ("seems to hear thirst before the leaves curl") and later echoed in "seeing without sensing why" when Maris anticipates the militia's lethal intent. However, the trait is never dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff—Maris does not misread a situation or pay a cost for her hyper-awareness. It remains a label that colors her character without altering her tactics or creating friction. No visible cost tied to the attribute; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Sheathe" drives the central reversal: Maris lifts the rifle from Tarek's shoulder and sheathes it in a canvas sleeve, triggering the roses' refusal to open and forcing Tarek to confront his choice without the weapon. The action appears in the middle third, constrains Tarek's tactical options (he cannot reach for the rifle without the roses' judgment), and directly enables the closure (he unbuckles his gunbelt and plants seeds). Swapping "sheathe" for "hide" or "set aside" would lose the symbolic and tactical specificity. Cost is visible in Tarek's foreclosed bounty-hunter path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("inculcating plants with values, whispering patience into seedlings, coaxing mercy into thorns") and demonstrated when the roses refuse to open for armed hands—a trained behavior that directly constrains Tarek's choice. It reappears at closure when Maris and Tarek plant archive seeds "at the dome's rim," extending the practice into the future. The method is irreplaceable: the story's central mechanism depends on it. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract ("whispering patience," "coaxing mercy") rather than concretely detailed. Present across beats, shapes the key turn, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass dome frames the entire action, constrains the militia ("rifles tapped the glass"), supplies the roses as tactical resource, and anchors closure (planting at "the dome's rim"). The cracked panes Lio repairs signal fragility and the soot catching "like dark snow" ties the dome to the tower's fall. The dome's atmosphere ("calm that felt like an oath") directly affects Tarek's shoulders softening. Spatial choreography (beds, workbench, water tanks, central bed) guides movement and choice. The setting is indispensable—remove the dome and the story's pressure and closure dissolve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the story in a post-collapse window and "the third dusk" specifies when Tarek arrives. The militia's approach creates a ticking clock ("engines through the sand like distant drums"). However, time is not tightly tracked—the interval between Tarek's arrival, the talisman exchange, the kneeling, and the militia's arrival is vague, and "that night" at closure suggests hours have passed without clear progression. The timeframe provides urgency but does not narrow options beat by beat. Functional but replaceable; a vaguer "after the collapse" would work nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to weave continuity through chaos" is stated early ("she decided her work would not just be beauty but a way to weave continuity") and dramatized through her actions: training roses, making the talisman, protecting Lio, and planting archive seeds. It directly conflicts with Tarek's mission (enforce the new council's order by capturing Lio) and the militia's violence. The cost—risking confrontation, trusting an untested lesson—is visible. The final image (planting seeds, breathing "certain that continuity could be grown") confirms the motivation with tangible action. The desire is irreplaceable and shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced mid-story ("the roses flaring like a tranquil blaze") and captures the paradox of quiet intensity that permeates the dome. The tone holds coherence—calm coexists with threat (militia trucks, Tarek's rifle)—and modulates subtly as Maris guides Tarek from tension to stillness. However, the tone is more described than enacted in rhythm: the long, clause-heavy sentences create a stately pace that supports "tranquil" but never quite "blazes." The final paragraph's certainty flattens into serenity without retaining the fire. Present and thematically apt, but the prose could embody the duality more sharply in cadence and diction.</comment>
