<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lani's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven; her translation work embodies her trauma response through the coral fragment and cast-reading. Mako's "shrewdly innocent" smile and the secondary characters (captain, liaison) apply clear pressure. The ending choice—grafting new meaning—is earned by prior causality, though the final beat leans slightly toward articulation rather than remaining fully embodied under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Conceptual Repricing): Lani's final explanation to Mako reweights the cast and coral from wound-markers to graft-sites, foreclosing revenge with visible social cost (standdown, vigil). One meaningful deepening occurs when translation shifts from literal to affective, tightening the dominant stake. Cost is legible in "lotus hearted ache" and the captain's exhaustion, though slightly oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium's mist, twilight, glass roof, and pond anchor the scene with purposeful sensory detail (gray coins, prayer-like footsteps). The cast functions as micro-setting, constraining Lani's translation work and charging the final image. The coral fragment recurs with evolving meaning. Minor: the "corridors outside" and field clinic remain abstractly sketched, but the dominant spatial frame—atrium and bedside—guides all key choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent ambush/mourning miscommunication) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the map-time note that could mean "funeral" or "meeting." Lani's agency (translation, radio calls) forecloses the revenge march with visible cost (captain's command, villagers' vigil). Escalation is driven by protagonist decision under the Accumulative lens; the false-friend homonym and smeared ink deepen pressure. Cost is legible in the standdown and candlelit vigil, though the final beat slightly summarizes resolution rather than dramatizing the captain's or liaison's micro-choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the coral/cast pairing, the false-friend homonym, and the layered anxieties in smeared ink. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"graft new meaning onto old wounds"—that reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (rubbing the coral, lifting the arm gently) and the shared tremor across languages. Minor: the reef-healing metaphor in the final exchange tilts slightly toward articulation, though it remains grounded in the object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Lani's perceptual signature (noticing ink swells from tears, recognizing fear patterns) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and idiomatic ("lotus hearted ache," "unknotting," "bleached stone"). The prose modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Minor: a few filter phrases ("she realized," "she felt") appear in high-density passages where free indirect style could have sharpened immediacy, and the final dialogue slightly over-articulates the metaphor rather than trusting image alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs (setting, interiority, stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer opening sentences contracting during the translation sequence. Minor loop: "shared anxieties" appears three times with slight synonym variation, and the phrase "the same fear" / "the same tremor" recycles concept. The coral/cast metaphor stack in the final paragraph ("maze like ridges," "labyrinth," "story hardened around damage," "graft living polyps onto bleached stone") approaches density overload without full muddle, applying −0.3 for mild pattern artifact in a non-closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The translator-as-mediator premise is familiar, but the cast-as-treaty-paper and homonym-as-trap angles offer fresh specificity. The coral/reef metaphor transforms stock reconciliation imagery through tactile handling and the graft-versus-break distinction. Emotional arc (fear to grafting) synthesizes particulars rather than template beats. Minor: the atrium's symbolic role (twilight, mist, lotus/water lilies) leans slightly toward ready-made hospital-peace imagery without full subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lani's translation choices create two key turns: decrypting the map-time note (preventing ambush misread) and calling the rebel liaison (reframing "meeting" vs. "funeral"). Present in setup (waiting, coral in pocket), middle (cast-reading), and closure (explaining to Mako). Causal pressure is strong; her decisions alter tactics (standdown, vigil). Cost is visible in "lotus hearted ache" and the captain's exhaustion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coral fragment appears in three beats: pocket (setup), rubbed during memory (middle reflection), placed on bedside table at closure. It charges the final metaphor (reef healing by graft) and constrains Lani's coping tactic (rubbing when "old sounds" return). The reprise reweights meaning from salvaged damage to healing template. Minor: mid-scene handling is reflective rather than decision-forcing, limiting causal depth slightly below 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" is named early ("her real dictionary") and operationalized: mothers/soldiers/rebels' fears are read in smeared ink and translate into the captain's and liaison's speech shift ("not of victory but of sons"). The concept shapes Lani's translation method and alters tactics (standdown/vigil). It appears in setup, middle (cast-reading), and closure explanation. Cost is visible in the emotional labor ("lotus hearted ache") and the forecast of sons over victory.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mako's "shrewdly innocent" smile appears once in setup, establishing tone and adult dependency ("as if he knew the adults needed him to be brave"). It does not return or constrain a later choice. The cast (Mako's passivity as treaty surface) does the causal work; the attribute itself is label-only. Present in one beat without middle development or closure reprise; no visible tradeoff tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unknot" is signaled early ("the work of unknotting the messages by decrypting"), executed across two beats (reading the cast, explaining to captain/liaison), and referenced at closure ("his scribbles unknotted a war"). The action defines the central conflict method and drives both key turns (false-friend discovery, dual radio calls). Causal pressure is strong; swapping it would require structural rewrite. Cost is legible in the standdown and vigil.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cast is established in beat two ("white plaster... covered in smudged notes"), mechanics matter (ink swells from tears, graphite blur, shaky signatures), and it shapes all translation attempts. The method is signaled early, developed across the middle sequence (lifting arm, reading letter by letter), and returns at closure (Mako looks at the cast). Causal: the cast's dual-language trap drives the standdown decision. High irreplaceability; the piece hinges on this exact medium.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atrium is anchored early (glass roof, mist, water lilies, twilight) and houses all action. It provides the recovery-beside-pond spatial frame and the quiet necessary for translation work. It recurs in the ending image ("watching mist bead on the atrium leaves"). Minor: the setting enables rather than pressures; Lani could perform the same choices in a generic quiet room. The mist/twilight charge mood but do not constrain tactics. Two gates (setup, closure) met; middle pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" anchors the timeframe in setup; recovery and the "next hour" are noted. Time is tracked loosely (Mako's breathing, his later stirring) but does not tighten decisions—no clock forces faster reading or a communication deadline. Functional but replaceable; the same plot could occur over two hours or twenty minutes without structural change. Two gates (setup, closure mention) met; no middle escalation via time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated at closure ("trying to graft new meaning onto old wounds") and dramatized throughout: Lani reads the cast to prevent miscommunication, rubs the coral against trauma sounds, explains the shared anxieties to defuse rifles. The graft metaphor is embodied in the coral/cast handling and the final explanation to Mako. Cost is visible in "lotus hearted ache" and the emotional labor of dual translation. Present in setup (implicit in her role), middle (active translation), and closure (explicit articulation). Strong integration, though the final articulation slightly over-tells.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lotus hearted ache" appears once, mid-story, during the radio call to the rebel liaison. The tone—mix of sorrow, care, and fragility—is coherent across beats (twilight/mist imagery, Mako's innocent smile, Lani's gentle handling, the shared tremor in ink). It modulates under pressure (from waiting to translation urgency to resolution tenderness) and charges the final image of mist beading on leaves. Minor: the exact phrase is used only once; the tone is sustained through diction and rhythm rather than recurring label, which is acceptable but limits overt integration score slightly.</comment>
