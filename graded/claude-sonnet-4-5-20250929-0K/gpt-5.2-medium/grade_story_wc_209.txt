<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is consistently rooted in her mother's death and the question of night-blooming flowers, driving her from the pavilion to the cathedral and through her final discovery. Her interior world is embodied through her art practice, the postcards she carries, and her patient observation in the cloister. The final panel she paints represents a credible change earned by her discovery, though the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor slips: the sacristan and gardeners remain functional tokens without pressure, and Lina's emotional progression is more accumulative than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds through closure: Lina's journey gathers postcards, observations, and finally the layered window discovery into a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her mother's journeys as deliberate acts of shelter-building. Orientation anchors (Lina, autumn pavilion, then cathedral across winter) arrive cleanly. The closure unit—discovering the palimpsest, reading her mother's name and confession, then painting the new panel—lands on the page with conceptual and emotional cost: Lina must reckon with her mother's absence and the engineered tenderness she missed. One meaningful deepening (the window revelation) is sufficient at this length, and the final image (the mural panel showing the cathedral window) recharges prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral cloister, and transept window are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (sleet tapping panes, soot-dark stone, etched glass like scratches on ice). The cathedral's architecture directly constrains and enables Lina's discovery: the narrow stair, the exact viewing angle, and the hidden palimpsest all shape her final understanding. The map of warm air currents rising from crypt vents is a concrete mechanism that charges the closure by explaining the night bloom. Spatial choreography remains clear across the seasonal transition, and the final mural panel integrates setting into the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night and what her mother was trying to tell her—is signaled early and tightens through Lina's custodial work, her noticing the night-blooming stock, and the postcards' clues. The window discovery is a meaningful deepening that narrows options by providing a concrete answer with visible cost: Lina must accept that her mother's journeys were acts of care she can never reciprocate directly. The piece lacks a traditional reversal or antagonist, but under the Accumulative lens the escalation reads as density increase culminating in the palimpsest revelation. Agency is present in Lina's choice to climb the stair, interpret the layers, and paint the new panel, though the discovery itself arrives without prior struggle or failed attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme—gentleness can be engineered; safe nights can be built—emerges organically from the mechanics of the crypt vents and night-blooming stock without moralizing. The final image (the mural panel showing the cathedral window layered like memory) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question by making visible the connection between temperature manipulation and maternal care. The recurring motifs—postcards, moths, moonlit lilies, night flowers—accumulate pressure and are reweighted at closure when Lina learns her mother "had been building safe nights wherever she went." No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending, and the piece invites reflection on inherited care and the limits of understanding across a generational divide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lina, with distinct perceptual filters (her artist's eye for "colors vivid enough to warm," "vines so fine they looked like scratches on ice"). The prose carries a lyric, elevated register that fits the reflective, memorial mode. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract literary constructions ("umbral tenderness," "palimpsest of botanical drawings") that feel more authorial than character-specific under pressure. The narrative certainty remains calibrated to what Lina can know, and the window discovery unfolds through her direct observation rather than exposition. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and imagistic with strong propulsion through the seasonal arc and discovery sequence. Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, and the final image is charged. However, several lines carry overwriting: "she began to reckon that the answer might be braided with whatever her mother had been trying to tell her" is abstractly phrased, and "an umbral tenderness that made her slow her steps and listen" stacks metaphor without concrete grounding. Minor paraphrase loop: "the question turned from curiosity to hunger" and "she began to reckon" restate the same shift. The figurative density (moths, moonlit lilies, scratches on ice, exhaling perfume, palimpsest, layers like memory) is high but remains legible and does not obscure causality. No major scaffold or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of night-blooming flowers, cathedral architecture as thermal engineering, and maternal care encoded in postcards feels specific and non-obvious. The palimpsest mechanism—layered etchings visible only from one angle—is a fresh narrative device that serves both plot and theme. The piece avoids stock grief narratives by grounding the mother's absence in concrete, verifiable botanical and architectural detail. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: the custodial job and seasonal frame are functional but somewhat predictable scaffolding for the discovery arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lina is present throughout; her choice to climb the stair and interpret the window drives the climactic discovery. She makes two on-page decisions with visible cost: taking the postcards to the city (leaving her mural work) and painting the new panel (converting private grief into public art). Setup is early (opening line), development occurs in the cloister observation and postcard examination, and payoff is the window climb and final mural. However, much of her arc is observational and reflective rather than choice-driven under pressure, trending toward mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The postcards appear in three distinct beats: carried in her satchel with the mother's question, spread under the nave lamp to reveal the cathedral window clue, and implicitly present when she returns to paint the new panel. They enable the key discovery (the final card's instruction "Look through it when the morning goes quiet") and are causally active, not ornamental. Setup is early (first paragraph), development is the nave-lamp examination, payoff is their role in prompting the window climb and shaping the final mural. They are irreplaceable: without these specific postcards and their clues, the discovery would not occur. Minor friction: the postcards are described more than handled on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "dawning hush" is explicitly named and staged: "the moment the choir stopped rehearsing and the city had not yet woken, the dawning hush that filled the cathedral like held breath." It directly enables Lina's climb to the transept window by providing the quiet necessary to follow her mother's instruction. Setup is mid-story (cathedral section), development is implicit (waiting for the right moment), and payoff is the window discovery scene. The concept shapes the timing of the key action but does not constrain tactics or recur with reweighted meaning. It functions as a threshold condition rather than an ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is labeled in the opening line ("She was a quietly driven, vivid mural artist, the kind who listened more than she spoke") but does not visibly constrain or enable on-page choices with cost. Her actions—painting, taking the custodial job, observing the cloister, climbing the stair—are consistent with the trait but would read similarly if she were described differently. No tradeoff or friction arises from being "quietly driven" versus, say, boldly curious. The trait is ornamental rather than mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears twice as a key verb: "she began to reckon that the answer might be braided with whatever her mother had been trying to tell her" (motivation shift) and "reckoning not only with the mechanics of petals and vents, but with the message threaded through all those journeys" (closure beat). The action of reckoning—interpretive, patient synthesis—defines Lina's approach and culminates in the window discovery and final mural. Setup is early (first paragraph), development is the cloister and postcard examination, payoff is the forehead-against-glass moment and the painted panel. The action is specific to character and irreplaceable: removing "reckon" would require rewriting the entire arc of understanding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window" are the climactic discovery mechanism: vines as ornament, then palimpsest of botanical drawings, then the map of air currents, then the mother's name and confession. The method is signaled mid-story (postcards showing the same window) and its mechanics matter (one exact viewing angle, alignment of layers). Setup is the postcard clue, development is the climb and shifting gaze, payoff is the layered revelation and the final mural showing "the cathedral window layered like memory." The method is causally essential and irreplaceable, though it arrives late (past midpoint) and is more revealed than used across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion appears in the opening and closing beats, framing the story. It provides the inciting context (Lina's mural work) and the return destination where she paints the new panel. The autumn light and glasshouse warmth contrast with the cathedral's cold stone, charging the seasonal transition. However, the pavilion does not pressure choices or supply resources during the central conflict; it is a frame rather than a crucible. Setup is strong (opening line), development is absent (she leaves it), payoff is the return and final mural. Lyric reprise reweights the pavilion as a place of synthesis, but it remains secondary to the cathedral setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" structures the middle section and signals seasonal progression from autumn (pavilion) to winter (cathedral) to spring (return). It provides duration for Lina to learn the building's rhythms and observe the night-blooming stock. The thaw moment ("When spring finally loosened the gutters and the last snow retreated into the river") marks the transition to closure. Setup is the autumn opening, development is "Across the melting of winter's last snow" learning phase, payoff is the spring return. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; it is durational rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The question "Why do the flowers bloom at night?" is the story's engine, named in the first paragraph and carried on every postcard. It shifts from "curiosity to hunger" after the mother's death, driving Lina to the cathedral, through her observations, and to the window discovery. The motivation is dramatized in her choice to take the postcards to the city, to question the sacristan, to spread the cards under the lamp, and to climb the stair. The cost is legible: she suspends her mural work and confronts her grief to pursue the answer. Setup is early (opening paragraph), development is the cloister noticing and postcard examination, payoff is the window revelation and final mural that explains "why they bloomed." The motivation is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone—"umbral tenderness"—is named explicitly ("an umbral tenderness that made her slow her steps and listen") and sustained through diction choices: "quietly driven," "softer, older rhythm," "the same tender dark." The prose modulates from vivid autumn warmth to cold winter observation to spring resolution without breaking register. The tone charges the final image by making the engineered gentleness feel earned and resonant. However, "umbral tenderness" as a phrase is announced rather than fully embodied across all beats; some sentences (the sleet tapping, the cold frame) carry sharper edges. The tone is coherent and purposeful but not uniformly integrated under peak pressure.</comment>
