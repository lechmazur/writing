<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivations are clear and rooted in ambition tempered by practiced patience; her choice to read the diary and act on its instructions flows from established traits. Internal contradiction surfaces when she feels "the old hurt of being seen and still being small," embodying the tension between recognition and advancement. The captain's awareness of her exists only in diary form, limiting relationship pressure, but his trust becomes a constraint that shapes her final stance. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment" toward the captain reads slightly authored rather than earned through prior interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands through Earned Stasis: Lysa stops the elevator, thwarts the conspiracy, and crystallizes her stance on curiosity as both sabotage and salvation with visible cost (she climbs out, evades conspirators, reaches the tenth floor by stair). The causal lens holds: diary discovery → decryption via goggles → hidden instruction → brake pull → promotion offer, each beat narrowing options. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the code shifts at floor six to address her directly, raising personal stakes and foreclosing passive delivery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator mechanics, and goggles constrain Lysa's choices: she uses the goggles' ground lenses to decode the diary, the elevator's maintenance hatch and brake cable become her tools for sabotage, and the frozen environment charges the atmosphere. Sensory selection is purposeful—"grit of ice in their hinges," "prismatic shimmer," "muffled and distant" hangar lights—filtered through her careful, ascending perspective. Spatial choreography remains clear across ten floors and the service corridor. Minor excess: some description (e.g., "like a frozen candle") borders on ornamental without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lysa's desire to be more than a carrier of secrets—is signaled early and tightens when the diary addresses her by name at floor six, then escalates when she must act on the captain's instructions to stop a conspiracy. Agency is clear: her decision to unfold the wire, read the code, and pull the brake forecloses the path of passive service with visible cost (she evades danger, climbs stairs, and accepts the magistrate's praise without promotion enthusiasm). One meaningful reversal: the diary shifts from captain's grief journal to conspiracy warning. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the captain's practice of noting small delights beneath grief models the story's implicit question—can ambition and care coexist without one diminishing the other? The goggles and diary return with reweighted meaning: tools of navigation become instruments of trust and agency. Lysa's final thought—"seeking out the joy beneath anguish could be an act of sabotage as well as salvation"—synthesizes the theme without overt moralizing, though the phrasing risks explicit articulation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she adjusts the goggles and thinks "with fond distance," balancing ambition with human connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Lysa; distance is controlled and modulates with pressure (tight during decryption, slightly wider during reflection on the captain). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices "the careful patience she used on cracked teacups" and "warmly inquisitive fingers," filtering the world through her servant's attentiveness. Syntax reflects her steady, methodical mind. Minor slips: "oddly calm" and "affectionate detachment" read slightly exterior to her focalization, and the phrase "the diary was becoming a ladder built out of light" risks metaphorical overreach that muddies immediate perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong images like "frozen candle" and "ladder built out of light" carry thematic weight, but the latter borders on purple during a high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loop at "secrets travelled upward only when servants carried them, and she was tired of being merely a carrier" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the diary-reading sequence: multiple sentences begin with "The [noun]" or "At [floor]." Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, with strategic telling compressing transit efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of encrypted diary, airship captain, and icebound spire offers a fresh steampunk-adjacent frame, and the emotional specificity—joy beneath anguish as both practice and instruction—avoids generic templates. The turn at floor six, where the diary addresses Lysa by name, feels earned in hindsight by the captain's observant characterization. Risk-taking in the lyric reflection on grief and delight elevates the piece. Minor limitation: the conspiracy plot (locking the elevator during whiteout) arrives late and feels somewhat convenient to activate Lysa's agency, though her response flows from established traits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's choices create all key turns: she decides to read the diary, unfold the wire, decode via goggles, and pull the brake. Her ascent frames the narrative literally and thematically. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (diary reading, floor-by-floor climb), and closure (reaches tenth floor, adjusts goggles). Causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The goggles enable decryption (floor-by-floor reading), appear in the captain's instruction, and charge the final image when Lysa adjusts them on her forehead. Setup early (apron pocket, first paragraph), middle (lens use for scattered light), and closure (adjusted with "fond distance"). Visible cost: without them, the code remains opaque. Irreplaceable and causally active across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The diary discovery drives the entire narrative arc: Lysa finds it, decodes it, learns of the conspiracy, and acts on its instructions. Setup (elevator, behind call lever), middle (multi-floor decryption), closure (tucked to chest, conspiracy thwarted). Shapes stakes and tactics directly; without it, no conflict. Causal pressure and closure linkage high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is embodied when her fingers feel the grit of ice in the goggles' hinges and she chooses to unfold the diary's wire rather than leave it for the magistrate. The trait enables the key decision to read and act. Present in setup (first paragraph, "warmly inquisitive fingers"), middle (diary unfolding choice), but only label-reinforced at closure. One strong causal beat; moderate irreplaceability (curiosity could be shown otherwise).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears twice with distinct narrative weight: unfolding the wire into a key (enables decryption) and unfolding the diary pages (accesses content). Both actions are causally necessary; without them, the conspiracy remains hidden. Setup (elevator ascent), middle (wire and pages), and implicit in closure (diary tucked to chest). Two strong beats; moderate specificity (another verb like "open" could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reading through scattered light is the method of decryption: Lysa tilts her head to catch the lamp's beam bouncing off iced rails, creating prismatic shimmer that reveals the code. Signaled at setup (goggles' sky-map lenses), mechanics matter in middle (floor-by-floor reading), and implicit at closure (diary content acted upon). Shapes attempts and enables the turn. Moderate irreplaceability (another optical method could serve with rewrites).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire provides the elevator (narrative frame), the maintenance hatch and brake cable (tools for sabotage), and the frozen environment (atmospheric pressure and grit in goggles). Setup early (first paragraph), middle (elevator mechanics, service corridor), closure (tenth floor reached by stair). Micro-setting alters tactics: the hatch and cable are essential to stopping the conspiracy. Moderate irreplaceability (another vertical structure could serve with edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb structures the narrative: each floor marks a beat (code shifts at floor six, brake pulled at floor eight). Time is tracked and tightens decisions: Lysa must decode and act before reaching the top or before conspirators return. Setup (elevator begins climbing), middle (floor-by-floor progression), closure (tenth floor arrival). The clock is live and alters moves; without it, urgency collapses.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through the captain's diary practice (noting joy beneath grief) and Lysa's realization that this practice can be "sabotage as well as salvation." She reads each entry's delight note and later adopts the stance. Setup (diary entries), middle (her reflection on the captain's why), closure (adjusts goggles "with fond distance"). Friction between wanting more and the hurt of being seen is visible. Moderate cost legibility; the final thought risks telling over showing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is sustained: Lysa reads the captain's grief "as if the captain were still leaning against the elevator wall making room for her," maintains calm when stopping the lift, and thinks "with fond distance" at closure. Tone modulates slightly under pressure (throat tightens at floor six) but returns to composed observation. Charges the final image. Minor slip: the phrase itself appears on the page, risking label-only execution, but the narrative largely embodies it through her steady, warm yet unsentimentalized choices.</comment>
