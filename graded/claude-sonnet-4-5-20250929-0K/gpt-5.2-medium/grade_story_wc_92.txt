<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is present and inventive traits surface in action ("I took it not as a threat but as a curtain"), but internal contradiction is minimal—the protagonist moves through elaborate intrigue without genuine doubt or competing impulses. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "throat warmed with a private laugh" is one of few physical anchors in a sea of declarative control. The final choice to open locks feels mechanically inevitable rather than earned through visible psychological cost, and the narrator's competence goes untested by meaningful error or friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation is muddled: the reader learns "I, the vigilant lock sentinel" but the relationship between the Archive Door, the terrace, the sundial, and Captain Orven's arrival is spatially unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens is Causal, but key turns depend on off-page mechanics (locks "easing open by a hair" after a spark pulse) rather than on-page decision pressure. Closure offers a Charged Poise moment—"every lock still intact, yet none truly theirs"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible, and the revolution's success arrives without genuine friction or sacrifice shown in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout create atmospheric contrast, and the half-painted sundial with coded scratches functions as a plot device, yet spatial choreography remains vague: the narrator moves from Archive Door to terrace to corridor without clear distances or obstacles. The bronze quill holder constrains one choice (alignment on the sundial), meeting the micro-setting test, but sensory detail is visual-heavy and filtered through a declarative rather than experiential lens. The fort's "bright skin" and "winking hush" are vivid phrases, but the environment does not evolve or resist the protagonist's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Captain Orven arrives, forcing the narrator to hide the pick and misdirect, but that reversal resolves immediately without lasting cost or tactical shift. The blackout complicates timing but does not genuinely narrow options; the protagonist's plan unfolds as rehearsed, with allies slipping through and Orven turning "too late." Agency is present but unchallenged, and the final image of empty Cradle and intact locks asserts success without visible trade-off or loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance versus loud heroism emerges through concrete action—"a shift of hinges and habits"—and the sundial's coded angles function as subtext for collective language. The ending image ("every lock still intact, yet none truly theirs") offers resonance, but it leans toward statement rather than felt reweighting of prior material. The Cradle of Sparks motif is seeded early and returns empty at closure, yet the conceptual cost of revolution remains abstract; no individual sacrifice or moral friction charges the final beat. Diagnostic phrasing is minimal, and the piece avoids overt moralizing, but thematic depth is limited by the protagonist's uncontested success.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct formal register ("calmly inventive by habit," "angles lived on the terrace"), but psychic distance is wide and declarative throughout, flattening immediacy under pressure. The narrator's perceptual signature—focus on mechanical detail and coded systems—is consistent, yet syntax and diction remain uniform across calm planning and peak action, missing the compression or rhythm shift expected during Captain Orven's arrival. Purposeful elision of how the spark pulse mechanically opens locks could be defended as mystery, but it withholds knowledge the narrator clearly possesses, reducing trust. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence openings repeat stems excessively: "The coded angles," "The holder was," "The shadow," "I carried," "I set," "I rotated," "I tipped," "I returned"—template cadence across the terrace sequence (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "the Cradle of Sparks" is named, then "that secret cache the Cradle of Sparks," restating within two lines (−0.2). Filter-verb stacks ("I listened," "I took," "I carried," "I set," "I rotated," "I tipped") in the high-pressure middle third dull immediacy (−0.5). Information density is high in world-building but lower in action beats, where intricate setup yields mechanical payoff. Clarity is solid; no grammar breaks, but propulsion sags under declarative scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial as cipher and the Cradle of Sparks as covert power source offer a specific synthesis of fantasy tropes, avoiding pure stock. The silent revolution via coded angles and lock manipulation is a fresh angle on heist/resistance narratives, and the "winking hush" tone distinguishes the piece from grim-revolution defaults. Yet the emotional arc and protagonist competence follow template lines: the clever trickster executes a flawless plan with no setback or genuine sacrifice. The blackout as cover and the oblivious Overseers read convenient rather than inevitable, and the ending's assertion of success without visible cost or counter-pressure limits originality's impact on stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present throughout; decisions at Archive Door, terrace alignment, and misdirection of Orven all turn plot. Cost is visible in risk (Orven's arrival) but not in loss. Causal across three beats and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Appears in setup (Archive lintel), middle (carried to terrace, aligned on sundial peg, spark released), and closure (sits empty). Three distinct uses with evolving function; alignment constrains the coded-angle method. Not quite indispensable—another vessel could carry sparks—but irreplaceability is high due to specificity (bronze, quill, historical). Cost linkage: the emptying signals sacrifice. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Named early and functions as the power source enabling lock manipulation, shaping one causal beat (spark release). Present at closure ("Cradle of Sparks would sit empty, smiling") but the stakes it represents—covert energy vs. Overseers' control—are summarized rather than dramatically contested. Swappable with "hidden battery" or similar without fundamental structural change. One gate (closure participation) is weak; cost is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is declared ("I am calmly inventive by habit") and demonstrated in lock rewiring and misdirection, but no visible tradeoff: calmness never costs the narrator speed or urgency when action demands it. Label-only in interiority (−0.3); trait enables but does not constrain. Present in two beats (rewiring, Orven encounter) with causal pressure, meeting functional threshold, but replaceable with "resourceful" or "cunning" without narrative loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Intrigue is the dominant action: planning, coded alignment, spark release, key swapping. Present across setup, middle escalation (Orven misdirection), and closure (locks intact yet freed). Two major turns trace to it (sundial signal, lock opening). Cost is conceptual (risk of discovery) but not felt in scene. Not easily swappable—"rebellion" or "sabotage" would shift tone and method. Strong integration with minor friction: intrigue succeeds without setback.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coded angles seeded early ("angles lived on the fort's western terrace"), mechanics explained (three scratches match meeting places, shadow alignment triggers action), and method executed at peak (holder aligned, spark released, locks ease open). Two beats: alignment decision and Orven misdirection both hinge on the sundial's function. Causal pressure and closure linkage present. Specificity high—removing the sundial breaks the intrigue's mechanism. Cost: risk of misalignment or discovery, though not paid on the page. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fort introduced in opening line, blackout creates urgency cover, terrace supplies sundial platform. Setting enables intrigue (hidden terrace lamps stay on) and complicates (Orven's patrol). Three beats involve location: Archive Door post, terrace alignment, corridor dimming. Closure image ("fort brightened") marks time shift. Spatial vagueness limits higher score: distances and chokepoints unclear. Functional across all three gates but does not tighten decisions or charge final image beyond time marker. Mid-integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blackout present at inciting beat ("sudden hush"), enables covert action (Overseers blind, terrace lamps fed by hidden charges), and brackets the intrigue (city lights return at dawn). Two beats: initial cover and Orven's battery lantern response. Timeframe tightens tactics (must act while blackout holds) but does not create urgency pressure—no countdown or competing deadline dramatized. Closure acknowledges time ("by dawn," "city lights returned") without reweighting. Solid causal role; cost is opportunity window, not felt sacrifice. Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Revolution motive declared early ("The revolution we wanted had to be silent") and pursued through all beats: sundial signal, lock manipulation, ally movement. Desire dramatized in choices (align holder, release spark, open doors) but internal conflict is absent—no friction between revolutionary goal and personal safety, loyalty, or doubt. Told desire plus consistent action meets functional threshold; missing contradictory impulses or visible emotional cost. Present in setup, middle, closure; causal but not conflicted. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Winking hush" named explicitly and sustained through imagery: fort's "bright skin glowed alone like a wink," "winking hush held the fort," "stones were in on the joke." Tone modulates with pressure (calm planning, Orven tension, satisfied click at closure) and charges final image ("smiling" empty Cradle, neutral face at watch). Coherent across beats with purposeful levity. Not indispensable—another conspiratorial tone could serve—but specificity and closure linkage are strong. One deduction for on-the-nose declaration of tone (−0.3). High functional integration.</comment>
