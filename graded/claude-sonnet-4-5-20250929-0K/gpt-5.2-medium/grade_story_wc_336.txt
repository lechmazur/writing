<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist narrator's creative identity and worry over Nela provide embodied motivation, and the gesture of drawing color at the climax demonstrates agency with visible cost. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("my ideas came out gray, as if my imagination had been frostbitten") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Soren's role as guide is consistent but his interior remains opaque; the relationship pressure is present but not tested by competing choices. The final choice to draw instead of prune feels under-motivated by prior causality—no earlier beat establishes drawing as a viable tactic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (narrator, Soren), where (parapet, waterfall), and when (budding season) within the first 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the collection ritual, the seed ceremony, the threshold crossing, and the final fruit that restores blue. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the impossible fruit laid on Nela's tongue, color restored) with felt cost (the narrator's fear harvested, the seed replanted to maintain the weave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator admits losing blue and is asked to contribute that shade. Minor causality slip: the shift from pruning to drawing is not established as an option before the climax, weakening the turn's motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The parapet crack, waterfall mist beading on shears, and the seed locket are vivid and purposeful. The jars lined with beeswax and the doorway in falling water constrain choices—Soren cannot cross without the ritual, and the narrator must pour essence onto the seed. Sensory detail is filtered through the POV's creative lens ("ink the color of their scent," "bell underwater"). Spatial choreography is clear across the threshold crossing. The bruised patches in the other orchard provide tactile pressure that shapes the pruning and drawing actions at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring Nela's health and the narrator's creative color—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when Soren asks for "one thing I feared to give" and the narrator admits losing blue, narrowing options to crossing the threshold. The climax drawing action produces the impossible fruit with visible cost (the narrator's fear harvested into essence). However, the escalation lacks a second meaningful reversal or complication; the sequence from admission to crossing to drawing to cure proceeds without significant resistance or trade-off that forecloses another path. The cost is felt but the tightening is single-step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as care rather than spectacle, and the cost of succor—emerges organically from the pruning-as-translation conceit and the weave between worlds. "Wonder without succor becomes a painted mask" and the insistence that the work is "not for thrill but for care" crystallize without didacticism. The final image (orchard brighter "without shouting") offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor slip: "our weaving between worlds was not for thrill but for care" tilts toward thematic echo, though it is embedded in Soren's teaching rather than narrator summary. No explicit moralizing in the final paragraph; the replanted seed charges closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance and a lyric, inventive diction ("verdant parapet," "thoughts had been bottled," "drew it in the air"). Voice reflects the narrator's creative identity through metaphor and sensory particularity. Minor issues: "insatiably creative" is a label rather than shown through prior action; the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally slips into elevated register ("radiant hush that made secrets feel safe") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. Free indirect handling of Soren's teaching is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but controlled in most beats. However, overwriting accumulates: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries layered metaphor ("orchard's first buds held their breath," "air itself sounded like a hymn sung under one's tongue," "color of wonder before it leaked from our world"), reducing clarity and momentum in the setup. Template cadence appears in the crossing sequence: "when the parrots…went quiet, he placed…and arranged…and…braided…Then he asked." Paraphrase loop: "the seed swelled, throwing off threads of light" is immediately restated as "a seam only pruners could see." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure the closure beat. Information density is generally high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—pruning as translation, capturing essence to heal across worlds—is specific and non-obvious. The heirloom seed as a "knot in the weave" and the jar ritual provide fresh procedural texture. The emotional arc (creative loss linked to Nela's illness) avoids generic template by grounding fear in color deprivation. Risk: the lyric compression and threshold crossing could alienate, but the piece commits fully. However, the "worlds woven by wonder" frame echoes familiar fantasy templates (threshold guardians, dual realities, healing quests); transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Soren appears in the opening line, teaches the jar ritual, asks the narrator for the feared shade, guides the seed activation, prunes the bruised limbs in the other orchard, and delivers the fruit to Nela. His choices (asking for blue, opening the locket, carrying the fruit) create key turns. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure: his decision to ask for the narrator's fear enables the crossing. Closure linkage: he lays the fruit on Nela's tongue. Irreplaceable: his role as pruner and threshold keeper is specific. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, cost connection (narrator must give fear) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, minor deduction for split agency (narrator also draws) −0.2 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The heirloom seed is introduced early (locket at throat), placed on wet stone for the ritual, pressed into the narrator's palm, swells to open the seam, and is replanted to maintain the weave at closure. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Appears in four beats (locket introduction, stone placement, palm press, replanting). Causal: the seed anchors the passage; without it, no crossing. Closure: replanting ensures worlds stay woven, charging the final image. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceable +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, minor reduction for the seed's passive role in mid-beats (placed, pressed, but not wielded by narrator until the pour) −0.2 = 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept frames stakes from early on ("weaving between worlds") and shapes the threshold crossing action. The seed is "a knot in the weave," Soren listens for "the second current," and the ending states the seed will keep "our worlds stayed woven." Causal: the weave enables the crossing and the healing. Closure: replanting maintains it. Setup, development, and payoff present. Early signal +0.6, two beats (crossing, replanting) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (narrator's fear woven in) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, minor deduction for the concept functioning more as thematic frame than tactical pressure (the mechanics are seed + essence, not weaving choices) −0.5 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The trait is labeled early ("insatiably creative and forever inventing new grafts") and mentioned again at closure ("I drew it in the air, lines of cobalt and silver"). It enables the drawing action that produces fruit. However, it is not constrained or tested with visible cost—no failed graft, no creative misstep. The trait does not narrow options or force a trade-off; it simply allows success. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak. Label-only in setup −0.3, late first dramatized use (final third) −0.6, swappability (could replace with "resourceful" or "bold") −0.6, ornamental mid-story (mentioned but not enacted) −0.5. Base 3.0 + early signal 0.4 + closure participation 0.9 = 4.3, deductions −2.0 cap at −0.8 for non-closure issues = 3.5, plus closure participation lifts slightly +0.7 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Succor is named as Soren's teaching ("by capturing essence…we could succor both tree and traveler"), enacted when essence is fed to glowing trees, and delivered when the fruit restores Nela. Setup, development, and payoff present. Three beats: teaching, feeding trees, healing Nela. Causal: the essence-capture enables the crossing and the cure. Closure: laying fruit on Nela's tongue is the final succor act. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection (narrator's blue given) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, minor reduction for the action being Soren's delivery rather than narrator's at closure (split agency) −0.2 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Capturing essence is introduced early (jars, blade kissing bud, sealing with twist), demonstrated in the ritual (pour essence onto seed), and repeated in the other orchard (pruning bruised limbs, feeding essence to glowing trees). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Four beats: jar introduction, seed pour, pruning other orchard, fruit production. Causal: without capturing essence, no crossing and no cure. Closure: the fruit is captured essence. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (jars, beeswax, naming in scent-ink) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, minor reduction for the mechanics being partially offstage (we don't see Soren capture the fruit's essence on-page) −0.5 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The parapet is anchored early (verdant, beside waterfall, mist drifting over stone rail), the pear tree grows from its crack, and the seed is placed on its wet stone. The waterfall mist braids between jars and forms the seam. Setup and development present. Two beats: parapet as stage for ritual, waterfall as threshold door. The setting enables the crossing but does not constrain tactics—Soren could theoretically perform the ritual elsewhere. Closure participation: weak; the replanting is mentioned but not shown on the parapet. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (waterfall seam) +0.8, closure linkage (replanting mentioned, not shown) +0.3, specificity (crack, mist, stone) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, lift for vivid micro-setting (spray, stone, seam) +0.7 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is poetic and atmospheric ("upon the hush of budding hope") but does not tighten decisions. No clock or deadline pressures choices. The phrase appears in the opening and is echoed at closure ("at dawn, the orchard…looked brighter"), creating a lyric reprise. Setup and weak payoff; no middle pressure. Swappability high (could replace with "spring" or "early morning"). Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise at closure +0.5, no causal pressure 0.0, ornamental −0.5, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.5 − 1.1 = 2.8, cap at missing middle development = 3.4, slight lift for coherent framing = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation is introduced early (Soren "had sworn to preserve the color of wonder") and dramatized when the narrator admits losing blue due to worry. The motivation drives the crossing and the harvesting of the narrator's fear-shade. Setup, development, and payoff present. Three beats: Soren's teaching, narrator's admission, drawing action restoring color. Causal: preserving wonder requires capturing the narrator's blue. Closure: orchard brighter, color kept. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (fear given) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, minor reduction for told-only declaration in setup ("sworn to preserve") rather than shown through prior scene action −0.4, and the motivation being Soren's rather than narrator's (split) −0.2 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("radiant hush that made secrets feel safe," "hymn sung under one's tongue") and modulates with pressure: the ritual is hushed and luminous, the other orchard mixes radiance and bruise, and the ending is quiet brightness ("brighter without shouting about it"). Coherent across beats. The tone charges the final image by maintaining the paradox of luminous calm amid suffering. Setup, development, and payoff present. Three beats: opening hush, crossing's luminous damage, quiet ending brightness. Causal pressure: tone does not alter tactics but shapes perception. Closure linkage: final image embodies the tone. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.2, specificity (hush + radiance pairing) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, lift for tone's consistent integration and final payoff +0.4 = 7.2.</comment>
