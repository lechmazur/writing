<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's spiritual curiosity and embodied grief (the unopened-letter chest, trembling hands) anchor her motivation credibly. The camera obscura work provides concrete micro-choices, and the breath-rhythm shift at the ending forecloses her prior pattern of withholding with visible cost. However, the pilgrim functions more as a mystic facilitator than a character under pressure, and the soldier memory remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to earn the final release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: foggy setting, recurring tear motif, and breath-work pattern converge to charge the final petal-rain image. Orientation anchors (Mara, viaduct, twilight, past-life trigger) land by the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (breath rhythm releases the sternum knot, petals fall, unused love "keeps moving"), and the cost—permission to let go—is felt. One cap: the pilgrim's guidance enables rather than opposes, so escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The viaduct's wisteria, fog, and iron ribs recur with purpose: petals fall at closure, charged by the breath-work. Kwan Yin's tear moves from tongue to camera pinhole, constraining the revelation (the rib-corridor vision). Fog modulates perception throughout, and the spatial choreography (parapet, walkway, rail) remains coherent. The micro-setting (camera box, tear, breath) functions as a constraint engine for the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—where is unused love stored?—is signaled early and drives the breath-work discovery. The sternum knot and ember-face vision deepen rather than reverse, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Mara empties pride and blesses the soldier's departure, foreclosing her habit of withholding. However, the pilgrim's intervention supplies the method without Mara encountering prior failure or resistance, so agency tilts toward guidance rather than protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—unused love as current, not vault—emerges through breath, tear, and petal particulars without sermon. The final image (tear as "lantern for the dead parts of the heart") reweights the opening question non-literally. The sternum knot and exhale rhythm resist tidy closure while offering conceptual resolution. Minor slip: "her spiritually curious mind" edges toward label-speak, but the embodied breath-work anchors the theme in scene action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature (salt/compassion taste, chest-as-letter, embers-in-ribs) is distinct and figuratively dense. The pilgrim's dialogue ("revealing through breathing changes") carries modest exposition but reads voice-consistent. No head-hopping. One penalty: elevated diction ("spiritually curious mind," "foggy lucidity," "unused love... trapped as a tight knot") occasionally drifts above natural interiority, edging toward thematic annotation rather than lived thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language dominates most sentences ("camera obscura artist," "body dies and mouth stays shut," "corridor of her own ribs," "breath to anyone she chose to see"), creating lyric density but risking overwriting. Two mixed metaphors: "chest like an unopened letter" and "embers... feeding restless" blur vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in the middle third (repeated "and" openers, "she + verb" stems). No paraphrase loops at closure, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats (pilgrim's teaching, sternum release) triggers the density penalty: −0.5 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The camera-obscura/past-life/breath-work synthesis is specific and non-obvious, anchored in Guangzhou heirloom and wisteria viaduct. The "unused love as current" answer to the opening question feels earned in hindsight. However, the pilgrim-of-sparks archetype (wise stranger, wired coat, mystic touch) and the breath-as-healing method echo familiar spiritual-fiction templates. The piece personalizes the material through sensory particulars (tear on tongue, petals on coat) but does not fully escape derivative premise drift: −0.6 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (camera obscura artist) frames the story, trembles over the camera, places the tear in the pinhole, and practices the pilgrim's rhythm while walking home. She appears in setup, mid-scene breath-work, and ending. Her profession supplies the camera mechanism that houses the tear and projects the rib-corridor. However, her key turn—exhaling until pride empties—is guided rather than autonomously chosen, and the occupation itself does not constrain the ending cost. Two gates (setup, closure participation) plus modest causal work place this in mid-band: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus guided-agency friction −0.5, minus swappability (another artist type could work) −0.6 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is tasted (salt/compassion), placed in the pinhole chamber (enables rib-corridor vision), lifted at twilight ("lantern for the dead parts"), and reappears in the ending image. Three beats (taste, camera, final gaze), early signal, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the heirloom's name and aunt's origin matter) all elevate. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the vision) +0.8, closure linkage (final image) +1.2, specificity +0.5 = ~7.2 (round down). The tear's mechanics are ornamental in the taste beat but essential in the pinhole and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pilgrim of sparks enters mid-scene, introduces the breath method, and vanishes. "Pilgrim of sparks" and "travels outage to outage" flavor his role but do not constrain Mara's tactics; any mystic guide could deliver the breath-work lesson. He appears after the first third (late −0.3), occupies two beats (introduction, teaching) +0.9, but resolves a problem (how to release love) he did not help create −0.8. Swappable with "wandering healer" or "sage" −0.6. No closure participation beyond vanishing. ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase "spiritually curious mind" appears once as narratorial label; Mara's curiosity is asserted but not tested on the page through a trade-off or competing impulse. The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost—she follows the pilgrim's guidance without internal conflict between curiosity and skepticism. Label-only mention without dramatized friction: ornamental band, late single mention −0.4, no causal work, swappable −0.5 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Heal" appears explicitly when the pilgrim asks Mara "to heal it the way she would heal a cracked negative, by letting light pass through." This metaphor drives the exhale-and-bless turn that loosens the sternum knot and releases the petals—central to closure. Setup metaphor +0.4, one decisive beat (the healing exhale) +0.4, causal pressure (narrows to exhale vs. clutch) +1.0, closure linkage (knot loosens, petals fall) +1.4, specificity (photographic metaphor unique to her craft) +0.5. However, "heal" as explicit verb arrives late (second half) and the action is brief; swappable with "release" or "forgive" −0.5. ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Revealing through breathing changes" is named by the pilgrim, demonstrated in two cycles (inhale dims embers, exhale gathers face; later exhale empties pride), and practiced by Mara walking home. The method enables the vision and the knot release. Setup (pilgrim names it) +0.5, two beats (guide, practice) +0.9, causal pressure (breath rhythm unlocks the sternum) +0.9, closure linkage (she practices it at the end) +0.8, minus late introduction (second half) −0.4, minus ornamental practice beat (walking home) −0.3 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom anchors all action: wisteria over iron ribs, fog, parapet, walkway, and the petal-rain finale. The setting's blooming state is explained as masonry "remembered touch," tying environment to theme. Setup (first sentence) +0.8, present in all beats +1.4, causal pressure (petals shake free at closure, charged by breath-work) +1.0, closure linkage (blossoms land on coat, Mara walks home over the span) +1.2, specificity (viaduct architecture, wisteria, fog lamps) +0.6, minus postcard risk (some description is atmospheric without constraining choice) −0.4 = ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the past life memory surfaced" is named in the opening line and the soldier memory recurs in dialogue and vision. The past-life trigger shapes Mara's emotional state (unopened-letter chest) and her question, but on-page time is a single continuous evening without ticking pressure or tactical tightening. Setup +0.6, present in two beats (opening, vision) +0.9, causal framing (memory drives question) +0.5, minus vague present clock (no urgency or deadline) −0.6, minus swappability (could be "after loss" or "after regret") −0.5 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's question—"where is unused love stored when the body dies and the mouth stays shut?"—is voiced early, pursued via the camera/tear experiment, and answered at closure ("not a vault... but a current"). Setup +0.7, drives two beats (question voiced, knot discovered) +0.9, causal pressure (question frames the breath-work test) +0.9, closure linkage (answer realized, love "keeps moving") +1.3, specificity (the soldier memory and withheld call ground the abstraction) +0.4, minus told framing (motivation is narrated, not entirely dramatized through competing wants) −0.5 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is embodied throughout: fog as altar cloth, lamps like moons, breath clearing windows in fog, and the final "pale glint" of the tear. The tone modulates from heavy (unopened-letter chest) to charged release (petals fall, knot loosens) without breaking coherence. Setup (twilight fog, first paragraph) +0.7, present in all beats +1.4, causal texture (fog filters perception, breath clears it) +0.8, closure charge (fog/window/glint image) +1.6, tone consistency under pressure +0.6, specificity (fog + clarity paradox) +0.5 = ~7.6.</comment>
