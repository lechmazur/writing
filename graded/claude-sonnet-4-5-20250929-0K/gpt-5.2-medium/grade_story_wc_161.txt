<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is richly textured through embodied details (balance beam practice, dust-mote reading method), and her motivations are layered across trust issues and preservation of her mother's songs. The final choice to send the birds demonstrates contradictory impulses in action—risk versus safety, trust versus betrayal—earned by prior material. However, Merek and Oren remain functional rather than fully individuated; their interiority is told more than shown, and the climactic confession scene lacks embodied emotional specificity. The meteorite-chip shadow moment reads slightly symbolic rather than anchored in visceral decision-making.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal pressure from Oren's arrival and Merek's confession, Accumulative texture through dust-motes and music motifs) that coheres at closure when Mara sends the birds. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (attic, pigeons, meteorite chip by ~10% mark). One meaningful tightening occurs when Oren's meteorite chip and the ledger receipt narrow Mara's options, forcing her midnight decision. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act reweights her reinvention as "withering" and accepts relational risk with visible cost—trusting both men and exposing the rooftop network. Cost is felt but could be more concrete; "feeling a small bloom" is slightly abstract where a sharper image would anchor the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attic is vividly established (foxed paper, pigeon feed, skylight, rafters) and micro-setting details constrain choice: the balance beam practice grounds her equilibrium metaphor, the dust-mote swirls under the skylight provide her trust-selection method, and the floorboards hide the original scores. Sensory hierarchy is strong (smell, sight, spatial choreography), and the setting charges the final image ("dust-lit air as the attic emptied"). Minor slip: "soaked coat" with "no mud" on boots is a telling detail but the weather/exterior context is never grounded, creating a small spatial gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whom to trust with the songs/network—is signaled early and tightens when Oren's chip and Merek's ledger receipt force Mara to weigh betrayal risk against preservation duty. The midnight skylight scene narrows her options (send or withhold), and her final choice to trust both men forecloses the safer path of isolation. Cost is present but slightly diffuse: the phrase "feeling a small bloom" and "trusting" are more emotional summary than dramatized consequence. One additional visible price (a named rooftop contact, a concrete network node exposed) would sharpen the stakes' on-page weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: reinvention as survival ("withering") versus trust as growth ("bloom"), paper trails as both forgery and preservation, and the songs as communal memory against erasure. The meteorite chips and dust-mote method function as recurring images that reweight meaning at closure without overt symbolism. Merek's confession—"tired of living as a shopkeeper with a false past stitched together by receipts"—articulates the thematic question but narrowly avoids sermonizing because it's embedded in his vulnerability. The final image ("small bloom in the dust-lit air as the attic emptied") offers resonant closure, though "bloom/wither" as stated metaphor in the penultimate paragraph slightly telegraphs the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer; psychic distance is controlled and diction ("foxed paper," "mars meteorite chip," "swirl of dust motes") reflects her particular way of noticing. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("mind bloomed and withered at once"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Oren's "softly" and Merek's confession feel slightly generic in rhythm. One minor filter-verb cluster in the skylight scene ("she asked," "he said," "she felt") flattens immediacy under peak pressure, and the phrase "because promises were exactly what she had learned to forge on paper" reads slightly over-articulated for a crisis moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; sentences like "She was a courier pigeon trainer by trade, but lately she trained herself harder" do double work efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences dilute momentum: "Everything else in her life she reinvents personal history with, changing names on ration cards, smoothing dates on letters, making paper trails that led nowhere but forward" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. The phrase "As-you-know" exposition is avoided, but "the last betrayal" and "before the fires took the theater" are past-summary placeholders that could be cut. Template cadence in the Oren introduction paragraph ("He set...and asked...Merek listened...but Mara saw") stacks clauses without propulsion. No major opacity, but cumulative friction from synonym churn and near-loops merits deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—pigeon courier who reads trust via dust-mote disruption under a skylight—is specific and non-obvious, and the convergence of meteorite chips, forged paper trails, and banned theater songs synthesizes into a coherent whole. The dust-mote method and meteorite-chip plumb bob are fresh inflections that feel earned rather than ornamental. Risk-taking in the lyric texture and metaphorical scaffolding (bloom/wither, paper/music) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "theater fire + banned gatherings" backdrop and "clerk from the Archives who isn't what he seems" echo familiar post-censorship templates, though character specificity and the dust-reading method transform the frame enough to avoid derivative territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (courier pigeon trainer) drives all key turns: she reads Oren's stone, weighs Merek's ledger receipt, conducts the midnight skylight test, and makes the final choice to send the birds. Her decisions alter tactics (trust versus withhold) and the ending's charge depends on her agency. Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure participation. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (no generic "messenger" could replace her dust-reading method).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mars meteorite chip appears in three beats: initial mention on Mara's desk, Oren's matching stone on his chain (which triggers recognition and narrows trust options), and the midnight plumb-bob test under the skylight. It enables the central conflict (matching stones = proof or trap?) and charges the closure image indirectly. However, the final paragraph does not return to the chip; its reweighted meaning is implied rather than dramatized, and the plumb-bob mechanic is more atmospheric than tactically decisive. Strong middle involvement but closure linkage is incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paper trails" shapes stakes throughout: Mara forges ration cards and letters, Merek's ledger receipt points toward betrayal, and the sheet music copies function as traceable evidence. The concept alters tactics (trust the Archives or protect the network) and the final decision to send copies hinges on weighing paper's risk. Present in setup (reinvention via documents), middle (Oren's receipt), and implied at closure (copies sent = new trails created). Swappability is moderate—"messages" or "records" could substitute with edits—but the paper/music/preservation braid is specific enough to earn mid-band credit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" constrains Mara's worldview (distrust of promises, reflex to forge safety) and enables her recognition of Merek's parallel forgery, which shifts her stance at closure. The trait is dramatized through ration cards, smoothed dates, and the realization that "her own reinvention had been a kind of withering." Cost is present (foreclosing authentic connection until the final choice) and the attribute shapes the thematic payoff. However, much of its work occurs in reflection rather than on-page micro-choices, and the ending trust-act feels slightly told ("trusting Oren...trusting Merek") rather than shown through embodied hesitation or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Balance" appears twice: Mara practices on the rafter beam to steady her breath, and later she feels "the beam under her feet again, that old need to balance between suspicion and need." The action grounds her physical discipline and metaphorically frames the trust calculus. However, it does not reappear at closure or directly enable the final choice; the dust-mote method supersedes the beam as the operative mechanic. Swappability is moderate (meditation or another centering practice could serve similar thematic work). Lyric reprise between setup and middle earns mid-band credit, but absence from the ending caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dust-mote mapping method is signaled early ("by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight...she read temperaments"), used in the climactic midnight test ("let her meteorite chip hang from thread like a plumb bob, tracing how its shadow crossed the dust swirls"), and implicitly present in the final image ("dust-lit air"). The mechanics matter—dust disruption reveals pigeon temperament and, by extension, human trustworthiness—and the method is irreplaceable (no generic "intuition" could substitute). However, the midnight test feels slightly atmospheric rather than tactically decisive; we do not see her read a specific pattern that tips her choice. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is established early (foxed paper, pigeon cages, rafters, skylight, floorboards) and constrains choices throughout: the balance beam trains her equilibrium, the skylight enables dust-reading, the floorboards hide the original scores, and the attic's emptying at dawn completes the closure image. Micro-setting elements (desk, tin, thread) function as tools. The setting is indispensable—removing the attic would break the pigeon trade, the dust method, the hidden scores, and the final spatial metaphor. All three gates (setup, middle pressure, closure charge) are met with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" frames the arc but does not impose a live clock. The phrase "one small delivery at a time" and "lately she trained herself harder" suggest ongoing process, and the story spans from Oren's afternoon arrival to Mara's dawn decision—roughly 18 hours that tighten pressure moderately (Oren's "before night" deadline, Merek's midnight confession). However, time is vague ("one afternoon," "that night," "at dawn") and does not constrain tactics beat-to-beat. The timeframe is present and causal but swappable; a similar arc could unfold over weeks without structural loss. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is established early ("her private motive for keeping the bookshop's attic as a nest; paper carried music longer than lungs") and drives the final choice to copy and send the sheet music despite betrayal risk. The motive is conflicted—preservation versus network safety—and the cost is legible (exposing rooftops to potential agents). However, much of its dramatization occurs in backstory (mother's theater songs) and reflection rather than on-page friction. The climactic midnight test weighs trust more than songs specifically, and the phrase "keep her work alive" at closure feels slightly told. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" operates as a dual-tone motif woven through diction: "doubt withered her throat," "Mara's mind bloomed and withered at once," "her own reinvention had been a kind of withering," "feeling a small bloom in the dust-lit air as the attic emptied." The tone modulates with pressure (withering under suspicion, blooming at closure) and charges the final image. However, the metaphor is slightly over-articulated in the penultimate paragraph, where "bloomed and withered" and "a kind of withering" appear in close succession, risking label-speak. Coherence is strong and the dual register supports theme, but subtlety is incomplete.</comment>
