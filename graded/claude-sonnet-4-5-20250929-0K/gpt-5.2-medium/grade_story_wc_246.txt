<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is vivid and particular—"confidently uncertain" manifests in her choice to keep the pen dry and "imagine words filling themselves later." Her decision to rewrite the courier moment rather than erase the vines shows genuine agency under pressure. The resolution earns its cost through her loosening of certainty, though the shift from garden error to historical editor feels convenient rather than causally motivated. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("thresh meaning from experience") but recovers through embodied detail (the bent nib, the act of unbending).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Mara, anomaly station, post-garden mistake. The causal lens holds: chirp → search database → edit ledger → nib bends → trace courier moment → insert tea scene → ledger clicks → nib unbends → stars shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara files the record with a blank signature, crystallizing that "the work of editing history was never finished, only passed along." Cost is conceptual but legible—she relinquishes authorship and accepts contingency. One meaningful tightening (the new cadence that pulls up the garden mistake) narrows options and forces the unbending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The anomaly compresses corridor lights into "a blue thread," the listening room houses a mercury reservoir, and the bent nib functions as a tactile constraint that must be unbent to restore function. The viewport's shifting constellations charge the final image. Micro-setting (the pen, the headphones, the metal ruler) substitutes effectively for broader world-building at this length. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Mara can correct the garden error through her editing method. The new cadence forces the unbending choice, which narrows options—she must loosen her own certainty to proceed. The resolution (inserting the tea moment) alters tactics and forecloses brute decree as a method. Cost is visible: she accepts that kindness matters more than grand correction and signs nothing, releasing control. One clear tightening under a causal lens is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the dried pen scores "faint grooves" that "imagine words filling themselves later," mirroring the story's question of whether the past is trap or draft. The bent nib's unbending literalizes the need to loosen certainty. The ending image—blank signature line, trust in the next interpreter—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: meaning comes from contingent relationships, not authorial decree. "Comfort could be strange and still true" is stated rather than fully embodied, but prior images (vines, tea, stars) ground the thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "confidently uncertain," "imagine words filling themselves later," "thresh meaning from experience." Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("contingent relationships," "modest kindness," "invitations to thresh meaning") that feels slightly outside Mara's lived idiom during peak beats. The final paragraph's "warmth that comes from admitting how contingent every life is" edges toward essayistic voice. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (the nib-unbending beat tightens syntax effectively).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. The phrase "the contradiction was the point" and "drafts could be made kinder without erasing the pain" approach thematic summary but remain anchored in Mara's work. Minor paraphrase loop: "the signals were not warnings but invitations to thresh meaning from experience" closely echoes prior thematic material without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she understood that comfort could be strange and still true, a warmth that comes from admitting..." stacks abstract claims (−0.3). No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—editing history via celestial signals mapped to contingent relationships—synthesizes fresh elements (gravitational anomaly + archival editing + signal interpretation). The bent nib as both tool and metaphor for loosening certainty is specific and non-obvious. The resolution (inserting a tea moment rather than erasing vines) transforms the familiar "fix the past" trope through moral specificity: kindness over erasure. Risk-taking in the anomaly's mechanics and the abstract editing system heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as celestial signal interpreter drives all key beats: she receives the new cadence, maps it to the courier node, edits the ledger, and files the record. Her decisions (keep pen dry, insert tea moment, leave signature blank) create turns. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dried fountain pen with exotic nib appears in at least four beats: initial description (dry, no ink), the moment she reaches for it "as if it were a trowel," discovery of the bent nib, and the unbending against the ruler that produces "a line that looked almost wet." The nib's bent state mirrors her need to loosen certainty; unbending it is the story's physical climax. Irreplaceable and causally active across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Editing history shapes stakes throughout: Mara's job is to "translate [signals] into edits in the historical record," she believes "history could be edited only through contingent relationships," and the climactic choice is whether and how to rewrite the courier moment. The concept constrains her method (no brute decree) and the ledger's acceptance "with a soft click" validates her approach. Present in setup, drives middle tactics, and resolves at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is defined early ("she spoke in firm clauses while leaving room for the sky to contradict her") and enables her method (recording faint grooves, imagining words later). The trait constrains her final choice: to unbend the nib she must "loosen her own certainty." Present in setup and payoff, but middle development is less distinct—she doesn't visibly struggle between confidence and uncertainty in the database search. The cost (releasing authorship via blank signature) ties back to uncertainty but could be more direct.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Unbend" is the story's pivot: Mara must "unbend" the exotic nib by tracing the bend back to the courier moment, then physically unbends it against a ruler. The action is literalized and metaphorical simultaneously ("feeling the resistance like a memory letting go"). Swapping "unbend" for another verb would break the causal chain and thematic resonance. Present in middle and closure, with the physical act producing the story's first "wet" line.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method "through contingent relationships" is signaled early ("she mapped [chirps] to lives in the database, believing history could be edited only through contingent relationships") and demonstrated when Mara searches for "a friendship that had been missed, an introduction that never happened." The climactic edit inserts a relational moment (offering tea, listening) rather than erasing vines. Mechanics shape her approach across setup, middle search, and closure. Specificity (relationships vs. brute decree) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly houses the station and "tightens" to compress lights into a blue thread, triggering the new cadence. Stars near it shift into unfamiliar constellations at the end. The anomaly enables her work (time pools there) but doesn't directly constrain the tea-moment choice—Mara could perform the same edit without the anomaly tightening. Present in setup and closure image, but middle pressure comes more from the signal/nib than the anomaly itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" frames the story and the garden error is the problem Mara solves, but the timeframe functions more as premise than live pressure. No countdown or urgency tied to "after"; the anomaly shift ("one night") introduces immediacy but isn't temporally stressed. The phrase "years earlier" in the edit marks narrative time but doesn't tighten tactics. Present in setup and thematically relevant at closure (the revised timeline still bears scars) but doesn't actively constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience, separating seed from husk" is stated late as a realization rather than dramatized as conflicted desire throughout. Mara's actual choices (keep pen dry, insert tea moment, file with blank signature) enact a drive to find meaning through relationships and modest correction, but the "thresh" language arrives as summary. The motivation shapes her method and closure stance, yet friction between wanting certainty and accepting contingency could be more embodied in middle beats. Present in closure, implied in setup, but middle development is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is embedded throughout: "Comfort came strangely in the work," the revised memory "looped back to her in the anomaly as a calm pulse," and the final understanding that "comfort could be strange and still true, a warmth that comes from admitting how contingent every life is." Tone modulates from the initial garden shame through anomaly compression to the quiet closure. The oxymoron charges the final image (filing with a blank signature as an act of trust). Coherent across setup, middle pressure, and ending.</comment>
