<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motives are clear and her micro-choices (copying lyrics, cloaking the pages, planning the concert) advance the stakes. However, her internal contradictions remain thin; we see her actions but not the cost of her compliance versus resistance until the concert arrives fully formed. The embodied emotion is sparse—"pricked her like thistles" feels more decorative than visceral. Supporting cast (Vell, Ashmouth) apply pressure but exist primarily as facilitators rather than sources of friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara collects lyrics, stitches them into scores, and orchestrates a public reveal. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (copyist, archive loft, post-famine city). The closure—the concert where dust whispers back and Censors are stopped by their own steps—reads as Charged Poise; the audience hears meaning and the mist "holds stories like seeds," but the immediate consequence (arrest? next broadcast?) remains off-page, leaving cost more conceptual than dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs (the concert decision), yet the causal chain relies on convenient alignment: the shortwave dial glow unlocks the covers exactly when needed, and the Censors' boots shimmer on cue without prior setup of that mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, archive loft, and central square are vividly rendered with soot drifting "like snow" and fog rolling in. The shortwave radio's dial glow functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's tactics (she must return to the alcove, position it behind the timpani) and charging the final image when it washes the stands "like moonrise." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: during the concert the glow and dust take precedence. The famine-era specificity (bread lines, Censors of Noise) anchors tone without over-explaining occupational systems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving narrative in a censored city—is signaled early and accumulates through Mara's successive acts (copying, cloaking, concert). One meaningful tightening occurs when the Censors post their inspection notice, forcing Mara to cloak the pages; this narrows her options and raises cost. The concert itself delivers the peak pressure, yet the resolution hinges on the dust whispering back and the Censors being stopped by ambient sparkle—outcomes that feel more thematic assertion than earned reversal driven by protagonist agency. The "dust shimmered and whispered" moment lacks prior dramatization of how the copied lyrics would transfer to the ground or compel the Censors' confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—story as survival, narrative as resistance—emerges organically from Mara's copying work and the pirate broadcast mechanics. The final image (mist holding stories "like seeds," ember glowing "in time") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "thistled calm" and the way luminous letters "rise from the pages in threads," avoiding direct statement. The recurring motifs (dust, glow, songs as contraband) constrain Mara's tactics and charge the closure without turning into checklist symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close on Mara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "soot drifted like snow," "dust at their boots shimmered," "threads that curled around the musicians." Perceptual signature is selective—Mara notices luminosity, notation, and the orchestra's response—yet the voice occasionally slides into elevated diction ("contraband narrative," "Censors of Noise") that reads slightly above a working copyist's internal lexicon under stress. Dialogue is absent; all character interaction is summarized ("Vell explained"), which flattens potential subtext and limits voice distinction between Mara and Vell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("dust drifted like snow," "dial glow warmed the fog," "fish under ice"), yet several beats loop or paraphrase: "secretly luminous" appears three times across the story, and the "dust" motif is restated in adjacent sentences without added pressure ("dust on the stands wanted to listen" / "dust to speak" / "dust at their boots shimmered"). Template cadence runs appear: "Mara opened…began to copy," "She noticed…she understood," "Mara decided…and she sewed." The final third stacks passive constructions ("was on the air again," "were directions") that dull immediacy. Information density is high, but scaffold remains visible in transitions like "At home, Mara stitched" and "To test her trick, she returned."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of music notation, pirate radio, and story famine offers a fresh angle on censorship narratives. The dial glow as both tool and metaphor (unlocking hidden text, charging the final image) feels specific and purposeful. The concert climax where dust whispers back the Censors' steps is a bold, non-obvious choice that grows from prior particulars (luminous ink, copied lyrics). However, the pirate-broadcast-as-resistance premise echoes familiar dystopian templates, and the transformation relies on the established world logic (famine, Censors) more than on Mara's lived detail or moral calculus under fire.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as copyist is introduced immediately and her choices (copying lyrics, cloaking pages, planning the concert) drive three key beats. Her profession enables the tactics (she has access to scores and musicians) and shapes the closure (the concert where hidden staves are revealed). Removing her occupation would break the story's logic. The element is signaled early, develops through middle choices, and is causally active at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shortwave radio's dial glow appears in the ember alcove scene, reappears when Mara tests her cloaked pages, and is positioned behind the timpani to unlock the covers during the concert. It constrains Mara's tactics (she must return to the alcove, arrange the light source) and charges the final image ("dial glow would wash the stands like moonrise," "even the ember in the tin seemed to glow in time"). The object is handled in three distinct beats and its "secretly luminous" property matters at closure. High irreplaceability: a generic light would not carry the pirate-broadcast link or the metaphor of hidden transmission.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is introduced early (Vell tunes the radio to find Ashmouth), shapes Mara's middle actions (copying lyrics, joining the recruitment), and is integrated into the concert climax where "the broadcast joined the orchestra through the speakers." It constrains options (the lyrics must be elusive, the Censors punish it) and enables the final tactic (using the radio's glow and signal to reveal the hidden staves). The concept is causally active across at least three beats and the story's logic would collapse without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is applied to the dial glow, the copied letters, and the dust at the Censors' boots. The trait enables Mara's reading without a lamp and charges the closure image, yet it functions more as metaphor than constraint—there is no on-page cost tied to the luminosity itself (no risk of being seen, no energy drain). The attribute is present in the setup, middle, and payoff, but its causal pressure is indirect: it signals the effect of the pirate songs rather than altering Mara's tactics under duress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Cloak" drives the middle turn: the Censors' inspection notice forces Mara to sew a black cloth cover that hides the lyrics until the dial glow reveals them. This tactic shapes the concert climax ("the covers softened into transparency"). The action is introduced at the inspection beat, developed when Mara tests it at the alcove, and paid off at the ending. Removing it would require a different mechanism for hiding and revealing the contraband text. Causal work is solid across two beats and closure linkage is clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the ember alcove scene ("a voice sang in fragments, slipping between static, its lyrics elusive like fish under ice"), shapes Mara's middle actions (copying "words as she would copy violins," stitching lines into margins), and is explicit at closure ("Ashmouth sang the missing verses between movements"). The elusiveness constrains her work (she must "trust that story could return") and the lyrics' ability to "sneak past the officials" is the premise of the concealment tactic. The method is causally active in three beats and irreplaceable: direct speech or printed pamphlets would not carry the same risk or resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove appears in two scenes: Mara's first meeting with Vell and her return to test the cloaked pages. It supplies the radio and the dial glow (resources that affect the outcome) and its mist-shrouded, hidden location reinforces the clandestine stakes. However, the alcove does not constrain a choice at closure—the concert occurs in the central square. The setting is purposeful in the middle but does not charge the final image directly. Present in setup and middle development; absent from payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the story famine" anchors the world (bread lines, burned tales, Censors) and motivates Mara's desire to restore narrative. It primes the stakes but does not function as a live ticking clock; no deadline tightens Mara's decisions. The timeframe is referenced early ("the city kept its mouths closed") and implied at closure ("the mist held the stories like seeds, waiting for the next telling"), yet it operates as setting context rather than a pressure mechanism that alters tactics beat by beat. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic echo at payoff) but no middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's promise "to teach dust to tell stories again" is stated early and drives her choices: she copies lyrics, stitches them into scores, and orchestrates the concert to make "the hungry hear plots and not just percussion." The motivation faces friction (the Censors' inspection, the risk of punishment) and the closure dramatizes its partial success (the dust whispers, the mist holds stories). The want is concretely enacted across three beats with visible cost (she risks arrest, defies the Censors). High specificity: the "dust" motif ties the desire directly to the world's physical state.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is attributed to Vell ("listened with a thistled calm," "still calm as a thistle in wind") and implied in Mara's steady copying work under dangerous conditions. The tone coheres through the accumulative middle (patient collection, stitching, testing) and modulates at the concert climax where pressure peaks but the prose remains measured ("the mist held the stories like seeds"). However, the descriptor is applied primarily to one character and does not charge the final image distinctly—"thistled" disappears in the closing lines. Present in setup and middle; only faintly echoed at closure.</comment>
