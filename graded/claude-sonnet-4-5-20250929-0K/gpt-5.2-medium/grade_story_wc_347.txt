<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's curse-driven motivation is embodied through concrete non-touch mechanics ("pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark") and tested under pressure when rescue tightens the curse. Internal contradiction surfaces in "I should refuse, because every rescue tightens the curse, yet my orchard was planted to mark safe paths, not graves." Micro-choices accumulate—counting turns aloud, assembling the waystone without fingers—revealing a hierarchy of values. The final stance ("someone must keep the curse facing outward instead of inward") earns Earned Stasis but skirts diagnostic phrasing; the choice to finish the remaining waystones forecloses solitary endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the forgotten blueprint motivates the waystone assembly (causal), while the curse mechanics and orchard-as-map layer meaning (accumulative). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + forward commitment): the protagonist decides to finish the waystones, transforming the Duke's convenience into "a map of ethics." Cost is legible—"each impression I leave will be a sign"—but the final image ("the path through the labyrinth will not" look the same) tilts abstract rather than landing on a charged concrete beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nut unlocks the waystone and confuses the birds, narrowing options and enabling escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds constrains choices throughout: the forty-seven-minute frost deadline, the birds' patrol confusion when the waystone sings, the child pinned under a bent wing. The nut as micro-object charges the final image by becoming "quiet inside the stone." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("tears steam in the cold air," "brass wings click in the dusk"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through "seven right, two down, one back." The orchard-as-shadow and wind-bitten fruit anchor the setting in the opening, and the environment evolves causally (frost threading corners, birds returning "with a sound like reluctant applause").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide the travelers before frost turns corridors to mirrors and birds to knives—is signaled early and tightens when the child is found pinned. Agency surfaces in the protagonist's choice to plant the nut and assemble the waystone despite the curse's cost, a decision that enables escape and forecloses solitary refusal. The forty-seven-minute clock and the birds' adaptive confusion create escalating pressure. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's alteration (committing to finish the remaining waystones) with visible cost: "every rescue tightens the curse." One clean reversal: the waystone's song breaks the birds' patrol pattern, opening the path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the Duke's traps repurposed into "a map of ethics," precision as "the only kindness I have learned," and the curse kept "facing outward instead of inward." The nut shifts from relic to key to ethical tool, its meaning reweighted at closure when it goes quiet inside the stone. Subtext operates in "offhandedly exact" as both cruelty and care, and in the birds' "reluctant applause" charging the ending without moralizing. The final decision to finish the waystones answers the implicit question—whether mercy compounds suffering or redeems it—through scene work rather than assertion. Minor slip: "a map of ethics" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic statement but remains anchored in the blueprint conceit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "knotted branches and wind-bitten fruit," "frostless air," "offhandedly exact," "graceless beauty." POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Diction sustains the narrator's perceptual signature—precision as character trait ("forty-seven minutes," "seven right, two down, one back") and poetic compression ("stitched-on shadow," "tears steam"). Dialogue is spare and functional: Mara's plea, the protagonist's questions, the final exchange. Free indirect touches are clean. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between immediacy ("I kneel without kneeling") and reflection ("someone must keep the curse facing outward"). Under peak stress, syntax tightens without losing texture. Minor filter-verb reliance ("I listen to the labyrinth") but voice-motivated and non-intrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong figurative control: "stitched-on shadow," "frostless air to bruise bark," "breath stains the stone," "tears steam in the cold air." Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "offhandedly exact" appears three times without evolving use (paraphrase loop), and "the orchard will look the same, but the path through the labyrinth will not" is serviceable but less charged than prior images. The closing's abstraction ("each impression I leave will be a sign") dilutes momentum slightly. No clarity breaks; grammar and tense are clean. The opening and key beats shine; the final paragraph loses a fraction of propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of curse mechanics (non-touch cultivation), labyrinth, mechanical birds, and blueprint-as-key synthesizes familiar tropes into a coherent, non-obvious frame. "Offhandedly exact" as both flaw and gift, and the orchard-labyrinth shared design rooted in the Duke's hubris, feel specific and earned. The protagonist's ethical calculus—transforming convenience into care—elevates the premise beyond rescue plot. The birds' "graceless beauty" and their patrol confusion add fresh texture. Minor proximity concern: the tone and imagery occasionally echo fairy-tale gothic without fully transforming the register. The ending commitment (finishing the waystones) is a quiet but structurally sound turn rather than a bold formal risk. Solid execution within its chosen mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist drives every major beat: chooses to enter the labyrinth despite curse cost, assembles the waystone, frees the child, decides to finish remaining waystones. Present in setup (orchard caretaker bound by curse), middle (rescue choices), and closure (commitment to continue). Causal pressure and visible cost throughout. Swappability low—the curse mechanics are character-specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nut appears in setup ("In the hollow of my coat I carry a small nut"), middle (planted in the waystone to unlock the song), and closure (goes "quiet inside the stone" and its note's silence marks transformation). Used across three beats with evolving function: relic, key, embedded signal. Its unique properties (starts the waystone, confuses birds) make it irreplaceable. Visible cost: planting it forecloses future use and commits the protagonist to the waystones project.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blueprint shapes stakes (enables the waystone system), appears in setup (found "years ago" in a rusted pipe, memorized "like prayers"), middle (guides assembly at the first junction), and closure (recast as "a map of ethics"). It changes options by providing the means to counter the Duke's traps and alters tactics throughout. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and specificity—"ink showed an assembly of waystones and wind-fins meant to sing directions"—but could theoretically be replaced by another lost schematic with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is signaled early ("I note, offhandedly exact, that they have forty-seven minutes"), used in middle ("I count turns aloud, offhandedly exact: seven right, two down, one back"), and implicitly charges the ending via the precision-as-kindness theme. It enables navigation under pressure and constrains the protagonist's social presentation ("they stare at me as if precision is cruelty"). Present in two distinct beats with cost (social alienation). Moderate swappability—another precision trait could substitute—and the phrase itself recurs without evolving function, trending toward label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Assemble" drives the central turn: the protagonist assembles the waystone from loose slabs at the first junction, which unlocks the song, confuses the birds, and enables escape. Setup (blueprint calls for assembly), middle (waystone assembly on-page with specific mechanics: "nudging them with the pressure of my shadow and the nut's pull"), closure (decision to assemble remaining waystones). The action is irreplaceable—no other verb or tactic would activate the blueprint's system. High causal pressure and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("pressing my palms close enough for frostless air to bruise bark into new growth"), used throughout (kneeling to leave "an impression of a circle," planting the nut "without fingers," denting the bird's breastplate "shaped like mercy"), and implicit in the closure commitment to leave impressions as signs. Mechanics constrain every action and define the protagonist's relationship to both orchard and labyrinth. Irreplaceable—removing non-touch would break curse logic and protagonist identity. Present across all gates with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth pressures every choice: forty-seven-minute frost deadline, mechanical birds that herd and pin, narrow slots, fallen gears. Setup (described as "a maze of slate corridors cut into the rock and patrolled by mechanical birds"), middle (birds spiral down confused by the waystone's song, child pinned under a bent wing, spatial navigation "seven right, two down, one back"), closure (labyrinth settles with birds returning to routes). Environment supplies resources (loose slabs for the waystone) and obstacles (gears, frost). Irreplaceable and deeply integrated into tactics and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("forty-seven minutes until the first rim of ice"), tightens tactics (rushing into the labyrinth, urgency in assembly), and pays off at closure ("the first frost threads the corners" as they escape). Time pressures the middle choices and narrows options. Present in setup, middle urgency, and closure image. Moderate cost linkage—time runs but exact tracking fades in the middle. The live clock alters moves but could be replaced by another urgent constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized in the opening ("I cannot ignore them even when I want to"), tested in friction ("I should refuse, because every rescue tightens the curse, yet my orchard was planted to mark safe paths, not graves"), drives middle choices (entering the labyrinth, assembling the waystone, freeing the child), and culminates in closure commitment ("someone must keep the curse facing outward instead of inward"). Visible cost throughout: each rescue tightens the curse, final decision forecloses solitary endurance. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone coheres through "knotted branches and wind-bitten fruit," "graceless beauty" applied to the birds' brass wings, "a dent shaped like mercy," "tears steam in the cold air," and "reluctant applause." The oxymoronic register—beauty in mechanical clumsiness, precision as cruelty and kindness—modulates with pressure and charges the ending without stating theme. Present in setup imagery, middle description, and closure mood. The phrase "graceless beauty" appears once explicitly but the tone pervades. Moderate swappability—another paradoxical tone could substitute with edits—but execution is strong and purposeful.</comment>
