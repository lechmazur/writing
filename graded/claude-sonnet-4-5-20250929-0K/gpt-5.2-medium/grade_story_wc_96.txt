<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Len's personality-shifting trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it's decorative. Interior access remains thin throughout; we see poetic observation but minimal embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Mara exists largely in summary; their friendship is told rather than dramatized in scene. The ending gesture (planting, passing the tin) feels motivated by premise rather than earned internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we don't anchor "who" clearly until the prison library paragraph, and "when" remains vague until late. The piece operates as accumulative/textural mosaic across multiple time shards (spring riots, June shift, summer deepening), but transitions are abrupt and the causal linkage between beats is weak—events happen because the premise requires them, not because prior choices narrow options. Closure offers a conceptual repricing ("fracture could shine, if you let it bloom"), but the cost is abstract and not dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vivid and returns with charged specificity at closure, constraining Len's rebuilding choice. Sensory detail (moon, silver light, bent shelves like ribs) is selective and atmospheric. However, spatial choreography across the city and prison remains vague, and the "false bottom" mechanism is described but never shown in tactile use that alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Escalation is conceptual rather than tactical: riots happen off-page, the library reopens via summary, and Len's personality shifts are told without visible friction. The final exchange (catalog for seedlings) is a thematic gesture, not a pressure-tested choice with legible cost. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—resistance as cultivation, fracture as opening—emerges organically from image and action (seeds, poems, rusted shelves). The final line offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the tin's false bottom and the contraband exchange. However, "fracture could shine, if you let it bloom" borders on explicit theme statement, and the piece occasionally gestures toward profundity ("anarchy was not a fire to fear but a field to plant") rather than earning insight through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent ("light had cracked and learned to sing," "shelves bent like ribs"), but the register is elevated and uniform across all beats, even moments of supposed urgency (riots, near-burning pamphlets). Len's "personality shifts" are claimed but not reflected in perceptual signature or syntax—May's "impatient personality" reads identical to prior months. Psychic distance remains stable, but the lack of modulation under pressure flattens emotional texture. Dialogue is absent, so no test there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("pockets full of ash," "sirens braid with birdsong"), but multiple metaphors in high-pressure beats (riots, near-burning) create rhythmic drag rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "forge beauty from anarchy" is restated as "fracture could shine, if you let it bloom." Template cadence in the middle section ("He broke into… he set… he imagined… he began") stacks identical stems without taught pattern. Information density is high, but the piece reads as lyrically overwritten for the modest on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—vagrant poet, false-bottom tin, prison library, mutual aid across walls—is specific and non-obvious. The rusted library image and seed-poem pairing offer fresh angles on resistance narratives. However, the personality-shifting trait feels ornamental, and the "forge beauty from anarchy" frame echoes familiar anarchist-pastoral motifs without transformation. The ending's luminous tone and conceptual neatness (two libraries rebuild each other) trend toward safety rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Len is present throughout and his decision to break into the branch and pass the catalog drives two beats, but the choices feel premise-driven rather than earned by internal conflict. The "vagrant penny poet" frame is decorative; we never see him sell haiku or handle pennies on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in three beats: initial description, breaking into the branch (spilling contents), passing to the guard. Its false bottom enables smuggling poems and later the catalog, shaping two tactical moves. However, the tin is never handled with tactile specificity that alters a choice under pressure—it's a prop rather than a constraint. Closure linkage is present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is the thematic spine and seeds + poems appear in multiple beats, but the concept operates as metaphor rather than on-page stake. The planting of nasturtiums and seed-packet distribution are told in summary, not dramatized as choices that narrow options or incur visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The monthly personality molts are mentioned three times (opening, May's "impatient personality," June's "gentler and afraid") but never constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only; Len's voice, perception, and choices remain uniform across shifts.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rebuild" appears explicitly in two beats (breaking into the branch, final image of mutual rebuilding) and shapes the ending's conceptual repricing. However, the action is largely summarized ("began to rebuild," "two libraries… rebuilt each other") rather than dramatized in scene with visible cost or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The friendship with Mara is central: it sparks at the Rilke moment, enables the smuggling idea, and motivates Len's catalog exchange. However, the Rilke collision is the only on-page beat; later collaboration and Mara's letter arrive via summary. The method shapes two beats but lacks middle development with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "rusted library under stars" is signaled in Mara's dream, discovered concretely by Len, and charges the final image ("roofless… rebuilt each other"). The setting pressures Len's choice to claim the space and shapes the ending's resonance. Micro-setting (moon, plywood, planters) alters tactics in the rebuilding beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"As the moon clears the skyline" appears once in the breaking-in beat to mark atmospheric timing, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track causally across the mosaic structure. Spring riots, June shift, and summer deepening are vague seasonal markers without a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Forge beauty from anarchy" is Len's stated vow and motivates the break-in and rebuilding gestures. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized in conflicted choice—no on-page friction tests the cost of beauty against survival, safety, or relational stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" coheres across the piece: "light had cracked and learned to sing," "fracture in the world was also an opening," "fracture could shine, if you let it bloom." Tone modulates slightly (urgency at riots, near-fear in June) and charges the final image. However, the register remains uniformly elevated without degradation under peak pressure, flattening emotional texture.</comment>
