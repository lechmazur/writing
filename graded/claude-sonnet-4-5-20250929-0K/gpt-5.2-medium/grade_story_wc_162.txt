<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is rooted in her father's disappearance and her inheritance of his maze-philosophy, but her interior life reads more as thematic musing than embodied contradiction. The micro-choices (waiting, counting breaths, measuring the gap) are present but lack visible cost or competing impulses that would elevate them. "Featherly determined" appears twice as a phrase rather than showing up as a trait that constrains action with trade-offs. The final crossing and door-building feel more like thematic resolution than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, drifting prism terrace, post-butterfly-effect city) arrive early. The causal chain—logbook → weather code → brass plate → timed corridor → doorframe message—holds together under a causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira builds her own maze of measured doors, accepting that she may never find Oren but can maintain the sacred threshold he opened. Cost is conceptual (the path continues without him) but felt in "she did not know if she would ever find him." One meaningful tightening (the seven-minute window) narrows options. The piece sustains coherence but the final image's charge is more thematic echo than visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terraces, old fairgrounds below, and the doorframe salvaged from the maze anchor the spatial logic clearly. The terrace's wind-driven motion creates the timed corridor constraint that forces Mira's crossing. Wood grain as map, brass plates hidden in seams, and the pavilion's barnwood all serve the mystery and the method. The seven-minute alignment window charges the final crossing with urgency. The setting constrains choice (the corridor dissolves) and the doorframe charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly Mira's quest to understand her father's "necessary distances" and why thresholds feel sacred. The weather code discovery, the timed corridor, and the final crossing provide one meaningful tightening (the seven-minute window). However, the escalation is more accumulative than urgent—Mira's agency is mostly interpretive (reading grain, waiting, counting breaths) rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible friction. The crossing itself is described as silent and smooth ("her landing was silent"), which softens the cost. Pressure coheres but does not sharply narrow options under causal tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—sacred thresholds as the meeting of necessary distance and chosen risk—emerges from the logbook, the wood grain, the measured gaps, and Mira's final act of building her own maze. The brass plate's instruction ("sacred thresholds exist where needed distance meets chosen risk") borders on statement but is earned by prior particulars (the maze, the corridor, the doorframe). The ending offers a non-literal answer: Mira will maintain the space Oren opened without finding him, building doors "each gap measured to let the hush heal without breaking." The final image reweights the opening ("hush fracture around her like thin ice") with purposeful resonance, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is purposefully lyric ("featherly determined," "hush fracture," "intervals of waiting"), with a consistent elevated register that matches the conceptual stakes. The perceptual signature—Mira reading grain as time, feeling heat through a wall, sensing patterns in wood rings—is specific and sustained. Psychic distance remains controlled. Two small frictions: "featherly determined" recurs identically twice without variation, and some constructions ("She could not read it directly, but she could intuit") lean toward filter verbs in a way that slightly softens immediacy. Voice is coherent and distinct but not quite seamless under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance the search or accumulate thematic texture. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clear. Two clusters of artifact pull the score down: (1) "featherly determined" appears verbatim twice, a stock phrase that reads decorative rather than earned; (2) the phrase "necessary distances" recurs four times across the piece, and while thematically motivated, the repetition edges toward synonym churn without reweighting. The final paragraph risks overwriting ("each gap measured to let the hush heal without breaking") but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the repeated stock phrases and elevated diction in conceptual beats create minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination—drifting prism terraces, maze architect's lost child, weather code as signature, wood grain as time map—feels specific and non-obvious. The concept of "necessary distances" as ethical spacing offers a fresh angle on labyrinth/threshold mythology. The butterfly-effect city and wind-aligned corridor add ingenuity. However, the emotional core (searching for a lost parent, inheriting their philosophy, accepting their absence) follows a familiar arc. The piece synthesizes its elements with care but does not take bold structural or perspectival risk that would elevate it further; the final maze-building feels more inevitable than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (corn maze architect's lost child) is the protagonist; her identity shapes the dominant stake and her choices drive all major beats: interpreting the logbook, analyzing wood grain, waiting for the wind alignment, crossing the corridor, and building her own maze. She appears in setup, middle, and ending. Her final choice—to build measured doors without finding Oren—alters her path from search to creation. The element is essential but her agency is more interpretive than decisively forking; the crossing itself is described as inevitable once understood ("she did not jump until she understood"), which softens the turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pilot logbook with weather code is introduced early (courier kite drop), constrains Mira's search (she intuits direction "like feeling heat through a wall"), returns at the ending (she holds it against wood, aligning code to grain), and enables the timed corridor discovery. It appears in at least three beats with evolving use. The code's match to the storm pattern charges the mystery. However, the logbook itself is more container than active prop; the code does the causal work. Strong integration but not indispensable—another carrier (e.g., a salvaged note, an engraved tool) could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is the conceptual spine: Oren's idea, Mira's inheritance, the maze design principle ("a maze is kinder when its turns are spaced for courage"), the brass plate's instruction ("needed distance meets chosen risk"), and the ending's measured gaps. It shapes the dominant stake (why thresholds feel sacred), constrains the crossing (Mira waits to understand the distance as "an ethical line"), and defines the closure (building doors with measured gaps). Setup, middle tactics, and ending all depend on it. The concept is irreplaceable and charges the final image with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears verbatim twice ("featherly determined to measure," "she stepped to the edge, featherly determined") as a label rather than a trait that constrains action with visible cost. It signals a quality of Mira's resolve but does not enable a tradeoff or force a difficult choice. The crossing is described as requiring understanding, not a struggle between determination and doubt. The attribute is present but ornamental; swapping it for "resolutely" or "carefully" would not alter beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Intuition enables Mira to find direction from the weather code ("she could not read it directly, but she could intuit where it pointed"), to sense Oren's message in the wood ("listening, and in the fractured hush she heard a faint click"), and to sense his path continuing in grain patterns at the end. It appears in setup and closure, shaping two key discoveries (the knot seam, the continuing path). However, the mechanics of intuition remain vague—Mira "feels heat through a wall" but the reader cannot trace the logic. The action is signaled but not grounded in specific sensory or cognitive steps that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Analyzing wood grain appears early (taught as Oren's lesson: "Each ring and curl held distances… intervals of waiting"), drives the middle beat (Mira runs fingertips along the bench, hears the click at a knot, finds the brass plate), and returns at closure (she holds the logbook against wood, aligning code to grain, sensing the path). The method is specific (grain as time map, rings as breaths between decisions) and shapes at least two beats with causal consequence. It is tied to the "necessary distances" concept and charges the ending. Strong integration; removing it would break the discovery mechanism and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is the primary location, introduced in the opening beat and sustained throughout. It creates the timed constraint (wind alignment for seven minutes), supplies the corridor for crossing, and positions the final doorframe. The terrace's motion under wind pressure is the mechanism that enables and then closes the crossing window. The setting is signaled early, pressures the middle choice (Mira must wait and time her move), and is present in the closure (she builds her maze on the terrace). Spatial choreography is clear and the setting's drift is causally active, not decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the world rules (small choices → storms, city speaks softly, rooftops rebuilt) but does not tighten present tactics. The timeframe is the distant past (Oren's disappearance "years ago"), the recent past (logbook dropped "that morning"), and the present (Mira's search and crossing). The seven-minute corridor window introduces urgency in one beat, but the broader "after" setting remains static backdrop. The butterfly-effect premise justifies the drifting terraces but does not shape Mira's choices with a live clock or deadline beyond the single alignment moment. Functional setup, modest middle pressure, minimal closure role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover why some thresholds feel sacred" is stated early and drives every beat: interpreting the code, analyzing wood, waiting for alignment, crossing the gap, and building measured doors. The motivation is rooted in her inheritance of Oren's philosophy and her loss. It is tested by the choice to cross ("she did not jump until she understood the distance as an ethical line") and resolved in the ending (she accepts that sacred thresholds are where "needed distance meets chosen risk" and continues the work without finding him). The motivation is present in setup, middle choice, and closure with visible cost (accepting his absence). Strong integration; the friction is that the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is introduced in the opening ("the hush fracture around her like thin ice"), sustained through quiet, interpretive beats (listening to wood, waiting in silence, "her landing was silent"), and returns in the ending ("each gap measured to let the hush heal without breaking"). The tone is coherent—contemplative, delicate, grief-tinged—and modulates with the timed crossing moment (pressure rises briefly when the corridor opens). The final image recharges the opening phrase with added meaning (hush that heals rather than fractures). The tone is purposeful and integrated but remains largely static; it does not sharply shift under the crossing's urgency, which softens its pressure contribution.</comment>
