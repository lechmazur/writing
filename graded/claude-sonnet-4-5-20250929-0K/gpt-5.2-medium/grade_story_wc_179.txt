<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's interiority shows purpose-driven thought ("scheme was to restore the melody") but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. Mara's shift from knife-carrier to release feels insufficiently earned; her resistance is declared ("face hardened") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The cellular-memory mechanism replaces psychological specificity with a concept-label that circumvents the need for individuated internal conflict. Minor: "childhood that the shifting city had stolen" reads as convenient backstory rather than a lived constraint shaping present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Mara's knife drop and the pin's reappearance, a valid Resonant Reconfiguration under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative at the end. Cost is present but thin: Mara "chose to lead her people without threats," yet we see no concrete forfeiture or tactical trade-off in the final image. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), and the dominant stake (teaching resentment to release) coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass walls flicker and Mara panics, narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary (pressure in ears, walls becoming glass) constrains interaction and charges the climax when silence allows only bodily reception of the music box's click. The broken cylinder pin is handled twice (opening, closure) and its reappearance directly enables the final turn. The shifting city outside provides escalating context (three possible streets) that pressures Mara's panic. Spatial choreography is clean; the stone floor and Lio's fingertips anchor the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release resentment) is signaled early and pursued through Lio's scheme. Escalation: Mara's weapon audit → night when city shifts hardest → glass walls and panic → Lio's gambit with the box. One meaningful tightening when Mara's soldiers crowd and resentment thickens into certainty. The knife drop forecloses a path with visible cost (her role as threat-keeper). Agency is Lio's decision to open the box and Mara's choice to stop reaching for the knife. Minor: coincidence allows the pin to reappear "at the instant it was required," which complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (bodily memory vs. cognitive resistance, grace as adaptive mercy) emerges through the music box mechanism and the sanctuary's shifting form. The final image (complete cylinder, remembered sound traveling through blood) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "teaching release more effectively than any sermon" edges toward thematic statement, and the closing line ("planned the next gentle theft of anger") nearly summarizes the premise rather than leaving it implicit. The melody/pin motif constrains choice and charges closure, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV (Lio) with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "scheming pacifist," "as if grace were sliding from one joint to the next." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("resentments that stayed constant even when their names did not"). No dialogue on the page; gesture and silence carry subtext effectively ("showed his empty hands," "mouthed" the argument). Minor register wobble: "teaching release more effectively than any sermon" and "planned the next gentle theft" tilt toward authorial summary rather than Lio's interior idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (glass walls showing three streets, pin clicking "so softly that only bones could register it"). Template-cadence slips: three consecutive "he [verb]" stems in paragraph 4 ("He convinced," "He did not mention," "He set"). Paraphrase loop: "The healer had called it borrowing, because cellular memory is communal" immediately followed by "the sanctuary had held thousands" restates the same communal-memory idea without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "grace were sliding from one joint to the next" and "teaching release" lean generic. Artifacts touch mid-story beats but not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary and cellular-memory mechanism offer a fresh synthesis of sensory deprivation and embodied forgiveness. The scheming-pacifist frame ("redirect conflict the way water is redirected") and the self-returning pin add specificity. However, the refuge-with-guarded-leader and the magical-object-that-heals-trauma templates are widely used; transformation occurs through the silence constraint and the pin's agency, but the emotional arc (hardened leader softens via mystical intervention) follows a familiar path. The closing image (complete melody, blood-borne teaching) is evocative but not fully inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio (scheming pacifist) appears early, frames the central strategy (restore melody without forcing), and makes two key decisions: convincing Mara to allow the box and opening it during the glass-wall crisis. His scheme shapes setup, middle tactic (pressing memory into the mechanism), and closure (the pin reappears, refugees release). The final line shows him planning the next intervention, sustaining character consistency. Cost is conceptual (he must scheme continuously) rather than a visible personal sacrifice. Two beats plus closure participation, causal pressure evident, moderate irreplaceability (a different archetype would alter tone).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The broken cylinder pin is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled in two distinct beats (Lio keeps it in a pouch, it reappears in the closure turn), and its reappearance directly enables the complete melody that releases resentment. The pin's self-returning property ("turning up in his pocket or under his tongue") constrains Lio's tactics (he cannot discard it) and charges the ending image. Visible cost: Lio must accept the pin's agency rather than control it. Strong closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability (a different object could serve, but the broken/whole motif fits tightly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named early and described as "a mercy that moved location and form to meet the moment." It shapes the sanctuary's adaptability (walls becoming glass, pin reappearing) and the refugees' bodily reception of the melody. The concept enables Lio's method and complicates Mara's panic when the walls shift. However, "grace" reads more as thematic overlay than a mechanical constraint that narrows options; the pin's reappearance is the concrete manifestation, but the abstract "grace" itself does not force a visible trade-off. Present across beats, moderate causal pressure, some swappability (could be rephrased as "adaptive mercy" without loss).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" governs the pin throughout: setup (sliver reappears in pocket or under tongue), middle constraint (Lio cannot discard it), and closure payoff (pin sits "neatly in its hole, reappeared at the instant it was required"). The trait enables the final turn and imposes a cost (Lio must trust the pin's timing rather than act on his own schedule). Two beats, strong closure linkage, visible constraint (cannot force the pin's return). Moderate irreplaceability (a similar magical-return trait could substitute, but this phrasing fits the "shifting grace" frame).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Convince" drives three pivotal beats: Lio convinces Mara to let him keep the box (setup), convinces her during the glass-wall crisis by showing empty hands and mouthing his argument (climax), and the final outcome is Mara choosing to lead without threats (closure consequence). Each instance narrows options or redefines stance. The action is irreplaceable; substituting "persuade" or "argue" would lose the pacifist's tactical flavor. Strong causal pressure, early signal, closure participation, visible cost (Mara's knife drop, Lio's ongoing scheming).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through cellular memory" is explained mid-story ("grief and vengeance store patterns through cellular memory") and enacted when Lio "pushed the memory of the lost melody from his skin into the mechanism." The mechanism enables the climax and is present at closure ("that remembered sound traveled through their blood"). However, it is introduced relatively late (second third), functions as a tell-rather-than-show device, and could be replaced with "through touch" or "via resonance" without major structural change. One beat, moderate closure linkage, high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary appears in the opening line, constrains all interaction (no audible music, only bodily pressure and silence), and charges the climax when the music box's click registers "so softly that only bones could register it." The setting's silence is causally necessary for Lio's method to work and for Mara's resistance to soften without verbal argument. The glass-wall transformation during the crisis adds tactical pressure. Early signal, two beats (silence enabling the box, glass walls triggering panic), strong closure linkage, high irreplaceability (removing silence breaks the mechanism).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is present in setup (city revises itself every hour, refugees slip in during revisions) and escalates at the climax ("the night the city shifted hardest," walls become glass showing three streets). The timeframe creates urgency and complicates Mara's panic, but the shifts do not impose a legible clock or deadline that alters tactics beat-by-beat. The final shift (glass walls flicker back to stone) is felt as relief, reweighting the stake. Two beats, moderate causal pressure, some swappability (could be rephrased as "during instability" without major loss).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To teach resentment to release" is Lio's stated goal from paragraph 2, drives his scheme (restore melody, let cells argue), and is tested when Mara's resentment "had kept people alive, but now it was keeping them trapped." The desire is dramatized through Lio's micro-choices (keeping the pin, opening the box during crisis) and Mara's final choice (letting the knife fall). Visible cost: Mara forecloses her threat-keeper role; Lio must continue scheming. Early signal, two beats, strong closure participation, moderate irreplaceability (a different healing motive would shift tone but preserve structure).</comment>
