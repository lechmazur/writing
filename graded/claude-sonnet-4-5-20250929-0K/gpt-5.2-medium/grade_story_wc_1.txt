<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's craft-specific perception (reading frost like light patterns) and adaptive trait are embodied in concrete choices. Internal contradiction appears in the decision to build the furnace rather than flee, though the motivational arc from fear to action feels somewhat linear. The "purpose in pauses" realization at the end risks epiphany language but is grounded in the glass-making metaphor. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slides toward poetic abstraction ("drifting resonance") rather than visceral specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (studio, firebomb survival, ledger strip). The causal lens holds: attempt → retracing → frost-reading → discovery → glass-sealed proof → schoolhouse reveal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the bomb was rehearsed at the camp ring, narrowing the threat to a specific conspirator. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (councilman exposed, protagonist's purpose clarified) with visible cost (risk, labor, public confrontation), though the cost to the councilman reads more summary than scene at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon functions as micro-setting: frost patterns constrain the detective method, the fire ring provides charcoal for the furnace, and the enclosed space amplifies "drifting resonance." Sensory detail is selective and craft-filtered (frost as "lacework maps," soot-dark camp ring). The glass pane itself becomes setting-as-object, sealing evidence. Spatial choreography remains clear across the riverbed journey and schoolhouse reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival and truth) is signaled early via the firebomb. The frost-reading discovery and furnace-building choice constitute one meaningful tightening under the causal lens, forcing the protagonist to commit smuggled charcoal and craft skill to proof-making. Agency is clear: the decision to "make a vessel" rather than "march back with proof" narrows options and charges the final confrontation. The councilman's pale pause and later arrest provide closure, though the arrest itself is told rather than shown, softening the felt cost at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (endurance, light in darkness, pause as decision-point) emerges from the glass-artist's craft and the literal sealing of soot into transparent pane. The final window with "deliberate empty spaces" offers a non-literal answer to "purpose in the pauses" without stating a moral. "Scorched testament" and adaptive resilience interweave throughout. Minor slip: "make every surviving breath a clear testament that cannot be erased" in the final line edges toward thematic summary, though it grows organically from the glass metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and craft-anchored ("coaxes light into bottles," "melted sand until it ran, bright and obedient"), maintaining lyric register and perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's certainty matches plausible inference. Minor lapses: "drifting resonance" recurs as a motif-phrase without clear evolution, and some constructions ("the very shape of a conversation that ended in violence") feel slightly over-wrought. Dialogue is minimal (children, councilman) but functional. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the frost drew lacework maps" anchors method and stakes). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Deductions: "drifting resonance" appears three times without clear reweighting (−0.3 paraphrase loop). "Steadily adaptive" is stated twice in near-identical phrasing (opening and close), risking scaffold (−0.2). "Scorched testament" recurs but evolves in context, so no penalty there. The final paragraph's "clear testament that cannot be erased" slightly over-explains the glass metaphor already embodied (−0.2 for clarity redundancy). No grammar errors or major filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glass-artist-as-detective synthesis is fresh, and the frost-reading method (craft skill repurposed as forensic tool) feels specific and non-obvious. The furnace-in-canyon reversal (using smuggled charcoal against the smuggler) is earned and conceptually tight. Minor issue: the schoolhouse revelation with children holding the pane risks sentiment, and the councilman's instant pale confession leans toward convenience. The final window with "deliberate empty spaces" transforms the premise into thematic object without heavy-handedness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from opening; drives the frost-reading method, furnace-building choice, and schoolhouse reveal. The artist's craft-specific perception and adaptive trait enable all three major beats and the closure. Removing this character identity would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph two; handled in the canyon retracing (matching mile marks), reappears when charcoal lifts the smeared line, and is physically sealed into the glass pane. The ledger's burned edge becomes the "scorched testament" motif. Used in three distinct beats with evolving function; drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "scorched testament" appears twice and the concept (evidence preserved through fire/survival) structures the glass-sealing tactic. It shapes the protagonist's method at closure but does not constrain earlier choices; mostly thematic rather than tactical. Present in final image but swappable with "preserved proof" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is stated in the opening and closing paragraphs as a label. The furnace-building pivot demonstrates it on the page, but the trait itself is not tested with visible cost—adaptation succeeds without trade-off. Functional but closer to character description than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The retracing action structures the entire middle: canyon journey, frost-reading, camp-ring discovery, furnace-building. Each beat depends on following the ledger route. Removing this action would eliminate the investigative spine and the closure proof. Essential across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("I had learned to read light") and operationalized in the frost-reading beat: "frost drew lacework maps of where bodies had passed." The method enables the key discovery (bomb rehearsal site, smeared line recovery) and justifies the protagonist's success. Mechanics matter and constrain the approach. Present across two beats and referenced in closure reflection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon supplies the investigative theater, the fire ring's charcoal, and the isolation needed to build the furnace. "Drifting resonance" as acoustic property recurs and charges the final callback. The setting enables two key beats (discovery, furnace) and the starlight motif frames the glass pane's reveal. Not merely postcard; constrains and resources the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The phrase "after surviving the attempt" anchors the opening and frames all subsequent action as response. The one-night journey to dawn creates mild urgency. Time does not tighten decisions on the page—no countdown or escalating pressure—but the "after" stance reconfigures the protagonist's purpose. Present in setup and implicit throughout; lyric resonance in closure reflection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is declared explicitly ("to discover purpose in the pauses") and dramatized through the choice to retrace rather than hide, then to build the pane rather than confront directly. The "pause as decision" insight recurs and charges the final window design. Some friction: the line "whoever tried to kill me feared what it completed" externalizes the drive. Present in three beats with visible cost (risk, labor).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears three times as description of canyon acoustics and emotional state. Tone is cohesive—lyric, measured, craft-anchored—and modulates subtly from threat (singed hair) to resolve (schoolhouse) to reflective closure. The phrase itself risks repetition without evolution. Tone charges the final image but does not vary dynamically with pressure peaks; sustained rather than modulated.</comment>
