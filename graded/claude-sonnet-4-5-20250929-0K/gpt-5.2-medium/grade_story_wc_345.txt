<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist "I" remains largely undifferentiated from the collective "we," with minimal interiority or embodied emotion. Mara appears briefly as "foreman" but makes no on-page choices that reveal contradiction or cost. Serren's altruism is told through backstory logs rather than dramatized in scene, and the ghost's motivations are explained rather than shown through conflicted action. No character faces a meaningful internal conflict or demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: chalk messages accumulate into collective effort, the bell returns with reweighted meaning, and the final relay-well opening reconfigures the community. Closure arrives on-page (the window to the nebula opens, Serren brightens, the crew promises to continue the practice), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no character forfeits a live option or suffers a visible loss. The orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs (the grave revelation shifts trust from fear to understanding), but the resolution feels orchestrated by Serren's plan rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating arches, pear orchards, and butterfly garden are vivid and consistent, with sensory details (pollen, milkweed, windblown thorns) woven through action. The brass bell is handled twice (rung to summon Serren, rung again at the relay well) and the chalk messages appear in multiple beats, both constraining the crew's tactics. However, the relay well itself—the closure pivot—remains abstract; we never learn how hands "rebuilt it together" or what cables-across-arches means in spatial terms, weakening the micro-setting test at the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reach the nebula of respite) is signaled early and tightens once when Serren reveals the relay-well route. The work montage ("every beam we raised seemed to attract windblown thorns") gestures at difficulty but remains summary rather than dramatized conflict. The grave-visit beat reweights trust but does not narrow options—the crew's course does not change. At closure, other crews appear conveniently, and the relay opens without on-page resistance or trade-off, undercutting agency and felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—"family was a practice, not a bloodline"—emerges from repeated motifs (chalk, bell, shared labor) and is earned by Serren's sacrificial backstory. The final image (Serren saluting as the crew departs, asking them to leave messages for others) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the phrase "belonging were fuel" and the closing line's direct articulation ("family was a practice") veer toward thematic echo, and the nebula of respite remains more metaphor than lived particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping, and the voice carries a lyric texture ("brambled hope, scratched and snagging"). Psychic distance is consistent, and no mid-paragraph POV leakage occurs. However, the narration withholds the relay-well mechanics and the content of many chalk messages solely to compress exposition, and phrases like "translucent as mist yet steady as a lighthouse" drift into elevated register during a grounded discovery beat. The collective "we" flattens individual perceptual signature, making it difficult to distinguish the narrator's specific way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully ("the air cooled and a pale figure unfolded"), and information density is high in the opening and grave-reveal beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Serren was altruistic in the plainest way, asking nothing, tending our wounds" repeats the altruism already shown in the prior line. Template cadence runs through the work montage ("Mara… became our foreman; Jai kept the fuel cells alive; I learned…"), and the phrase "brambled hope, scratched and snagging" is poetic but functionally redundant. The closing paragraph stacks summary ("as our patched ship rose… Serren saluted… fading into the milkweed") rather than landing on a concrete final image, dulling propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The combination of ghost-as-altruist, floating-arch planet, and chalk-message orchestration is specific and coherent, avoiding stock tropes. However, the core arc—strangers unite, discover helpful ghost, complete communal task, depart—follows a familiar mutual-aid template without a non-obvious turn. The grave-reveal beat (Serren died signaling refugees) deepens trust but does not transform the plot or stakes; the crew's course remains unchanged. The relay-well solution and the convenient arrival of other crews at sunset feel telescoped rather than earned through friction, and the "family as practice" thesis is stated rather than discovered through hindsight synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Serren is present in setup (butterfly garden), development (teaches safe fruit, reveals grave), and ending (stands beside the crew, asks for continuation). The ghost's altruism enables the crew's work by providing chalk routes and knowledge, but Serren makes no on-page choice that narrows options or incurs cost—its role is guide and explainer. The character is functional but largely passive, and removing Serren would require replacing it with another benevolent info source without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bell appears in three beats: Mara rings it to summon Serren, the crew moves it to the relay well, and Mara rings it again to call other crews. Each use advances the plot (first reveals the ghost, second opens the relay), and the bell's sound "threaded through the orchard, calling not spirits but people" reweights its meaning from ghost-signal to community-召集. The object is causally active and shapes two key turns, meeting the high-integration threshold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The nebula is signaled early (Serren describes it as "a pocket of quiet where exhausted ships could drift"), it shapes the dominant stake (reach respite), and the relay window at closure points toward it. However, the nebula remains abstract—no on-page scene shows what respite looks like or costs, and the crew departs without demonstrating how the nebula changes their options. The concept functions as goal-label rather than lived constraint or tactile reward.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Serren's trustworthiness is labeled early ("the directions they offered felt strangely trustworthy") and explained via backstory (the logs show sacrifice), but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page choice with visible cost. The crew follows the chalk routes and accepts Serren's teaching without friction or a moment where trust is tested and forfeited something. The attribute is thematic gloss rather than enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears twice with distinct stakes: the crew reexamines chalk notes each morning (shapes collective coordination) and reexamines the grave logs (shifts fear to trust, altering their emotional stance). The second use triggers the story's key emotional turn, making the action causally central. However, the first use is summary ("arguing and laughing as if they were letters") rather than dramatized, and neither instance narrows tactical options in a way that could not be achieved by "read" or "study."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chalk messages are signaled in the opening ("white chalk lines on the deserted sidewalks"), appear in multiple beats (morning notes guide the crew, final plea asks them to continue the practice), and the method shapes the plot's key mechanic (Serren orchestrates collective effort through dawn messages). The crew's reliance on chalk routes constrains their coordination tactics, and the closing promise ("keep chalk and bell together") charges the final image. The method is causally indispensable and present in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are signaled early and appear in setup, development (the relay well lies "beneath one of the hovering arches"), and ending (the arches "carried our shared labor into the stars"). The setting supplies the relay-well resource and the windblown thorns that complicate beam-raising, altering the crew's work tactics. However, the arches' floating property is never leveraged as a puzzle or constraint—cables are "hauled across the empty air" without spatial friction—so the setting's unique physics remain decorative at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe is present in the opening ("tight months of rationing") and implied in "years" of Serren's chalk messages, but no clock tightens decisions. The work montage compresses unnamed duration ("each morning we reexamined"), and the relay opens "at sunset" without time pressure forcing a trade-off. The attribute frames backstory but does not constrain present tactics or escalate the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Serren's motivation (orchestrate collective effort) is stated and demonstrated through chalk routes and the relay-well plan. The desire shapes multiple beats (morning coordination, the bell-calling at closure) and the ghost's inability to "lift stone or weld metal" adds friction. However, the motivation is never conflicted—Serren has no competing want, and the crew's acceptance is frictionless—so the element remains functional rather than charged with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone is signaled explicitly ("brambled hope, scratched and snagging") and modulates from fear ("questions about why a ghost cared") to trust (the grave reveal) to collective uplift (the relay opening). Phrases like "dry leaves" and "star-scented window" sustain the lyric-hopeful register. However, the bramble metaphor is stated rather than enacted in scene pressure, and the closing beat ("as our patched ship rose under the thorny constellations") leans into uplift without sustaining the snagging friction, flattening tonal complexity at closure.</comment>
