<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is clear and consistent—protection through destruction evolving toward revelation—but her interiority leans heavily on declarative summary ("the arsonist in her begging for flame, yet the archivist in her hands wanted preservation") rather than embodied contradiction in action. The relationship with Miko is told through backstory and symbols rather than dramatized friction that alters present choices. Micro-choices exist (scraping the canvas, copying the reel) but feel more like puzzle-solving than decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final shift from match to broadcast feels unmotivated by on-page struggle; the renunciation of burning arrives as assertion rather than earned stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Sera follows a trail of artistic clues that deepen her understanding of Miko's message, culminating in a choice to broadcast rather than burn. Orientation is clear early (ash flats, ridge, archive). The closure unit—carrying evidence to the broadcast tower—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("her love for him felt like a volcano turned outward") rather than felt through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. The trail structure coheres, yet the final turn lacks causal pressure: nothing on the page shows why she chooses broadcast over destruction except Miko's instruction, which functions as external direction rather than protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is vividly realized: obsidian steps, stone tablets, polymer reels, lamps that wake, mosaic footprints, clay hands. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Sera's urgency. The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining her decryption choice (scraping the canvas) and charging the final image by linking past promise to present action. Spatial choreography is clean through the descent and chamber sequence. The archive supplies the reel that shapes her decision, meeting the Q3 gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue a forgotten promise and reveal regime lies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the trail (bent bird, charcoal spiral, vandalized portrait, mosaic footprints, clay hands), but the escalation is puzzle-解答 rather than choice-driven tightening. The climax (finding the reel, copying it, broadcasting) lacks on-page cost: Sera does not forfeit a live option or face a trade-off. The instruction "start burning what keeps them blind" is external direction, not protagonist agency under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (understanding Miko's message), but the final act feels more like completion of a treasure hunt than a decision that narrows options with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—protection versus revelation, fire as both destruction and illumination—emerges organically from Sera's arc and the archive's symbolism. The tapestry fragment, spiral motif, and final broadcast offer a non-literal answer: truth-telling as a new form of fire. "PROMISES DO NOT BURN, NOW KEEP YOURS" and the reel's recorded names charge the ending without moralizing. Subtext operates in Miko's absence and the tar-masked portraits. The final line ("light the way home for everyone still reading in the dark") borders on thematic statement but stays anchored in image. Minor slip: "her love for him felt like a volcano turned outward" asserts meaning rather than letting the broadcast action carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Sera; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("analytically intuitive, able to feel a pattern in her ribs and then prove it with numbers") and shapes her decryption method. Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into exposition ("the courage to reveal herself"). Filter verbs and declarative interiority ("she understood he was asking") flatten immediacy in key beats. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("eyes precise, mouth soft, hands stained with soot"), but peak moments lean on summary ("her chest roared, the old arsonist in her begging for flame") rather than showing the conflict through action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is competent with selective sensory detail and varied syntax. Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or atmosphere. However, declarative summary recurs in emotional beats ("the thought cracked her throat with shame," "tenderness surged like magma") where embodied action would sharpen pressure. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally mixed ("love felt like a volcano turned outward"). Template stems appear in the trail sequence ("Then came the third sign," "Behind the canvas a narrow drawer"). No loops or major clarity issues. Proofreading is clean. The final line's metaphor ("light the way home for everyone still reading in the dark") is evocative but slightly over-explained by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist librarian decrypts a trail of art to find hidden regime evidence—synthesizes familiar elements (oppressive state, censorship, buried archive) with specific detail (lending card ledgers, tapestry fragment cipher, tar-masked self-portraits). The trail structure is purposeful and the archive setting is fresh. The moral calculus (burning to protect versus preserving to reveal) offers non-obvious complexity. Transformation is visible: the arsonist becomes broadcaster, inverting her weapon. Minor derivative notes: the hidden-message treasure hunt and regime-forgery premise echo common templates. The emotional arc (love as guiding force) is handled with specificity that avoids cliché, elevating the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sera's identity as arsonist frames her guilt, shapes her hands-on approach (scraping the canvas, copying the reel), and drives the thematic tension between destruction and preservation. She appears in setup, middle (archive exploration), and payoff (broadcast decision). However, her final choice to broadcast rather than burn is instructed by Miko's message rather than driven by on-page internal conflict; she does not face a live trade-off or cost. The arsonist attribute charges theme but does not constrain a pivotal beat with visible price. Swappable with "regime dissident" or "fugitive activist" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in setup (Miko gives it to her), middle (aligns with tower spiral, unlocks the seam, reveals cipher in clay hands), and payoff (used to scrape the canvas and reveal Miko's message). It enables multiple choices and its spiral motif recurs with reweighted meaning. Causal pressure is strong: without it, she cannot decode the trail or access the hidden letters. The fragment is handled physically across beats and is irreplaceable in its specific patterned role. Cost connection is present but indirect (the fragment reveals a demand, not a sacrifice). Scores in the essential range but not indispensable; a generic "cipher key" could substitute with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is central: the tar-masked tower portrait unlocks the seam (setup and middle), and the canvas portrait in the chamber reveals Miko's hidden message (payoff). It shapes Sera's understanding and tactics, driving the scraping action that discloses "I KEPT MY WORD, NOW KEEP YOURS." The concept is irreplaceable in its dual function (lock and revelation) and charges the theme of identity and transformation. However, the portrait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it delivers information rather than forcing a trade-off. Strong causal role but closure impact is informational, not decisional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once in exposition ("able to feel a pattern in her ribs and then prove it with numbers") and demonstrated in her mapping of artworks and decoding of the clay-hand cipher. It enables her to follow the trail but does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; the trait is purely positive and could be replaced with "observant" or "methodical" without changing beats. No on-page moment where intuition conflicts with analysis or where the trait forecloses an option. Functional but swappable, trending low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Portray" appears thematically (Miko portrays Sera and himself in the self-portraits) but does not drive a major turn. The portraits are objects Sera discovers and decodes; the act of portrayal itself occurs off-page before the story begins. Sera does not portray anyone on the page, nor does the concept of portrayal constrain her choices. The story could function with "conceal a message in art" or "encode evidence" without structural loss. Present in theme but not causal in escalation or closure; ornamental to the plot's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The trail (bent copper bird, charcoal spiral, tar-masked portrait, mosaic footprints, clay hands) structures the entire middle section, signaled early and driving every beat of Sera's journey. Each piece narrows her path and reveals the next step; the method is irreplaceable and its mechanics matter (alignment, counting, cipher). The trail delivers her to the reel and the final instruction, shaping the closure. High causal pressure and beat involvement. Cost is indirect: the trail demands decryption effort but does not impose a sacrifice. Scores high for indispensability to structure and closure linkage, falling short of top band only because the method does not force a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive is present in setup (buried under the ridge), dominates the middle (obsidian steps, lamps, tablets, reels, chambers), and supplies the payoff (the reel Sera broadcasts). It constrains her physically (descent, navigation) and provides the resource (evidence) that alters her final choice. Spatial detail is vivid and purposeful. The archive's identity as a "lost civilization" repository charges the theme (archives survive fires) and the closure (preservation versus destruction). Strong integration across all three gates, high causal pressure, and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable—any hidden evidence cache could substitute—but deeply woven into structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" appears in the opening line as backstory anchor but does not constrain present action. No on-page clock tightens decisions; Sera explores the archive at her own pace with no urgency or pursuit. The timeframe could be "during exile" or "while hiding" without altering beats. Setup is present, but middle and payoff show no temporal pressure or cost tied to being off-grid. Functional context but swappable and non-causal; trends low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sera's motivation—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is established early (Miko's instruction, the tapestry fragment) and drives her journey through the trail to the archive. The promise is tested in the chamber when she must choose between burning and broadcasting, and the final act (carrying evidence to the tower) fulfills it. However, the promise is more external direction than internal friction; Sera's conflict (arsonist versus archivist) is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. The motivation shapes beats and closure but lacks on-page struggle or trade-off that would elevate it to essential. Mid-high band for causal presence, capped by low dramatization of conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is signaled in the opening ("hands that still wanted to hold someone gently") and recurs in reflection ("tenderness surged like magma") and the final image ("her love for him felt like a volcano turned outward"). The tone is coherent and modulates from guilt and shame to resolve and illumination. However, the tone is often asserted through metaphor rather than embodied in action or rhythm under pressure. The final line ("light the way home") extends the volcanic image but remains declarative. Present across setup, middle, and payoff with thematic charge, but the tone does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it colors rather than drives. Mid band for coherence and reprise, lacks causal necessity.</comment>
