<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mina's "logical dreamer" nature is embodied through concrete actions—repairing calibration formulas, encoding patterns in prime numbers—and her motivation to puzzle out hope drives micro-choices throughout. Interiority is specific and grounded in her methodical approach, though emotional embodiment occasionally slips toward conceptual label ("serene upheaval" as descriptor rather than sensation). The ensemble-across-timelines realization provides genuine internal complexity, and her climb to town with the gauge represents agency with cost (leaving solitary experimentation for communal risk). Minor voice convergence in the town-gathering sequence slightly flattens her distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes clear orientation (grotto, Mina, collapsing town, night experiment) by the opening paragraph. Causal linkage holds: balloons → gauge readings → chalk marks → ensemble realization → refined formula → updraft → communal lift. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the basket ride aligns timelines and demonstrates that "hope, like lift, could be computed and shared," with the conceptual cost that she cannot know "which world would be saved." One meaningful tightening (gauge measuring sideways units, then stabilizing with collaborative input) sufficiently escalates under a Causal lens. The parallel-timeline mechanism arrives slightly late (~30% mark) but is earned by prior gauge behavior and drives all subsequent beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: tide-polished stone, sea breathing through it, tidewater glow, wet sand for writing. The altitude gauge functions as micro-setting, constraining Mina's method (she repairs its calibration, reads needle angles, translates sideways units). The balloons' mirrored decorations and their interaction with offshore updraft directly shape the climactic canopy design. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (cavern ledge → beach mouth → town → basket). Sensory selection is filtered through Mina's investigative focus, though occupational depth (balloonist mechanics) remains light, appropriate to length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled immediately: Mina seeks equations for hope before "despair turned habitual" in a politely collapsing town. Pressure escalates through three balloon launches, each yielding new data (flashing mirrors, sideways units, ensemble proof, stable updraft), and the protagonist's agency drives every turn—she revises formulas, encodes patterns, climbs to town, and co-creates the canopy. The final basket ascent forecloses her solitary grotto work and commits the community to shared risk, with visible cost: "she did not know which world would be saved." One minor slip: the town's gathering feels slightly convenient (drawn by rumors), though Mina's demonstration with gauge and pages earns their shift from "polite collapse" to action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action: hope as a computable, shareable force tested through trial balloons and ensemble collaboration across timelines. The altitude gauge measuring "possibility" rather than air, and the equation predicting lift "that could support more than balloons," operate as earned metaphor grounded in Mina's scientific method. The ending image—"hope, like lift, could be computed and shared"—risks mild abstraction but is anchored by the prior particulars (prime-number sequences, decorated patterns, parallel-timeline proofs). The piece resists tidy morals: the uncertainty of "which world would be saved" introduces meaningful ambiguity. Subtext operates in the town's "polite collapse" and gardens "drying in orderly rows," implying systemic despair without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with Mina's perceptual signature evident in technical diction ("calibration formula," "coefficients," "term for divergence") and methodical observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate during gauge readings and ensemble realization, pulling back for the town gathering and basket ascent. Free indirect style is clean, though a few filter verbs ("she understood the method," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-stakes beats. Voice is distinct and consistent, with syntax reflecting Mina's logical-dreamer mindset. The phrase "hope, like lift, could be computed and shared" in the final line risks didacticism but reads as earned synthesis rather than authorial intrusion. No dialogue present; scoring applies narration only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. The "sea breathe through stone like a slow engine" and "mirrors flashed like calm lightning" offer fresh, apt images. Minor scaffold appears in repeated "she + verb" stems across the middle section (four consecutive sentences beginning "She tied," "She read," "She understood," "She stayed"), creating mild template cadence (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and legible, though "serene upheaval, a quiet shaking in her ribs" leans slightly abstract for a peak emotional beat. Mechanics and tense remain consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—trial balloons encoding data across parallel timelines to crowdsource equations for collective uplift—offers a non-obvious synthesis of scientific method, magical realism, and communal resilience. The altitude gauge measuring "sideways" units and chalk marks in alternate handwriting provide specific, memorable inflections. The core concept transforms familiar hope-in-crisis material through Mina's particular approach (prime-number sequences, mirrored decorations, calibration repair). Risk-taking in the parallel-timeline layer heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative element: the collapsing town and solitary inventor seeking communal salvation echo familiar templates, though the multi-timeline mechanic and trial-balloon method provide sufficient freshness. The ending avoids neat resolution, maintaining tension in "she did not know which world would be saved."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mina as "logical dreamer" drives all key turns: she initiates the grotto experiment, repairs the gauge calibration, decodes the ensemble proof, revises formulas with a divergence term, climbs to town with her findings, and co-creates the canopy design. Her observational rigor enables the multi-timeline discovery, and her decision to share the method (rather than remain solitary) forecloses her initial plan with visible cost. Setup early (opening paragraph), development across all three balloon launches, and payoff in the basket ascent where "she felt the other timelines rise with her." Causal pressure is high; the trait is irreplaceable and specific. Scores in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The altitude gauge appears in the opening paragraph ("lay her grandfather's balloonist's altitude gauge, brass-ringed and fogged"), is repaired and calibrated by Mina, used to read all three balloon launches (needle twitches, sideways units, steadying), and accompanies her to town where it persuades the gathered people. Its impossible behavior (measuring "not air but possibility," counting sideways, averaging parallel results) is causally central to the ensemble realization and formula revision. The gauge is handled, consulted, and reweighted across multiple beats, and its presence in the town demonstration directly enables the communal shift. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; irreplaceability and causal pressure high. Nears indispensable tier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" structure the entire narrative arc: Mina's plan is to "launch trial balloons from the beach mouth of the cavern, track their rise, and let the numbers tell her what the weather hid." All three launches (first cluster with mirrors, second with spiral sequences, third in prime numbers) generate escalating data that refine her equations and reveal the parallel-timeline ensemble. The concept shapes tactics (decoration as encoding, pattern-matching across worlds) and stakes (whether hope can be measured and shared). The final canopy repeats "Mina's coded patterns so the wind would recognize the design," directly linking method to climax. Setup immediate, development across all beats, payoff in the communal ascent. Irreplaceability and causal centrality are maximal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is introduced early ("her mind stayed lucidly watchful, even as sleep tried to flood the cavern") and reprised ("She stayed lucidly watchful until dawn"), framing Mina's sustained experimental focus through the night. The trait enables her to detect the gauge's impossible behavior, notice the chalk marks, and maintain iterative refinement across multiple launches. However, the attribute functions more as mood/state descriptor than active constraint with visible cost; removing "lucidly" would not break story logic, as her methodical observation could stand alone. Setup and payoff present; development implied in her sustained attention but not dramatized as a tradeo ff or struggle (e.g., fatigue vs. clarity). Scores in the shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is the story's explicit goal ("the act would revitalize them all") and outcome, delivered through the communal basket ascent that lifts "the canopy, the baskets, and finally their laughter." The action traces directly to Mina's encoded patterns, the predicted updraft, and the ensemble-across-timelines collaboration. It redefines the town's trajectory from "polite collapse" to shared risk and hope. Setup in the opening (Mina seeks to prevent habitual despair), development through the formula work, and payoff in the final paragraph where "the act would revitalize them all, because hope, like lift, could be computed and shared." Causal centrality high; swapping for a near-synonym (e.g., "renew," "restore") would slightly weaken the biological/energetic resonance but story logic holds. Essential-across-beats tier.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with decorations" is introduced in the first balloon launch ("tied thin balloons to shells and bits of mirror, creating patterns with decorations so each ascent would write a distinct curve"), used methodically in the second ("decorated in spiral sequences") and third launches ("prime numbers, each balloon tagged with a shell, a bead, or a shard of glass"), and directly transferred to the climactic canopy ("stitched a canopy from old sailcloth and festival ribbons, repeating Mina's coded patterns so the wind would recognize the design"). The method is both signaled early and causally essential: patterns encode information that crosses timelines and summons the stable updraft. Mechanics matter (specific decorations, sequence types) and shape all attempts. Setup, development, payoff all clear; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "tide-polished grotto" is established in the opening line, provides sensory anchoring (sea breathing, tidewater glow, wet sand for writing), and supplies the physical site for all three balloon launches. The chalk marks appearing on the grotto's rock wall signal the parallel-timeline connection. The cavern's beach mouth serves as the launch point and frames the transition to the offshore updraft. The setting enables Mina's solitary experimentation and supplies resources (sand for formula revision, stone for chalk proofs). Setup immediate, development through all experimental beats, payoff in the transition to town and the updraft prediction tied to "just offshore." The grotto constrains her location and method but does not force a tactical dilemma or charge the final image as strongly as the gauge or balloons. Scores in the essential-across-beats band, lower tier.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" becomes legible at ~30% (the chalk marks "from a Mina who had learned different symbols," gauge "averaging their results"). The concept drives the second half: Mina realizes "failure in one world could be corrected by another," adds a divergence term, and receives refinements from the ensemble. The parallel structure shapes tactics (encoding patterns for cross-timeline communication) and the ending stakes ("she did not know which world would be saved, only that the act would revitalize them all"). Setup delayed but functional, development through formula revision and third launch, payoff in the basket ascent where "she felt the other timelines rise with her, aligned for a breath." Causal role solid but the timeline layer arrives late (−0.3 for late setup). Scores in the shapes-one-key-turn to essential band, mid-tier.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope before despair turned habitual" is stated explicitly in the opening and dramatized through Mina's iterative experimental choices: repairing the gauge, launching balloons, encoding patterns, revising formulas, and ultimately sharing the method with the town. The motivation is conflicted in that she begins alone ("fled" the town's collapse) but the ensemble realization and communal demonstration reveal an implicit need for connection. The friction between solitary calculation and shared risk provides pressure, and the final basket ride embodies the synthesis: hope computed and shared, with the cost of uncertainty. Setup immediate, development through all beats, payoff in the ending image. Irreplaceability and causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is instantiated early ("the idea brought serene upheaval, a quiet shaking in her ribs") and maintained through the ending ("aligned for a breath"). The tone balances Mina's methodical calm (logical formulas, patient iteration) with transformative stakes (collapsing town, parallel timelines, communal ascent). Diction choices—"politely collapsing," "calm lightning," "decisive" gust, "serene upheaval"—sustain the oxymoronic pairing. The tone charges the final image: quiet certainty amid existential uncertainty, and the laughter lifting in the baskets conveys upheaval without chaos. Setup early, modulation through pressure beats (gauge anomalies, chalk marks, town shift), and payoff in the ending's poised uncertainty. Coherence and thematic resonance high; the tone is integral to the story's conceptual design.</comment>
