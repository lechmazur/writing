<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is defined by rich sensory gift and steady purpose, but the story compresses her arc—planting, tending, pruning, and distributing fruit—into summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on poetic assertion ("she believed rebellion could be gentle") rather than contradictory impulses colliding in scene. The final choice to prune the tree into "an open canopy" gestures toward cost but the renunciation or trade-off is told, not shown through lost options. Secondary characters (neighbors, clerks) are receivers rather than sources of friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the seed's growth cycle and the alignment deadline, culminating in the fruit's distribution and the tree's final pruning. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final line—"certain that beauty was the safest form of defiance"—reweights the gentle rebellion premise with undeniable pressure, and the open canopy image charges the ending. Orientation anchors cleanly (greenhouse, Mira, seed) by the first third. Cost is conceptual and felt (pruning away Ministry propaganda, risking neighbors) but the final pruning's specific price—what Mira forecloses—is asserted rather than made concrete on the page, reducing the closure's bite by −0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly realized ("broken glass made good skylights," "bent ribs," "collapsed rail yard") and actively shapes Mira's work: the cracked terracotta pot, the dead vines she prunes for light, the rafters the tree tries to tangle. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a chef's idiom (compost from burned books, honey-glazed roots, nettle disinfectant). The greenhouse's spatial logic remains stable across the timeline, and the three-moon alignment light floods the space at closure. The recurring pruning motif charges the final image when Mira shapes the tree "into an open canopy," making the micro-setting indispensable to both tactics and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform the Ministry's control tool into a memory-restoration aid before the alignment. The tightening is signaled (alignment approaches, fruit swells) and one meaningful turn occurs when Mira prunes away propaganda-tasting shoots, narrowing the fruit's effects. The final distribution and pruning impose cost (exposure to patrols, neighbors' vulnerability) but the escalation unfolds through summary rather than on-page reversals that test Mira's commitment. The coincidence of finding the seed in the botanist's pocket complicates setup but does not resolve; Mira's agency at closure (pruning into an open canopy) is visible, though the specific price she pays—what she gives up—remains implicit rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pruning motif: choosing what to save and what to cut, gentle rebellion versus erasure. The knowledge fruit literalizes memory and synaptic change without meta-commentary; Mira's whispered jokes to branches and her "plain voice" teaching embody informal wisdom rather than stating it. The final image—"beauty was the safest form of defiance"—reweights prior material (burned books, banned songs, Ministry badges) without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question of how to resist gently. No thematic echo in prompt language mars the closure. Subtext operates in Mira's choice of which shoots to prune and the quiet transformation of neighbors, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly throughout with no head-hopping; Mira's perceptual signature (chef's taste memories, grandmother's wisdom, listening to measure change "the way she measured salt") is distinct and purposeful. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("synaptic plasticity," "once-in-a-lifetime crossing") that reads expository rather than voice-rooted, though the context (botanist's memory) partially motivates it. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect blends smoothly. Dialogue is minimal (whispered jokes to branches) and voice-appropriate. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the alignment and opening at closure. Filter verbs are light; thought formatting is consistent. The prose texture is specific and controlled under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and the prose advances story and atmosphere efficiently. Sentence variety supports rhythm and several vivid anchors land ("three moons lined up like coins on black velvet," "the taste of regret and diagrams"). However, runs of identical syntactic stems appear: "Each morning she pruned… each cut felt," "she cut away… she kept," "a woman remembered… a boy remembered… a clerk remembered." Template cadence across three consecutive lines in the final third triggers −0.5. Minor scaffold ("the botanist's stew had tasted of regret and diagrams, and in the aftertaste Mira understood") pads causality. Stock metaphor "small, luminous garden" at closure dulls precision. Proofreading is clean; no loops or pronoun drift. The accumulation of patterns across peak beats caps high-band entry at 8.7 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of taste-memory chef, knowledge fruit, and pruning-as-rebellion is specific and non-obvious; removing any element would break the story's logic. The greenhouse setting and synaptic plasticity anchor transform familiar dystopia tropes through tactile detail (compost from burned books, nettle disinfectant, shoots that taste of propaganda). Emotional truth (neighbors' quiet recovery of banned songs and lost faces) avoids generic templates. The ending resists the explain-everything trap, offering a charged image rather than a moral. Risk is present in the unconventional pruning-as-climax structure, though the arc leans toward lyricism over high-stakes conflict. Proximity check: no famous echoes detected. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: Mira's taste-memory gift is established in the opening lines and defines her perception throughout. Development: she tastes the botanist's regret and diagrams to understand the seed's purpose (middle beat), then tastes pruned shoots to distinguish propaganda from grief and joy (second middle beat). Payoff: at closure, her sensory gift enables the final pruning decision, though the act itself is told rather than shown through a specific tasted choice. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait shapes two distinct beats and the ending, but the final pruning could function with generic chef skills. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, swappability −0.5 (a botanist or gardener could prune without tasting). Total neighborhood: 6.7–6.9; round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: the seed is found in the botanist's pocket and planted by the first third. Development: Mira feeds it compost, prunes surrounding vines for light, uses its dew in tea (multiple middle beats); the seed grows into a tree whose branches tangle rafters, and she prunes shoots based on their taste. Payoff: the first fruit swells at alignment and Mira slices it for distribution; she performs a final pruning to shape the tree "into an open canopy," directly charging the closure image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows options via pruning) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6, cost connection (pruning away propaganda with visible result) +0.4. Total neighborhood: 7.5–7.7; round to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "gentle rebellion" is named explicitly in the opening third and frames Mira's plan. Development: the concept shapes her tactics—secret dinners, pruning with jokes, teaching without force—across multiple beats. Payoff: the final line declares "beauty was the safest form of defiance," restating the concept rather than dramatizing a cost or choice it imposes. The concept functions more as theme than as a constraint that narrows options on the page; Mira never faces a test where gentleness conflicts with efficacy. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, thematic resonance +0.4, ornamental closure mention −0.6 (label restated, not reweighted through action), swappability −0.4 (could substitute "quiet resistance"). Total neighborhood: 6.3–6.5; round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "informally wise" is declared early ("the kind of woman who quoted her grandmother while sharpening a knife"). Development: the trait colors her voice (plain explanations, jokes to branches, "listening" to measure change) but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost; wisdom enables her moves without friction. Payoff: at closure, she teaches in a "plain voice" and shapes the tree with certainty, reaffirming the trait without a trade-off (e.g., formal knowledge she lacks causing a mistake). Early signal +0.4, beat involvement (one) +0.4, label-only −0.5, no on-page cost −0.6. Total neighborhood: 5.7–5.9; round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: pruning is introduced when Mira clears dead vines for the seedling's light, framed as "choosing what to let go and what to save." Development: she prunes the tree with shears and nettle disinfectant, cutting away propaganda-tasting shoots while keeping grief-and-joy branches (two distinct middle beats). Payoff: the final pruning "shaped the tree into an open canopy," directly charging the closure image and literalizing the gentle-rebellion theme. The action is irreplaceable; substituting "watering" or "harvesting" would collapse the thematic spine. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows fruit's effects) +1.3, closure linkage (shapes final image) +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection (cuts away options) +0.5. Total neighborhood: 8.1–8.3; round to 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "synaptic plasticity" is named and explained in the botanist's memory by the first third, establishing the fruit's mechanism. Development: the method is mentioned when Mira considers the fruit's teaching effect, but its mechanics do not constrain her choices (she does not adjust tactics based on plasticity limits). Payoff: at closure, "bite by bite, synaptic plasticity did its quiet work" summarizes the fruit's effect on neighbors; the phrase appears but the mechanism does not shape the ending's pressure. Early signal +0.5, one beat (closure mention) +0.4, summary-only −0.6, ornamental closure use −0.5, register drift (scientific term in peak beat) −0.2. Total neighborhood: 5.1–5.3; round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: the rusted greenhouse is anchored in the opening line with vivid detail (broken glass skylights, bent ribs, collapsed rail yard). Development: the space supplies resources (cracked pot, rafters for the tree to tangle, light Mira clears by pruning vines) and shelters the secret dinners; on the alignment night, it fills with pale moonlight that triggers the fruit's ripening. Payoff: "inside the rusted greenhouse people traded stories and planted seeds in tin cups," and Mira's final act occurs within this frame. The setting is indispensable; removing it collapses the story's spatial logic and thematic container. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (light, shelter) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection (exposure to patrols outside) +0.4. Total neighborhood: 8.3–8.5; round to 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: the celestial alignment is introduced in the botanist's memory by the first third, establishing a deadline. Development: "as the alignment approached" signals rising urgency; the tree grows in sync with the timeline. Payoff: "On the night the three moons lined up like coins on black velvet, the greenhouse filled with pale light, and the first knowledge fruit swelled"—the alignment triggers the fruit's ripening and anchors the climactic distribution. The timeframe is irreplaceable; without it, the fruit's emergence loses causal motivation. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (deadline tightens tactics) +0.9, closure linkage (triggers fruit) +1.1, irreplaceability +0.6. Total neighborhood: 7.0–7.2; round to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: Mira's desire "to create something beautiful from the ruins" is stated explicitly in the opening third. Development: the motivation drives her planting, feeding compost from burned books, and pruning; she "wanted to create something beautiful" rather than erase questions. Payoff: the final line—"certain that beauty was the safest form of defiance"—restates the motivation without dramatizing a friction between beauty and efficacy or a cost beauty imposes. The desire is told and thematic rather than tested by competing wants. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, thematic linkage +0.6, told-only friction −0.7, closure restatement without new cost −0.4. Total neighborhood: 6.5–6.7; round to 6.6.</comment>
