<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete (crystallize recognition for goodbye) and embodied through her ritual actions with ash and charcoal. Her backstory with her father provides clear causal grounding for her present choices. However, the emotional arc remains largely static—she enters wary, performs her work, and exits wary without a visible internal shift or cost that forecloses a path. The inspector's moment of recognition affects him, not her, leaving her agency and transformation unclear at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens: Lira performs her portrait ritual under the pressure of inspectors arriving. Orientation is delayed—the curfew, her trade, and the gallery's purpose emerge gradually across the first third without clear spatial grounding until the back room. The closure offers a micro-turn (inspectors leave, she begins the next portrait) but lacks a decisive change or visible cost to Lira herself; the emotional crystallization happens *to the inspector*, not through her agency. The ending reads as repetition (she will continue) rather than reconfiguration, and no felt price is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery is vivid and purposeful, with perspective lines that guide Lira's work and create thematic resonance. The rocking chair returns as a charged object that interrupts the inspector's reach. Sensory detail (powdered charcoal like a night sky, porcelain mask chime, river smell) is filtered through Lira's professional attention. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the relationship between the white-walled corridor, the back room, and the convergence point where she pins the paper could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the portrait without arrest—is signaled and sustained. The inspectors' arrival provides external pressure, and the rocking chair's groan creates a micro-reversal that buys Lira time. However, escalation is thin: she answers questions carefully, the inspectors leave without taking the work, and she resumes. No tightening of options or visible trade-off is dramatized; her careful truths succeed without cost, and the inspector's softening happens independently of her choices. One meaningful deepening is present (the inspector recognizes his own father) but it does not narrow *her* options or force a renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mirage-of-safety theme is woven through image and action: Lira's distrust, her father's broken promise, the inspectors' praise of illusion, and the scattered ash as testimony. The final image of scattering ash "into the gallery's vanishing light" reweights the premise without stating a moral. Yet the emotional crystallization occurs in the inspector, not Lira, and the ending's thematic claim—that she "realized the emotion she sought had crystallized in a stranger"—edges toward exposition rather than letting the moment resonate on its own. The theme is coherent but leans on articulation where silence would sharpen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira with consistent perceptual bias (professional attention to clues, distrust of safety). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("trade as a charcoal portrait ash scatterer" is compressed but legible). However, several lines slip into elevated diction that strains Lira's lexicon under pressure: "stubborn way of letting the dead testify," "somber marvel," "consensus reality" phrasing in the inspector's moment. The dialogue ("it was an exercise in vanishing points") reads slightly expository. Psychic distance widens at the inspector's recognition without clear filter, creating a brief POV leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high, and figurative language (night sky of charcoal, mask chime, mirage) is purposeful. However, several sentences loop or restate: "safety was always a mirage, shimmering until you stepped on it" is then echoed by "safety was still a mirage" at the end without added pressure. The phrase "weaves truth carefully by drawing what grief allowed and leaving the rest in deliberate blur" uses present tense amid past-tense narration without clear effect. Template stems appear in the middle third ("She [verb]… She [verb]…"). The closure sentence is dense but syntactically tangled, slowing propulsion at a key moment. Clarity holds, but momentum dips in the reflective middle passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of disappeared-persons portraiture, ash as evidence, and the vanishing-point gallery is specific and non-obvious. The mirage-of-safety motif and the rocking chair as witness/warning are earned through prior material. The emotional turn—recognition in a stranger rather than the client—offers a fresh inflection on the grief-portrait premise. The piece takes structural risk with heavy backstory interleaving and succeeds in maintaining coherence. Proximity check: the porcelain-mask breath and ash-scattering carry fresh sensory detail, and the vanishing-point frame is purposeful rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's profession is signaled early, shapes her middle choices (reading clues, adding ash, answering inspectors), and frames the ending. However, her final action (begin the next portrait) is repetition rather than transformation. Her choices create beats but no key turn that alters her own stakes or tactics. The emotional crystallization happens *to* the inspector; Lira observes but does not change course.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The porcelain mask appears in three moments: worn on arrival, "let its jagged reflection remind her to stay unreadable" when inspectors approach, and implied removal when she speaks. It reinforces her self-protection but does not constrain a choice with visible cost or return with reweighted meaning at closure. The mask is atmospheric but functionally swappable with any symbol of concealment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mirage of safety is signaled early, embedded in Lira's bone-deep distrust, her father's broken promise, and the gallery's illusory perspective. It shapes her wary tactics (careful truths, unreadable mask) and charges the final image ("safety was still a mirage, scattered… into the vanishing light"). The concept drives thematic pressure and recurs at closure, though it does not narrow her options on the page—she was always going to continue.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is demonstrated when Lira answers inspectors with "careful truths, only what the folder proved" and draws "what grief allowed." It enables her evasion but the cost is implicit rather than visible—no moment shows her weighing a fuller truth against danger. The trait is functional but does not create an on-page tradeoff that alters her ending choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Powdering charcoal is dramatized in a vivid beat ("rose in the lamplight… like a night sky being made") and precedes the portrait's completion. It is Lira's signature method and frames her ritual. However, it does not create a reversal or redefine her options—she powders, then adds ash, then the inspectors arrive. The action is profession-specific but swappable in sequence with other preparation steps without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Incomplete information" (torn sleeve, report card, rumor) is signaled early, guides Lira's interpretive work ("the incomplete clues guided her hand"), and is echoed when she tells inspectors the folder proved only partial truths. It shapes one beat (her drawing process) but does not constrain later tactics or charge the ending. The method is thematic but functionally marginal to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery is introduced in the opening line, provides the perspective lines where Lira pins her work, and supplies the closing image ("scattered… into the gallery's vanishing light"). The rocking chair (part of the gallery's back room) interrupts the inspector's reach—a small but decisive spatial contribution. The setting drives two beats and charges the thematic closure, making it essential to the piece's coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" appears only in the penultimate paragraph, late for setup. It marks the inspectors' departure but does not tighten earlier decisions or create a live clock. The rocking chair's motion matters (it groans, interrupting the inspector), but "slows to a stop" is ornamental timing rather than a constraint that alters Lira's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation—"to crystallize a fleeting emotion, the instant a loved one recognizes a face"—is stated early and demonstrated in her ritual. The ending delivers recognition, but it occurs in the inspector, not the client. Lira's friction is implied (risk vs. mission) but not dramatized as a difficult choice with visible cost. The motivation guides beats but does not create on-page conflict between wants and obstacles that she must navigate at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is coherent across the piece: Lira's quiet ritualism, the lyric imagery (night sky of charcoal, mask chime), the inspectors' pause at the chair's groan, and the inspector's softened face. The tone modulates subtly—wary in the opening, focused during the drawing, tense at the inspectors' entry, quietly charged at the end. It supports escalation and integrates with the mirage theme, charging the final image of scattering ash into vanishing light.</comment>
