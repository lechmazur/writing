<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sel's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction remains largely abstract—the "moonstruck dreamer" feels more archetypal than particular. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("hands shook with cold and awe"), but peak moments lean on poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to unlock the vault is signaled throughout yet lacks visible cost; Sel stands "exhausted" but no path is foreclosed with felt consequence. The renunciation or endurance that would earn Stasis is gestured at but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through repeated meteor observation and the astrolabe's growing urgency, culminating in the vault's opening and dust release. Orientation anchors who and where early (Sel under the archway), though "Lumen Gate" and "unwritten calendar" remain abstract. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the final image (Sel under the aurora, city answering) crystallizes restored creativity with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (exhaustion, extended vigil) but not sharp; the specific trade-off or foreclosed path remains oblique, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains Sel's action (resting beneath it to match the sky's pulse, using it as a spatial anchor for the vault). The astrolabe—a tool—charges the final image and enables the meteor-tracing method. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("bruise of green fire," "sour hush"), though some phrases ("shadowed rapture," "remembered stardust") repeat without evolving. Spatial choreography is clear across the archway, streets, and vault. The unwritten calendar adds texture but remains conceptually vague, diluting practical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: each night's meteor observation tightens resolve ("murmurs grew louder, almost impatient"), and the elders' "unsaid confession" deepens urgency. The vault's opening is the single meaningful tightening that narrows options (Sel commits to the spiral map). However, no live trade-off or visible price alters tactics; the resolution feels granted rather than won through a costly pivot. Coincidence (meteors returning when Sel watches) complicates but does not resolve, consistent with the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of control versus the chaos of creativity—emerges from the elders' siphoning and the city's reawakening, not thesis statements. The final image (murals blooming, Sel lifting the astrolabe) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "sour hush" confession and the dust as "half-born idea." Yet "remembered stardust" and "unspoken words" risk abstraction; their particulars (grit on the tongue, moths of words) are vivid but occasionally feel decorative rather than essential to choice. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Sel hears unspoken words, tastes stardust) and voice-specific ("bruise of green fire," "relieved throat"). Distance control is steady, though some phrases ("shadowed rapture," "aurora-lit archway") recur mechanically without modulation under pressure. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the vault opening. No dialogue present to evaluate. Prose as character is evident but occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("wanderers," "rapture") that slightly exceeds the focalizer's established lexicon during peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image or action. Rhythm varies, though certain stems ("Sel could hear," "Sel believed," "Sel heard") repeat across adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence that dulls propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but stock metaphors ("bruise of green fire," "moths") and elevated diction ("shadowed rapture," "murmured names") cluster in peak beats without fresh payoff. Clarity is maintained; no causality breaks. Filter-verb stacks ("Sel could hear," "Sel heard") appear in high-pressure moments, reducing immediacy. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Overall, solid line-level craft with noticeable artifacts that prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of "hearing unspoken words" with meteor-tracing and trapped stardust feels purposeful and non-obvious. The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe as tools of liberation transform familiar "muse" tropes through specific world logic (meteors leaving grit, birch-bark maps forming spirals). Emotional specificity (cold, awe, impatience) avoids templates. However, the "elders trapping creativity to keep citizens docile" premise is a recognizable control-versus-freedom template; the story does not fully transform it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in tone and voice is evident but does not obscure clarity. Transformation test: the arc could transplant to another "suppressed art" setting with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sel appears throughout and makes the final choice to place the astrolabe on the spiral map, unlocking the vault. However, most beats involve observation (hearing, listening, watching meteors) rather than decisions that alter tactics. The choice to rest beneath the archway is described but not dramatized as a fork. Setup is early, middle development is present (drawing lines, hearing confession), and closure participation is clear (standing in doorway, lifting astrolabe). Causal pressure is moderate; the character enables the ending but does not face visible trade-offs that foreclose other paths.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astrolabe is handled in at least four beats: Sel carries it and presses an ear to it (early), uses it to mark meteor angles, hears its impatient murmurs, and sets it on the birch-bark map to unlock the vault. It returns at closure ("holding the astrolabe against their heart," "lifted the astrolabe"). Its etched constellations and murmuring names provide specificity and irreplaceability. It drives two beats (marking meteors, unlocking vault) and shapes the ending image. Causal pressure is strong; removing it would break the method and closure. Cost connection is oblique (Sel's exhaustion is general, not tied to the instrument's use).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" appears early (meteor grit that made songs rise, elders trapping it), in the middle (tasting another cause, carrying grit in the astrolabe), and at closure (silver dust spilling upward, "heat of vanished suns held in memory"). It shapes the dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) and the final image (dust rising into streets, minds answering). However, its mechanics remain abstract; how the stardust enables creativity on the page is asserted more than dramatized. Causal pressure is moderate; it functions as premise and metaphor but does not constrain or enable specific tactics with visible cost. Setup, middle, and closure participation are all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is signaled early (hears trapped creativity as pressure, a plea) and enables multiple beats: hearing the confession beneath the elders' footsteps, translating the "sour hush," and hearing words turn to laughter at closure. It constrains Sel's method (listening rather than fighting) and provides unique access to the problem. Cost is oblique; the trait itself imposes no visible trade-off or vulnerability. Specificity is high (murmurs as moths, pressure that never reaches the mouth). The attribute is present in setup, middle, and closure, with clear causal pressure in the vault-opening beat. Swappability is low; removing it would require a different access mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rest" appears as the first step Sel takes ("truly rest beneath the archway until the aurora quieted"), drives the middle beats (resting across nights to match the sky's pulse, listening in "shadowed rapture"), and frames the ending ("Sel, exhausted, rested again under the aurora-lit archway"). The action enables the meteor observation and vault unlocking; it is not easily swappable—observation alone would lack the specific method. Causal pressure is strong: rest tunes Sel to the sky's rhythm, making the meteors return. Closure linkage is clear (Sel resting while meteors write the calendar). Cost connection is moderate (exhaustion). Specificity is high (matching breath to the sky's pulse). All three gates are met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced early as the "old method taught by wanderers" and executed across the middle beats: Sel raises the astrolabe to catch meteor angles, marks streaks on birch bark, and the traced paths form a spiral. The method directly unlocks the vault (laying the map, turning the astrolabe to match the spiral). It shapes at least two beats (observation, unlocking) and is indispensable to closure. Specificity is high (birch bark, spiral convergence). Causal pressure is strong; removing this method would break the resolution. Cost is oblique (Sel's hands shaking with cold). All three gates are met, and the mechanics matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway appears in the opening line, serves as the spatial anchor for Sel's resting and listening, and houses the vault entrance ("seam opened beneath the arch"). It returns at closure ("rested again under the aurora-lit archway"). The archway constrains Sel's method (rest here to tune to the sky) and is tied to the vault's location. However, its function is partly symbolic (gateway to inspiration); practical pressure is moderate. Specificity is high ("bruise of green fire"). Setup, middle anchor, and closure participation are present. Causal pressure is moderate; it guides choice but is not irreplaceable—a different site could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" appears early ("Time in Lumen Gate passed across an unwritten calendar, marked not by dates but by what the sky chose to show") and punctuates the middle ("By the third night," "On the seventh mark"). It frames the ending ("Across the next blank marks"). However, its mechanics remain abstract; the "marks" do not impose a live deadline or alter tactics. Specificity is moderate (sky-driven time), but the effect is more atmospheric than causal. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak (numbers are noted but do not tighten decisions). Swappability is moderate; traditional time markers could replace it with minor tonal loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is Sel's stated goal from early on and drives the vault-opening action. It is dramatized in Sel's listening ("trapped creativity knocking inside them"), the confession about elders siphoning stardust, and the final release (dust carrying "every half-born idea"). However, friction between want and cost is minimal; Sel's resolve "hardened" without visible internal conflict or competing desire. The motivation is consistent and shapes the ending but lacks on-page contradiction or trade-off. Setup, middle, and closure participation are present. Causal pressure is moderate; the goal is pursued without dramatic cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" as tone is established early (Sel in "shadowed rapture" listening) and modulates with pressure (awe, impatience, exhaustion, astonishment at closure). The pairing of "shadowed" (secrecy, night, repression) and "rapture" (ecstasy, release) coheres through turns and charges the final image (Sel resting while the city answers in "shadowed rapture"). Tone is not static; it intensifies from quiet listening to the vault's sigh and dust swarm. Specificity is high; the phrase recurs purposefully. Setup, middle modulation, and closure linkage are present. Causal pressure is moderate; tone enriches but does not constrain choice. The exact phrase is used explicitly, anchoring the effect.</comment>
