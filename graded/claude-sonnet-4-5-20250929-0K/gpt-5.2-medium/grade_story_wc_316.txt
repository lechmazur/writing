<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's post-ego-death clarity is established early and shapes perception throughout, but the internal texture remains somewhat abstract—"empty drum" and "numbness" are repeatedly asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. The final choice to invite both factions onto the mat and guide them into shared breath demonstrates agency, though the leap from numbness to facilitation feels under-motivated by prior micro-choices. The clone body's shudder "from attention given without ownership" introduces a late mechanism that borders on convenient resolution, slightly undercutting earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, ego-death survivor, rewriting history) arrive early. The custody trial escalates through the Custodians' arrival, the jar reveal, and the trial demand, then the protagonist's paired motion (push/pull) forces shared breath and ends the battle with a co-guardianship charter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (closer to Charged Poise): the protagonist reframes custody as "custody of the moment," and the clone body shudders in response to shared attention. Cost is conceptual—both are rewrites, neither original—but the physical/relational price (what the protagonist or factions forfeit) is asserted more than shown. The because/therefore chain from numbness → clarity → dojo training → trial → paired breath holds, though the final charter materializes quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo with gravity ropes, wind bells in two tones, and the edge falling into cloud is vivid and purposeful. The dojo edge stage-manages the trial, and the wind shift correlates with history's flux. Spatial choreography (highest slab, mat, edge, jar placement) remains clear. The setting constrains the trial's staging and charges the final image—the protagonist guides staves and signatures "into the same circle" on the mat—meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice, though the tactile engagement could be sharper in peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving personhood and escaping the custody battle's ownership logic. The trial demand on the dojo edge tightens pressure, and the protagonist's paired motion (push/pull, protect/risk) forces the factions into shared breath, which shifts the outcome. The escalation is clear under an Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure—what the protagonist or factions lose by forming co-guardianship—is more conceptual than visceral. The clone body's animation from "attention without ownership" introduces a mechanism late, softening the protagonist's direct agency in the final turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of custody, ownership versus presence, and the antidote to numbness through complementary opposites emerges from action. The protagonist's realization that "neither of us was an original, we were both rewrites" reframes the premise without stating a moral. The final image—paired breath, shared circle, co-guardianship—resonates, though the line "attention given without ownership" risks abstraction. Subtext operates in the protagonist's bow to the clone "as if to an opponent and as if to a sibling," and in Master Sora's whispered counsel. The thematic resonance is solid but slightly telegraphed by the protagonist's articulated insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly formal register ("the clarity that sliced through pretense the way a blade parts fog") that suits the speculative setting, though some phrases ("empty drum," "rehearsed stories") edge toward stock metaphor. Internal thought remains clean with no head-hopping. The protagonist's perceptual signature—seeing pretense, feeling numbness—is consistent. Diction stays within a reflective, philosophical range, and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure, though peak moments (the paired motion, the final breath) could benefit from sharper sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases repeat structure: "letting grief and gratitude balance, letting stillness and strike share one breath" and "as if to an opponent and as if to a sibling" use parallelism purposefully, yet other moments cycle near-synonyms ("rewrites had dulled," "rewrite aligned," "rewrites, and the only custody"). The longest sentence (Custodians paragraph) packs cause and backstory efficiently but risks density overload. No major loops or filter stacks, and the opening/closing images anchor well. A few abstract nouns ("clarity," "pretense," "numbness") recur without fresh embodiment, applying modest line-level drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating dojo, ego death, clone custody, history rewriting itself hour by hour—feels specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's post-ego-death "strange clarity" and the use of complementary opposites (push/pull, protect/risk) to resolve a legal/existential conflict offer a fresh angle on identity and ownership. The custody battle over a jarred brain and living body is memorable. Risk-taking in structure (dense single-paragraph format, accumulative pressure) and thematic stance (neither original, both rewrites) elevate the piece, though the final charter mechanism arrives quickly and some images (wind bells, ash sea) function more as texture than tight integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor frames the protagonist's perception from the opening and drives the key choice: seeing through both factions' pretense, inviting them onto the mat, and guiding the shared breath that ends the custody battle. Present in setup (first third), middle (witnessing the trial), and closure (paired motion and co-guardianship). The attribute enables the final turn and constrains the protagonist's response to numbness. Causally essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The brain in a jar (labeled "duplicate") is introduced in the second beat (Custodians' arrival), returns when the protagonist opens the jar and places a palm on the glass, and its presence underwrites the custody stakes. It appears in two distinct beats and ties to the premise, but the protagonist's gesture—feeling "both our pulses, mine in blood and his in stored fluid"—reads more symbolic than tactile, and the jar does not constrain later tactics. It shapes the conflict but remains somewhat ornamental in the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is the dominant stake: Custodians vs. Council fight over the body, the trial on the dojo edge is staged to prove personhood, and the protagonist's response (co-guardianship charter) directly resolves it. Present in setup (city's reprint lottery), development (trial demand), and closure (charter). The concept narrows options, forces the trial, and determines the ending. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is named early ("clarity that sliced through pretense"), invoked at the trial (protagonist asked to witness because of this sight), and operationalized in the climax ("the dojo art that slices through pretense, a paired motion"). The trait enables the protagonist's role and final action, though the paired motion itself is more vividly realized than the "slicing" metaphor. Present across beats with causal weight, but the trait overlaps conceptually with "clarity" and risks label-only status in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Vivify" is introduced as the protagonist's goal (came to the dojo to vivify what rewrites had dulled), taught by Master Sora (antidote to numbness is complementary opposites), and enacted in the climax: the protagonist vivifies "the whole scene through complementary opposites" and invites the factions to "feel what numbness had stolen." The action is named, dramatized, and delivers the resolution. The protagonist's paired motion (push/pull, protect/risk) and the clone body's shudder from attention both trace to vivification. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through complementary opposites" is taught by Master Sora (grief/gratitude, stillness/strike), echoed in the protagonist's strategy (dominance vs. surrender, cold logic vs. warmth, ownership vs. surrender), and executed in the climax: "paired motion of push and pull, where one hand protects and the other risks." The method is signaled early, shapes the protagonist's understanding, and defines the final action. The mechanics matter and are irreplaceable, though the execution at closure could be more physically grounded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is established in the opening, stages the trial on its edge ("where the rock fell away into cloud"), and houses the mat where the paired motion occurs. The gravity ropes, wind bells, and edge-into-cloud provide atmosphere and spatial constraint. The setting enables the trial's staging and the final circle on the mat, though the protagonist could theoretically perform the same resolution elsewhere with minor edits. Present across all three gates and shapes closure staging, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself hour by hour" is introduced early (constellations change, birth certificate flickers Original/Copy) and recurs when "history flickered" during the protagonist's speech. The timeframe flavors the premise and explains the custody confusion, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock at closure. The protagonist's choice is not raced by a rewrite deadline. Functional setup and thematic color, but replaceable in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to defeat emotional numbness drives the protagonist to the dojo, frames the lesson from Master Sora, and underlies the invitation to the factions ("feel what numbness had stolen"). The protagonist's "numbness crack[s]" in the climactic breath. Present in setup, development, and closure, with friction between the desire to feel and the "empty drum" state. The motivation is dramatized through the dojo training and the final action, though the internal shift at closure is asserted more than shown in contradictory impulses.</comment>
