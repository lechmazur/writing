<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's synesthesia (sound as touch) is embodied consistently and drives micro-choices: they keep their voice low, hunger for texture over facts, layer stories in memory rather than on paper. The final choice to whisper rescued names and accept namelessness as a vessel shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between erasure-fear and erasure-acceptance, though the arc could press harder on competing impulses in peak beats. Minor slip: the discovery of Container 9H feels more revelatory than agonizing, slightly muting the emotional cost at the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (layering overheard fragments, tidal rhythm as structural pulse) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist becomes a nameless vessel holding rescued names, a stance crystallized with felt cost ("my own erased history gained a grain"). Causality is elliptical but motivated: the label discovery → week of focused listening → Container 9H → redistribution and whispered recitation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes erasure was systemic, not personal, reweighting the stake from individual restoration to collective witness. Cost is legible in the final image: footprints covered, but layers held internally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains movement and discovery throughout: stack labels (KX, MZ), tidal gaps, Container 9H's flood-lapped placement. The poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting, its paper "bite" charging the protagonist's hand and priming the erasure motif. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: salt air, kelp smell, diesel engines, burlap/silk touch synesthesia. The maze's tidal reconfiguration pressures the week-long search and the final act of hiding folders "in different stacks." The port's architecture directly enables the closure: "the labyrinth protect[s] what was left."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recovering erased identity (self and collective). The piece tightens once with visible cost: discovering Container 9H proves erasure was systemic, shifting the goal from personal restoration to archival witness, and the final act—redistributing folders, whispering names—forecloses legal resurrection in favor of nameless stewardship. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: "I did not claim them as mine, yet…my own erased history gained a grain." The tidal timeframe and Container 9H's inaccessibility create pressure, though the lack of an active antagonist or competing danger keeps escalation more textural than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as collective archive, identity as vessel—emerges through concrete particulars: the label, overheard stories, smeared folders, the tarnished mirror showing "everyone I had listened to." The final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: namelessness becomes capacity, erasure becomes witness. The protagonist's synesthesia (texture over facts) and the port's economy of forgetting interweave into a coherent meditation on what survives bureaucratic erasure. Subtext operates in the whispered names as fabric, water covering footprints, and the phrase "the layers inside me held"—each image reweights the premise with resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and sustained: synesthetic perception (burlap, wet silk, dry sand, citrus sting), aversion to paper, preference for layered memory. Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (filtering sound as touch, craving texture) remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom—poetic but grounded in port labor and sensory specificity. The prose modulates appropriately: calm accumulation during the week of listening, brief compression at the Container 9H discovery, expansive lyricism in the final whisper-and-walk. No dialogue on the page; overheard fragments are reported, not dramatized, which is voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and sonic cadence. Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. Minor loop: "the labyrinth protect what was left" / "the layers inside me held" are near-synonyms in adjacent final beats, though the second adds embodied closure. One filter-verb cluster mid-piece ("I felt the absence," "I learned to keep," "I recognized") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. Figurative language (memory solvent, barnacles, fabric syllables) is coherent and voice-motivated. No scaffold or template cadence. The final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—bureaucratic erasure × synesthesia × port labor × tidal time—is specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's sensory filter and the container labyrinth as archive transform stock "lost identity" territory into embodied inquiry. The poison-bottle label and the mirror showing composite faces are fresh inflections. The risk—accumulative structure, elliptical causality, quiet closure—succeeds without obscuring clarity. Small deduction: the "memory solvent" motif borders on symbolic convenience (the label appears exactly when the protagonist needs a lead), though it is anchored in the port's smuggling economy and pays off at Container 9H.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist is present throughout; their decision to layer stories (early), follow the tidal clock for a week (middle), and redistribute the folders while accepting namelessness (closure) drives all major turns. The death-certificate error frames the stakes from the opening line and the final stance—walking "nameless, alive"—closes the arc. Strong causal role across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in one beat (discovery at low tide), is handled ("slipped it into my glove"), and its "MEMORY SOLVENT" text seeds the week-long investigation that leads to Container 9H. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the folders and whispered names take over. Two beats (discovery, motivating search) but no closure reprise caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Erased histories shape every beat: the protagonist's legal death, the work in a numbered maze (street names as "missing teeth"), the collected fragments, the discovery that erasure was systemic (Container 9H folders), and the final act of redistribution and nameless witness. The concept defines the dominant stake, alters tactics (layering in memory, not paper), and charges the closure image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic filter (sound as touch) constrains on-page choices: keeping voice low, listening for texture rather than facts, and feeling words as fabric in the final whisper. It enables the layering method and deepens the hunger for memory-texture. The trait is embodied in multiple beats (burlap, silk, sand, citrus) and contributes to closure (syllables as fabric). Strong integration with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Layer" is the protagonist's core method: layering overheard fragments in memory (early), layering them into a pattern pointing to 9H (middle), and the final statement "the layers inside me held" as closure. The verb defines the accumulative structure and the protagonist's identity as vessel. Removing it would collapse the narrative logic. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Collecting fragments is signaled early (stevedore's grandmother, customs agent's joke), executed across multiple listening beats during the week-long search, and its mechanics matter: the protagonist refuses paper, filters for texture, and builds a pattern that points to Container 9H. The method shapes attempts and drives the discovery. The final whisper of rescued names completes the method's arc. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures every choice: numbered stacks replace street names, tidal rhythm shifts access, Container 9H is found "where floodwater lapped its doors," and the protagonist hides rescued folders "in different stacks, letting the labyrinth protect what was left." The maze constrains movement, supplies the discovery, and becomes the archive. The port setting is indispensable to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm structures the narrative: barges arrive on flood / leave gaps at ebb, the label is found at low tide, the protagonist returns "at each ebb" for a week, Container 9H is opened at slack tide, and dawn flood "covered my footprints." The timeframe tightens the search window and adds urgency (limited access at ebb). Time shapes tactics and the final image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire for "texture of memories" is dramatized early (hunger for what a past feels like, aversion to facts), drives the collecting behavior, and creates friction: the protagonist cannot restore their own history, so they archive others'. The final cost—"I did not claim them as mine, yet…my own erased history gained a grain"—shows want meeting limit. The motivation is embodied in choices and pressured at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Namelessness is coherent throughout: the opening "my name slid off every screen," the work as "a kind of invisibility," the mirror showing composite faces, and the closing "nameless, alive." Tone modulates from matter-of-fact erasure through investigative texture-seeking to lyric acceptance. The final image—"I walked on, nameless, alive"—crystallizes tone as the protagonist's earned stance. Tone charges closure and sustains pressure.</comment>
