<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is embodied through tactile habit (the buckle) and sensory focus (listening, counting nicks), with motivation rooted in the watcher's burden rather than personal stakes. Internal conflict appears in "I wanted to accuse him, yet my duty was to preserve trust," though it resolves quickly into procedural competence. The choice to bind the impostor rather than let him fall shows moral calculus, but the decision feels more职业 obligation than contradictory impulse acting simultaneously. Emotional embodiment is strong in the opening and closure, though the middle leans procedural.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (watcher in arbor, moonlit air lanes, tonight's supply drop). The drive lens is Causal: the impostor's pause triggers buckle-checking, which enables the trap revision, leading to capture and route correction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the protagonist stays in the arbor rehearsing, accepting the solitary burden with visible cost ("alone, in the arbor's silence that repeated every choice as a soundless echo"). One meaningful tightening (recognizing the impostor) escalates to the capture, and the cost is legible in the final image of solitary vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vivid and specific (leaves like black glass, slick trunk, thin branches), and the high fork physically constrains the protagonist's position and sightlines. The setting enables the trap (southern crown with thin branches and wind) and the final act (climbing down, cinching lines in the netting). Micro-setting (the buckle as tactile anchor) and sensory hierarchy (prioritizing sound over sight) reflect the protagonist's professional focus. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and confrontation, though the arbor's exact scale and the parachute mechanics remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve trust in the flight chain under pressure from a cargo thief—is signaled early and drives all tactics. One meaningful tightening occurs when the buckle-check confirms the impostor, forcing the trap revision; this forecloses the option of simple accusation and raises the cost of error. Agency is decision (revising coordinates, keying the real Nine, binding the clerk) with visible consequence (trust returns, clerk bound for judgment). The choice to speak truth publicly rather than let the clerk fall demonstrates moral calculus with felt cost, though the resolution feels assured once the impostor is caught.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The watcher's burden—to preserve the web without punishing—emerges through action rather than statement, and the buckle accrues meaning from harness-checking habit to trap-lock to badge. The final image of rehearsing pauses and breaths, alone in silence, offers a resonant answer to the cost of vigilance without moralizing. The tension between wanting to accuse and needing precision deepens the theme of trust under pressure. The recurring phrase "soundless echo" charges the ending by linking the voice's arrival to the protagonist's solitary rehearsal, though it hovers near thematic echo without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices pauses, breath lengths, nicks on the buckle, and the smell of machine oil, all filtered through occupational expertise. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("cold metal parachute buckle," "slick trunk," "bound for judgment"), though some phrases trend lyric-elevated ("stone dropped into a deep well," "oath," "badge and warning") in ways that slightly exceed the watcher's working register under peak stress. No dialogue appears on the page to test naturalism or subtext. Psychic distance is controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closure, but the middle beat includes a long compound sentence ("I revised the landing coordinates with a calm that felt false, sending him toward the southern crown...") that cycles through multiple actions without pause, creating mild momentum drag. "Soundless echo" appears three times, twice in abstract phrasing ("leaving a soundless echo inside my skull," "repeated every choice as a soundless echo"), which borders on synonym loop and slightly dulls the closure charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, and clarity remains intact. Minor overwriting in figurative density does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The arbor-above-clouds setting and the buckle-as-mnemonic-tool offer a specific synthesis that avoids stock watchman tropes. The protagonist's method (muscle-memory via buckle nicks) is fresh and anchored in prior jumping experience, and the choice to bind rather than punish transforms the vigilante-watcher premise. The emotional truth—solitary vigilance as burden rather than heroism—feels earned. The midnight pattern seeker role and the air-lane trust network read original, though the impostor-caught-in-trap beat follows familiar investigator logic once the buckle reveals the truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker frames expectation in the opening, drives two key choices (buckle-check identification, trap revision), and appears in the closure rehearsing breaths. The role enables the causal chain and constrains the protagonist to preservation rather than punishment, with visible cost in solitary endurance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parachute buckle is handled in three beats: worn as habit/anchor, used to count nicks (muscle-memory check), and snapped free to cinch the impostor's lines. It evolves from comfort object to investigative tool to physical restraint, with each use essential to the causal chain and the closure (the protagonist rubs it back on afterward, linking past and future vigilance).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is stated early and shapes the protagonist's refusal to accuse without precision, the choice to trap rather than confront, and the decision to bind rather than let fall. It drives tactics and reappears in the closure image of solitary rehearsal. The concept is lived through action, though the phrase itself is told rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" describes the job in the opening but does not constrain a later choice with visible cost. The buckle-check demonstrates attention, and the trap revision shows invention, but the trait itself is label-only and could be inferred from action without the phrase.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Revise" appears three times: landing revision requested, coordinates revised as trap, and route publicly revised after capture. The trap revision is the story's fulcrum, enabling the capture and trust restoration. Removal would break the causal chain and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Remembering through muscle memory is signaled in the opening habit, executed in the buckle-check beat (sliding thumb, counting nicks, hands telling truth), and implicit in the closure rehearsal of pauses and breaths. The method is specific, indispensable to identifying the impostor, and ties past (jumping days) to present vigilance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is established early, supplies the trap location (southern crown with thin branches and wind), and houses the final solitary vigil. It pressures the impostor's landing and enables the netting capture. The setting is specific and essential, though the mechanics of the arbor-as-landing-platform remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static clears" marks the inciting beat (Courier Nine's voice arrives), but the clock itself does not tighten decisions beyond "minutes later" for the parachutes. The phrase anchors the moment when listening becomes decision, participating in setup and closure (rehearsing after dawn), but elapsed time is vague and does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve trust under pressure is dramatized in the protagonist's refusal to guess, the precision demanded by the buckle-check, the trap revision to avoid false accusation, and the public truth-telling that restores Nine's trust. It drives all major choices, conflicts with the desire to accuse, and incurs visible cost (solitary burden) at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears three times: the voice's arrival, the arbor's silence, and the final rehearsal. The tone of solitary vigilance and unspoken consequence is coherent and modulates from watchful tension to quiet endurance. The phrase charges the final image by linking inner reverberation to the protagonist's ongoing burden, though repetition borders on over-reliance.</comment>
