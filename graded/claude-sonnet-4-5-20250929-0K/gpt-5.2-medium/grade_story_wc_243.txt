<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is concrete and particular—her walnut-ink archival work embodies her "gently thorough" approach, and the locket triggers contradictory impulses (euphoria/haunt) that act simultaneously when she realizes she whitewashed Jun's death. The final choice to tear out the accident page and replace it with ordinary losses shows agency with visible cost: she publicly dismantles her own record. Minor slip: Jun's mother's sudden appearance feels under-motivated; we lack setup for her presence or her readiness to participate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (jetty, locket, walnut ink, the rewritten oath) that converge at the public ceremony where Mara reads the confession aloud. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the town accepts accountability, the mayor's hand shakes, Jun's mother drops the locket, and Mara tears out the lie—each gesture forecloses the old covenant with visible social and personal cost. Orientation anchors appear promptly (jetty at twilight, Mara as archivist). One friction: the transition from jetty to archives to mayor's rehearsal to the final ceremony compresses four narrative shards in ~800 words; while the pattern holds and the lens remains coherent, the second and third beats (archives, mayor confrontation) feel slightly telescoped, risking a list-like quality. Cost is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, walnut ink, and night-blooming lilies create a distinct sensory signature filtered through Mara's archival priorities. The locket lodged in barnacles and the salt-stained crate at the final ceremony are tactile anchors that constrain action: Mara must pry the locket free, place the book on the crate. The jetty's damp planks and the tide sliding in "with an almost celebratory hush" charge the closure image. Minor gap: the archives workroom and the mayor's rehearsal space lack spatial grounding, reading more as narrative stations than lived-in environments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early: whether the regenerated covenant will repeat the old lie or admit the council's complicity. Pressure tightens through Mara's discovery (locket), her archival decision (writing the confession), her confrontation (reading proximate causes to the mayor), and the public ceremony where multiple characters pay visible prices—the mayor's shaking hand, Jun's mother dropping the locket, Mara tearing out the false page. Each turn forecloses options: once Mara writes the new preface, the council cannot ignore it; once she hands them the locket, their rehearsed lines "sound like lies." The final ceremony crystallizes the shift from denial to accountability with social and emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—accountability's weight versus institutional convenience—emerges organically from Mara's archival method and the town's hunger for investor-friendly narratives. The proximate-causes motif (broken seawall, late bell, council bargains with dredgers) operates as both plot device and thematic scaffolding: tracing causes is how Mara either hides or reveals complicity. The final image, where the sea "smelled suddenly of walnuts and wet paper" and Mara writes "everyday losses" on a receipt-sized sheet, delivers a non-literal answer: honesty requires recording the small, ordinary griefs that institutions erase. The locket's return as seed rather than keepsake, and the crowd's "haunted euphoria," resist tidy resolution. No overt moralizing; the priest's shift from blessing to asking accountability dramatizes the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature: she notices tannins, walnut broth color, the texture of parchment. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "dead fishermen murmuring under the pier" and "joy had to borrow a ghost's throat to be heard" maintaining lyric consistency. Brief dialogue (mayor, priest) feels purposeful and advances plot without head-hopping. One friction: the phrase "haunted euphoria" appears as both free indirect thought and then as if objectively confirmed by the crowd's reaction, blurring the line between Mara's interpretation and narratorial claim. Distance stays intentional overall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, information-dense, and propulsive. Sentence variety supports the accumulative design: "Euphoria surged through her like warm wine, and then the haunt followed it" compresses contradictory affect without therapy-speak. Figurative language (reeds hiss like paper, lilies open as if the jetty were flowering inland) is purposeful and sensory. Two frictions: the clause "because she had written the official record that named Jun an accident" slightly over-explains what the next sentence will dramatize; and the phrase "proximate causes" recurs four times across the story, twice within two paragraphs, edging toward template cadence. No major loops or scaffold, but the repetition of "proximate causes" as both method and mantra could tighten. Overall clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—archival record-keeping as moral reckoning, walnut ink as embodied craft, a locket lodged in barnacles as material witness—feels specific and non-obvious. The regenerated covenant frame transforms a familiar "town secret" premise by grounding it in documentary method: Mara's proximate-causes habit becomes both the lie's structure and its undoing. The final gesture of writing everyday losses on receipt paper offers a fresh inflection. Minor derivativeness: the drowned-child-as-catalyst and the archivist-as-conscience roles lean on established literary templates, though the walnut-ink specificity and the public ceremony's choreography personalize them. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet, multi-character closure scene elevate originality within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara Quill, the walnut-ink archivist, drives every key turn: she finds the locket, writes the new preface, confronts the mayor, reads the confession publicly, and tears out the false page. Her archival method (steeping parchment, recording proximate causes) shapes tactics throughout. Present in setup (opening line), middle (writing the oath book, confronting the mayor), and closure (placing the book, tearing the page, inserting the receipt sheet). Her professional habit of tracing causes is the story's method and her means of transformation. Causal pressure is high; irreplaceability is strong. Cost is visible: she dismantles her own official record and accepts social exposure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The locket photo appears at the jetty (Mara pries it free, finds her and Jun's faces), returns as evidence when Mara hands it to the mayor, and culminates when Jun's mother drops it into the water "like a seed." Three distinct beats; the object's meaning shifts from personal memory to public witness to ritual offering. Setup early, development in confrontation, strong closure participation. Causal role: it proves the jetty "remembered more than revenue" and destabilizes the mayor's rehearsed lines. High specificity (split hinge, blackberry-jam-stained mouths) and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the story's dominant stake: Mara's goal is to make the renewal "real" by admitting the council's appetite. The concept frames the opening (the old covenant cracked), drives the middle (Mara writes a new preface that confesses complicity), and resolves at the final ceremony where the town signs the book and the priest asks the sea "to hold them accountable." The covenant is not merely thematic backdrop; it structures the conflict and the closure gesture. Present in all three integration gates, with visible cost (public confession, shaking signatures). Slightly abstract compared to the concrete locket and ink, but it shapes options and tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is established early ("Gently thorough by habit, she believed history was not a parade of heroes...") and demonstrated through Mara's patient steeping of parchment, her careful listing of proximate causes, and her refusal to rush the mayor. The trait enables her confrontation: she reads the causes aloud until the mayor's lines sound like lies—gentleness paired with relentless thoroughness. It constrains her method (she cannot simply denounce; she must document) and shapes the closure (the small receipt sheet for "everyday losses" is thorough care at micro scale). Present in setup and closure; one clear middle beat (the confrontation). Visible tradeoff: the method is slow and requires public vulnerability. Slight penalty: the trait is more demonstrated than tested under opposing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steep" (the action of steeping parchment in walnut broth) appears once, in the archives scene: "she steeped fresh parchment in walnut broth, watching the ink darken to the color of riverbeds." The act is specific and sensory, but it does not drive a major turn; it is preparation for writing the new preface, not a pivot itself. The real turn is the writing and then the confrontation. Functional within the archival texture, but swappable with another craft step (grinding shells, binding pages) without structural loss. Present in middle only; no setup or closure participation. Mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is both Mara's archival method and the story's means of transformation. She "traced the broken seawall, the late warning bell, the hurried evacuation, each link a sentence that let the council sleep," then later lists "the council's bargains with dredgers that had weakened the wall years before the flood." The method is signaled early, drives the middle confrontation (she reads proximate causes aloud until the mayor's lies are exposed), and implicitly governs the closure (the new oath book's confession is a causal chain). Mechanics matter: the phrase "proximate causes" recurs, and the story teaches that tracing causes can either conceal or reveal. Strong integration, though slightly repetitive in phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors the opening and closing scenes. Mara sets her ledger on damp planks, listens to reeds, pries the locket from barnacles—tactile, sensory grounding. The final ceremony occurs on the same jetty: lanterns tremble, the tide slides in, the planks pulse beneath Mara. The setting supplies the locket (lodged in barnacles), provides the ritual space for the public oath, and charges the closure with the smell of "walnuts and wet paper" merging with the sea. Setup, development (jetty as discovery site and ceremonial stage), and payoff (the living record beneath Mara's feet). Strong environmental constraint and atmospheric coherence. Slightly penalized: the archives and mayor's space are less developed, creating mild unevenness.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When context changes" is introduced early as Mara's teaching: "When context changes, you do not erase the past; you rebind it." The timeframe is the window between the storm that cracked the old covenant and the ceremony to enact the new one—roughly two twilights. Time pressure is moderate: Mara must act before the regenerated covenant becomes official, but the story does not employ a live ticking clock. The phrase "when context changes" reappears implicitly in the closure (the covenant is rewritten to fit the changed understanding of Jun's death). Present in setup and thematic payoff; less visible as a constraint in the middle. The temporal frame is legible but does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to preserve the weight of small moments"—is established in the opening: "she believed history was not a parade of heroes but a weight of small moments that could tip a life." This belief drives her decision to include Jun as witness, to list the council's bargains, and finally to write "everyday losses: a cracked teacup, a missed goodbye, a child's jammed grin" on the receipt sheet. The motivation is dramatized through her choices and costs her safety (public exposure, dismantling her own record). Present in setup, middle (writing the new preface), and closure (the receipt-sheet entries). Friction between institutional convenience (investors, the mayor's rehearsed lines) and Mara's archival care is visible. Slightly abstract compared to the locket and ink, but clearly contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is introduced when Mara finds the locket: "Euphoria surged through her like warm wine, and then the haunt followed it." The tone recurs at the final ceremony: "Someone began to cry, then laugh, and the sound carried the same haunted euphoria Mara felt, as if joy had to borrow a ghost's throat to be heard." The dual affect—celebration shadowed by grief—coheres throughout: the blooming jetty, the night-blooming lilies, the tide's "celebratory hush" paired with the dead fishermen murmuring. The tone modulates with pressure (Mara's discovery, the confrontation, the public ceremony) and charges the final image where the sea smells of walnuts and the planks pulse with "a living record." Setup, development, strong closure participation. High coherence and specificity.</comment>
