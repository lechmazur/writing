<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's dimensional homesickness is vividly embodied through the pendant's warmth and inward doorway vision, creating concrete motivation. The guardian's feral years as defense against threshold terror shows internal contradiction acted in scene. The final choice to turn attention inward together rather than open the way demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost (forgoing the impossible home). Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("color that lived just past the last visible wavelength") rather than purely character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: mist-and-pendant imagery accumulates through breathing the garden, the doorway on ribs, and the final dull pendant with catalog card. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): both characters choose to interiorize rather than escape, with conceptual cost legible in the dull pendant and the tag "RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP." Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian confesses his terror and the protagonist recognizes their shared misread map, tightening the dominant stake from individual escape to mutual stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: roses cast shadows when the pendant brightens, hedges frame the threshold, and breathing the garden "as if it were a book" becomes the tactical method. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's particular perception ("foggy lucidity of thoughts that almost became daylight"). The pendant as recurring object charges the final image when it becomes dull stone with a catalog card. Spatial choreography remains clear across the circling, the shelves, and the inward turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is dimensional homesickness seeking resolution; pressure coheres as the pendant tries to widen the vision into passage. One meaningful tightening: the guardian lunges to tear the pendant away, and the protagonist's choice to wait at the edge shifts tactics from individual escape to shared renunciation. Visible cost is the forfeiture of the impossible home and the pendant's power (it becomes dull). Agency is shared decision and endurance under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist required; the "living boundary" provides situational pressure that complicates without resolving through convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges through concrete particulars: the cult's mistake of treating boundary as tool, the guardian's feral guarding of every threshold, and the final choice to interiorize rather than command. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer via the catalog card "FRIENDSHIP WITH UNCERTAINTY, RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP"—a quiet image that reweights prior material without stating a moral. The boundaries of light behaving "like a cautious animal" crystallizes the theme through specific perception. Minor slip: "practice interiorizing exteriors" edges toward prompt-like phrasing but is embedded in dialogue and dramatized through the breathing exercise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("dimensionally homesick, the kind that aches for a street you have never seen"). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: compressed syntax when the pendant brightens, expansive when reflecting. The guardian's dialogue ("rasp that sounded like pages turned too fast") carries character-specific idiom. Minor weakness: some diction edges toward elevated register not fully earned by the narrator's established lexicon ("interiorizing exteriors," "wavelength" as metaphor). No head-hopping; elision of how they physically "turned attention inward" is purposeful compression that fits the dream logic taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show variety; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure). The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "he did not speak so much as sniff the air, listening for theft the way wolves listen for blood" stacks two comparisons in one clause, risking slight muddle. "Stepped from between biographies and frost coated roses" juxtaposes incongruous details (books and flowers) without clear spatial logic, though the surreal setting may intend this. One paraphrase near the end: "my homesickness was the same kind of misread map" echoes the guardian's confession without adding new pressure. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; clarity remains strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-logic library, dimensional homesickness, and the pendant as boundary-conversation feels specific and non-obvious. The guardian as feral librarian who became keeper of sunlight transforms the stock "guardian" trope through particular detail (paper dust in hair, rasping voice). The method of interiorizing exteriors to befriend uncertainty offers a fresh angle on escape-versus-acceptance stakes. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would not work unchanged with different setting or object. Minor familiarity: the dream-library and the pendant as mystical key have wide precedent, though the execution particularizes them enough to avoid pure derivative scoring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Feral library guardian is present in opening third, drives two distinct beats (circling and testing boundaries; lunging to tear pendant then softening), and his confession that he "listened for footsteps that might choose him as a friend" enables the protagonist's final choice to wait together. His decision to turn attention inward with the protagonist shapes the closure directly. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceable because his dual nature (guardian/homesick) mirrors the protagonist's conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cultist's pendant appears in opening paragraph, is handled in at least three beats (tugging warmth, glinting through fingers, drawing doorway on ribs, trying to widen vision, becoming dull at closure), and its transformation into dull stone with catalog card charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Drives escalation when it brightens and the guardian lunges. Visible cost: its power is sealed away. High irreplaceability; swapping for another mystical object would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Boundaries of light shapes stakes (the pendant can cut a seam where shadow and shine touch) and alters tactics (watching the boundaries behave like a cautious animal, refusing to command them). Present in opening third via pendant mechanics; returns at closure when both characters choose not to force the boundary open. Causal role in one major turn (the choice to wait at the edge). Could be more deeply embedded in earlier choices; some presence feels thematic echo rather than mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dimensionally homesick is signaled in opening paragraph, constrains protagonist's goal (seeking the impossible home), and enables the recognition that "if we let the pendant open a way we would only trade one certainty for another." The attribute is shared with the guardian, creating the bond that drives closure. Visible tradeoff: forgoing the vision of home. One minor weakness: the term itself is used twice as a label; more embodied manifestation in middle beats would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wait appears as "the only brave thing I knew" early, drives the guardian's recognition and softening when the protagonist holds hands open, and becomes the climactic choice ("asked him to wait with me at the edge, just for one breath"). That breath is the peak beat where boundaries are observed rather than commanded, leading directly to the mutual turn inward. Irreplaceable: swapping for another action (e.g., "refuse," "bargain") would require rewriting the thematic resolution. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiorizing exteriors is named by the guardian mid-story, becomes the method when he guides the protagonist to "breathe the garden as if it were a book...from the inside," and the final turn explicitly states "together we turned our attention inward, interiorizing the frozen garden." Present in setup and closure; shapes the resolution. Weakness: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the exact steps of interiorizing are elided, making it harder to track as a repeatable constraint. Scores in mid-band due to closure participation but limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden in mist is anchored in opening line, supplies the spatial frame (hedges, shelves, roses) that the protagonist navigates, and its mist thickens/thins as the breathing exercise proceeds. The roses casting sharp shadows when the pendant brightens creates immediate visual pressure. At closure the garden is interiorized "until its mist became a calm page." Present across all three gates; constrains movement and charges the final image. Specificity and causal pressure are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through the veil of sleep is signaled in the opening phrase and establishes the dream-logic frame. At closure the protagonist wakes at dawn, and the catalog card reads "RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP," creating a purposeful early-final reprise. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle; no clock pressure is felt. The dream state allows certain elisions (spatial logic, simultaneity of perception and dialogue) but does not function as a live constraint during escalation. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score trends toward mid-5s due to reprise without middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>To make friends with uncertainty is named by the guardian as counsel, is dramatized when the protagonist watches boundaries behave unpredictably and refuses to command them, and crystallizes in the closure image (catalog card). The desire is conflicted: protagonist's homesickness drives the opposite want (certainty of home), and the guardian's guarding contradicts his longing for connection. Friction between wants and costs is visible in the choice to turn inward rather than open the passage. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the motivation is not merely told but enacted with tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is established in the opening line and modulates through the piece: mist thickens then thins, the pendant's light creates sharp shadows, and the final "calm page" resolves the fog into clarity. Tone remains coherent through turns and supports the dream-logic mode without becoming static. The final image (dull pendant, careful handwriting) maintains the established register. Minor weakness: the tone is more atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on choice; it charges the ending but does not shift measurably under peak pressure. Scores in mid-7s for coherence and closure participation.</comment>
