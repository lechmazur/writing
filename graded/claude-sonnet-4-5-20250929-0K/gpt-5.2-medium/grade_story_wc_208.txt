<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's spiral-making is concretely motivated through her sculptor identity and responds to the lantern's prompt with embodied action. The attribute "perpetually learning" appears as a label without constraining choices or creating internal friction. Supporting figures in the projection remain instrumental rather than individuated, but at this length and with clear spatial separation (past/present), that's acceptable. The closure choice—pocketing the slide to "reimagine what else alliances can repair"—telegraphs future agency rather than dramatizing a present cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered-time images early and sustains it through the spiral-making sequence. Orientation anchors (lost sculptor, archway, storm) land within the first 120 words. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the town arrives, the sandbags lock, and Mara pockets the slide with alliance potential reweighted—pressure crystallizes and options reconfigure even though the next act is not yet paid. Cost is conceptual (commitment to this mode of bridging) rather than a visible forfeiture, which holds but doesn't electrify.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting throughout: it shelters the carving, frames the projection, and becomes the convergence point for both gatherings. Sensory anchors (rust, kelp, salt-flecked glass, rain skewing sideways) are selective and voice-filtered. The driftwood spiral planted on the service road constrains the town's path at closure, satisfying the choice-constraint test. Storm pressure is present but remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a ticking clock that narrows options beat by beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repair the alliance/sea wall through shared symbols. The lantern encounter introduces a tightening when Nora gestures and Mara realizes she must translate across tribal divides. Carving the spiral deepens the stake by operationalizing the concept, and planting three sculptures narrows the town's options at dawn. Agency is decision and craft, not renunciation. The closure shows collaborative success (sandbags lock, turbines hum) but the cost—what Mara forgoes or risks by committing to this mediator role—is implied rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (alliances bridged through shared material language rather than words) emerges organically from the spiral-making and projection dialogue without thesis statements. The driftwood symbols—hook as question mark, turbine blade as crescent, mitten as center—show complexity scaffolded through simplicity. The final image (pocketing the slide, already reimagining) reweights prior material by framing repair as iterative and portable. No overt moralizing. One minor slip: "her craft is the language of this place" borders on summary, though it's embedded in Mara's realization rather than narrator commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature (sculptor noticing "pale sticks," "bent crescent," layered meanings) is consistent. Diction stays within an educated artisan's register ("scaffold complexity," "timewoven alliances") without jarring leaps. The projection figures speak through gesture and mouthed words rather than full dialogue, which sidesteps voice-distinction tests. One rhythm slip: several mid-story sentences open with "She [verb]" or "Mara [verb]," creating a brief template cadence. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "as if time carries different weights" advances both world logic and Mara's learning). Figurative language ("broken jaw," "turbine-hum reverie," "thread that ties moments") is vivid but clusters heavily in the opening third without pattern-teaching, risking density overload. Two paraphrase loops: "realizes the slide is not a recording but a thread" immediately followed by "hears the present storm…and also hears a calmer gale inside the slide" restates time-layering. "Keeps learning" appears twice as a stem. No closure-beat artifacts; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—magic lantern as temporal bridge requiring material craft to complete the alliance—synthesizes historical object, environmental stakes, and artisan mediation in a non-obvious way. The spiral as shared sign across decades transforms the "message in a bottle" trope through specificity (fishhook, mitten, crescent mapped to local meanings). Mara's sculptor identity is integral; swapping her for a different mediator would require rewriting all tactics. Risk: the multi-era projection could feel gimmicky, but the piece commits fully and grounds it in concrete problem-solving (currents, wind load, sinkhole). One proximity note: "scaffolding complexity with simplicity" echoes design-theory language without quite earning folk-artisan vernacular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's sculptor identity drives the central tactic (carving symbols), enables her to read the lantern's prompt, and shapes the three sculptures that guide the town. Her choices—lighting the lantern, asking how to help, planting the markers—create two major turns (understanding the task, operationalizing it). Present in setup, middle development, and closure. The "spirited" and "perpetually learning" labels add texture but don't constrain choices. Removing sculptor identity would collapse the story's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in at least four beats: discovery, lighting/projection, interactive carving session, and dawn convergence. It enables causal pressure (Nora's instructions, the engineer/fisherman knowledge transfer) and charges the final image (Mara pockets it, "already reimagining"). The glass is handled, clipped, held to light, and slid out—embodied interaction across the arc. Removing it would eliminate the time-bridge mechanic and the closure gesture. Specificity: salt-flecked glass, brass frame, single slide all matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is operationalized on the page: Nora's past crowd and Mara's present town overlap in the projection, each touching the spiral to share knowledge across eras. The concept shapes stakes (repair requires trust across time and factions) and tactics (material symbols bridge the divide). It's named once ("timewoven alliances between people who never share a calendar") but functions throughout the lantern sequence. Without this exact mechanism, the story defaults to straightforward relic restoration. Cost: Mara commits to this iterative, symbol-based mediation rather than direct persuasion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is stated early and echoed at the end ("she keeps learning"). It enables Mara's receptiveness to the projection's instructions (fisherman, engineer, mayor knowledge) and justifies her iterative sculpture-building. The trait appears in two beats (label at setup, action cluster mid-story) but lacks on-page friction—no moment where learning costs her time, pride, or a competing value. Removing the label wouldn't break story logic; replacing it with "curious" or "adaptive" would function identically. Mid-band: functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reimagine" bookends the story: Mara ducks under the arch "to reimagine her route without screens," then closes pocketing the slide "already reimagining what else alliances can repair." The action defines her method (turning found objects into new configurations) and drives the spiral-carving beat. Two touches with reweighted meaning. Swapping for "rethink" or "redesign" would slightly dilute the artisan-specific connotation but wouldn't break mechanics. Present in setup and closure; shapes one middle turn. Solid integration, not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is both stated (Mara carves "symbols that can be read through layered meanings by anyone who has lived here") and demonstrated: fishhook as question mark, turbine blade as crescent, mitten as center. The method shapes the middle tactic—how she translates across factions—and is tested when the projection figures interpret the spiral and respond. Signaled at the key turn, active in two beats (carving, convergence). Removing it would leave the sculptures generic rather than multi-valent. Close to essential for this exact resolution path.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway shelters Mara's carving work, houses the lantern, frames the projection overlap, and becomes the physical convergence point where both gatherings "stand in the same light." It supplies the rust/kelp smell, wedges the lantern, and provides the "inner curve" for the slide image. Present in setup (discovery), middle (workspace), and closure (dual gathering). Specificity: "black stone," "broken jaw," archway's inner curve all matter. Removing it would require a different shelter and eliminate the "whole archway in the slide" callback. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" frames the inciting condition (Mara is lost, follows sound) and justifies the archway discovery. The timeframe pressure is storm-driven rather than GPS-clock-driven; the failed device doesn't return or constrain later choices. Present in setup, absent in development and closure. The story would function identically with "after the trail washes out" or any other navigation loss. Setup-only participation; functional but replaceable. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is both Mara's stated realization ("her craft is the language of this place, a way to scaffold complexity with simplicity when words turn tribal") and her enacted method: three plain sculptures encode currents, wind load, and sinkhole. The motivation drives the carving beat and the closure convergence (town reads the signs "as naturally as if they had always been there"). Present by implication in setup (collecting sticks), explicit in middle development, tested at closure. Removing it would leave Mara's role generic (messenger) rather than specific (material translator). Strong integration with visible cost: she forgoes direct speech.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" sets acoustic and atmospheric tone in the opening line and recurs at closure ("turbines start their steady hum again"). The phrase captures the liminal, meditative quality that persists through discovery and carving; tone modulates slightly (half laughing, half terrified; storm hammering vs. calmer gale) without breaking the dreamlike register. Diction ("timewoven," "thread that ties moments," "resonant") sustains the tone. Present in setup and closure; charges the final image by returning the hum as stability restored. One notch below essential: the specific phrase "turbine-hum reverie" could be replaced by "wind-hum trance" without major loss, but the tonal coherence it anchors is load-bearing.</comment>
