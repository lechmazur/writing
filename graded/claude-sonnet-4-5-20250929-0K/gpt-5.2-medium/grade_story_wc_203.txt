<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular—"the living lie with words, but dust never does"—with embodied observation driving micro-choices (kneeling to trace patterns, climbing the counter). Internal contradiction appears when responsibility is claimed as "weightless burden," a paradox that's felt rather than resolved. The ghosts function as pressure rather than mere atmosphere, and the choice to "engage" leads to the action of carrying out the barrel, a renunciation of evidence-taking that forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor slip: the barrel "warmed in my pocket like a small heart" risks sentimentality, but the prior particulars earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (abandoned circus, elevator repair work order, night). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns → ghost appearance → ceiling discovery → mainspring → modern cabinet → release/repair mark → departure, each beat layering density until the final image reweights the opening promise ("to discover what ceilings hide"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the protagonist seals the facade crack, quiets the shaft, and carries the barrel out as "a name tag for the time he had guarded," crystallizing the tension between repair work and spectral custodianship with visible cost (the object taken, the plaster marked). The causal chain is clean: crack in facade → thieves → hidden mechanism → modern cover → release → repair recommendation. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: the ghosts depart, the barrel remains, and the narrator's fatigue is named.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The circus ticket office constrains action: jammed service entrance forces the gap entry, the counter becomes a platform for ceiling access, the ticket window reflects phantom crowds at closure. Micro-setting details—"machine oil and sugared peanuts," "moth-eaten sequined coat," "ink-stained cuffs"—are filtered through the narrator's professional and spectral priorities. The mainspring barrel functions as both tool and recurring object, its weight and warmth charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves (floor → counter → ceiling void → control cabinet → door). The crack in the facade is established early, mirrors ceiling fractures, and drives the thematic closure when the narrator marks it for sealing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled in the opening and pursued through each beat. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: dust analysis → ghost engagement → ceiling exploration → mainspring discovery → mechanism history → cabinet opening → chain release. The tightening occurs when the protagonist opens the modern cabinet and cuts the zip tie, releasing the hidden chain; the cost is the responsibility to carry the barrel out as witness rather than evidence, and to mark the crack for sealing, which will "seal the leak between eras" and end the haunting. Agency is clear: the choice to engage the ghosts, to climb and search, to cut the tie, and to carry the object out all narrow options with visible consequence. One meaningful deepening: the ghosts' request transforms repair work into spectral custodianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between physical repair (elevator, facade) and temporal repair (sealing the leak between eras). The mainspring barrel shifts from hidden mechanism to "name tag for the time he had guarded," a non-literal answer to the central question of what ceilings hide: not just gears but epochs, not just secrets but the dead who guard them. The crack motif (facade, ceiling, time) charges the closure without overt statement. Subtext operates in the ghosts' wordless communication and the narrator's acceptance of "responsibility without a body." The final image—"the barrel warmed in my pocket like a small heart, reminding me why I keep looking up"—reweights the opening promise with earned complexity: discovery is also burden, repair is also loss. No thematic echo; the insights arise from concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with controlled distance; perceptual signature is职业-specific ("dust never does," gear marks matched to beam lines). Voice remains distinct under pressure: "I am skillfully observant because I have to be" carries both competence and fatigue. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—technical terms (mainspring barrel, zip tie, control cabinet) feel earned, not imported. The ghosts' silence and gesture create clean dramatic irony without head-hopping. Minor slip: "as lightly as lint on my sleeves" in the opening and "like a small heart" at closure risk poetic overreach, but the texture remains coherent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for dust analysis, pulled back for ghost engagement, intimate again for the final reflection. No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short ("She did not speak") to long accumulative ("My fingers found a small wooden box…sugared peanuts"). Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or spectral pressure. The text avoids loops and template cadence; each paragraph advances knowledge or stakes. Minor friction: "the quiet arrives like a curtain drop" and "dropped an inch, then settled, like a held breath finally released" lean slightly metaphorical for peak technical beats, and "the city lent me its dead, as lightly as lint" in the opening risks purple prose. Clarity remains strong throughout; spatial choreography (floor → counter → ceiling → cabinet) tracks without error. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and the final line recharges the opening promise without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator repair and ghost mediation feels specific to this narrator's dual competence; the premise transforms the haunted-building trope through occupational expertise (dust analysis, gear marks, control cabinets). The mainspring barrel as both mechanism and memorial object is a fresh inflection. The choice to "engage" ghosts as routine professional practice, and to accept "responsibility without a body," avoids the melodrama typical of ghost stories. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the wordless communication heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure—sealing the facade to end the haunting—follows from established particulars (crack, thieves, hidden lift) rather than convenience. Minor limitation: the "weightless burden" frame, while well-executed, echoes existing mediumship narratives; full transformation occurs through the repair-work lens rather than the spectral premise itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist established as elevator repair technician who sees ghosts in opening lines. Development: the choice to "engage" the ghosts drives the middle sequence—ghost woman points to ceiling patch, thin man shows payroll-lift history, both guide the search. Payoff: the protagonist accepts the barrel as "name tag" at the ghosts' request, a decision that transforms repair work into spectral custodianship and shapes the closure. Causal pressure: the dual competence constrains tactics (dust analysis, gear marks) and enables the final act (cutting zip tie, marking plaster). Irreplaceability: a standard repairman would not engage the ghosts; a standard medium would not read the technical evidence. Visible cost: carrying the barrel out forecloses the evidence path and accepts ongoing burden. Two gates (setup, development, payoff) met; causal work across at least two beats; closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: discovered mid-story in the ceiling void. Development: the thin man's ghost hovers over it, revealing its history as the payroll-lift drive; the protagonist examines it ("heavy for its size, the kind that stores coiled force"). Payoff: the barrel is carried out at the ghosts' request, "not as evidence but as a name tag," and warms in the protagonist's pocket "like a small heart" in the final line, recharging the custody theme. Causal pressure: its discovery unlocks the hidden mechanism's history and motivates the choice to carry it. Irreplaceability: a generic object could not anchor both the technical (mainspring function) and thematic (stored time, guarded epochs) work. Visible cost: accepting it as witness rather than evidence. Three gates met; appears in two distinct beats (discovery, departure); closure linkage strong; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "the painted clown face on the facade had cracked" in the opening paragraph. Development: the protagonist notes "hairline cracks in the ceiling plaster…mirrored the fractures on the building's facade" and later learns "a crack in the facade had let thieves see the hiding place," establishing causal pressure. Payoff: the protagonist marks "the cracked plaster with chalk so the restoration crew would repair it, because sealing the facade meant sealing the leak between eras." Causal work: the crack enables the theft backstory and creates the spectral "leak." Closure linkage: the decision to mark it for sealing ends the haunting and crystallizes the repair-as-closure theme. Irreplaceability: the crack functions both literally (structural flaw) and thematically (temporal breach). Three gates met; causal role in at least two beats; closure participation clear; cost is conceptual (ending the haunting by sealing time).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "I am skillfully observant because I have to be; the living lie with words, but dust never does" signals the trait early. Development: the protagonist kneels to analyze "dust accumulation patterns, tracing clean arcs where cables once swung," which leads the gaze upward to ceiling cracks—a causal beat. The trait enables matching "gear marks to dust-free lines on the beam" to locate the hidden cabinet. Payoff: the observation-driven search culminates in opening the cabinet and releasing the chain, directly shaping the closure. Causal pressure: skillful observation constrains the method (dust, not guesswork) and enables the key discovery. Cost: implicit in the ongoing burden of seeing what others miss (ghosts, hidden mechanisms). Three gates met; trait appears in two distinct beats; closure-enabling. Minor limitation: the trait is told once ("skillfully observant") and then shown, rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "I chose to engage" appears early when the ghost woman is encountered. Development: engaging the ghosts drives the middle sequence—the woman's eyes guide the protagonist to the ceiling patch, the thin man wordlessly reveals the payroll-lift history, both enable the search. Payoff: the decision to engage culminates in accepting the barrel "not as evidence but as a name tag" at the ghosts' request, which charges the closure and crystallizes the custodianship theme. Causal pressure: without engagement, the protagonist would lack the clues (ceiling patch, mechanism history) needed to solve the technical mystery. Irreplaceability: refusing engagement would strand the plot; a different action (e.g., "investigate") would not carry the relational and spectral weight. Visible cost: accepting responsibility for the dead's requests rather than evidence protocols. Three gates met; causal role across two beats; closure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "analyzing dust accumulation patterns, tracing clean arcs where cables once swung and thick drifts where air had been trapped" appears in the first third. Development: the method reveals the "square patch of ceiling where the dust lay thinner," prompting the climb and discovery; later the protagonist matches "gear marks to dust-free lines on the beam" to locate the modern cabinet. Payoff: the method's results (thinned dust, gear marks) enable the cabinet opening and chain release, directly shaping the closure. Causal pressure: the method constrains the search to physical evidence rather than spectral testimony alone, grounding the protagonist's dual competence. Specificity: dust patterns are concrete and technical, not generic investigation. Three gates met; method used in two distinct beats; closure-enabling. Minor limitation: the method is signaled and used but does not carry visible cost or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "abandoned circus ticket office, where the painted clown face on the facade had cracked" anchors location in the opening. Development: the setting supplies resources and constraints—jammed service entrance forces gap entry, the ticket counter becomes a climbing platform, the ceiling void holds the mainspring, the control cabinet is "bolted over the old mechanism." The ghosts (sequined woman, ink-stained man) are setting-specific remnants of circus history. Payoff: the ticket window reflects "crowds reflected there, queued for wonders" at closure, and the protagonist's decision to mark the facade crack for repair "seals the leak between eras," directly tying setting to thematic resolution. Causal pressure: the layered history (circus → payroll lift → modern cover) drives the mystery and the spectral haunting. Irreplaceability: the circus-specific details (sugared peanuts, sequins, clown face) charge the atmosphere and closure image. Three gates met; setting shapes two beats and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, the quiet arrives like a curtain drop" marks the temporal frame early. Development: the silence enables the protagonist to hear "the elevator shaft above us breathing, a slow metallic sigh timed to no power at all," which signals the hidden mechanism and motivates the climb. Payoff: the timeframe does not reappear at closure, though the final image ("the elevator in its shaft was quiet") echoes the earlier silence. Causal pressure: the buzz-off moment shifts perception and enables the auditory clue, but does not tighten a deadline or alter tactics under time pressure. Two gates met (setup, development); closure participation is thematic echo only, not active. Mid-band: functional in one beat but does not drive escalation or charge the ending with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "a single promise I never said aloud: to discover what ceilings hide" signals the motivation in the opening paragraph. Development: the promise drives the search—kneeling to trace dust, climbing the counter, reaching into the ceiling void, opening the control cabinet—each action pursues the hidden mechanism. Payoff: the final line, "reminding me why I keep looking up, listening for what ceilings still hide," recharges the motivation and reweights it with the burden of spectral custodianship, crystallizing the cost. Causal pressure: the desire to discover constrains the method (observation, not assumption) and sustains the search through multiple beats. Friction: the motivation is told once and then enacted, but internal conflict (wanting discovery versus fearing burden) is implied rather than dramatized. Three gates met; causal role across three beats; closure-shaping reprise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "weightless burden, responsibility without a body" appears in the middle third when the protagonist accepts the ghosts' request. Development: the tone is established through contradictions—"I felt my usual weightless burden" acknowledges routine spectral work, and the paradox (weightless yet burden) recurs in the final image ("the barrel warmed in my pocket like a small heart"). Payoff: the closing line, "reminding me why I keep looking up," sustains the tone of weary acceptance and ongoing responsibility, charging the ending with quiet fatigue rather than resolution. Coherence: the tone modulates from technical calm (dust analysis) to spectral patience (ghost engagement) to resigned acceptance (carrying the barrel), tracking pressure without melodrama. Three gates met; tone shapes the narrative stance and charges the final image. Minor limitation: the phrase "weightless burden" is stated once rather than embodied across beats, though the effect is sustained.</comment>
