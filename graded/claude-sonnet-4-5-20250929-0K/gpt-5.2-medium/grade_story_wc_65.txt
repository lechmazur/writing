<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jora is anchored by clear professional competence (mapping ignorance, predictive modeling) and internal contradiction appears in her tension between trusting systems and admitting doubt. Her backstory (father's fatal over-confidence) motivates her present stance via a single anchored block that tilts her choice to list uncertainties in margins. The final "promise to admit doubt and still move forward" reads as declared insight rather than dramatized pressure at the moment of choice. Micro-choices under pressure (setting the paper out, writing conditional sentences, showing margins to the Warden) demonstrate agency, but the peak beat lacks embodied tension—we're told she "let the silence press her into clarity" without witnessing the internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal/Accumulative hybrid: Jora's method (measuring, modeling, drafting conditional sentences) advances through because/therefore linkage, and the closure arrives when her charter leads to spring implementation and systemic transformation. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the first two paragraphs. Closure form is Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the villages transform iteratively, and the final image reweights her childhood vow into a working method. Cost is visible (confrontation with the Warden, the constraint of one page, risk of leading others astray) but felt cost at the climactic writing moment is muted—she simply dips the nib and writes. The causal chain from ignorance maps → model → conditional charter → spring results holds without breaks, and the single-page constraint meaningfully tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen lake and obsidian spire anchor place vividly and recur (ice singing, thaw water cracking open). Micro-setting details—wind cuts, fisher lights, salt sheds at choke points—constrain the modeling choice and are integrated through action. The kingfisher nib functions as a tool-as-setting element that charges the final act: its blue-barred sharpness and legend of writing the future press against Jora's empirical stance. Spatial choreography (threshold, chart room, shore walk, return to spire) tracks cleanly. The spring thaw image returns the spire and lake as environmental witnesses to transformation, meeting the 9+ quick test for setting constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: draft a one-page forecast charter that seeds innovation within a strict constraint without robbing villagers of adaptive freedom. Pressure tightens through the Warden's objection and Jora's need to convert forecast into action within the page limit. The moment "before the pen meets the blank page, when every option is perfect and therefore useless" is the narrative fulcrum, but it resolves via telling ("let the silence press her") rather than dramatized struggle. The spring payoff demonstrates that her charter worked—villages transform iteratively—yet that validation arrives off-page. Agency is present (she measures, models, drafts conditionals, defends margins to the Warden), and the cost of error (her father's fatal map) shadows the stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the model produces a pattern and she must compress it to one page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: naming ignorance enables adaptation; admitting doubt sustains transformation. The kingfisher nib, ignorance charts, and conditional sentences recur with reweighted meaning—tools that convert uncertainty into choice rather than prophecy. The final image of elders and youths arguing over data "with the same fire they once saved for legends" offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Jora's internal arc (child who watched fatal certainty → cartographer who maps gaps → author of conditional forecasts) is inextricable from the thematic question. The phrase "grounded imagination" risks label-speak, but it remains woven into action. No overt thesis statement mars the ending, and the quiet closure reweights prior material through spring implementation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Jora with a consistent elevated register ("ink had not yet met paper," "silence of the spire press her into clarity"). Perceptual signature is present—she notices wind cuts, counts lights, feels numbers "like bones warmed in her pocket"—but the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("small machine of meaning," "map of the future made from present facts") that reads more authorial than character-bound. The Warden's brief dialogue feels functional but underdeveloped; his objection and capitulation arrive quickly without subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately from reflective setup to focused action at the writing beat. Template-stem repetition appears in the middle third ("she overlaid," "she set," "she dipped," "she showed"), creating mild cadence monotony that nudges the score down.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully across the piece, with longer expository sentences in setup and compressed action at the writing moment. Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears: "turning absences into variables and feeding them into a slate of equations" slightly paraphrases "run predictive modeling on her own maps of ignorance." The phrase "she answered with grounded imagination, explaining" uses a near-abstraction where dramatized dialogue would sharpen the beat. Figurative language ("ink had not yet met paper," "bones warmed in her pocket," "small machine of meaning") is purposeful but occasionally stacks without payoff. No loops or text artifacts touch the closure beat. Sentence openings vary adequately, and paragraph structure creates visual rhythm. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping ignorance rather than coasts, using conditional forecasts to preserve adaptive freedom within a one-page constraint—offers a fresh angle on familiar material (expert versus tradition, innovation within limits). The "ignorance cartographer" role and the kingfisher nib's legend are specific inversions: she trusts neither prophecy nor the quill's magic, yet uses both as tools. The transformation test largely passes: the emotional arc of admitting doubt to enable action feels particular to this character and world. The spring payoff (salt sheds, sled routes, data arguments replacing legend-fire) synthesizes the premise into a resonant outcome. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. Minor hedging appears in "grounded imagination" as a prompt-facing label. Risk-taking in structure (extended setup, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jora is present throughout and drives key turns: she climbs the spire to model, walks the shore to gather data, overlays findings to produce a pattern, writes conditional sentences, and defends margins to the Warden. Her choices alter tactics (shift sled routes, build salt sheds at choke points) and the spring outcome validates her agency. Setup is immediate, development spans multiple beats (modeling, data walk, drafting), and payoff arrives when villages transform. The cost tied to her role is visible (risk of repeating her father's error, confrontation with tradition). Swappability is low—"ignorance cartographer" is irreplaceable. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's summary mode rather than a dramatized closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib is introduced early with vivid detail ("blue barred and sharp, taken from a bird that skimmed water and never froze") and legend. It recurs at the climactic writing moment ("she dipped the kingfisher nib") but its use is compressed into one beat. The nib's symbolic charge (guild legend versus Jora's empiricism) tensions her stance but does not constrain a mid-story choice. Closure linkage is present but understated—she writes with it, fulfilling the setup, yet the quill's properties (blue-barred, never-frozen origin) do not visibly shape the outcome. Two-gate integration (setup, payoff) supports mid-band; missing middle development caps higher scores. Lyric reprise is clean but lacks reweighted cost at the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is the core concept and shapes stakes: the one-page charter must forecast outcomes (grain yields, ice thickness, sled routes) without robbing adaptive freedom. The concept pressures tactics throughout—Jora runs models, measures data, writes conditional sentences rather than commandments—and the spring payoff demonstrates that her writing enabled transformation. Setup is immediate, development spans the modeling and drafting beats, and closure hinges on iterative transformation arising from her forecast. Cost is visible: if the forecast is wrong, villages suffer (echoing her father's fatal map). Swappability is low; the premise depends on this exact tension. Minor cap for the phrase "map of the future made from present facts," which restates the concept rather than dramatizing its final cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Grounded imagination" is named once explicitly ("she answered with grounded imagination, explaining...") and demonstrated through her method: she uses predictive modeling (grounded) to sketch many likely routes (imaginative). The trait enables the drafting beat—conditional sentences that convert forecast into action—and contrasts with the Warden's fear of robbing adaptive freedom. Setup is mid-story, development occurs at the explanation and drafting beats, and payoff arrives when the charter invites villagers to test and revise. Cost is implicit: balancing empiricism and possibility under the one-page constraint. Swappability is moderate—"pragmatic creativity" could substitute with minor edits. Label-only mention at the Warden confrontation nudges the score down; fuller dramatization of the trait's friction would lift it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Prevail" anchors the ending paragraph ("Jora prevailed, not by foretelling destiny, but by teaching a region to transform") and is earned by prior choices: drafting conditional forecasts, listing uncertainties, defending margins, and enabling spring implementation. The action redefines success as iterative transformation rather than static prophecy. Setup is implicit throughout (the challenge to seed innovation), development spans the modeling and drafting beats, and payoff is explicit. Cost is visible: she risks repeating her father's error and confronts the Warden's objection. Swappability is low—"succeed" or "win" would miss the thematic weight of sustained transformation. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's summary mode, which tells the prevailing rather than dramatizing a final on-page act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Predictive modeling is signaled early ("run predictive modeling on her own maps of ignorance, turning absences into variables and feeding them into a slate of equations") and its mechanics matter: the model produces a pattern (sled routes two miles east, salt sheds at three choke points) that alters village tactics. Setup is clear, development spans the data-gathering and overlay beats, and payoff arrives when spring results validate the model. The method constrains her choice—she must compress the model into simple levers (measure, compare, adjust, record, share, measure again)—and differentiates her approach from prophecy or tradition. Cost is implicit: if the model is wrong, lives are lost. Swappability is low; the concept depends on this exact method. Brief mention of "slate of equations" suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire by a frozen lake is introduced immediately ("Ice locked the lake into a dull mirror beneath the obsidian spire") and recurs: Jora climbs to the chart room, walks the frozen shore, returns to the spire, and witnesses spring thaw cracking the lake open. The setting supplies resources (chart room for modeling, shore for data) and pressures choices (ice thickness is a forecast target, the frozen lake's singing informs her data). The spire's "silence" is said to "press her into clarity" at the writing beat, but this is told rather than dramatized through environmental constraint. Closure participation is present (thaw water around the spire, lake cracking open) but ornamental—removing the spire would not break the logic. Two-gate integration (setup, mild closure reprise) supports mid-band; stronger causal linkage would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is named explicitly as the story's threshold ("Jora paused on the threshold where ink had not yet met paper") and reappears at the climactic moment ("the hardest moment was still before the pen meets the blank page, when every option is perfect and therefore useless"). It pressures the drafting beat by crystallizing the choice-paralysis, and the act of dipping the nib resolves it. Setup is immediate, development occurs at the writing beat, and payoff is implicit when she writes. The timeframe does not tighten tactics beyond this single moment—there is no live clock or deadline that narrows options. Cost is conceptual: the moment of infinite possibility must be forfeited to act. Swappability is moderate; "before committing" could substitute. Lyric reprise is clean but the timeframe does not constrain mid-story choices, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to seed innovation within a constraint" is explicit ("the council had ordered her to draft a one page forecast charter for the winter villages, a strict constraint meant to keep leaders from dreaming too loosely, yet she wanted to seed innovation inside that narrow border") and drives every beat: she models to find leverage points, writes conditional sentences to preserve choice, lists uncertainties in margins, and compresses the model into simple levers. Setup is immediate, development spans modeling and drafting, and payoff arrives when villagers test and revise the charter. The motivation is conflicted—she must satisfy the council's constraint while enabling adaptive freedom—and friction is visible in the Warden's objection and her defense. Cost is on the page: if she fails, villages lose trade and fuel or their freedom to adapt. Swappability is low; this exact tension shapes the premise. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage support high-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tone of "sustaining transformation" is coherent throughout: the piece opens with Jora paused at a threshold, moves through methodical modeling and drafting, and closes with iterative village transformation and data-driven gatherings. Tone modulates appropriately—reflective in setup, focused at the writing beat, expansive at the spring payoff—without static monotony. The final image (elders and youths arguing over data "with the same fire they once saved for legends") charges the transformation with cultural shift. The tone supports the closure by framing change as ongoing process rather than one-time victory. Setup is immediate (mapping ignorance, seeding innovation), development spans the full arc, and payoff is explicit. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's summary mode, which tells the transformation rather than dramatizing a charged final moment that embodies it.</comment>
