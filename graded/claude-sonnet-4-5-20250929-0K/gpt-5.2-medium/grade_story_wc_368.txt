<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maru's interiority carries specific embodied details ("new heart thudding politely," "quietly explosive") and her professional lens filters perception consistently. However, the donor-heart premise risks sentimentality and several beats summarize emotional states ("I hated how true it felt") rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses in action. The final vow feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the progression from watchful observer to active practitioner is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (valley, floating tea house, two months post-transplant) and maintains a coherent Accumulative lens: density increases through sun-trail dots, each revealing a fragment of Sairi's practice, culminating in the dye jar and morpho-wing spark that reweights Maru's understanding. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the vow to practice rather than hoard) with felt cost (renunciation of loudness, acceptance of caution). Minor causality slip: the morpho wing's "cold flash, like a warning" at midpoint is setup without clear payoff when the wing later sparks joyfully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house supplies vivid anchors (rope stair, brass prisms, outer deck over mist-wrapped valley) and micro-setting detail (mirror, lacquer tray, jar wedged in crack) that enable the sun-trail method and constrain Maru's movements across three mornings. Sensory hierarchy reflects dye-master priorities (color, shimmer, bleed). The final image—sparks illuminating mist-painted figures—charges closure by making abstract legacy concrete. POV filter is consistent; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning why stories magnetize) is signaled early and tightened through the sun-trail quest: each dot narrows understanding until the dye jar and morpho spark force the insight that stories stick to service, not volume. Agency is present but muted—Maru follows Eno's guidance more than she drives reversals herself. The vow at the end crystallizes stance with visible cost (accepting caution over chasing light), meeting Accumulative escalation requirements, though the protagonist's active resistance to the lesson is more told than dramatized in high-pressure choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (iridescent caution: light you hold safely versus light you hoard) emerges organically from Sairi's map, the poisonous-if-hoarded dye, and the morpho wing's sparks that illuminate only when shared. The final vow—"dye cloth like Sairi lived"—answers the magnetism question through specific images (glints, script, brief mist-paintings) without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the "quietly explosive" heart, the donor's unfinished journey, and the distinction between plot hook and practice. Minor slip: "valley-mist wonder rising through the floorboards" edges toward label-only lyricism in the closing line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maru's perceptual signature (dye-master noticing stains, color, bleed) filters consistently. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("iridescent caution," "sutures became honest scar"), though occasional phrases ("her name drew tales the way wet cloth draws indigo") feel slightly over-written for peak pressure. Eno's dialogue is minimal and functional; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "magnetize stories" and "plot hook" carry meta-narrative self-awareness that edges toward authorial intrusion rather than character-natural phrasing under the established lyric voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a blue morpho wing pressed flat in paper, shimmering even in shadow" anchors object, stakes, and tone). However, several figurative constructions cluster densely in the opening third ("shawl of mist," "patient lantern," "bloom into a different person") without pattern-teaching, edging toward purple. Minor paraphrase loop: "the donor had not given me a plot, but a practice" restates the magnetism lesson already visible in prior beats. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; prose is clean but occasionally weighted with metaphor during setup rather than peak action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor-heart recipient, dye mastery, and sun-trail cartography offers a fresh angle on legacy and craft. The premise avoids obvious beats (no ghost haunting, no literal conversation with donor) and instead grounds insight in tactile objects (morpho wing, mirror, dye jar) and a method (tracking light). However, the "stories magnetize toward service" moral calculus is not entirely non-obvious; the transformation lies more in specific world-building (floating tea house, sun-script ink) than in structural or thematic risk. The final image (sparks painting mist-figures) is memorable and particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maru the watchful dye master is present throughout and her professional lens (noticing stains, controlling bleed) filters perception. She makes the choice to visit the tea house and to follow the sun trail, and the final vow constitutes a stance shift. However, most key turns (Eno revealing the map, the sun trail's mechanics, the dye jar's properties) are delivered to her rather than driven by her agency; she is more observer than active decider until the closing beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in three beats: introduced as Sairi's last possession, flashes a "cold flash, like a warning" at midpoint, and its scales spark the dye jar at the climax to illuminate mist-figures. The object is handled on the page and its meaning evolves from relic to active agent. However, the midpoint warning is not clearly paid off—when the wing later sparks, the effect is joyful rather than cautionary—creating a minor coherence gap that limits indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is the story's thematic and mechanical spine: Sairi's practice, the healer's advice, the dye's properties (looks like joy but turns poisonous if hoarded), and Maru's final vow all hinge on it. The concept shapes stakes (learning to hold light safely) and tactics (following sun trails rather than chasing brightness). It appears early, drives the central question, and charges the closure image. Minor gap: the concept is more thematically resonant than mechanically tested in a high-pressure choice where caution must be weighed against risk on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is attributed to the new heart twice and echoed in the dye's sparks at the end. The trait colors interiority ("as if it might bloom into a different person") and the final image (sparks that do not burn but illuminate). However, it remains largely metaphorical; no on-page action is constrained or enabled by the heart's explosiveness in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The label enriches voice but does not drive visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Illuminate is the story's central action: Maru uses the mirror to throw light onto stone faces, each glint reveals Sairi's script, and the climactic dye sparks illuminate mist-painted figures of those Sairi helped. The action is signaled early (brass prisms, sun trails), shapes the middle quest (three mornings tracking dots), and defines the closure image. Removing "illuminate" would collapse the method, stakes, and thematic answer. The mechanics are on the page and causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is introduced via Eno's explanation (sun as storyteller, handwriting), demonstrated through the mirror-and-map method at midday, and executed across three mornings as Maru follows dots from cliff to cliff. The method is mechanically specific (moving the mirror until a ribbon of sunlight hits the map, glints answering on stone faces) and shapes the quest's structure. The sun-trail logic directly enables the discovery of the dye jar and the understanding of Sairi's practice, making it indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house anchors orientation (rope stair, rotating rock, outer deck, underside with crates) and supplies the spatial structure for the quest: Eno's guidance occurs inside, the sun-trail work on the outer deck, and the dye jar is found wedged in the underside crack. The setting's verticality (over emptiness) and the prisms charge the atmosphere. However, the tea house does not constrain choices under pressure—Maru could conduct the same quest from a stationary peak—so it functions more as atmospheric scaffolding than as a tactical pressurizer.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "two months after receiving the donor heart" anchors Maru's healing state (sutures not yet honest scar, healer's caution) and provides backstory context. However, the two-month marker does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the quest unfolds over "three mornings" with no urgency tied to recovery deadlines or donor legacy fading. The timeframe is present and logically consistent but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maru's motivation—to learn why some people magnetize stories—is stated early, dramatized through the tea-house visit and sun-trail quest, and answered in the climax (stories stick to service, not volume). The desire is conflicted with her dye-master habit (control bleed, keep beauty from ruining cloth) and the resolution requires her to vow a different practice. However, the friction between wanting magnetism and resisting Sairi's lesson is more narrated than enacted in high-stakes choices where the cost of each path is tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is coherent and sustained: the opening's "shawl of mist," the tea house drifting "like a patient lantern," the mist thinning to reveal pine and river, and the closing image of "valley-mist wonder rising through the floorboards" as sparks paint figures. Tone modulates appropriately (curiosity, caution, revelation) without breaking the lyric register. The final line explicitly names the tone, which edges toward over-articulation, but the atmospheric work throughout supports the closure image's charge.</comment>
