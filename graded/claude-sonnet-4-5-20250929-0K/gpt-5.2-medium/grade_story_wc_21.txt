<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clearly established—"not heroism but to uncover truth in tension"—and embodied choices appear (kneeling to arrange debris, negotiating redaction). However, interiority tilts toward poetic abstraction ("the air thickened and I slipped backward") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final negotiation with Lila earns the renunciation (redaction compromise) with visible cost, but the path feels more contemplative than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers archive discovery → retrocognitive vision → beach excavation → parley → diary retrieval in a pattern of deepening sensory immersion and textural density. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the water rises, the diary surfaces, and the trapped July releases—cost is legible in the release itself and the archivist's promise to redact until consent. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (zeppelin library, coast, 1963). One pressure slip: the parley feels ordained rather than fought-for, slightly softening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains the final choice (descent to black water, surface clicks, ripples as cipher key) and charges the closure image when it "rises like a hand offering its palm." The zeppelin library and dunes are vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail (kerosene, crushed sea grass, kelp commas, white pebble vowels). Beach debris and lagoon surface function as micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the encrypted diary and honor Lila's testimony—is signaled early and tightens through three beats: vision of Lila's moonlit encoding, lagoon discovery, parley negotiation. The protagonist's agency (arranging debris, promising redaction) forecloses the path of unredacted publication with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is moderate; the parley outcome feels collaborative rather than fought, and no live opposition forces a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as door not grave, testimony's tension between record and harm—emerges organically from the parley and the archivist's promise to redact. The final image (water offering, trapped July releasing, zeppelin thrum) answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the cipher-as-message motif and the retrocognitive trap as metaphor for archival responsibility. No label-speak intrudes; the resonance is non-literal and grounded in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV; distance is stable; perceptual signature ("paper as evidence and grief as a datum," "searing reverie") is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction remains within the archivist's register (solemn, analytical, sensory). Two frictions: "the past tugged harder" and "the air thickened" tip toward stock metaphor, and one phrase—"telling her that archives are not graves but doors"—flirts with thematic echo in the parley beat. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; information density is high; no loops or paraphrase cycles. Two mild overwriting signals: figurative language is dense ("slow, stitched cloud," "obsidian lagoon...a mirror so dark it seemed to drink starlight," "water rose like a hand") without pattern-teaching, and elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "parley," "searing reverie") occasionally drifts above plain archive-work register. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is vivid. Minor template cadence in the middle (repeated "and" openers) does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognitive archive work, cipher solved by lagoon ripples, beach-debris parley, redaction as ethical compromise—is specific and non-obvious. The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are fresh anchors; the emotional calculus (testimony vs. family safety) avoids easy binaries. Risk-taking (retrocognitive trap, non-linear time, arranging debris as syntax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications through closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Archivist present throughout; choices (board zeppelin, follow coordinates, kneel and arrange debris, promise redaction) create key turns. Setup early, middle development (lagoon descent), closure participation (negotiation and promise). Causal pressure moderate; the negotiation shifts from retrieval to ethical compromise. Cost is visible (redaction until consent). Swappability is low; the solemn archival stance colors every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lagoon seeded early (letters hint "black pool"), appears in retrocognitive vision ("obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes"), protagonist descends to it, its surface answers in ripples (cipher key), and it surfaces the diary at closure ("water rose like a hand offering its palm"). Three distinct beats; closure linkage strong. Causal pressure: ripples unlock cipher, enabling parley. Specificity high (obsidian, clicks, starlight-drinking mirror). Cost tied to retrieval.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Encrypted diary shapes stakes (uncover and decrypt), tactics (comparing code marks to protest manuals, reading ripples as cipher key), and closure (diary surfaces in tin box). Setup immediate, middle development (cipher work, ripple-key discovery), closure participation (tin box retrieval). Two beats; causal pressure moderate. Swappability low; the encryption-as-protection layer is load-bearing for the parley negotiation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap signals early ("slipped backward...trapped inside her July"), constrains action (protagonist experiences Lila's encoding, shares her perception), and enables the parley ("I realized I was not alone in being retrocognitively trapped"). Two beats; cost visible (involuntary immersion, "woke shaking"). Causal role: trap explains how Lila's voice persists and demands negotiation. Swappability moderate; another paranormal link could work, but the "lag between her last entry and my present reading" is specific.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Parley seeded ("she demanded a parley"), enacted on-page (arranging debris as syntax, lagoon ripples answer, negotiation over testimony and redaction), and resolves the dominant conflict (archivist promises redacted publication, Lila releases diary). Setup, middle turn, closure participation all present. Two beats; major turn traces to this action (shift from retrieval to ethical negotiation). Causal pressure high; removing parley breaks the closure's cost structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Method seeded in retrocognitive vision ("arranging beach debris as messages, spelling names with shell shards and driftwood"), re-enacted by protagonist ("I laid kelp for commas and white pebbles for vowels"), and lagoon surface "shivered and answered in ripples" (cipher key). Two beats; causal: arranging debris enables communication and unlocks cipher. Specificity high (kelp commas, pebble vowels, shell shards). Closure linkage: method enables parley and diary release.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zeppelin library present in setup ("boarded the zeppelin library...floating stacks"), used for cipher research ("comparing her code marks to marginalia"), and returns at closure ("steady thrum of the zeppelin above"). Two beats; causal pressure light (provides research venue, signals return transport). Lyric reprise reweights the ending (archivist will return diary "to the floating library so they could not be buried again"). Swappability moderate; any mobile archive could serve, but zeppelin adds tonal charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the letters were found" anchors the inciting incident immediately. The trapped July of 1963 constrains the retrocognitive vision and establishes Lila's historical moment. Closure references release ("the trapped July released me"). Two touches; causal: past events (deputies' offer, Lila's refusal, diary burial) drive present stakes. Time does not tighten tactics on-page (no live clock pressure). Lyric reprise (after → release) reweights the arc moderately.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to uncover truth in tension" is stated clearly ("My motivation was not heroism but to uncover truth in tension, to file what happened without smoothing the burn marks") and dramatized in choices: protagonist negotiates redaction (tension between full record and family safety), promises return to floating library (truth as door not grave). Setup, middle friction (Lila's fear "the record would be used to hurt the living"), closure participation (redaction promise resolves tension). Causal: motivation drives parley outcome and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone "searing reverie" is coherent from envelope seal ("burned my fingers with a scent of salt and smoke") through retrocognitive immersion ("kerosene and crushed sea grass") to parley negotiation ("I answered in searing reverie") and closure ("trapped July released me, leaving only the hiss of dunes"). Modulates with pressure: calm research, visceral vision, charged parley, quiet release. Charges final image (hiss, thrum). Diction and rhythm sustain the elevated, sensory register throughout.</comment>
