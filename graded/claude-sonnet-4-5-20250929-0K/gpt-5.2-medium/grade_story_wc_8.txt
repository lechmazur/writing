<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (repairing the lock, offering the exhibit compromise) reveal character under pressure. Hadrin's arc from protective concealment to admission feels earned by the dramatized exchange. The "emotionally rational" trait is mentioned but not consistently embodied in contradictory impulses; Mara's anger "tightened her throat" yet she remains measured without visible internal friction. The father reference risks instrumentalizing grief but stays within bounds as it tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The confrontation escalates through Hadrin's admission and Mara's counter-offer, narrowing to the bargain that recaptures the letter with annotations—a Decisive Change with visible cost (Hadrin's exposure, Mara's compromise on full truth). Orientation anchors (Mara, disused station, after the petal) arrive within the opening lines. The rosebush signal and ivy motifs charge the final image with seasonal metaphor, though the cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy-covered nameplates "like graves with green hair," cracked tiles, weeds "like slow smoke") and the lamplight stages the confrontation. The rosebush petal and bare branch bookend the piece, reweighting the seasonal metaphor at closure. Spatial choreography (Mara stepping closer, taking the satchel) tracks cleanly. The ivy "hid meetings from street level" subtly constrains secrecy, linking setting to stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the recapture of truth vs. civic stability, signaled in the opening paragraph. The confrontation tightens when Hadrin reveals the letter and Mara's parallel to dock strikes forces his admission of the "one small edit" spiral. The bargain (curated exhibit + annotations) narrows options with visible cost: Hadrin faces exposure, Mara accepts mediated truth. The hawk's judging gaze is a strong pressure image. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (noble lies vs. corrosive secrecy) emerges organically through the truce coercion, dock strikes parallel, and Hadrin's admission that "each year demanded another." The exhibit bargain offers a resonant answer without moralizing: truth with context, avoiding both silence and shaming. The crowned hawk reappears as a judging motif, charged at closure. Mara's father and "compliant" belief risks abstraction but stays concrete enough. Final image (bare rosebush, "recaptured past toward morning") reweights the seasonal metaphor without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (historian's eye for "marginal notes," archive details) but could be more distinctive under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Hadrin's "practiced sigh" and "protect people" carry subtext; Mara's request to read aloud dramatizes confrontation. "Fictional on paper yet stubbornly real" is a clever touch but slightly obscure on first pass. Register is consistent; no filter-verb stacks or expository clutter. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong images ("ivy overgrown...like graves with green hair," "weeds rose...like slow smoke"). Minor scaffold: "She was a historian...fictional on paper yet stubbornly real in her own routines and debts" reads as exposition mid-opening; the "fictional" claim is never paid off and distracts. "Emotionally rational even when anger tightened her throat" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. Sentence rhythm varies well. No loops or template cadence. Information density is high; most lines advance character or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core premise (historian confronting councilor over a stolen founding document) is familiar but executed with specific detail: the illuminated hawk initial, coercive truce vs. official story, River Riots to dock strikes parallel. The disused station and rosebush signal add texture. The "fictional on paper" phrase hints at metafictional risk but is not developed. The bargain (exhibit with annotations + Hadrin's preservation credit) feels fresh and credible. No bold structural risk; synthesis is solid but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (fictional historian) drives the confrontation: repairs the lock (setup), confronts Hadrin and draws parallels (middle), offers the exhibit bargain that recaptures the letter (closure). Her choices alter tactics and narrow options with cost. The "fictional" descriptor is present but unexplained.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in the fireproof cabinet theft (setup), is produced by Hadrin mid-scene and read aloud (middle), and the gold hawk initial judges Hadrin at the turn before Mara takes the satchel (closure). The hawk's crowned detail recurs with reweighted meaning, constraining Hadrin's choice. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Noble lies frame the conflict: the official truce story vs. coercive truth. Hadrin defends "some lies were noble" to spare children; Mara counters with her father's compliant belief. The concept shapes the bargain (annotations that teach without shaming) and is paid off when Hadrin admits the edit spiral. Present in setup, middle debate, and closure terms.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is explicitly labeled ("she still weighed it carefully, emotionally rational even when anger tightened her throat") but the trait is told more than shown. Mara's measured responses fit the label, yet we do not see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—anger and rationality are described as coexisting, not dramatized in conflicting micro-choices. The attribute influences tone but does not visibly constrain a pivotal action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Recapture" is Mara's stated goal from the opening ("to recapture a missing piece") and drives the confrontation structure. The action is completed when she "took the satchel gently" and promises to publish with annotations. It shapes the entire arc and redefines options (from hidden to contextualized truth). Swapping for "retrieve" or "recover" would weaken thematic charge but not break causality; still, the recapture metaphor ties to the broader rescue-from-pit framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By drawing parallels" is dramatized mid-scene: Mara "drew parallels between the River Riots and the recent dock strikes, showing how both began with hidden bargains." The method appears again in her exhibit proposal (placing the coercive truce "beside other hard peaces in history"). It shapes her persuasive tactic and is signaled early enough to matter, though it arrives in the middle rather than setup. The mechanics (comparison as argument) drive Hadrin's shift.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station appears in setup (title, opening lines, ivy-covered nameplates) and stages the confrontation throughout. The ivy "hid meetings from street level" and the rosebush petal signal provide minor tactical context. The cracked tiles anchor the bargain moment ("as plain as the cracked tiles"). The setting supplies atmosphere and secrecy but does not alter a key tactic with mechanical force; it is more crucible than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" anchors the opening and recurs at closure ("the rosebush stood bare"). Hadrin explicitly ties it to "another season of silence." The petal drop functions as a signal rather than a ticking clock that alters tactics; no urgency compresses decisions on the page. The seasonal metaphor reweights meaning at the end (bare bush, "toward morning") but does not tighten mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to rescue truth from a pit of lies" is stated early and dramatized through her repair of the lock, the confrontation, and the final bargain. The desire is conflicted: she "weighed [the comfort in the lie] carefully" and offers a compromise (annotations, not exposure) that balances truth and harm. Friction between want (full truth) and cost (civic unrest, Hadrin's dignity) is visible and shapes the closure choice.</comment>
