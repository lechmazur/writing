<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete and embodied through the inkwell and her mother's absence, with clear internal contradiction between professional duty and personal excavation. The interiority occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") that reads more poetic than character-particular under pressure. Beran's confrontation creates genuine stakes, and Lira's physical choices (wrestling the beam, shoving his skiff) reveal her hierarchy of values. The final cost—returning with the inkwell and marking stones that will preserve her hidden words—earns the stance crystallization, though the mother's vanishing remains more told than dramatically constrained on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the pavilion's submerged architecture, and recurring motifs (inkwell, notes, her mother's absence) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira escapes Beran, plants her final note, and returns to shore with the inkwell "warm against her ribs," crystallizing her commitment to chart absence rather than recover the lost. Cost is visible—she defies the council, risks confrontation, and commits to a solitary memorial project—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the first stone herself, feeling "time resisting her hands," then escalates when Beran's intrusion forces her to choose between retreat and completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze across silted tiles," pillars "lean like tired dancers," curtains of weed replace velvet. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves—steps to the skiff, threading through posts, the cloud of silt that blinds Beran. The pavilion actively constrains Lira's choices (she must row carefully, wedge notes into footings, navigate around Beran's skiff) and charges the final image when she surfaces on the far side with the drawbridge raised. The inkwell and silver mask function as micro-setting objects that ground the scene in tactile immediacy. Minor: "firm shore" recurs without evolving, and the city's silhouette at the end feels slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira seeks to preserve her mother's memory by mapping the drowned pavilion and hiding notes in its foundations. Pressure tightens when she places the first stone "while the river presses back," then escalates when Beran appears with a hook, demanding the inkwell and threatening to end her survey. The reversal—she shoves his skiff into a pillar, creating a silt cloud—is earned by her established determination and physical capability. The cost is visible: she defies authority, risks injury, and commits to a clandestine memorial that may never be acknowledged. The final choice to wedge the note "I am still listening" and escape to the far shore forecloses reconciliation with the council and locks her into solitary defiance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: absence as something "braided through every later memory" rather than a void, and the act of charting what vanished as a form of fidelity. The pavilion's drowned architecture and Lira's hidden notes dramatize the question of how to honor the irretrievable without dismissing it. The final image—masons setting stones where she marked them, her words binding the pavilion "back to memory"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: preservation is an act of stubborn attention, not recovery. The inkwell's survival "like a secret ember" and the note "I am still listening" avoid sentimentality through restraint and embodied action. Minor: "interlaced absence" and "archeologist of abandoned dreams" occasionally tip toward prompt-like articulation rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with Lira's perceptual signature evident in her professional lens ("rule and plumb line") layered with personal sensitivity. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though phrases like "interlaced absence" and "hushed blaze" occasionally elevate into lyric register that sits slightly above her surveyor idiom under stress. The single line of dialogue from Beran—"the survey is complete"—feels functional but generic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the confrontation when "she pivots and shoves his skiff into a pillar." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly during action beats and breathes during reflective moments, though some mid-paragraph clause stacking could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the prose carries high information density with strong verbs ("wrests," "threads," "wedges"). However, several lines exhibit template cadence and elevated register that flatten momentum: "stoically sensitive to every creak," "the missing is threaded with what remains and cannot be pulled free," and "a hushed blaze across silted tiles" stack figurative language without on-page payoff in choices. Paraphrase loop appears when "interlaced absence" is defined in one sentence, then restated in the next. Minor spatial clarity issue: "threading the skiff through the opening into the submerged pavilion" then "below the surface" creates slight redundancy. The opening and closing lines are strong, and no grammatical errors appear, but the cumulative register drift and phrase density in mid-passage reduce propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of surveyor + grief archaeology + submerged architecture + hidden notes offers a specific angle on memory and preservation. The premise avoids stock ghost-story or treasure-hunt templates by grounding the quest in bureaucratic defiance and tactile memorial-making. However, the core emotional arc—daughter seeks traces of lost mother in a drowned space—is familiar, and the transformation relies more on atmospheric detail than on a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk. The final image of notes hidden in foundation repairs is fresh and earned, and the choice to resist Beran rather than explain or negotiate shows character-specific boldness. The "interlaced absence" conceit and lyric diction lean toward poetic ornament rather than lived detail, slightly reducing particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's choices create every key turn: asking for the assignment, navigating to the pavilion, placing the first stone, hiding notes, resisting Beran by shoving his skiff, and escaping to plant the final note. Her decisions shape tactics throughout and drive the closure image—returning to shore with the inkwell, knowing her words will remain hidden in the foundations.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in setup (carried in her satchel, "brass worn smooth," ink "like a secret ember"), is used functionally in the middle (she writes notes with it, seals them in wax), and returns charged at closure ("warm against her ribs, as if the ember ink approves"). Three beats with evolving use; not merely ornamental. Its unique property—ink that survives and "will not wash away"—enables her method and emotionally anchors the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is named early ("interlaced absence, because the missing is threaded with what remains") and shapes Lira's tactics: she charts the pavilion's "pauses" and "shapes" rather than seeking recovery. It reappears at closure when she acknowledges "she cannot recover her mother, but she can chart the spaces left behind." However, the phrase itself reads more as thematic label than a constraint that narrows live options on the page; it colors her motivation rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The trait is named in setup ("stoically sensitive to every creak") and arguably shown when Lira "holds it tight, her sensitivity locked behind a calm face" during the confrontation with Beran. However, the stoicism vs. sensitivity tension does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with felt cost; it remains more descriptor than dramatized friction. The phrase itself leans into lyric register without on-page payoff in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice with causal weight: Lira "wrests the beam aside" to enter the pavilion (first turn), then "wrests his hook away" before shoving Beran's skiff (climactic reversal). Both instances narrow options and alter tactics under pressure. The action is specific and physical, not easily swappable; removing it would require rewriting the confrontation and entry beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("placing notes in foundation repairs, tucking each sealed strip between stone and mortar"), used in the middle when she "sets the first stone herself, pressing it into place," and shapes the closure when she "wedges a final note into a cracked footing" before escaping. The mechanics matter: she writes with the inkwell, seals strips in wax, and physically places them during her dive. The method is indispensable to her goal and the story's final image of masons setting stones where she marked them.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion pressures every choice: Lira must time her entry after the patrol leaves, navigate drowned posts, measure footings underwater, place stones against the river's push, and use the silt cloud for cover during Beran's attack. The environment supplies resources (the beam, the pillar, the cracked footing) and obstacles (trapped air, leaning pillars, silted tiles) that alter tactics across beats and charge the final image when she surfaces on the far side with the drawbridge raised between her and pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the title and opening: "After the drawbridge rises, the river hushes," Lira "waits until their oars fade," and the raised bridge later prevents Beran from following. The window tightens decisions—she must work at night when the patrol is gone—and the drawbridge's position bookends the sequence. However, elapsed time within the dive is vague, and the clock does not visibly narrow her moves beat by beat; it sets the opportunity rather than creating continuous pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation is named in setup ("to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") and dramatized through her actions: asking for the assignment, diving to the pavilion, measuring and marking, hiding notes. It conflicts with Beran's demand to surrender the inkwell and end the survey, forcing her to choose defiance. However, the phrasing "archeologist of abandoned dreams" reads more as lyric summary than a desire tested through contradictory wants; the friction is external (Beran) rather than internal (dream vs. cost).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone—quiet intensity, restrained lyricism—is established early ("the river hushes," "stoically sensitive") and modulates with pressure: contemplative during her approach, sensory during the dive ("moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze"), taut during the confrontation ("silt boiling up like smoke"), and resolute at closure ("her hidden words will bind the pavilion back to memory"). The phrase "hushed blaze" recurs purposefully to charge the lantern image when Beran is blinded. Coherent across turns without static monotony.</comment>
