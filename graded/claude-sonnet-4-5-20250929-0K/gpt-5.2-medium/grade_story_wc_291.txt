<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's face-blindness is told rather than embodied through concrete misrecognitions or compensatory behaviors under pressure. Internal contradiction exists (methodical artist vs. "to awaken dormant empathy"), but the motives never clash on the page in a way that forecloses options. Maren's confession arrives through dialogue summary rather than dramatized resistance, flattening the peak choice into exposition. The narrator's final offer ("I offer to paint...if she tells the truth") reads transactional rather than earned through prior struggle with her own blindness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~80 words, meeting the test. The drive lens reads Causal through the investigation sequence, but the climax depends on Maren's convenient emotional collapse after one metaphorical "lance" gesture rather than dramatized pressure that narrows her options. The closure unit (confession + offer to paint) lands on the page, but cost remains abstract: "unite guilt with grief" is asserted theme, not a visible forfeiture or reconfiguration with felt price. The ribbon's causal role (double knot → stagehands → troupe) is clean, but the final turn bypasses embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wine-red ribbon, calipers, gray paper, and tin-roofed rehearsal shed anchor the investigation convincingly. The quarry mist functions as more than atmosphere—it charges the entry into the shed and mirrors the protagonist's face-blindness ("in fog every person becomes any person"). The matching ribbon on the wall lance supplies a concrete constraint that pivots the interrogation. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (studio, quarry theater, shed interior), and the fog-muffled footsteps at dawn create sensory density tied to the POV's vulnerability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconstruct vanished dancers to "awaken dormant empathy") is signaled early but remains abstract until the shed confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon on the wall lance narrows Maren's options, but the escalation bypasses embodied resistance: the protagonist's pencil gesture is metaphorical ("lance the air...to pierce the rehearsed story"), and Maren's shoulders sag without a fought choice. Cost is declared ("unite guilt with grief") rather than paid through visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The investigation coheres under the Causal lens, but the climax substitutes symbolic gesture for pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of recognition beyond vision—building "a whole from contradictions" when literal sight fails—emerges organically from the ribbon's double knot, the witness opposites (broken-glass laugh / gentle hand), and the protagonist's methodical columns. The final contrast ("I am face blind and still I have learned to hold a person...by their contradictions") resonates without moralizing, and Maren's inability to "name the dancers as people rather than roles" answers the thematic question through concrete failure. The ribbon-as-evidence motif reweights prior material when it reappears on the lance, charging the closure image with the cost of Maren's erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person voice carries distinct diction ("furrowed hush," "lance the air with my pencil tip") and a methodical perceptual signature (columns, rows, plumb checks). Psychic distance remains stable, and the face-blindness filters observation consistently. Two weaknesses lower the score: Maren's dialogue summary ("she confesses that during the Masque she lured...") compresses the climax into exposition rather than letting speech pursue and evade goals, and the narrator's offer ("I offer to paint...if she tells") reads stiffly formal at peak pressure. Filter verbs ("I ask her," "I tell her") cluster in the final third without adding immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Information density is high—nearly every sentence advances investigation or character—but three artifacts dull momentum. Template cadence: "I accept because...and because I suspect" followed by "Sato says...and the judge wants" stacks parallel clauses across adjacent lines. The climax compresses Maren's confession into summary ("she confesses that during the Masque she lured the dancers...panic did the rest") rather than dramatizing the pivot beat. A paraphrase loop: "by unifying opposites, we can unite guilt" repeats the core metaphor within two lines without added pressure. The opening anchor and caliper imagery are vivid, but the final third loses propulsion to exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of face-blindness with forensic reconstruction through "unifying opposites" offers a fresh angle on cold-case investigation, and the masquerade-theater setting avoids generic procedural backdrops. The double knot as stagehand signature and the prop lance's reappearance are specific, non-obvious beats. Risk: embedding the detective's vulnerability (fog makes "every person becomes any person") into the climax scene heightens stakes credibly. The thematic calculus—Maren saw dancers only as "light bodies to move"—transforms the premise beyond surface novelty, though the "awaken dormant empathy" motivation echoes therapeutic language common in contemporary short fiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist frames the investigation method (columns, opposites) and makes the key decision to go to the quarry at dawn, but the climactic offer to paint the dancers in exchange for truth is transactional rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The trait shapes two beats (drawing from witness opposites, interpreting the ribbon knot) and appears in the closure argument, meeting setup-development-payoff, but the final choice bypasses embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The masquerade mask ribbon fragment appears in four beats: arrival on the table with pond-water smell, analysis of the double knot, reappearance as matching strip on the wall lance (the turn), and implicit presence in the closure argument ("by unifying opposites...the ribbon fragment escaped her"). Early signal, causal pressure (knot type → stagehands → troupe), and closure linkage all present. Specificity (wine-red, frayed, double knot) makes it irreplaceable. Cost connection: Maren's failed erasure centers on this object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cold cases shapes the setup (evidence disappears, old photos gone, "just this ribbon") and the stakes (judge wants "procedural silence"), but the investigation itself plays out as a standard interrogation rather than tactics uniquely constrained by cold-case conditions. The ten-year gap matters narratively but does not alter on-page choices—Sato's memory and the ribbon drive the same beats a fresh case would. Present across two gates (setup, implicit in closure), but swappable with "covered-up case" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Very methodical" constrains the protagonist's approach in three beats: the studio ledger "reads like a lab notebook," the witness-statement columns and rows that build the masked figure, and the request to "recount, again, every detail." The trait enables the breakthrough (double knot recognition) and contrasts with Maren's improvisational panic, charging the climax argument. Visible tradeoff: methodical reconstruction cannot supply empathy directly, forcing the final bargain. Early signal, causal work, closure participation all met.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lance" appears as the missing prop in Sato's admission, reappears physically on the wall with the matching ribbon (the turn that narrows Maren's options), and is metaphorically invoked in the climax gesture ("lance the air with my pencil tip"). The broken lance hidden under slate is the physical evidence that ties Maren's confession to the accident. Three beats, causal pressure (missing prop → wall prop → metaphor → confession), closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable: removing "lance" collapses both the investigation turn and the thematic piercing image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is stated as the protagonist's method early ("my work has always been done by unifying opposites"), demonstrated in the witness-column technique (laugh + gentle hand → mouth lines + finger spacing), and recurs in the closing line ("by unifying opposites, we can unite guilt with grief"). Setup and payoff clear, but the method's mechanics in the middle beat read more like description than a constraint that shapes failed attempts or tactical shifts. The lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting the score into mid-6s despite minimal mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadowed quarry in mist functions across three beats: Sato's account ("night of fog and music"), the dawn approach where mist "muffles even our footsteps" and makes "every person becomes any person" (charging the protagonist's vulnerability), and the tin-roofed rehearsal shed where the troupe still gathers. The fog directly constrains the protagonist's ability to rely on recognition, forcing reliance on the drawing. The quarry edge is the accident site, shaping Maren's confession. Micro-setting (mist, shed interior) alters tactics and charges the final confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" frames the inciting event and urgency (shredded case file last week, judge wants silence), but elapsed time within the investigation is not tracked. The ten-year gap since the Masque matters thematically but does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressures Sato or the protagonist to act faster. The timeframe seeds setup and implicit closure stakes (town has looked away for a decade), meeting two gates, but does not alter middle tactics or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy in a town that learned to look away" is stated as the protagonist's private reason in the opening but never dramatized through conflicting choices. The motive does not face friction—no moment where awakening empathy costs the protagonist safety, time, or method. The final offer to paint the dancers aligns with this goal but reads transactional rather than a sacrifice. Present in setup and echoed at closure ("let the town finally feel"), but told-only; no visible want-versus-cost pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears explicitly once ("In a furrowed hush I spread calipers...") and modulates coherently through the investigation: the mist-muffled footsteps, Maren's "kindness practiced to a shine" that cracks, and "the hush that follows" the pencil-lance gesture. Tone charges the final image (confession breaking the rehearsed silence), but the single static phrase and limited tonal range across turns keep the score mid-band. The tone supports pressure without dynamic modulation under peak stress.</comment>
