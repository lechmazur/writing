<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's embodied nervousness (walking backwards) is concretely shown and drives micro-choices; his combative tenderness toward Mara reads as consistent character logic. Mara's arc from pride to vulnerability is earned through on-page action—her shaking fingers, annotations growing steadier—and the final moment where she looks "less like a thief and more like a child who wants to come home" lands with visible cost. Internal contradiction operates throughout (Lio's hatred of the system versus his willingness to mentor; Mara's scorn versus her fear), and the final choice to speak her name is motivated by prior pressure. Minor deduction for occasional label-reliance ("combative tenderness") that edges toward therapy-speak, but the embodiment in gesture and dialogue mostly earns it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening beat (library, Lio, reversible exile premise) and the dominant stake—Mara's need to reverse exile—is clear. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through annotation ritual, shadow manipulation, and Mara's steadying strokes until the tag falls away as Charged Poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tag falls; she speaks her name; the door-shaped shadow opens) with felt cost (she must choose the angle where she looks afraid). One meaningful deepening occurs when her annotations straighten the trapped shadow. Minor causality slip: the mechanics of how leaf geometry aligns with shadow to flip the balcony scene are asserted more than dramatized, creating a hinge that feels more magical convenience than earned logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library functions as micro-setting, supplying tools (cracked teacup, glass pane, shard-mirrors) that constrain and enable Lio's method. The brass exile tag, teacup, and glass pane recur with purpose; the playground swing outside bookends the piece and reinforces the mood of suspension. Spatial choreography is clear (table, door, lamps, swing outside) and sensory detail is selective (dust smell, swing creaking). The trapped afternoon shadow and shard-mirrors charge the final image when Mara aligns them. The setting pressures Mara's choice: she must work within the archive's geometry to reverse the sentence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mara's reversible exile; secondary is Lio's commitment to mentor despite hating the tribunal's cynicism. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Mara's initial scoff, her shaking fingers, her wobbling letters, then her choice of the afraid angle. One meaningful tightening occurs when her strokes stop shaking and the shadow straightens into a door. Agency is clear—Mara selects the mirror shard, annotates with care, speaks her name—and the tag falling is visible cost. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the piece deepens rather than reverses. Minor gap: the consequence of failure is told ("the exile becomes permanent") but never tested on the page, so the stakes feel declared rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: resilience as practice, the city's cynical mercy, and the power of choosing to see oneself as afraid rather than pretending strength. The annotation ritual, shadow manipulation, and leaf geometry function as concrete metaphor without heavy-handedness. Lio's final instruction—"not as a pardon, but as proof you can return and keep returning"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The shard-mirrors and geometry of tea leaves reweight the premise (angles change witness, practice oils hinges) and Mara's choice of the afraid reflection earns the thematic payoff. Subtext operates in Lio's backwards walking, Mara's brass tag held up defiantly, and the playground swing's hush framing the quiet victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Lio with tight access to his nervousness and his reading of Mara. Diction is purposeful and voice-particular ("combative tenderness," "shard-mirror archivist," "pride makes its own key"), though occasional elevated phrasing ("the spell behind them survives") edges into lyric register that risks distance drift. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Lio's "you must also learn which words spit back" and Mara's snarl that "writing will not feed her" carry subtext and advance the conflict. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is stable. Minor deduction for a few filter verbs ("he notices her fingers shake") and one moment of summary exposition ("His job as archivist is to catalog...") that flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm supports the quiet intensity of the scene. Information density is high in most beats (the glass pane traps the afternoon shadow; leaf geometry aligns with door-shaped shadow). Opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes effectively. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: paraphrase loops appear ("he agreed to mentor resilience quietly" is restated conceptually when Mara asks "how a library can fight a tribunal"), template cadence runs in exposition blocks ("He has annotated thousands... the margins never tell him..."), and the long opening sentence chains modifiers without clear propulsion. The phrase "combative tenderness" is repeated verbatim three times, reading as thematic label rather than fresh perception. Figurative density in the first third (lung holding breath, shard-mirror, spell behind exile) risks overwriting without pattern payoff. Apply −0.9 for combined loop, template, and metaphor-string issues across the first and middle thirds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist premise and reversible exile system are fresh, specific syntheses; the geometry of tea leaves as resilience training avoids generic magic-school tropes. The backwards-walking nervous tic and the trapped afternoon shadow are concrete, non-obvious particulars. Combative tenderness as tone is a purposeful oxymoron that charges the mentor relationship. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications (annotation steadies the hand, the hand steadies the shadow, the shadow opens the door). Minor derivative trace: the "mentor teaches outcast child to overcome unjust sentence" frame is recognizable, but the specificity of shard-mirrors, leaf geometry, and the tag falling away transform it enough to avoid template fatigue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lio's archival role is signaled early (unlocks door, lays out tools, annotates shard-mirrors). His decision to mentor Mara drives the scene; his choice to give her annotation work rather than merely observe is the engine of her change. He appears in the closure beat (smiles, hands her the pen, instructs her to annotate the day). Three beats: setup, middle instruction, and ending instruction. Causal pressure: without his method, Mara has no path to reversal. Cost: he walks backwards, bracing for the city to strike, and his hatred of the system remains even as he acts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass pane trapping the afternoon shadow is introduced in the first third (Lio lays it out, explains it belongs to the hour Mara was sentenced, it writhes when her name is spoken). Mid-scene, he slides it toward her and the trapped shadow twists into the balcony outline. At closure, Mara and Lio press the mirror shard to the glass pane, aligning leaf geometry, and the balcony scene flips. Three distinct beats; the shadow's transformation is causally active, enabling the door-shaped opening. The object's unique properties (trapped time, reacts to name, flips when aligned) make it irreplaceable. Strong integration; cost is tied to Mara confronting the trapped moment of her sentencing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile is introduced immediately (Mara was cast out; the sentence can be undone if she learns to stand without being held). It shapes the dominant stake: Mara must reverse the exile or it becomes permanent. The concept constrains Lio's method (create a new angle of that moment the city cannot ignore) and Mara's actions (annotate with steady strokes; choose the afraid angle). Closure directly enacts the reversal: the tag falls away when she speaks her name into the opening. Three gates met; causal pressure throughout; the story's logic collapses without this exact concept. Slight swappability with "conditional curse" or similar, preventing full 9+, but the specificity of "reversible" and the city's cynical mercy angle elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's backwards walking is introduced early ("When he is nervous he walks backwards, heel to toe") and recurs three times: when Mara arrives, when he gives her work, and at the ending ("still walking backwards a step as if bracing for the city to strike"). It embodies his anxiety and mistrust of the tribunal; it constrains him socially (he hates that she sees it). The trait charges the final beat, where his backwards step contrasts with his smile and the tentative hope. Two-plus beats; visible cost (vulnerability, self-consciousness). Does not enable a decisive turn but deepens characterization and tone. Mid-7s appropriate for embodied recurring trait with cost but modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Annotation is the action that drives escalation. Lio instructs Mara to annotate the tea-leaf geometry; her wobbling letters are coached ("Steady, because the city watches"); as her annotations grow, the shadow in the glass responds, straightening into a door. The final instruction is to annotate the day itself as proof. Three beats; causal pressure is unmistakable (annotation steadies hand, hand steadies shadow, shadow opens door). Closure turns on this action. The specificity (annotation as practiced geometry) makes it irreplaceable; swapping for "draw" or "trace" would require rewriting the archivist premise and the margin/ledger motif. Strong cost linkage: tremor equals unfitness; steadiness equals agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced mid-scene when Lio pours water over bitter leaves and tells Mara "we work by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves the way sailors read constellations." Mara describes triangles and spirals, annotates them beside her name, and the leaf lines align with the door-shaped shadow. Two beats (introduction and use); the method shapes Mara's attempt and the mechanics of reversal. The sailing-constellation analogy adds specificity. Slight late arrival (not in the first third) and the mechanics of how leaf geometry translates to shadow-flipping remain somewhat abstract, preventing high-8s. Solid causal role and irreplaceability lift it into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library is named and described early (side door, reading lamps, dust smell, Lio as archivist). It supplies the tools (cracked teacup, ink, glass pane, shard-mirrors, old ledgers) that enable Lio's method. The library's archival function constrains the approach: annotation, margins, remnants cataloged. It pressures Mara (she flinches at the smell of dust; the exile tag dangles in this space). Closure occurs within the library (the tag falls inside; the swing outside frames the hush but the victory is interior). Three beats; strong resource and constraint role; the setting's identity as forgotten archive is thematically charged (city that pretends it has no past). Irreplaceable at the concept level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" bookends the piece (opening and closing paragraphs) and the swing creaks once mid-scene to measure passing minutes. The "hush" and suspended moment reinforce the tone and thematic pause before change. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; the scene unfolds at tutorial pace without urgency. Lyric reprise reweights the mood (opening suspension → closing release as the tag falls), but the time element itself does not alter tactics or constrain choices. Mid-band for purposeful framing without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to mentor resilience quietly is stated early ("he agreed to mentor resilience quietly, one child at a time") and dramatized through his actions: unlocking the door, laying out tools, giving Mara work, coaching her annotations, and finally handing her the pen. His hatred of reversible exile creates friction (he hates the system yet participates) and his nervousness embodies the cost (walking backwards, bracing for the city to strike). The motivation drives the scene's structure and constrains his method (quiet, incremental, one child). Three beats; visible friction between desire and cost. Slight tell-heaviness in the opening statement prevents higher score, but the dramatization through scene action is strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is announced as the language Mara respects and demonstrated throughout: Lio reads the exile tag "gently and with teeth"; he snaps that "hunger is the first lie exile teaches" after she snarls; he admits "the city will call it your fault" when she asks about failure; he smiles while bracing for the city to strike. The tone modulates with pressure (sharp instruction when she wobbles, quiet approval when she steadies, charged encouragement at the end). It charges the final image (exhale, backwards step, smile, pen handed over). Coherent across turns; the oxymoron is embodied in action and dialogue rather than label-only. Strong integration; the tone is irreplaceable to the mentor dynamic and closure affect.</comment>
