<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation—decode the temple—is clear and embodied through dream chronicling, but interior texture is thin and sometimes generic ("midnight solace that lets pain be spoken"). Nera's grief is told more than shown in micro-choices; the scene where the narrator takes her hands and promises to carry part of her burden reads as therapeutic assertion rather than dramatized cost. The final act (traveling to the temple, performing the rite) contains decisions, but the narrator's own contradictory impulses remain largely off-page. Stock phrasing like "quiet weight settling into the ribs" and "carries forward with realistic inertia" slightly flatten voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: observatory watchkeeping → lucid dream → translation → temple rite. The closure—"decoding was not conquering a secret but keeping faith with it"—offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the decode-mission stake with conceptual cost (the burden of perpetual witness). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line. However, the dream sequence is somewhat loose causally: the variable stars "pulse," then "turn carvings into lit syllables," and the narrator "spoke the syllables aloud"—this chain feels more asserted than dramatized, and the brother's message arrives as exposition rather than earned friction. The rite at the temple lands the closure cleanly, but the midpoint connective tissue is thinner than the high-band gate requires.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory—salt flats, rotating maps, brass instruments—is anchored early and returns at closure. The dream temple courtyard offers vivid sensory detail ("pulsing stars like slow breathing," "air cooled as if exhaling"), and the variable stars constrain the narrator's decode method. The daylily-pressed telegram and Nera's brother's field journal function as small recurring objects that charge key beats. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the observatory itself does not constrain a choice until the very end (Nera reads under the dome); much of the middle uses the dream courtyard as the active setting, which slightly dilutes the title location's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode before erasure—is signaled in the opening third. The piece tightens once: the narrator enters the lucid dream, decodes the star-timing inscriptions, and translates them for Nera, which enables the temple rite. The rite itself (two witnesses, speaking and listening) is the on-page cost that forecloses solitary mourning. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through the observatory → dream → translation → temple sequence. However, the middle turn (the dream decode) feels more revelatory than contested; the narrator succeeds without visible friction or trade-off, and the cost materializes only at the rite. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation feels modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—shared witness divides grief—emerges through the star-timing decode, Nera's brother's warning, and the final rite. The closing line, "decoding was not conquering a secret but keeping faith with it," offers a resonant reconfiguration of the decode mission without moralizing. Subtext operates in Nera's faltering voice and the narrator's answering phrases. However, the temple-as-vault metaphor is stated rather than enacted ("the temple was a vault for grief"), and the rite instructions arrive as exposition in the dream. The final image—variable stars as a "schedule for returning"—reweights prior material with conceptual cost, but some thematic articulation reads closer to assertion than emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—charting stars, lucid dreaming, chronicling—is distinct. Diction is often elevated and lyric ("chronicles are also vessels," "particular midnight solace"), which suits the contemplative mode but occasionally slips into generic abstraction ("words are bridges in that place"). Dialogue is minimal (Nera's journal reading, the narrator's answering phrases) and serves function without strong subtext. Under peak stress (the dream decode, the rite), sentence rhythm compresses naturally. No filter-verb stacks or major POV leakage, but the narrator's voice feels more consistent than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; no major loops or scaffold. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. However, a few stock metaphors appear: "ship stalled in black water," "quiet weight settling into the ribs," "pain from the living and store it in ritual." The phrase "midnight solace that lets pain be spoken" reads slightly generic. The dream sequence employs purposeful compression ("each pulse struck the carvings, turning them from silent grooves into a sequence of lit syllables"), and the final image is concrete. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated register occasionally drifts toward abstraction without POV-specific grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination—lucid dream chronicler, variable-star decode, grief rite—is fresh and specific. The temple-as-vault premise and the two-witness structure offer a non-obvious synthesis. However, the core frame (decode ancient inscriptions via dream logic, discover a ritual for shared grief) leans on familiar quest-and-revelation templates. The emotional turn—grief divides when witnessed—is earned but not startling. The story commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the middle decode beat (stars pulse, syllables appear, brother's message arrives) feels more convenient than risky. One fresh inflection is present in the "schedule for returning" image, which reweights closure without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler trait is signaled in the opening line, enables the dream decode (middle beat), and shapes the closure rite (the narrator reads and answers). The narrator's choices—enter the dream, translate star timing, perform the rite—create key turns. Three beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; specificity high. Not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in the opening beat ("Nera slid a daylily-pressed telegram across my desk") and returns once ("I laid the telegram beside the star charts"). The petals-as-seal detail is vivid but ornamental; the telegram conveys the temple-crumbling news but does not constrain later choices or reweight at closure. Two touches, but no causal pressure or cost linkage. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens frames the opening conversation ("I took her hands, named her grief plainly, and promised to carry part of it"), drives the decode discovery (the temple rite requires two witnesses), and articulates the closure ("shared burdens…make a narrow path where two sets of footprints can keep each other from vanishing"). The concept shapes stakes (decode the rite), tactics (Nera reads, narrator answers), and the final image (returning schedule). Three beats; causal pressure; closure participation; cost legible. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is mentioned in the opening third ("I had always been said to heal with words") and enacted once when the narrator takes Nera's hands and names her grief, enabling Nera to sleep and the narrator to proceed to the dream. At the rite, the narrator "gave her words to hold on to." Two beats; modest causal linkage (Nera sleeps → dream proceeds); no visible on-page cost tied specifically to this trait. The phrase "said to heal" is passive and told. Functional but modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Witnessing is the story's fulcrum. The temple inscriptions encode a "rite of witness," the narrator decodes it, and the closure rite enacts it: "one person speaks the dead one's story, another listens, and the burden divides." The action shapes the opening stake (decode the inscriptions), the middle turn (decode the rite), and the climax (perform the rite at the temple). Three beats; causal necessity; closure cost ("the air in the sanctuary cooled as if exhaling"). Not swappable. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Variable stars are introduced in the opening third ("variable stars, whose brightening and dimming matched the carved spirals"), enable the dream decode ("the variable stars pulsed like slow breathing…turning them from silent grooves into a sequence of lit syllables"), and return at closure ("the same variable stars flickered above the broken roof…a schedule for returning"). Three beats; the method is specific and irreplaceable (star-timing unlocks the script); causal pressure at the decode beat; closure image charged. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory is anchored in the opening line and returns at closure ("back toward the observatory"). The dome hosts the rite rehearsal ("under the rotating maps she read passages"). The setting supplies resources (star charts, brass instruments) and frames the narrator's role, but it does not constrain a choice until the final act. Two beats (opening frame, closure return); modest causal work. The dream temple courtyard does more active setting work in the middle. Functional, nearly essential, but not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" appears as a lyric marker in the dream beat ("When understanding dawns, it does not arrive as sunlight…but as a quiet weight") and as the closing reflection ("I understood that decoding was not conquering"). The timeframe is abstract rather than tracked; no live clock tightens decisions. The piece uses night markers ("midnight watch," "third night," "next new moon") to pace events, but these do not create urgency. Lyric reprise reweights, but no tactical pressure from time. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—decode temple inscriptions before wind and looters erase them—is stated in the opening third ("my motivation was simple and fierce") and drives all major beats: the narrator charts, dreams, decodes, and performs the rite. The stakes are clear and urgent. The final image reframes the decode mission as "keeping faith" rather than conquest, which is a cost (perpetual witness duty). Three beats; causal necessity; closure cost legible. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Midnight solace is seeded early ("I kept the midnight watch") and articulated at the rite ("that particular midnight solace that lets pain be spoken"). The tone is contemplative, nocturnal, and elegiac throughout; it coheres across turns and modulates with the narrator's discovery and the rite's emotional weight. The closing image—stars as a returning schedule—charges the tone with quiet duty. The phrase "midnight solace" itself is slightly generic, but the tone's effect on the final image is strong. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
