<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is present but highly abstract, relying on philosophical language ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions") rather than embodied contradiction. The narrator's decision-making appears declarative and resolved rather than contradictory in the moment. Interior voice remains consistent but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would demonstrate genuine stakes. No secondary character is present, so relationship bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words (witness, temple library), so no penalty applies. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator stabilizes the dictionary definitions and climbs back through the well with a sense of duty replacing escape, crystallizing a new stance. Cost is conceptual (duty vs. escape, honesty vs. illusion) but felt rather than visceral. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates density through spiraling reflection and resolves through cadence shift and image reconfiguration at the end. The lens holds, though causality is impressionistic rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The temple library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (stone doors, incense, dust, circular shelves, central well, mirrors below). The dictionary is handled twice (opened, traced) and its shifting definitions constrain the narrator's spiral arbitration process. The well and staircase structure the narrative journey, and the mirrors below force the narrator to confront multiple pasts. The setting constrains choice and charges the final climb, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: unraveling cosmic illusions after the universe's hiccup. The spiral arbitration process provides one meaningful deepening as the narrator moves from examining mirrors to stepping into the spiral's center, unifying contradictions. However, escalation is impressionistic; the narrator's agency is declarative ("I swore," "I realized") rather than tested by live opposition or costly choice in scene. The resolution (stepping into the center, climbing back) feels ordained rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—reconciling contradictions and unifying fractured truths—emerges from the spiral diagrams, mirrors, and the dictionary's stabilizing definitions rather than statement. The final image (climbing back with the dictionary, feeling duty rather than escape) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to arbitrate paradox. However, the thematic work relies heavily on abstract philosophical language and metaphor rather than concrete particulars, and the narrator's insights are articulated rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent distance and perceptual signature (philosophical, reflective, precise). The phrase "wanderingly exact" is embodied in the narrator's deliberate attention to each footfall and breath while the mind roams through memories. However, diction drifts into elevated philosophical register throughout ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions," "unified truths") that reads more like essay than lived experience. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's voice remains abstractly literary rather than character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but multiple lines loop conceptually: "spiral arbitration" is explained twice in adjacent passages, and "cosmic illusions" recurs without deepening. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I realized," "I heard") stack in the final third. Figurative language is dense and sometimes mixed: "threads rose like threads" is circular, and "memory refusing to fade" + "rose from sand and shadow" competes for vehicle. Template cadence appears in the mirror sequence ("each mirror I saw," "each term," "at every loop," "at every narrowing"). Apply −0.8 for loops and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise—spiral arbitration as a method to resolve contradictions—offers a fresh philosophical angle, and the temple library setting is specific. However, the emotional arc and plot structure are generic: solitary figure enters liminal space, confronts internal/external reflections, undergoes transformation, emerges renewed. The "universe's hiccup" and "end of history witness" read as high-concept labels without lived specificity. The synthesis of reflection, spatial descent, and conceptual unification is coherent but not surprising. Risk-taking is present in the abstract philosophical mode, but the narrator's journey lacks the particulars that would make this vision irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" character is named and framed early, walks through the library, examines the dictionary, descends to the mirrors, performs spiral arbitration, and climbs back with a new sense of duty. However, most actions are observational or declarative rather than choice-driven under pressure. The witness's decisions (to trace diagrams, to step into the spiral's center) are not tested by opposition or costly trade-offs on the page. The character is present across all three gates and involved in multiple beats, but causal pressure and cost are conceptual rather than visceral. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental use in middle −0.6, swappability −0.5, summary-only key moments −0.5 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary appears early on a low table, is opened to "arbitrate" with spiral diagrams in the margins, is placed on the floor while the narrator traces its diagrams (raising threads that loop through mirrors), and is pressed to the narrator's chest during the climb back. The dictionary's definitions shift with the narrator's mood, then stabilize at closure, marking the resolution. It is handled in at least three distinct beats and charged at the ending. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4, but swappability −0.5 (any book with diagrams could function similarly) = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration is defined early ("a way to resolve contradictions by sending them around and around until they met at a shared center"), shapes the narrator's method in the mirror chamber (tracing diagrams, looping arguments until they overlap), and is named as the solution the narrator will carry forward. It appears in setup, development, and payoff. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see specific contradictions being arbitrated with tactical cost. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but ornamental (thematic claim more than enacted choice) −0.7, summary-only −0.5 = ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" is named early and embodied once: the narrator practices "letting my mind roam through memories while my attention measured every footfall and every breath." This dual attention constrains the narrator's movement through the library (prevents drowning in self) and is reflected in the final sentence's dual trajectory ("outward...and inward"). However, the trait is more label than enacted cost; we do not see a specific choice where wandering conflicts with exactness. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, but label-only −0.6, no visible cost −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unify" is the narrator's stated goal and the action performed at the spiral's center: "to unify them, I stepped into the spiral's center and performed the inward journey fully, letting the end of history inside me meet the beginning." This unification stabilizes the dictionary definitions and dissolves the mirrors, enabling the narrator to climb back and continue arbitrating. The action is signaled early, drives the climax, and shapes the ending. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, but summary-only (not dramatized) −0.6 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is introduced in the opening ("this crossing demanded a stranger method, journeying inward while walking out, letting each step take me deeper into myself even as my feet moved forward") and enacted at the spiral's center and during the final climb. The method is named and its dual motion shapes the narrator's path. However, the mechanics are abstract; we do not see how inward and outward journeys create friction or enable a choice that could not occur otherwise. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but ornamental (method as theme) −0.6, label-only −0.5 = ~5.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is anchored early, provides the dictionary and the central well, and structures the entire narrative journey (circular aisles, descending staircase, mirrors below, climb back up). The setting is specific (stone doors, incense and dust, spiral diagrams, plain stone at closure) and its architecture (circular shelves, central well, descent/ascent) directly shapes the narrator's choices. The library's craft (spiral arbitration) is the story's method. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.7, no swappability, but the setting is atmospheric more than tactically constraining −0.3 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "universe's hiccup" is named early and frames the stakes (time reknit, contradictions are the only roads left). However, the hiccup functions as backstory and thematic premise rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Time within the story is vague (the narrator walks, descends, arbitrates, climbs) with no urgency or deadline. The hiccup appears in setup and is referenced at closure ("wherever the hiccup had scattered paradox") but does not pressure tactics in the middle. Score: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.4, but vague/untracked time −0.8, ornamental −0.6 = ~3.8, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is stated early ("I swore that if anything could still be saved, it would be by unraveling those illusions") and drives the narrator's descent and arbitration. The narrator's desire is clear and shapes the goal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; we do not see the narrator tempted to accept an illusion or pay a visible cost to pursue truth. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only −0.7, no friction between wants and costs on the page −0.5 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("a resounding hush that was not emptiness but held breath") and sustained through sensory detail (dust motes hovering, faint breeze, whispered definitions, faintest chorus of unsaid questions). The hush is coherent across turns and charges the final image ("hearing in the silence the faintest chorus"). The tone modulates subtly (from held breath to creaking library to unsaid questions) without breaking. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, coherence and modulation +0.8, but single static register (always hushed, never loud pressure) −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>
