<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—touching objects, climbing stairs, fitting prism pieces—and the retrocognitive gift creates genuine interior contradiction (seeing futures as "echoes of choices" complicates agency). The obsession to prove meaning drives escalating micro-choices with visible cost: risking the climb, trusting the shard's pull, answering strangers. Minor slip: the caravan leader's quoted wisdom in the retrocognitive flash borders on thematic ventriloquism, slightly over-articulating the story's thesis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Situational with Accumulative texture: coincidences complicate (meteor shower, shard arrival, star alignment) while the protagonist's deliberate tracking and assembly work crystallize stance. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—"some accidents are invitations" reprices the obsession without neat resolution, and the caravan's arrival validates the beacon's promise with felt cost (weeks of solitary vigil, risk of failure). Orientation anchors immediately (beacon-tower, salt flats, post-collapse) and the seven-night structure tightens pressure legibly under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass pavilion's hum, the prism cradle, the beacon stairs, and the salt flats supply concrete spatial anchors that constrain choice (climbing with fragile objects, working in dim lantern light). The hush shard functions as micro-setting, dampening sound to sharpen thought and later steadying the flame—both instances alter tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (wind combing ribs, cold shard tugging hand) and the post-collapse idiom (grids died, radio towers were bones) reads consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and drives all choices: touching the prism to see sabotage, retrieving the shard, tracking stars nightly, assembling the apparatus. One meaningful tightening occurs on night seven when star corridor and cold shard converge, forcing the custodian to trust the pattern and fit pieces "like petals around a seed." The answering flash and caravan arrival validate the work with visible cost (solitary weeks, physical risk, emotional vulnerability in "knees shook with thistle-blown hope").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—order versus randomness, solitude versus connection—emerges from particulars: the whispering saboteur, the star paths' "patient geometry," the hush shard as invitation rather than accident. The final line "some accidents are invitations" reprices the obsession without moralizing, reweighting the custodian's vigil as bridge-work rather than delusion. Subtext operates in the engineers' memory ("Let it break"), the silent caravan judgment ("If it ever wakes"), and the pavilion's pleased hum—each image layering meaning without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV with stable first-person distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "thistle-blown hope," "maps were ash and radio towers were bones," objects "carried memories like dust." Psychic distance tightens under pressure (touching chalk marks to see tomorrow's smears, the hush's silence sharpening retrocognitive gift) without filter-verb stacks. The caravan leader's quoted line is filtered through retrocognitive vision, maintaining POV modesty. Diction remains post-collapse lyric throughout with no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with most sentences advancing situation or image: "sound folded inward," "beam held its shape," "stars traced a narrow corridor." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor friction: "That whispered sabotage felt like a coincidence begging for meaning, and meaning was all I had left to prove I was not alone" slightly over-explains what the surrounding action already dramatizes, and "objects carried memories like dust" is workmanlike rather than fresh. Rhythm modulates cleanly from reflective opening to deliberate work sequences to charged final exchange.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive gift, star-tracking method, and hush shard as stabilizer is specific and non-obvious; the star paths providing literal alignment while the protagonist's obsession provides thematic alignment feels earned in hindsight. The post-collapse beacon trope is familiar but transformed through the custodian's unique sensory gift and the inversion that sabotage becomes invitation. Minor limit: the caravan's perfectly matched signal code risks convenient symmetry, though the retrocognitive glimpse mitigates it. Risk-taking in the accumulative pacing and lyric texture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Custodian present throughout; drives key turns by touching prism (setup), nightly star-tracking (development), and assembling apparatus on night seven (climax). The answering signal and caravan greeting in final paragraphs complete the arc. Decisions narrow options with visible cost (solitary weeks, physical risk, emotional exposure). Irreplaceable: only this role has access and motive to rekindle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism introduced early (paragraph two), handled in memory-flash beat, carried to beacon at dusk, and reassembled around hush shard on night seven to restore rainbow code. Its fractured state is the inciting problem; its repair with hush seed is the climactic action. Ending image of restored beam and caravan reply depends on it. Swapping for generic "lens" would break the established memory and the "petals around a seed" assembly logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shard introduced at ~25% (paragraph four), immediately alters tactics by creating "breathable silence" that sharpens thought, then reappears in climax when it "grew cold, tugging my hand" and stabilizes the flame. Final paragraph confirms it "let us hear one another without fear." Two functional beats plus closure charge. Could arguably be any stabilizing object, but the silence→clarity→communication arc is purposeful and specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Retrocognitive gift introduced early (paragraph three), enables discovery of sabotage whisper (setup), sharpens under hush's influence to see "tomorrow's smears" guiding alignment choices (development), and reveals caravan's prior pause and conditional promise in climax (payoff). Each use has visible cost: emotional weight of sabotage knowledge, nights of iterative testing, vulnerability in trusting strangers' memory. Removing it collapses the causality of how alignment succeeds and why the custodian trusts the pattern.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rekindling is the explicit goal from paragraph five onward, structures all escalation (nightly tracking, assembly work), and succeeds on-page in paragraph nine when "the rainbow code reappeared on the clouds like a healed scar." The answering flash and caravan arrival are direct consequences. Swapping for generic "repair" loses the thematic weight of promise and watching. The action redefines the custodian's solitude as purposeful bridge rather than futile vigil.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Star-tracking signaled in paragraph six, detailed across paragraphs seven–eight with specific mechanics (Deneb, Orion's belt, moon intersections, chalk marks, retrocognitive preview of angles), and pays off when "the stars traced a narrow corridor" on night seven, cueing final assembly. The method shapes multiple attempts and the earned success. Generic "study the sky" would lack the procedural specificity and cumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pavilion introduced in opening paragraph, provides spatial anchor and houses prism cradle (setup), its threshold is where shard is found (development), and it hums again "as if pleased to be useful" in the ending (closure callback). The "glass ribs" and domed structure create specific containment and acoustic logic for the hush effect. Not indispensable—story could relocate to generic tower room—but the pavilion's singing quality and threshold placement tie motif and mood effectively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-collapse timeframe established in opening sentence, colors all description (grids died, maps ash, radio bones), and sharpens the custodian's isolation and the caravan's significance. The seven-night structure within that frame tightens tactics. However, the larger timeframe itself doesn't constrain on-page choices the way a ticking clock would; it's atmospheric context more than mechanical pressure. One beat where it matters: "weeks ago" caravan memory validates present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly in paragraph four ("my obsession: to prove that coincidences have meaning"), dramatized through the custodian's nightly work testing star angles, and tested by self-doubt ("when maps were ash... that was my obsession") before validation arrives. The friction between hope and isolation, between pattern-seeking and delusion, drives every choice from retrieving the shard to answering the flash. Final line "some accidents are invitations" reprices the obsession as earned faith rather than madness. Cost is weeks of solitary vulnerability and the risk of being wrong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone anchored by "thistle-blown hope" phrase and sustained through tentative-yet-determined diction: "beacon... last upright needle," "scraps of a fallen age," "my knees shook." Modulates from reflective melancholy (opening) through methodical focus (star-tracking) to charged vulnerability (answering flash) without breaking into false triumph or despair. Final image of pavilion humming and figures cresting flats maintains fragile optimism. The tone charges the closure by keeping hope provisional and hard-won rather than guaranteed.</comment>
