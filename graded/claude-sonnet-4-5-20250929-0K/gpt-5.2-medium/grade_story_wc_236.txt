<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iris's motivation to "unveil ordinary miracles" through reading emotional terrain is consistent but her interior life leans toward declarative summary rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice to deliver the screw herself and stage the father's view shows purposeful agency, but the decision arrives without visible struggle or conflicting impulse acting in the moment. Interiority edges toward label-speak ("trembling calm," "miracle she sought") and therapy-adjacent phrasing at pivotal beats. Her blindness to smell is used as setup but does not constrain her final action with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Iris reads distress in Aster's note, delivers the repaired screw, reads the room through occlusion, offers validation, and repositions the father's view, allowing reconciliation. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or light Charged Poise): Iris confirms her method works without smell, reweighting her opening loss. However, the final image is told rather than shown ("understood that even without smell she could still unveil ordinary miracles"), reducing the felt weight of the realization. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris intervenes, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop, fog, and birthing house are rendered with purposeful sensory detail (dripping clock, wet glass, steam, untouched tea) that guide perception and constrain Iris's method of reading through veils. The repaired screw's reddish tarnish and stripped thread are specific, tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clear: counter, bench, street, birthing house, curtain. The recurring fog and occluded views charge the final walk back, reinforcing the thematic lens. Minor: the shop's occupational texture (water clock mechanics) is sketched but not pressure-tested in Iris's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Iris proving her post-anosmia method can still help—is signaled early and drives the delivery choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris reads Aster's fear and the father's rigidity, then stages a resolution by repositioning sight lines and offering validation. The intervention narrows options (passivity vs. active humanizing) and alters the room's emotional state with visible result (the father speaks, asks to thank). However, the cost to Iris herself is not dramatized on the page; her internal risk or trade-off remains implicit. The father's shift is told quickly ("not to accuse but to ask"), compressing what could be a higher-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—reading emotional truth through occlusion, humanizing hidden pain—emerges organically from Iris's method and the screw's dual role (tool and symptom). The recurring fog and veil imagery (wet glass, loupe, steam, curtain) pattern the concept effectively. However, the final paragraph shifts into direct thematic summary ("understood that even without smell she could still unveil ordinary miracles by teaching people to read what they already meant"), replacing scene pressure with authorial assertion. The piece resists easy moral but edges toward over-articulation of its own thesis at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Iris's perceptual signature (pressure dents, ink blots, shaky spaces) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and literary without rupture. However, voice edges toward elevated register at emotional peaks ("trembling calm," "ordinary miracles," "humanize the request") that feel slightly external to urgent interiority. The single line of dialogue ("Your hands held a life in place when time slipped, and no tool is stronger than that") reads purposeful but over-polished for spontaneous speech under pressure. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "watched") cluster in the birthing-house beat without reducing clarity but slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong sensory anchors ("dripping water clock," "reddish tarnish only on one side"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reading between lines of polite ink and the shaky spaces where a hand had paused" → "peering at messages through the shop's wet glass, through the loupe" recycles the occlusion method without added pressure. Template-cadence check: several sentences open with participial phrases or "When Iris" constructions, creating mild syntactic monotony. The final paragraph summarizes the realization rather than trusting the dramatized walk and clock-drop image to carry it, adding scaffold where elision would serve. No major artifacts touch closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: one distinct issue (loops + template stems) = −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of anosmia, water clock repair shop, midwife's tool, and "reading between lines" offers fresh specificity. The core emotional arc—professional helping another professional through humanizing gesture—is familiar but executed with purposeful detail (reddish tarnish, stripped screw, father's view repositioned). However, the resolution falls into a well-worn template: kind outsider validates struggling caregiver, enabling reconciliation with minimal on-page friction. The thematic language ("unveil ordinary miracles," "humanize the request") leans toward prompt-adjacent abstraction rather than lived idiom. Transformation is present in the anosmia twist but does not fully escape the median safety zone of "small kindness heals hidden wound."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Iris (aromatherapist who lost smell) is present throughout and her sensory loss motivates her method of reading through occlusion. Setup clear in opening paragraph. She makes two key choices: to deliver the screw herself (middle) and to reposition the father's view (ending). However, her anosmia does not constrain the final beat—sight-based staging would work identically for a character with smell. The loss serves thematic resonance and backstory but is not causally indispensable at closure. Present in all three gates; drives two beats; partial causal pressure; partial closure linkage; moderate swappability at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midwife's birthing clamp screw appears in three beats: package arrival (Iris reads tarnish and stripped thread), repair off-page, and delivery/testing (Aster turns it, tests threads, steadies). Setup in first third. The screw's physical damage (stripped head, reddish tarnish) conveys the hard birth and Aster's fear, enabling Iris's insight. At closure, Aster's act of testing the threads demonstrates renewed steadiness. The screw is the hinge for all three beats and charges the reconciliation. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. Minor: the screw itself does not reweight meaning in the final image—Iris's walk and the clock do.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is named explicitly and demonstrated: Iris reads ink pressure, fading script, tarnish placement, untouched tea, trembling fingers. Setup clear. Middle: she reads the room to diagnose Aster's fear. Ending: she stages sight lines to let the father see Aster's grip without her fear. The concept shapes all three acts and alters tactics. However, the final paragraph tells the concept overtly ("teaching people to read what they already meant"), reducing it to theme rather than leaving it embodied. Causal work across beats; closure participation via staging; moderate specificity (could be "perceptive helper" with slight edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is an attribute of Iris's method, shown through pressure dents, ink blots, tarnish reading, and room observation. Setup in opening paragraph. Middle: she maps Aster's fear and father's rigidity. Ending: she uses this mapping to reposition view. The trait enables all key moves. However, it is a re-description of "reading between lines" rather than a separate constraint with unique cost. Label is invoked but the mechanics are identical to the core concept. Functional but overlapping; drives beats; partial specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Humanize" is invoked when Iris asks to deliver the screw ("to humanize the request") and enacted when she validates Aster's hands and repositions the father's view. Setup mid-story (~40% mark). The action drives the climax and reconciliation. However, "humanize" is an abstract frame; the concrete actions are validation speech + sight-line staging, which could be described as "mediate" or "advocate" with minor edits. The word itself does not carry unique mechanical weight. Late signal; drives ending; moderate swappability; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is signaled early (wet glass, loupe, fog) and repeated (steam, curtain, lashes). Setup clear. Middle: Iris uses fog and curtain to read the room. Ending: she angles the father's view "past the curtain" so he sees Aster's grip without her fear—a literal use of occlusion to stage reconciliation. The method is both motif and tactic. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage. The method is somewhat poetic/metaphorical, but the curtain-staging is concrete. Minor: "occluded" could be replaced with "veiled" or "partial" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is the opening setting and houses Maro's clock, which Iris hears at the end. Setup clear. However, the key conflict occurs at the birthing house; the shop provides atmosphere and the delivery errand but does not constrain Iris's choices or supply resources at closure. The clock's drop-ring is heard in the final walk but does not alter options. The shop is present in setup and faintly at closure but missing middle development that would pressure tactics. Two gates (setup, weak closure cameo); ornamental at ending; replaceable with any artisan shop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" appears in the opening frame and the closing walk. Setup clear. The fog creates the occluded-view aesthetic and returns to frame Iris's final realization. However, the fog does not tighten decisions or impose a time limit; it is atmospheric rather than a time constraint. The piece has no ticking clock or urgent deadline. Lyric early-to-final reprise that reweights the stake moderately. Two gates (setup, closure); thematic charge; no causal pressure on timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs. Iris's desire drives her method and the delivery choice. Setup clear. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction; Iris does not face a visible cost or doubt on the page that tests her commitment. The final paragraph asserts she "caught the miracle she sought" and "understood" her purpose, summarizing rather than enacting the desire under pressure. Desire present and goal-consistent; weak friction; moderate closure linkage via theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is named once ("the old trembling calm settle in her chest") and the tone is sustained: measured pace, careful observation, gentle intervention, quiet ending. The tone modulates slightly (morning fog → steam-filled tension → fog return) but remains steady. At closure, the tone charges the final image through the repeated fog and the clock's drop-ring, creating a resonant, hushed frame. Coherent through turns; modulates with setting; charges final image. Minor: "trembling calm" is a lovely phrase but slightly external/poetic rather than embodied in Iris's syntax under peak pressure.</comment>
