<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maris is embodied through concrete actions (baking, guiding, using the lens) and the motivation to rescue art is shown through choices under pressure. Internal experience shows through her "sweet dread" and the physical handling of objects. However, the displaced persons remain largely passive recipients rather than individuated agents with their own contradictory impulses, and Maris's trajectory from guide to rescuer lacks a moment of genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses an option. The captain's conversion at the end feels unmotivated by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a situational crystallization) and delivers closure through Charged Poise: the guards hesitate, Nemea keeps singing "not because the dread was gone, but because the arts had been thawed back into breath." Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce only after the beekeeper opening—but the grotto city frame becomes clear by the second paragraph and the disorientation does not obscure the ending. The escalation from eviction notice to ice-door thaw to impromptu opera house follows a clear because/therefore chain, and the final image reconfigures the stakes (singing despite dread). Cost is felt but not entirely visible: Maris risks Council wrath, but no on-page consequence lands beyond the guards' damp boots.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto city, waterfall spray, museum kiln, and frozen ice door all constrain choices and supply resources: the ice seals the cache, heat thaws it, the hall becomes a stage. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("monumental curtain," "museum lamps and prayer candles," "rosewater and wet stone"). The emerald lens functions as micro-setting, altering what Maris perceives and enabling the rescue. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image when the guards' boots are "damp" with waterfall mist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescue the arts and shelter the displaced—is signaled early and tightens when the eviction notice arrives. The ice-door thaw is a meaningful escalation driven by Maris's agency (baking honey loaves, enlisting refugees). However, the captain's conversion at the end lacks a visible trade-off or friction; he simply leaves after breaking bread, and no on-page cost or consequence is shown. The piece delivers one clear tightening (eviction threat) and one deepening (thaw reveals the cache), meeting the length requirement, but the resolution feels more like persuasion than a choice with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bread shaped like initials becomes a quiet registry, the arts survive through collective action, memory and mercy can coexist as tradition. The rosewater/honey/clover scent trio threads through and shifts meaning—clover is lost, rosewater marks grief and sustenance, honey carries the beekeeper's farewell. The final image ("mercy could also be tradition") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo in prompt language, and the piece resists binary resolution by letting dread and song coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Maris with consistent psychic distance and vocabulary. The perceptual signature is strong—"green circle," "sweet dread," "gold leaf under mildew"—and diction remains character-specific. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly phrases ("monumental curtain of water," "consensus reality") that sit uneasily with the urgent present. The refugees remain voiceless; no dialogue tests naturalism or distinction. Internal voice is coherent but not always compressed under peak stress, and some filter verbs ("watched," "saw") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double work, but several paraphrase loops appear: "the arts were dying here, not with applause but with mold" restates what the mildew and dread already showed; "rosewater from the crust rose with the cold mist" is near-synonym churn. Template cadence runs in the thaw sequence ("Maris mixed…shaped…baked…stacked"). The opening sentence is dense and atmospheric, but mid-story beats accumulate figurative language without clear payoff ("light meant discovery" is abstract, not embodied). No severe artifacts touch the closure image, but cumulative minor loops and scaffold reduce propulsion. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase and template stems, −0.3 for register drift in non-closure beats = total −0.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—grotto refugee shelter, baked-initial registry, frozen art cache, scent-driven memory—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of bread from "Sunday joke" to quiet resistance is fresh, and the emerald lens as both literal tool and thematic lens adds layered originality. However, the captain's conversion and the "mercy as tradition" resolution follow a familiar template (authority figure softened by gesture of care). The piece takes risks with density and texture but does not fully commit to an unexpected moral calculus. Within-band bonus for risk-taking partially offset by derivative resolution pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maris (cultured museum guide) is present throughout, frames the stake early, and drives the key turn—enlisting refugees, thawing the ice door, staging the impromptu opera. Her guide role enables the final persuasion of the captain through narration and the emerald lens. Setup, development, and payoff all present; two distinct beats (eviction response, thaw sequence); causal pressure evident; closure linkage strong. Cost is felt but not entirely visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald-tinted opera glass lens appears in three beats: reading inscriptions, seeing notes in ice, and at the ending when Maris uses it to show the captain dates on scrims. It reweights from discovery tool to persuasion instrument. Setup early, development mid-story, closure participation present. However, its unique properties (emerald tint, seeing "gold leaf under mildew") do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions more as symbol than causal agent. Two gates strong, third present but light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Displaced persons are introduced early (sleeping in alcoves, eyes drifting to exits), shape the dominant stake (shelter + identity), and enable the thaw sequence by bringing kettles and honey. They are present in the closure when children sing and adults eat their initials. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the concept constrains Maris's choices (she must house them, bake for them, enlist them) and the ending turns on their collective action. Cost is felt through their fear and labor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" appears once in label form ("a historically oriented mind") and is enacted when Maris "recited dates to travelers" and later uses provenance and dates to persuade the captain. The trait enables the final tactic but does not constrain an earlier choice or create visible friction. Setup present, development weak (the trait is told more than shown), closure participation clear. Swappable: "detail-oriented" or "scholarly" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thaw is signaled early (waterfall spray frozen into ice door), drives the central sequence (honey-loaves stacked to melt the seam), and unlocks the art cache that makes the impromptu opera possible. The action is irreplaceable—without it, the scrims remain sealed and the eviction proceeds unchallenged. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; causal pressure high; closure depends on the thawed art. Specific cost: the slow drip pace creates tension ("slow drops tapping like a metronome").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The family custom of baking bread shaped like initials is introduced early ("the day her mother taught her"), becomes the quiet registry for the displaced, and is repurposed at the climax (honey-loaves to thaw the door) and ending (captain eats his initial). Setup, development, and payoff all present; the method shapes two key beats and the final persuasion. Causal role clear; irreplaceability high (the initials carry identity and memory). Cost visible: the displaced "tasting honey, history, and fear."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the monumental waterfall is present from the opening, supplies the museum shelter and kiln, the ice door, and the impromptu opera hall. It constrains choices (alcoves for sleeping, spray freezes the door, acoustics allow singing beneath the waterfall's thunder) and charges the ending when the guards' boots are "damp" with mist. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; two distinct beats; closure linkage clear. The setting is indispensable—remove it and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" anchors the opening mood (no clover, saved honey jar) and the honey reappears at the thaw, but the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency. The eviction notice introduces pressure, but no clock tracks elapsed time or deadline. Setup present, development weak (the beekeeper's absence is atmospheric, not causal), closure participation indirect (honey used, but the "after" frame does not shape the ending). Swappable: "since the drought" or "after the flood" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to rescue dying arts is introduced early ("she had promised herself she would rescue what she could") and drives every major choice: baking the registry, leading families to the cache, enlisting refugees, staging the opera, persuading the captain. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure high; closure depends on this desire. Friction appears between the want (rescue art) and the cost (risk eviction, enlist vulnerable refugees), though the cost is more felt than visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" is present from the opening ("rosewater from the bakeries," "sweet dread, like rose syrup turned sour") and modulates through the story: dread blooms when light threatens discovery, mingles with steam at the thaw, and persists in the ending ("tasting honey, history, and fear"). The tone charges the final image ("not because the dread was gone, but because the arts had been thawed back into breath"). Setup strong, development consistent, closure participation clear. The dual note (sweetness + dread) is maintained without flattening.</comment>
