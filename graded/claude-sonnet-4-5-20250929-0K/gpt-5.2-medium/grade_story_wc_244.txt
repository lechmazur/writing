<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's journey from loneliness to connection is embodied through micro-choices (giving cigarette, walking Mara home). Mara's "desperately jocular" trait operates on the page—her jokes function as survival tools, revealed in "she made jokes the way others made fire, to keep the dark from sitting too close." The story resists full interiority for Mara, which is appropriate but makes her realization ("not the courier of the cure but its first patient") slightly sudden. The ending choice to pass on the moon rock earns the shift from isolation to reciprocity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's silence moves from isolating to "shared," and the moon rock is passed on with visible cost (the warmth fades, the narrator relinquishes ownership). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through escalating exchanges (cigarette, coat, lost child) until the platform fills with "mutual debts and cheerful thefts." The "story changes" moment is marked mid-text but could have been cued more subtly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes Mara herself needs the cure, reweighting all prior logistics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vividly anchored early (ivy-swallowed board, cracked clock, baggage room as "altar built by pranksters") and constrains the encounter—it's "neutral enough for strangers to meet without feeling recruited." The moon rock's warmth is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform, baggage room, exits). However, the station's ivy and decay remain largely static description after the opening; the setting does not materially alter tactics in the middle beats, holding the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early and tightens through the moon rock's reciprocity rule: each use must be passed on or "it went cold." The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (narrator initiates the exchange chain) and the cost is legible when the rock cools "from completion" and must be relinquished. The reversal at "the story changes" when Mara is revealed as patient rather than courier is earned. One persistent constraint—the reciprocity binding—shapes all tactics. The piece narrowly misses high-8s because the evacuees and thieves arrive suddenly without prior setup, slightly softening the turn's groundwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the moon rock as catalyst, the "improbable rumor chains" as infrastructure for connection, and the platform's "polite anarchy" as the working model. The ending's image—"my silence felt shared"—answers the loneliness question without stating a moral, and the reciprocity motif (moon rock passed on with a note) charges the closure. Mara's grin as fire against darkness deepens the theme without sermonizing. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the note left in the suitcase performs the resolution through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending wry observation ("altar built by pranksters with excellent manners") with lyric compression ("alive but unclaimed"). POV distance is stable first-person, and interiority stays character-bound. Mara's dialogue carries subtext ("you look terrible, so you must be serious") and distinct idiom. Minor slips: "the barber, a priest, and a scrapyard dog" risks quirk-list texture, and the phrase "when the story changes" is a meta-narrator intrusion that briefly breaks immersion. Diction remains consistent under pressure, and the final lines maintain voice through image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing images are strong. However, mid-passage phrasing shows template cadence: "In flood seasons she moved… in drought she traded… in every crisis she kept" stacks three parallel clauses without variation. The phrase "crooked channels" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 1 and mid-text), a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles touch the closure beat, so non-closure accumulation cap applies. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: the moon rock as both "catalyst" and "cure" blurs its function slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster logistics, moon rock as reciprocity token, and loneliness as epidemic is specific and non-obvious. The station as neutral ground and Mara's dual role (logistician/patient) feel earned in hindsight. The "polite anarchy" frame transforms mutual-aid tropes through the quirky cast (bicycle gangs, evacuees politely arguing about stealing rules). Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and the elliptical "story changes" marker. The piece avoids safety-middle choices and commits fully to its premise. Slight derivative echo: the magical object bound by a giving rule has precedent, but the logistical infrastructure and the ending's pass-it-on note individualize it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara Quill appears early, her "elusive" quality established through rumor before her footstep-less arrival. She makes on-page choices: leading the narrator to the baggage room, placing her hands around the narrator's (enabling the transfer), walking among the evacuees to broker exchanges, and asking for company at the end. Her decision to reveal the moon rock's rule and to accept companionship drives the closure. The element is indispensable—remove Mara and the logistics network, humor-as-survival, and the reciprocity lesson all collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moon rock is seeded through rumor in paragraph one, physically handled mid-story (narrator touches it, feels warmth), and governs the exchange chain. It appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the baggage room, warmth rising/falling during exchanges, and cooling at completion before being placed back with a note. Its warmth is both tactile and symbolic, and the reciprocity rule it enforces narrows options—each kindness must be passed on or the rock goes cold. The closure hinges on returning it; remove the rock and the story's logic breaks. The element is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reciprocity is introduced mid-story as the moon rock's binding rule: "every time someone used it to feel less alone, they had to deliver a kindness to the next person, or it went cold." This rule shapes all subsequent tactics—the narrator gives a cigarette, the barber mends a coat, the thief returns a child—and the closure depends on passing the rock on with a note. The concept constrains choice throughout and is causally active, not merely thematic decoration. Removing reciprocity would flatten the story into a found-object tale without stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is established early through description ("as if she made jokes the way others made fire, to keep the dark from sitting too close") and on-page dialogue ("Congratulations, you look terrible, so you must be serious"). The trait constrains her behavior—she hides need behind punch lines—and enables the narrator's realization that she is "its first patient." The cost is visible: her grin "finally" falls when she asks for company. One deduction for slight label-reliance in the opening summary; the trait is dramatized more fully in the baggage room and platform scenes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" governs the moon rock's function: it initiates the exchange chain that transforms isolation into connection. The action occurs in two beats—the narrator touches the rock and feels warmth, then watches as each kindness "catalyzed a steadier current." The word itself is used twice, signaling intent. However, the catalysis is partly told ("I realized") rather than fully shown through incremental choices. The element is essential but could be more tightly dramatized; swapping "catalyze" for "enable" would weaken specificity but not break the logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rumor chain is seeded early ("she coordinated by drone, mule, or teenage bicycle gangs, all coordinated by Mara through improbable rumor chains") and returns mid-story when the moon rock's rule "traveled along the same crooked channels she used for aid." The method shapes tactics: it explains how the moon rock and reciprocity rule propagate without formal systems. The platform exchanges (neighbors asking after neighbors "they had ignored") demonstrate the method in action. The element is structurally necessary—remove it and Mara's logistician identity and the story's infrastructure dissolve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station is anchored in the opening paragraph (ivy, cracked clock, old board, platform) and its neutrality is functional: "the only place neutral enough for strangers to meet without feeling recruited." The baggage room supplies the setting for the moon rock discovery. The platform becomes the stage for the evacuees' "polite anarchy" exchanges. Spatial elements (ivy curtains, table as altar, platform sweep) track coherently. The setting pressures the meeting (neutral ground) and supplies resources (baggage room, platform space). It is indispensable to the closure—the platform's hum of mutual debts is the story's final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"When the story changes" is marked mid-text as a temporal hinge, and "near midnight" anchors the ending. However, the phrase "when the story changes" reads more as a structural marker than a tracked clock. The timeframe does tighten slightly—the narrator waits, Mara arrives, exchanges unfold, midnight arrives—but elapsed minutes are not legible enough to alter tactics under pressure. The element signals narrative structure more than it constrains choice. Functional across two gates (signaled, closure-adjacent) but replaceable with minor edits; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized early: "I had come for a different delivery: a cure for loneliness, which in my city spread faster than the river and left people alive but unclaimed." The narrator's silence is tested through micro-choices (giving cigarette, keeping the rock, walking Mara home) and the ending delivers the shift: "my silence felt shared." Friction between the want (cure) and the cost (passing the rock on, accepting company) is visible. The motivation drives all major beats and the closure hinges on it. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is seeded mid-story when evacuees and thieves "politely argui[ng] about who would sweep the floor and who would write the rules for stealing." The tone modulates under pressure—Mara's jocular fire keeps darkness at bay, and the ending's "cheerful thefts" and "self appointed timetable of mutual debts" sustain it. The tone charges the final image and coheres through turns. However, the opening leans more lyric-melancholy than anarchic, creating slight tonal drift before the platform scene. The tone is essential to closure but could be signaled earlier; high-7s.</comment>
