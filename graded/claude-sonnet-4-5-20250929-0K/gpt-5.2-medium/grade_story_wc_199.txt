<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation is grounded in a specific professional practice (seed sorting) and anchored by embodied micro-choices—prodding, building cairns, scraping dust—that reflect his patient worldview. His decision to open the vault and bring the book public is causally linked to the monuments and moonstone-dust-marked prodding, though the interior texture relies heavily on thematic labels ("shy mossy delight," "hope") that soften the particularity. The transformation from orderly sorter to public truth-bearer is staged but the moment of risking exile or reprisal is elided, reducing the felt cost of his final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lio's public reading and monument trail shift Veyroot from theft-based levitation to shared memory, and the leaf spelling "LIFT" reweights the arbor's fate with conceptual and social cost (the elders' secret exposed, old history reintegrated). The causal chain—leaf → dust → decoded message → vault → book → public reading—holds under a Hybrid lens (causal linkage with accumulative/textural closure). However, the vault opening and the arbor's "steadying" occur without visible opposition or friction on the page, reducing the felt price of the final act and making the resolution feel slightly convenient despite its thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor, seed trays, monument shelf, and vault seam are vivid and purposefully integrated: the moonstone-dust needle, the sealed vault door, and the monument-building habit all constrain Lio's choices and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (pods "tick like clocks," fingers "smell like rain," air "smelled suddenly of moss after rain"). Spatial choreography remains clear across root hall, sorting room, and public walkways. The setting's sky-borne status and the threat of descent create concrete stakes, and the vault's blackened seeds and bark-paper book provide tactile anchors for the climactic reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the leaf message to prevent Veyroot's descent—is signaled early and tightens through the spiral's "DESCEND" reveal and the vault's confession. Lio's agency drives the key beats: scraping the dust, building monuments, prodding the vault seam, scattering cairns as a trail, carrying the book public. The foreman's dismissal provides a credible obstacle, but his opposition evaporates without cost or reprisal on the page. The arbor steadies and the sky brightens, but no character faces a trade-off or visible price in the final image—no elder's rage, no social exile, no monument destroyed—so the closure lands with conceptual weight but muted felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—memory as ballast, naming as preservation, shared history vs. theft—emerges organically from Lio's monument practice, the leaf-script decoding, and the vault's confession that Veyroot "swallowed the names of the ground below." The final image (leaf spelling "LIFT" and staying written) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The moonstone dust as truth-revealer and the monuments as counter-forgetting accrue meaning across beats. Minor thematic echo: "the tree marked him" and "emerges transformed always into hope" verge on direct statement, slightly softening the particularity, but the core resolution grows from prior action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, with narrative certainty calibrated to Lio's knowledge and perception ("he believed," "he understood," "he realized"). Diction is consistent and textured—"mossy and delighted," "buttress roots," "pearl gray"—with a lyric compression that matches the arbor's storybook logic. Two moments of filter-verb stacking ("he believed," "he trusted," "he felt," "he remembered") in the opening third slightly dull immediacy during the seed-sorting exposition, but pressure remains legible. Purposeful elision (the vault's opening mechanism, the elders' immediate reaction) is taught by the folklore frame and does not withhold facts Lio already knows. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective and bias-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere; sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Three prose artifacts lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loop in the opening ("listening to pods tick… because the elders said each seed carried a remembered name" restates the premise of seed importance), (2) template-cadence run in the vault sequence ("he went there alone… he set a monument… then prodded the seam"), and (3) thesaurus-adjacent phrasing ("mossy and delighted" recurs without dramatized cost, reading as ornamental label-speak). The final "emerges transformed always into hope" converts a physical detail into abstract summary without a concrete image anchor. No mixed metaphors or spatial confusion; clarity remains high despite the stylistic density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-sorting profession, skyborne folklore setting, monument-building as memory practice, and leaf-script decoding feels specific and non-obvious. The moonstone cabochon dust as truth-revealer and the vault's confession transform the standard "forgotten past must be remembered" template through concrete world logic (arbor levitation requires named memory as ballast). The final turn—shared memory replacing theft—is earned in hindsight by Lio's monument habit and the dust-marked prodding. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and patterned folklore voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a within-band +0.2 for bold execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lio (orderly seed sorter) drives three key beats: scraping the dust and decoding "DESCEND," opening the vault after building a monument at its base, and scattering monuments publicly to lead people to the book. His professional seed-sorting habit anchors the opening and the prod tool, but after the leaf arrives his occupation becomes secondary to monument-building and vault-opening. The character's choices create the major turns—vault, public reading—and constrain the ending (dust-marked skin, public trail). Setup early, middle development via vault choice, closure participation via public reading. Cost is conceptual (elders' secret exposed) rather than personal (no reprisal on page). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (conceptual) +0.3; professional role fades mid-story −0.3. Total neighborhood: ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moonstone cabochon dust speck is handled in three beats: scraped from the leaf and clings to the needle (making it "pale as milk"), used to prod the spiral into "DESCEND," and used repeatedly to prod fresh leaves for "REMEMBER ME" and vault instructions. The dust marks Lio's skin ("glittered with the same moonstone dust") at the vault, signaling transformation. Its property—truth-revealing in bark—drives the tactical decoding and vault discovery. Setup immediate (introduced with the leaf), middle development (vault prodding), closure linkage (skin glitter persists to final image). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4. No significant frictions. Total: ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Regional folklore frames the premise (Veyroot "fed on stories," leaves fall "like handwriting," "forgot what no one named") and the vault's confession that the arbor "swallowed the names of the ground below" is the conceptual hinge. The bride's moonstone tale from "western branch markets" primes the dust's function. Folklore shapes Lio's understanding and tactics (building monuments as ballast, seeking leaf-script) and the ending's solution (honoring the forgotten lets the arbor "float on shared memory"). Setup early, middle development (vault confession), closure participation (final promise fulfilled). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Primarily thematic rather than a forcing function on tactics −0.4. Total: ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" appears three times: once mid-story ("as he emerged transformed always from the shadows, his skin glittered"), again in the vault description, and in the final line ("emerges transformed always into hope"). The phrase marks Lio's dust-glittered state but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—no one reacts to his appearance, no door opens or closes because of it. It is lyric texture that charges the final image but does not alter tactics. Setup mid-story (−0.3), lyric reprise at closure +1.0, specificity +0.4, cost connection weak +0.2, ornamental (no action pressure) −0.7. Total: ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Prod" (with the bone needle) drives five beats: sorting habit established, tapping seed trays, scraping the moonstone dust, prodding the spiral into letters, prodding fresh leaves for vault clues, prodding the vault seam until it "sighed open," and prodding the final leaf that writes "LIFT" and stays written. The action is Lio's signature tool and the mechanism for decoding and opening; removing it would break the causal chain. Setup immediate, middle development (vault seam), closure participation (final "LIFT" leaf). Early signal +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5. No frictions. Total: ~8.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is Lio's habit ("near the root hall he kept another habit… building tiny monuments"), the method for honoring forgotten things, and the tactical bridge to the vault ("he set a monument at its base for the blight victims") and public reading ("scattering his tiny monuments like a trail"). The monuments are described as "ballast" and shape the arbor's memory logic. Setup early, middle development (vault monument), closure participation (public trail). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4. Slightly summary-reliant (no on-page construction process shown) −0.3. Total: ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor provides the stakes (threat of descent), the spatial environment (root hall, sorting room, buttress roots, public walkways), and the conceptual frame (tree that "fed on stories," leaves as messages). The arbor's groaning after the "DESCEND" reveal signals danger, and the final steadying and brightening to "pearl gray" mark resolution. Setup immediate, middle development (groaning arbor, vault access), closure participation (steadying, sky brightening). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Postcard elements (drifting branches, ash sky) do not constrain tactics −0.4. Total: ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" (when wind slows and leaves fall in patterns) frames the timing and signals the leaf-script window. The "hush day of his thirtieth year" marks the inciting event, and "that long suspended hush" covers the monument-building and vault sequence. Time pressure is implied (foreman's compost sweeping, the arbor's groaning threat) but not tracked with a live clock or countdown that alters Lio's moves. Setup immediate, closure linked (arbor steadies during the hush). Early signal +0.6, one beat (leaf arrival) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.4. No middle tightening or visible deadline that forces faster action −0.5, vague duration −0.4. Total: ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio's desire "to decode the message in falling leaves before the foreman swept them away" is dramatized through scraping the dust, prodding the spiral, building monuments, and opening the vault. The motivation is consistent, shapes all major choices, and faces friction (foreman's dismissal: "the man laughed at leaves"). The decoded messages ("DESCEND," "REMEMBER ME," "UNDO THE LATCH," "LIFT") drive the plot and closure. Setup immediate, middle development (vault quest), closure participation (final "LIFT" leaf). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, friction (foreman) +0.6, cost connection +0.4. Slightly tell-reliant in opening exposition −0.3. Total: ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mossy and delighted" is named twice (monument habit, the "shy mossy delight" creeping up Lio's ribs after the dust discovery) and evoked through sensory texture (fingers "smell like rain," air "smelled suddenly of moss after rain"). The tone modulates from orderly routine to wonder to urgency (vault opening, public reading) and returns to steadiness ("Lio returned to his trays") with the final "hope" note. Coherent through turns and charges the final image. Setup early, closure participation (hope reprise). Early signal +0.5, two tone beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Label-only in two uses ("mossy delight," "hope") without embodied cost −0.6, static "delighted" mood mid-story −0.3. Total: ~6.1.</comment>
