<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is rich with sensory memory and her mnemonic gift feels character-specific, but her agency weakens near closure—she "decides to rectify" yet the actual choices blur into a sequence of craft moves that feel more like solving a puzzle than wrestling with contradictory impulses. The final laugh ("softly, to keep the echo from dying again") gestures at transformation but the cost of her choice—abandoning the fairground life versus embracing the "family vocation"—remains abstract rather than embodied. The mother's notebook provides clarity about the past but doesn't force Mara into a live dilemma that charges the ending with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crystal cave, pigments, and mother's artifacts layer toward a final mural that reweights Mara's calling. Orientation anchors (fairground → tunnel → cave → studio) arrive promptly and the closure image—painting on crystal, stage waking, soft laugh—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. Cost is partially legible (she steps into a vocation that "would have swallowed her whole") but the final beat prioritizes wonder over felt tradeoff, leaving the price more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and purposeful: "walls glitter like frozen music," "auroral sorrow," cold air that charges each beat. The broken lock, canvas, pigments, and hidden studio are choreographed cleanly and the crystals' light becomes a functional constraint—highlights in the sketch, bending strokes in the mural. The cave's sorrowful atmosphere directly shapes the final image, where color "wakes" the hidden stage, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity before it turns to ash—is signaled early and Mara's descent into the cave tightens pressure through locked door and hidden notebook. The lock-picking with a crystal wedge and canvas provides one meaningful turn, but escalation remains linear: each obstacle yields to her skills without forcing a trade-off between competing goods. The ending's "stage wakes" suggests transformation yet the cost of stepping into the vocation versus staying in the fairground artist role is not dramatized with a visible price that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—art that heals, creativity as calling versus duty—emerges through cave imagery, pigments, and the mother's hidden instructions. The auroral sorrow metaphor recurs with purpose and the final mural offers a non-literal answer: Mara paints her mother's smile into the crystal, awakening the hidden stage. The notebook's revelation that her mother spared her from a "family vocation that would have swallowed her whole" adds complexity, though the ending leans toward resolution ("she laughs once, softly") rather than lingering ambiguity, softening thematic resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and Mara's perceptual signature—charcoal fingers, mnemonic rhythms, remembered diagrams—feels distinct. Diction stays consistent ("inescapable calling," "auroral sorrow") and psychic distance modulates purposefully at closure when reflection of her mother's songs and the cave's light merge. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("walls glitter like frozen music," "auroral sorrow, as if the crystals remember brighter colors") but the imagery remains tied to Mara's artist lens. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the descent sequence, but overwriting clusters in metaphoric runs: "frozen music," "auroral sorrow," "crystallized as if the cave has been waiting." The lock-picking beat includes both a canvas decoy and a crystal wedge with remembered diagrams—mechanically dense yet the double-layered solution obscures causality slightly. A paraphrase loop appears: "the lock is not merely closed but ruined" echoes "another small betrayal," restating without added pressure. Template stems recur ("she touches," "she realizes," "she decides"), applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact policy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The portrait-artist-as-lock-picker synthesis is fresh and the crystal cave setting avoids generic "magical studio" tropes through specific sensory detail (cold sweetness, reflected light as paint highlights). The canvas-over-wedge trick and painting-as-door reprise show ingenuity. Yet the mother's notebook revelation—"return only when the fair's laughter finally ended"—feels like a prompt-satisfying contrivance rather than an inevitable discovery rooted in Mara's prior choices, and the "portraits that could sing" instruction edges toward allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, and her mnemonic gift enables lock-opening and mural-painting. Her decision to enter the cave and "rectify what can be rectified" drives the descent, and the final painting-on-crystal choice shapes closure. However, her profession as a portrait sketch artist (charcoal, ten strokes, faces) plays a setup role but doesn't constrain a middle beat—she uses canvas and pigment generically rather than leveraging portraiture technique in a way only a sketch artist would. Two beats (lock, mural) plus closure participation place her in mid-6s; the lack of a distinct middle constraint specific to sketch artistry prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken combination lock appears in three beats: (1) discovered "like a tooth knocked loose," (2) Mara recites numbers and realizes it's ruined, (3) she slides a crystal wedge into the casing and it opens. The lock's brokenness shapes her tactic—she cannot solve it conventionally, so she improvises. Yet the lock vanishes after opening; the canvas hung "where the lock was" does not carry the lock's charge forward, and closure hinges on the mural and hidden stage, not the lock. Two functional beats with causal pressure but no closure reprise limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inescapable calling" is named early ("the three numbers her mother whispered… an inescapable calling that answers no logic except the need to uncork suppressed creativity") and drives Mara's descent. The concept shapes stakes—she follows the calling into the cave—but once inside, the narrative shifts to puzzle-solving (lock, notebook, mural) rather than dramatizing the cost or conflict of the calling itself. The ending's soft laugh and waking stage suggest acceptance of the calling, but the concept is told more than tested. Setup and thematic payoff without middle friction place it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's mnemonic gift is introduced early ("sharpened by years of memorizing jawlines… also hoards other details: her mother's vanished songs, the cave map… the three numbers") and enables two on-page actions with visible cost: (1) she recites the numbers to attempt the lock, discovering it's broken (a small failure), (2) she recalls "diagrams of tumbler teeth" to press the wedge correctly. The gift also shapes the final mural beat, where memory of her mother's face becomes the painted glow. Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage push toward 7.0, but the trait's cost is oblique—remembering is portrayed as a strength without tradeoff—which caps it slightly below.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears once as a decision marker ("she decides to rectify what can be rectified and what cannot") and governs her subsequent actions: painting the canvas, opening the lock, and creating the mural. It signals her shift from passive discovery to active making. However, "rectify" is abstract—what she rectifies (the lock? the vocation? her mother's absence?) remains ambiguous. The action shapes the arc but could be replaced with "repair," "restore," or "complete" with minor edits. Setup, middle involvement, and thematic closure participation without irreplaceable specificity place it in low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "painting with something behind it" method appears twice: (1) Mara hangs her canvas (portrait painted over with indigo) on the chain "where the lock was," hiding the crystal wedge behind the wet paint, (2) she finds "a painting of a stage curtain" on the studio wall, lifts it, and discovers the hatch with her mother's notebook. Both uses are causal—the first enables lock-opening, the second reveals the instructions that justify the ending. The method is signaled mid-story and its mechanics (concealment, discovery) matter to escalation and closure. Two distinct beats plus closure shaping earn low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is introduced early, anchors all middle beats, and directly charges the closure: the crystals' "auroral sorrow" and reflected light enable Mara to paint highlights in her mother's sketch, then the cave water mixed with pigments lets her paint on the crystal itself, "the sorrowful light bending through each stroke so that her mother's smile returns as a living glow." The cave's coldness, sweetness, and glittering walls create atmosphere and the quartz studio provides the hidden stage. The setting constrains (cave water as medium) and charges the final image (glow through crystal), meeting the 9+ gate and placing it in mid-7s to low-8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last echo of laughter fades" opens the story and establishes mood—the fairground is emptied, silence "pulls her downward." It sets the permission for Mara to descend but does not function as a ticking clock; no urgency or deadline tightens her choices inside the cave. The phrase reprises thematically in the final line ("to keep the echo from dying again") but as metaphor, not temporal pressure. Setup and lyric closure reprise without middle constraint place it in mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncork suppressed creativity before it turns to ash" is named early and drives Mara's descent and lock-opening. The notebook reveal—her mother hid it "to spare her from a family vocation that would have swallowed her whole"—adds friction, suggesting the calling is dangerous, yet Mara embraces it without dramatized hesitation: "she begins painting on the crystal itself… and she laughs once, softly." The want (create) versus fear (being swallowed) tension is told in the notebook but not enacted in her final choice. Setup, middle drive, and closure presence without on-page conflict place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is introduced early ("every step rings with auroral sorrow, as if the crystals remember brighter colors they can no longer throw across the sky") and recurs in the crystal's reflected light, the mother's vanished songs, and the final mural where "the sorrowful light bending through each stroke" brings her mother's smile to life. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the closure image, modulating from cold regret to warm renewal. It shapes atmosphere and ending without becoming static, meeting mid-7 range for tone integration.</comment>
