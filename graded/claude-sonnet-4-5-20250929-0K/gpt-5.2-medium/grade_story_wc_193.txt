<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (shame → redemption → collective action) is clear and her agency drives the drum sequence, but interiority remains abstract—"ache of those parallel selves like pressure she could finally use" tells rather than embodies. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is label-only; we never see her mis-direct or prank with on-page cost during a choice beat. Internal contradiction is absent: she moves from guilt to generosity in a smooth arc without simultaneous competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, mushroom farm, concept-physics season) arrive by ~80 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through spore-glow descriptions, glitchy texts, and the drum ritual, culminating in the diamond-bolt image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final quantum promise spoken aloud reconfigures prior material with conceptual cost (uncertainty about which future solidifies), though the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. One causal gap: Old Sen's bank demand and Mara's decision to use the drum are linked by coincidence (a convenient text arrival) rather than because/therefore agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm and submarine bolt are vivid and specific, and the bolt constrains the drum's mechanics (threads hold pressure). Spatial choreography is clean (shed → aisles). The "shadowseam light" and "indigo pulses" create consistent atmosphere, but sensory detail skews heavily visual; the mushrooms never smell, the drum never hums or heats Mara's hands. The bolt charges the final image, lifting this into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pay Old Sen's debt in diamonds) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara rejects the pyramid-scheme shortcut and volunteers her own memory, narrowing options. The drum's pressure-into-diamonds mechanism provides a clear escalation path, but the neighbors' participation arrives without on-page resistance or tradeoff—no one hesitates, pays a visible price, or risks exposure. Cost at closure is conceptual (uncertain future) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (collective honesty transforms regret into shared strength) emerges from the drum ritual and is charged by the bolt's evolving symbolism (depth demands honest fasteners). The quantum-promise motif recurs purposefully, reweighting prior pressure at the end. However, the piece skirts overt philosophizing—"translate pressure into diamonds" borders on thesis statement—and the parallel-selves texts risk explaining the theme rather than dramatizing it. The final spoken promise offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, keeping this above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric-dense and consistent ("shadowseam," "slick triangles of paper"), but register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "ache of those parallel selves like pressure she could finally use" and "quantum promise" feel authorial rather than Mara's idiom. Sentence stems repeat: "she kept," "she ran," "she used" across adjacent paragraphs. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality in the middle third ("slick triangles of paper that tried to wrap her wrists" is vivid but vague about the actual threat). Paraphrase loops: "tell the truth even when it hurt" closely echoes "stop pretending" two lines later. Template cadence: "she kept… she ran… she used…" across three paragraphs. Line-level clarity suffers in peak beats; the drum's mechanics (how confession becomes diamond) remain gestural. Deductions: density −0.5, loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, totaling roughly −1.3 in Q7, plus minor opacity touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quantum-promise mechanic and pressure-into-diamonds synthesis feel conceptually fresh, and the submarine bolt as honesty-fastener is a specific, non-obvious anchor. However, the redemption-through-collective-truth arc follows a familiar template (wounded healer gathers community to heal together), and the glitchy-texts-as-oracle device is a stock speculative trope. The piece commits fully to its premise, but the emotional resolution—neighbors unburdening without resistance—plays safely. Risk is conceptual rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's pyramid-scheme past frames her shame and desire for redemption (setup by ~15%), drives her rejection of the slogans at the drum (middle choice), and charges the final quantum promise (closure). She makes the key decision to volunteer her own memory rather than shortcut. Cost is visible: she risks re-exposure and chooses uncertainty. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5 = base ~7.2; minor swappability (any past shame could work) −0.4 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The submarine porthole bolt appears early (~10%), is handled in the drum assembly (middle beat), and becomes the diamond-studded anchor in the final image (closure). Its specific property (threads cut to hold against oceans/thought-tides) enables the drum's function and charges the "honest fasteners" motif. Present in all three gates with strong closure linkage and irreplaceability. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = base ~8.3; no significant frictions = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The quantum promise is named early (~20%) and explained conceptually ("exists in more than one outcome until someone chooses"), shapes Mara's decision to tell the truth (middle choice collapses one future), and is spoken aloud in the final line (closure). However, its mechanics remain abstract—how choosing solidifies a future into a diamond is asserted, not dramatized. Present in all three gates but causal pressure is weak (the concept is invoked more than it constrains). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4 = base ~5.8; ornamental use (more theme than mechanics) −0.1 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Virtuously mischievous" is introduced early (~12%) as a character label and mentioned twice (sliding spores, swapping swagger), but neither instance shows on-page cost or tradeoff—the pranks succeed without friction. The trait does not constrain a closure choice or evolve under pressure. Setup present, weak middle development (actions mentioned in summary), no closure participation. Early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4 = base ~3.7; label-only trait −0.3, swappability −0.2 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Volunteering appears early (clinic work ~15%), drives the key middle turn (she volunteers her own memory to the drum, rejecting the shortcut), and the final image shows her continuing to volunteer with new rules. The action is causally central and irreplaceable—without it, the drum sequence and collective honesty arc collapse. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5 = base ~8.3; minor late reprise (final line restates rather than advances) −0.2 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Glitchy texts are introduced early (~18%), deliver instructions for the drum assembly (middle beat), and one arrives in the final third ("Do it again, but share the load"). Present in all three gates, but the mechanics are vague—why do parallel dimensions send helpful advice? The method enables rather than constrains; Mara never struggles with garbled messages or trades ambiguity for action. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 = base ~5.0; late second text (final third) −0.3, ornamental (convenient oracle) −0.3 = 4.4, adjusted up slightly for closure participation to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is named in the opening line, supplies the shed and aisles for the drum ritual (middle), and the glow "stitched shadows to wonder" charges the final image. The farm's spores and lights are integral to the ritual's atmosphere and the neighbors' gathering. Present in all three gates with strong specificity. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base ~6.7; the farm itself doesn't constrain tactics (the drum could work elsewhere) −0.5 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When concepts become physical" is introduced in the opening phrase and governs the world logic (pyramid-scheme guilt becomes bricks, words have weight, pressure becomes diamonds). It frames the drum's function but never tightens a decision—Mara doesn't race a deadline or feel the season ending. Setup strong, middle use weak (static backdrop), no closure urgency. Early signal +0.6, causal pressure +0.5 = base ~4.1; static timeframe (no live clock) −0.0 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to translate pressure into diamonds is stated early (~8%) and dramatized when Mara uses the drum to transform regret into a literal diamond (middle choice) and when she invites neighbors to do the same (closure). The motivation is consistent and drives the arc, though the "miracle water to cousins" backstory feels ornamental. Present in all three gates with causal linkage. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2 = base ~6.9; minor abstraction (alchemy metaphor borders on thesis) −0.3 = 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shadowseam" and "wonder" appear early and recur (indigo pulses, violet spores, secret stars), creating a consistent lyric texture. Tone modulates subtly—darker when the slogans creep, lighter when the diamonds form—and charges the final image ("seams of shadow showed their secret stars"). Present in all three gates with strong closure linkage. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3 = base ~6.3; tone is static rather than dynamic under peak pressure (the wonder never falters or costs Mara clarity) +0.1 for lyric coherence = 6.4.</comment>
