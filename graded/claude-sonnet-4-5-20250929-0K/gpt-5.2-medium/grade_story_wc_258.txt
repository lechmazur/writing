<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "steadily curious" interiority reads as consistent, though the shift from passive observation to active collaboration with Aurel is somewhat telescoped. Grandmother's character comes through her notebooks and measuring method with embodied particularity. The final choice—to publish findings and return when the city changes—feels earned but lacks visible cost beyond time commitment. Internal contradiction is present (curiosity vs. caution) but not tested under sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator inherits measuring tape, receives Aurel's confession, decodes notebooks, and takes measurements into the streets, building toward a conceptual repricing where the "listening hush" becomes "a language." Closure lands cleanly—the map reveals "a cultural heartbeat" rather than market cycles, reweighting the inheritance. Orientation anchors arrive early (grandmother's loft, post-crash city, brass tape). One meaningful deepening occurs when street work validates the reconstruction method. Cost is conceptual (responsibility to share) rather than viscerally felt, keeping this shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vivid and recurring: "wet stone and old paper," rain stitching dusk, beads still present at midnight. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining the method (twelve feet from skylight marks a card placement). Streets are sketched through pawnshops, murals, water-truck queues—specific enough to ground the mapping expedition. The tape and skylight charge the final image when they return, raising this into the 7s despite limited occupational texture for cartomancy itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and continuing grandmother's cultural-pattern research—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The narrator's agency is present: choosing to unspool the tape, aligning sketches with beams, taking deck and tape into streets, promising to publish. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aurel confides his shame over guiding traders, raising ethical stakes. The resolution (accepting the inheritance, promising return visits) feels earned by prior work but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the cost remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—reconstruction versus prophecy, measuring invisible structures, cultural heartbeat over market cycle—emerges organically from the measuring method and street observations. The grandmother's last-page axiom ("never prophecy but reconstruction") avoids overt moralizing by arriving as discovered text rather than narrator assertion. The final image (rough map showing heartbeat, tape folded, deck given) offers a resonant answer: inheritance as ongoing collaborative curiosity. Subtext operates in Aurel's ink-stained fingers, the "vow to record," and the promise to return. No false equivalence or thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and layered: "listening hush," "writing in night," "rain stitched the dusk into silver lines." The narrator's perceptual signature (measuring everything before trusting it) remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Aurel's single line of dialogue ("said my grandmother had confided…") and his later traced-thumb gesture carry subtext (shame, vow). The prose modulates appropriately with pressure but occasionally edges toward elevated diction ("multiplying paths") that, while thematic, slightly distances the reader. Filter verbs ("I heard," "I understood") appear but are voice-motivated. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and key images (tape, skylight, ink-dark thumb) recur with purpose. However, several lines loop conceptually: "multiplying paths" appears three times without evolving meaning; "steadily curious" bookends but doesn't shift. The single-sentence paragraph structure, while intentional, creates visual monotony across 800 words. Minor clarity slip: "slid one card toward the spot where my tape marked twelve feet"—spatial choreography (is the tape already laid out?) is momentarily unclear. No major figurative muddle, but the density of elevated constructions ("a patient reverse engineering of why a city repeats its songs") occasionally slows momentum in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination—cartomancy as cultural archaeology, measuring tape as encoding key, post-crash mutual aid—feels specific and non-obvious. The story avoids template "wise elder" by making the grandmother absent and her method a puzzle. The transformation test passes: swapping names/setting would lose the post-crypto collapse context and the measuring-as-mapping logic. Risk is present in the lyric compression and mosaic structure (loft → notebooks → streets → loft). However, the cartomancer-as-guide and the "hidden map" frame echo common mystical-mentor tropes, and the resolution (promise to return, share findings) is earnest but safe. No proximity echoes or derivative premise, but the ending avoids a bold final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aurel opens the door, lays out the deck, explains the method, confides his shame, admits guiding traders, traces the final map, and gives the narrator the deck—present across setup, development, and payoff. His choices (confiding, handing over the deck, asking the narrator to return) enable key turns. His shame over "stealing the future" adds ethical pressure. However, his agency is secondary; the narrator drives discovery and publication. Causal role is clear but not indispensable—another guide could perform similar functions. Scores in the solid mid-range: essential but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brass measuring tape appears in the opening (inherited, carried to the loft), is unspooled across floorboards to test grandmother's method, marks twelve feet for card placement, becomes "a key" aligning sketches with beams, is taken into the streets, and is folded back into its case in the final beat. Three distinct beats (loft measurement, decoding, street mapping) plus closure reprise. The tape encodes dates in inches/centimeters—its specific properties (length, scale) matter causally. The final fold ("I folded the tape back into its case") carries ritual weight. Strong integration across all gates, but one step shy of indispensable—another inherited tool could theoretically serve a similar function, though less elegantly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reverse engineering" is introduced explicitly ("asked me to reverse engineer her method") and structures the entire narrative: starting from outcomes (riots, barter, slang) to reconstruct process, decoding dates from measurements, tracing three stories backward and forward. The concept shapes stakes (can the narrator decode the method?) and tactics (aligning sketches, following routes, multiplying paths). The grandmother's axiom ("never prophecy but reconstruction") reframes it at closure. The final map is described as "rough" but functional—a successful reverse-engineering. Present in setup, drives middle problem-solving, and charges the ending. The concept is load-bearing and irreplaceable; removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious, not brave" appears once in the opening and is echoed in the final line ("keep asking, steadily curious, until the hush becomes a language"). The trait constrains behavior—narrator measures before trusting, aligns sketches patiently, promises methodical publication—but no single on-page moment hinges on curiosity over another trait. The closing reprise reweights it as a methodological stance rather than just temperament, lifting it slightly. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with thematic resonance, but limited causal pressure in the middle. Mid-band: purposeful but not driving turns.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Confide" appears twice with distinct causal weight: grandmother confided in Aurel (setup), and Aurel confides his shame to the narrator (development). The second confession—steering traders toward mutual-aid kitchens—introduces ethical stakes and validates the method's real-world impact, raising pressure. The grandmother's last page "answers" Aurel's confession, creating a three-beat arc. The action is dramatized, not summarized, and the narrator's response (promise to publish) flows from it. Present across all gates, drives a key turn, but is not entirely irreplaceable—another vulnerability or revelation could serve a similar function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Multiplying paths" is explained mid-story ("every story a person told could be walked forward into the future and backward into its origin") and enacted in the street expedition ("following three stories at once: pawnshops, murals, lullabies"). The method shapes tactics—they must track multiple routes simultaneously—and the resulting map shows convergence. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the text asserts the method more than it dramatizes the cognitive or physical work of "multiplying." Present in development and payoff, enables the mapping beat, but the execution is more thematic than tactile. Solid mid-range: functional and specific but not vividly constrained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "rain-beaded skylight loft" anchors all four scenes: arrival, notebook work, departure, midnight return. The skylight provides a spatial reference (twelve feet from it marks card placement), and rain beading the glass bookends the narrative. The loft's smell (wet stone, old paper) and the glass above create atmosphere that supports the "inherited mystery" tone. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—no locked door, missing tool, or spatial limit alters tactics. It charges the final image (rain still beading at midnight) but does not pressure decisions. Three-gate presence with strong atmospheric work, but limited causal role keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cryptocurrency crash is the inciting context (city goes quiet, barter markets return, traders seek guidance) and motivates the narrator's inheritance visit. Aurel's backstory (guiding traders "after the crash") and the grandmother's recorded outcomes (riots, slang spread) tie to this timeframe. However, the crash itself does not tighten decisions within the story's present action—no deadline, no pressing threat, no time-sensitive cost. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than active pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic development) with clear world-building role, but minimal tactical constraint. Mid-band: contextually important but not driving on-page urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns" is the grandmother's project, inherited by the narrator, and dramatized through decoding (aligning sketches, measuring gaps and loops) and street mapping (pawnshops, murals, lullabies). The motivation is tested when Aurel confides his shame—should the method be kept private or shared?—and the narrator's final promise (publish in plain speech, return to re-map) resolves the question. The desire faces friction (complexity, responsibility) and results in visible commitment (accepting the deck, promising return visits). Present across all gates, drives multiple beats, and shapes closure. Strong integration with felt obligation, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery" is established immediately (grandmother's will, brass tape, Aurel's promise) and sustained through notebook decoding, encoded dates, and the final revelation (heartbeat vs. market cycle). Tone modulates appropriately: quiet curiosity in the loft, urgency during street mapping, ritual completion at midnight return. The rain, ink-stained fingers, and "listening hush" maintain atmospheric coherence. The final image—map made, tape folded, deck given—charges the mystery with collaborative continuity rather than resolution. The tone is load-bearing: removing it would flatten the narrative into procedural exposition. Present in every beat, constrains pacing, and amplifies closure. High integration.</comment>
