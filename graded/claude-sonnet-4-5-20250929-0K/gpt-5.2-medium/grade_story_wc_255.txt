<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's "innocently cunning" trait is established through the plant-language negotiation and her portrait gambit, but her interiority remains thin—we see tactics without the contradictory impulses that would charge her choices. Joren's fear of emptiness and his greed are told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The colorblindness functions as backstory explanation rather than a live constraint that alters her perception or tactics in scene. The final exchange feels transactional rather than emotionally costly, with the "borrowed starlight" insight arriving as a neat swap rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors early (phoenix aftermath, courtyard, Mara sketching). The closure unit—Mara taking the reed tongue after the shared-awakening trade—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("both more awake") rather than shown through a visible foreclosed option or altered stance. The spiral-arrangement sequence functions as a reversal (Joren "wakes" to non-transactional attention), yet the mechanics of "awakenings" remain abstract, weakening the because/therefore linkage when the final trade depends on them. Orientation Test penalty waived; lens holds, but cost clarity at closure is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored—glittering panes, furnace smoke, flagstone fractures, hanging chimes—and the plant-arrangement spiral visibly structures Mara's persuasion. The reed tongue's "cold edge bites her palm" and the vibrating chimes at the end charge the final image. Spatial choreography (pots, planters, velvet pouch) tracks clearly. However, the phoenix's world-altering effects (bartered awakenings, awakenings as currency) remain conceptual furniture rather than tactile constraints that pressure on-page choices; the courtyard itself does the causal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mara needs the reed tongue; secondary: Joren's fear of emptying himself through trades. The plant-language negotiation tightens when Joren refuses her first awakening ("not enough"), then Mara shifts tactics (portrait, spiral arrangement). But the escalation depends on Joren's emotional shift rather than a narrowing of Mara's options or a visible cost paid before the final beat. The closure trade—she asks for his "bubbles as stars" awakening and he "still remembers it, because the gift is shared"—feels like a workaround that sidesteps the story's own rule (awakenings are lost when given), undercutting the cost legibility the premise promised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—transactions that hollow versus trades that awaken both parties—emerges through the plant grammar, the portrait, and the spiral as alternative currencies. The "bubbles trapped in glass" motif (flaws as stars, then shared as a gift) reweights the premise without moralizing. The final line ("trades that leave both of them more awake") risks thematic echo but stays anchored in the rosemary/ivy particulars. Subtext operates in Mara's silence (she "measures every angle") and Joren's furnace-smoke roughness. The piece resists the commodification premise it sets up, which is fresh, but the shared-not-stolen twist arrives late without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited, Mara-focalized, with stable distance and purposeful diction ("innocently cunning," "lever that does not feel like cruelty"). The plant-language sequences are legible and voice-distinct. Joren's single spoken line ("the reed tongue once belonged to…") carries subtext (confession, warning). However, late in the story the narration accesses Joren's interior certainty ("something in him wakes that is not for sale") without clear signal, a brief focalization slip that clouds POV boundaries. The prose rhythm modulates well—compressed negotiation beats, then the lyric spiral-walk passage. No dialogue-tag clutter; perceptual signature is Mara's tactical eye, though colorblindness (her defining trait) does not color her on-page perception after the opening sketch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; each sentence advances negotiation or world detail. Rhythm varies (short tactical beats, longer lyric passages). However, paraphrase loops appear: "the phoenix's return changed more than the skyline; it left behind bartered awakenings" is immediately glossed in the next sentence. Template cadence in the middle third: "Joren pauses, tempted… / Joren finally speaks aloud… / Joren walks the spiral…" stacks "Joren [verb]" openings across four consecutive beats. The final image—reed tongue vibrating, chimes trembling, "every tremor shows her a new shade of wrong"—is vivid, but "shade of wrong that feels strangely right" is a told epiphany rather than shown sensation. Minor filter-verb stack ("eyes shine with the shock") dulls one peak beat. Applying Template-cadence check (−0.5) and Paraphrase-loop (−0.2) in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conceit—post-phoenix economy of traded insights, silent plant grammar as negotiation language—is fresh and tightly braided. Mara's colorblindness as asset rather than deficit avoids the deficit-overcome template. The "shared rather than stolen" twist on the awakening rule is non-obvious and earned in hindsight through the portrait and spiral beats. The glassblower-and-painter pairing and the plant-message system feel specific to this world. Risk: the accumulative texture (awakenings, plant language, glass metaphors, bubbles-as-stars) could collapse into ornament, but each layer constrains Joren's choice, so the synthesis holds. One proximity note: "cooled tears" (glass panes) and "borrowed starlight" lean toward poetic stock, but the overall vision is singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (colorblind painter) drives all negotiation beats and the closure trade. Setup: opening sketch; Development: portrait and spiral arrangement choices; Payoff: final reed-tongue acceptance. Colorblindness itself is mentioned at the start ("she wants to find beauty in imperfection rather than chase correct hues") and reprised obliquely in the final line ("shade of wrong that feels strangely right"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—it functions as thematic backstory rather than live pressure. Her painter identity shapes the portrait tactic (~one beat). Score reflects two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with mid-involvement causal work; colorblindness as label rather than actionable constraint limits score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concertina reed tongue appears in setup (Joren keeps it in velvet pouch), middle (Mara asks for it, Joren hesitates and reveals its musician origin, finally offers it), and closure (Mara takes it, breathes through it, the note vibrates chimes and shows her "new shades of wrong"). Three beats, early signal, closure involvement with reweighted sensory effect (vibration → tremor → perception shift). The brass sliver's origin story (musician's last awakening) adds cost. Causal pressure: Mara's entire negotiation aims to obtain it, so it drives tactics. Specificity: "can wake cooled glass into motion" is unique; not easily swappable. Applying Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, Causal pressure +1.2, Closure linkage +1.4, Specificity +0.6, minus no major friction = mid-7s band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings (core concept) frames the world, signals in the opening third ("people can trade as if they were coins"), shapes Joren's refusal ("he has already bought too many that turned sour"), and the final trade hinges on awakenings. Setup and payoff gates met. Development: Mara offers her first awakening (Joren rejects it), then negotiates for one of his; the concept constrains both characters' options and the resolution depends on redefining the trade (shared vs. stolen). However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of what an awakening exchange looks or feels like until the final paragraph, so the concept functions more as world-rule than live pressure that alters tactics beat by beat. Causal work present but one step removed from embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" (attribute) is introduced in paragraph one ("smiles as if she has forgotten to be wary while she measures every angle"). Development: the portrait gambit and plant-spiral persuasion illustrate tactical thinking; her silence and plant grammar are cunning moves. But the "innocent" half is told rather than shown—no on-page moment where her apparent guilelessness disarms Joren or lowers his guard in a way that costs or enables something specific. The trait is consistent but remains a label that describes tactics rather than a friction that forces a visible trade-off. Setup and development gates met, closure participation indirect. Applying Label-only deduction −0.6, two beats +0.9, Causal involvement (tactics shaped) +0.8, Late first concrete use −0.3 = mid-4s band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Awaken" (action) appears throughout: Mara's first awakening (colorblind insight), Joren's fear of awakening-fueled glass craft, Mara's proposal to "awaken his courtyard," the final shared awakening (bubbles-as-stars). Setup in opening paragraphs, development in middle negotiation, payoff at closure. The action shapes the entire negotiation structure. However, "awaken" is polysemous—sometimes literal (trade of insights), sometimes metaphorical (courtyard spiral "wakes" attention)—and the final trade's "shared rather than stolen" twist sidesteps the established cost (you lose the insight you give). This makes the action central but somewhat diffuse in mechanics; the verb could be swapped for "insight" or "gift" without major structural change. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, but medium specificity and one mechanical fudge at the end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Communicating through plant arrangements (method) is taught in paragraph four ("Three sprigs of rosemary… a circle of ivy… a single thorny stem"), used across multiple beats (Mara's silent opening, Joren's "wilted fern beside an empty bowl" refusal, Mara's "wreath of cracked eggshells around mint"), and culminates in the courtyard spiral arrangement that becomes the persuasive lever. Setup by 25%, development in two distinct negotiation exchanges, closure linked (spiral walk directly precedes Joren's decision). The method is specific and irreplaceable—remove it and the silent negotiation collapses into dialogue. Causal pressure high; cost connection present (Mara invests labor and invention). Applying Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, Causal pressure +1.4, Closure linkage +1.2, Specificity +0.7 = high-7s band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glassblower's courtyard (setting) anchors every beat: glittering panes, plant pots along the wall, flagstone fractures, hanging chimes. Setup immediate, development throughout (plant arrangements placed in courtyard, spiral walk across flagstones), payoff (chimes vibrate at closure). The courtyard supplies the medium (plants, stones) that enables Mara's persuasion method and the spiral pattern that shifts Joren. However, the space itself is neutral—any outdoor workshop with planters would serve; the courtyard's glass-specific details (panes, chimes) are atmospheric rather than constraining. Spatial choreography clear. Applying Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, Causal enablement +0.9, Closure linkage (chimes tremble) +1.0, moderate Swappability −0.5 = mid-6s band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the phoenix rises" sets the world state (ash smell, bartered awakenings) and appears in the opening and closing lines as a framing refrain. But the phoenix event itself is backstory; no on-page ticking clock or time pressure narrows Mara's choices. The phrase functions as thematic echo rather than temporal constraint. Setup in first line, payoff in final paragraph ("After the phoenix rises, people keep bartering…"), but no middle development that makes time matter to tactics. Lyric reprise present, but the timeframe is setting-furniture rather than a force. Applying Lyric-resonance allowance (early seed → final reprise) to reach ~4.2, but no causal pressure or middle involvement caps higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to find beauty in imperfection" appears in the opening ("she wants to find beauty in imperfection rather than chase correct hues") and is reprised in the portrait tactic ("she lets the mistakes show: the tremor in his hand, the soot… the tiny scar") and the final note ("every tremor shows her a new shade of wrong that feels strangely right"). Setup, development (portrait as proof of the ethos), and payoff gates met. The motivation drives the portrait choice, which is a key turn. However, the friction between wanting beauty-in-flaw and needing the reed tongue is not dramatized—Mara never faces a choice where perfection would be easier or cheaper. The motivation is thematically consistent but not tested under pressure. Two beats, causal role in one major turn (portrait), closure reprise, but told more than conflicted.</comment>
