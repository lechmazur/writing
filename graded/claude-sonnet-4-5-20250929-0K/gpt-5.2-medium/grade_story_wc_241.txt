<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The daughter's interior is specific and embodied—"clover melancholy," grief that feels "both lucky and bruised"—and her contradictory impulses (theoretically rebellious yet rule-abiding) generate the scavenger hunt choice. Her gradual shift from wanting to understand his chase to teaching students odds versus cost is earned. The father remains thin; his "palms empty at last" finale feels asserted rather than dramatized, and the final conversation summarizes rather than shows his renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the exhibit and the shared lantern conversation reconfigure her grief and his gambling into a teaching moment with visible cost (she must carry his confession forward, he must stop). The causal chain from note to subway scavenger hunt to library volumes to hospital-line seat is legible, and the final image reweights the clover symbol with undeniable pressure. Minor: the grad-student overpass detail feels planted for the envelope reveal rather than arising organically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica-pane lantern is handled across multiple beats (library, subway, overpass, father's room) and its "layered amber" light charges the closure. Rain, clover scent, and subway seat scrawls anchor sensory perception. The library and hospital settings constrain her choices. Small slip: "circulation desk" and "waterproof envelope taped behind a timetable" read convenient rather than lived-in; the spatial choreography of the overpass is vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding her father's double life without inheriting it—is signaled early and tightens as each scrawl narrows her interpretation. The scavenger hunt escalates from contradiction ("CERTAINTY IS A COIN WITH TWO HEADS") to cost warning ("DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE") to plea ("TEACH THEM ODDS, THEN TEACH THEM COST"). The exhibit decision and lantern visit are protagonist-driven with visible cost: she accepts the burden of teaching his lesson.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme—odds versus cost, lucid contradictions, and the line between rebellion and inheritance—emerges through scrawls, photographs, and the clover motif without stated morals. The final exhibit and conversation offer a resonant answer: rebellion can be theoretical yet useful when it teaches perspective. The "green enough to hold sorrow and still make room for another day" image reweights the clover symbol with earned complexity. No thematic echo or late sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "theoretically rebellious," "lucky and bruised," "grief felt like clover." Diction remains stable in the daughter's voice—educated yet emotionally particular. Purposeful compression in the scavenger-hunt beats maintains momentum. Small slip: "lucid contradiction so clear it felt like instruction" edges toward overt theme labeling, and the father's final line "the best bet was learning to stop" reads slightly didactic rather than voiced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (mica pane, clover, "tree of forks and odds") is concrete. Minor issues: "made my grief feel both lucky and bruised" and "clover melancholy" restate similar ground without added pressure; "Lucid Contradictions" as exhibit title is on-the-nose; "theoretically rebellious, the kind who argued about ethics in seminars yet obeyed speed limits" is scaffolding that could compress to action. No major loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes scavenger hunt, addiction narrative, and father-daughter teaching into a fresh frame: subway scrawls as field notes, probability as confession. The mica lantern and clover motif feel specific to this voice and world. Risk: the reflective frame and interleaved photographs could flatten pressure, but the piece maintains momentum. Small derivative note: the "teach them odds/cost" plea echoes familiar addiction-recovery arcs; the story transforms it through the exhibit and lantern closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The daughter is present from the opening, drives every major beat (library visit, subway traverse, envelope discovery, exhibit setup, father conversation), and her choices create all key turns. Her final decision to exhibit and teach forecloses inheriting his compulsion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lantern appears in four distinct beats: library (lit, mica pane clouds), subway (circles light), overpass (guides), father's room (trembles with flame, closure image). Its "visible grain" and layered amber light charge the final shared moment. Removal would collapse the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" shapes stakes: the scrawls embody contradictions ("CERTAINTY IS A COIN WITH TWO HEADS, DON'T FLIP, LOOK"), the father's proofs end with questions, and the daughter's rebellion is theoretical yet useful. It drives her interpretation method and the exhibit title. Strong integration, though the exhibit title is slightly on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is signaled early and constrains her choice to follow the scavenger hunt "responsibly" rather than recklessly. It recurs in the final note: "rebellion can be theoretical yet still useful." The trait enables her synthesis of ethics and obedience, but the cost is more implied than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Traverse" frames the entire narrative: the note commands it, the subway map structures it, and the daughter's physical traversal from library to subway to overpass to hospital line generates all major beats. The final conversation completes the traverse from his double life to her teaching stance. Swapping this action would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interpreting scrawls is signaled early ("the only way to read them was the way he taught me to read people") and shapes every subway beat: Westbridge ("CERTAINTY IS A COIN"), Harborline ("THE HOUSE ALWAYS LOSES IF YOU LEAVE"), hospital line ("TEACH THEM ODDS, THEN TEACH THEM COST"). The method drives her understanding and the exhibit premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer anchors the opening, houses the note and call-number volumes, and hosts the final exhibit. Rain recurs across scenes (opening, overpass, hospital window, closing), and midsummer frames urgency. The library's smell and clover courtyard pressure her grief. Strong integration; minor: the library could compress slightly without losing function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The heart attack timeframe is signaled in the opening and motivates the daughter's quest ("doctors ordered rest," "bring him something from the library"). It pressures the father's vulnerability and her urgency. The closure returns to his recovery window. Cost is felt but not dramatically tightened; no live countdown shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is stated early and drives her choice to follow the scavenger hunt rather than ignore it. It conflicts with her risk of inheriting his compulsion, and the resolution (exhibit, teaching) enacts the motivation. Slightly told rather than fully dramatized in friction, but the final exhibit choice makes it concrete.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is introduced early ("that smell made my grief feel both lucky and bruised"), recurs in the father's doodle ("childish doodle of a four leaf clover"), and charges the closure ("our grief felt like clover again, green enough to hold sorrow and still make room for another day"). Tone modulates with pressure: reflective in library, urgent in subway, resolved in the final shared light.</comment>
