<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is concrete and character-particular throughout—she is "lucidly watchful despite exhaustion," and her choices (pressing the shell, following the inked path, wading upstream against the current, gathering the cameo-shapes) are motivated by her obsession with "darker courage" and her refusal of the contracted bright ending. The gathered shapes function as micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values: she risks "silence" to collect witnesses rather than slide toward the "mouth of light." The final act—writing the baker's stepping-stone path instead of the easy bridge—earns the change through prior causality and forecloses the contracted ending with visible cost. Minor: the cameos (hero-baker, unfinished child, rival reviewer) apply pressure but remain somewhat abstract; embodied contradiction could deepen further in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (mist-nexus layering, gathering shapes, ink-river pressure, recurrence of shell and whisper). Orientation anchors (Mara at desk, manuscript, shell fragment) land by line 3; the transition into the nexus is signaled ("stepped between two sentences") and the spatial logic (shredded chapters underfoot, ink river, bank of metaphors, wet book at source) remains coherent. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—Mara opens the wet book "against its will," writes the stepping-stone ending that refuses the easy bridge, and the reversal of the ink river carries the hopes back with visible cost: she chooses "quiet, multiple shapes of hope" over applause, and the shell "becomes only a fragment again" but is kept as a reminder. Cost is legible in the final image (no applause, the contracted ending replaced). One meaningful deepening: the upstream wade against the current, the gathering of shapes, and the vow at the book all tighten options and charge the final scene. Deduction: the accumulative beats (cameos, shapes, climbing the bank) are rich but occasionally blur causality—why does the vow at the top make the cameos return as witnesses, and how does writing the scene reverse the river? The linkage is poetic but not entirely motivated within the established rules of the nexus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral nexus is vividly particular: "ground underfoot was made of shredded chapters," "wind had teeth," "narrow river of ink," "bank of broken metaphors," and the wet-leather book "closing itself page by page." These details constrain Mara's path (she must wade upstream, climb the bank, cut her thumb to mark the climb with blood) and charge the final image (blank paper "breathing"). The shell fragment functions as micro-setting: it warms, pulses approval, cuts her thumb—each use alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the scent of yeast, the cool mist "like erased drafts," the ink rising "like doubt"). Minor: the nexus rules (how the cameos leave shapes, why the vow makes them return) remain somewhat abstract; a bit more grounding in the mechanics of this space would anchor the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mara is "contracted to deliver a bright ending, yet obsessed with the darker courage of going against the current" and enters the nexus "to collect the shapes of different hopes" so she can "write an ending that does not lie." Pressure coheres and tightens: the ink river tugs at her ankles with "promises of ease" versus her upstream wade; she understands "resisting meant risking silence"; the climb up the bank and the cut thumb are physical costs. The final turn is protagonist-driven: she lays the gathered shapes on the cover, speaks her vow, opens the book "against its will," and writes the stepping-stone scene instead of the contracted ending—altering her own manuscript and foreclosing the commercial path with visible cost (applause replaced by "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). One meaningful tightening occurs (the upstream struggle, the vow, the reversal of the river). Minor: the cameos' return after the vow feels slightly unmotivated within the established causality of the nexus; the mechanism is poetic but not fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the conflict between contracted "bright ending" and "darker courage," the upstream wade against the current (physical and metaphorical), the gathering of "shapes of different hopes" (ephemeral cameos leaving pebble, ribbon, thimble), and the final stepping-stone path "one loaf at a time" versus the "easy bridge." The shell fragment recurs with shifting meaning (catalyst at desk → guide in nexus → "only a fragment again" as reminder). No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant answer through image: the baker's stepping-stone path and the "quiet, multiple shapes of hope" reweight the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the gathered objects (loaf, pebble, ribbon, thimble) and the river's "promises of ease" versus Mara's upstream choice. The final image—manuscript rustling shut, "swirling hush" with "multiple shapes of hope"—reconfigures the opening's "whisper of closing pages" and "novel tighten[ing] like a fist." Slight: the cameos as "witnesses" and the idea that "readers actually carry through loss" are elegant but border on abstraction; one more concrete particular in that beat would anchor the theme fully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance, perceptually filtered through Mara's watchfulness. Diction is consistent and textured ("chalky and pink," "tidewater moving backward," "erased drafts," "wind had teeth," "bank of broken metaphors"). The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: the opening is compressed and declarative, the nexus beats are layered and immersive, the ending slows into resonance ("swirling hush," "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). Purposeful compression and patterned cadence (the recurring "whisper," "hush," "closing pages") are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor: occasional filter-stack in high-pressure beats ("She understood then," "At the top, she laid") and a few near-repetitions in syntactic stems ("The first hope appeared," "More cameos drifted") create slight drag; a bit more varied sentence openings in the middle third would tighten the voice further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes ("Inside the whisper of closing pages" → "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). Information density is high in most beats; many lines do double work (the shell both warms and seeps letters; the baker glances back and the glance "turned into a small, warm loaf"). Clarity is generally strong, though a few beats approach density overload ("drawing a map toward a feral nexus in mist" and "the wind had teeth, and yet every sound was wrapped in the same hush" layer metaphor on metaphor without pause). Minor loop: "whisper" and "hush" recur across four beats without added pressure in the middle; "closing pages" appears three times. The phrase "shapes of different hopes" and "gathered shapes" repeat across adjacent paragraphs without variation. Template-cadence run: "She tucked… She understood… She wrote…" in close succession. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for filter-verb stack ("She understood then," "She wrote," "She laid"). No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4 per the priority check, yielding net −0.7 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—novelist enters her manuscript to gather "shapes of different hopes" and resist the contracted ending—is fresh and specific. The nexus mechanics (ink river, shredded-chapter ground, wet book, ephemeral cameos leaving objects) are particular to this voice and setting. The final turn (writing the stepping-stone path, river reversing, hopes returned to owners) grows from prior material and feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking: the accumulative structure, the layered metaphor-space, and the quiet ending (no applause, "swirling hush") heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for proximity to meta-fiction templates (writer struggling with ending enters the story-world) and the cameo mechanics (hero-baker, unfinished child, rival reviewer) that feel slightly convenient rather than inevitable; a tighter causal grounding for why these specific figures appear would elevate originality further. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for the risk of the metaphor-nexus and the upstream-reversal payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (conflicted novelist) drives the key turns: she presses the shell (line 4), follows the inked path and steps between sentences (line 6), wades upstream against the current (line 14), climbs the bank and cuts her thumb (line 20), lays the gathered shapes and speaks the vow (line 21), opens the book against its will (line 24), and writes the stepping-stone ending (line 25). Each choice alters tactics and forecloses the contracted path with visible cost. Setup by line 2, development in the upstream wade and gathering beats (middle third), payoff in the vow and writing beats (final third). Causal pressure strong; closure linkage direct. Minor: the character is more device than person—her interior is consistent but the upstream struggle could show more contradictory impulses in scene to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The spiral seashell fragment is handled across four beats: received on desk (line 3), pressed to ear and warmed to seep letters (lines 4–5), pulses approval during the upstream wade (line 14), cuts Mara's thumb at the climb (line 20), cools and is pocketed as reminder at the end (line 27). Setup by line 3, development in two middle beats (warms/seeps, pulses), payoff in final image (cools, becomes "only a fragment again," pocketed as reminder). It enables the transition into the nexus and constrains the climb (blood mark). Causal role across three distinct beats; closure linkage present (the reminder that "stories can resist gravity without breaking" reweights the shell's meaning). Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = base ~5.0 + adjustments = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Against the current" shapes stakes and tactics on every page: Mara is "obsessed with the darker courage of going against the current" (line 2), the shell's sound is "tidewater moving backward" (line 4), the ink river streams toward the mouth of light and "tugged at her ankles with promises of ease" but she "waded upstream" (lines 9–10, 14), and at the river's source she climbs against the pull (line 19–20). The final scene reverses the river, "carrying the hopes… back into their owners" (line 26). Setup by line 2, development in the upstream wade and climb (middle third), payoff in the river reversal (final third). Causal pressure across all major beats; closure directly tied (the reversal is the conceptual and physical payoff). Cost visible (risk of silence, cut thumb, no applause). Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~6.4 base + high irreplaceability = ~8.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears twice: "Mara, lucidly watchful despite exhaustion, followed the inked path" (line 6) and "her lucid watchfulness steadied them [the cameos]" (line 23). Setup by line 6 (early), payoff in line 23 (closure participation: the watchfulness steadies the witnesses). The trait enables the gathering and vow beats—Mara's clarity under pressure lets her see the cameos and solemnize them. Cost: her exhaustion is named but not dramatized as a tradeoff in tactical choices. The attribute is present and functional but could constrain a middle choice more visibly (e.g., exhaustion nearly causing her to slip or miss a cameo) to reach higher bands. Score: setup +0.6, one beat (steadying cameos) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, cost (implied but not dramatized) +0.2, label-only in first mention −0.3, swappability (could be "clear-eyed" or "alert") −0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears twice: Mara's goal is "to collect the shapes… one that solemnized what readers actually carry through loss" (line 11) and "she laid her gathered shapes on the cover and spoke the only vow she trusted, solemnizing them not as plot devices but as witnesses" (line 21). Setup by line 11 (early), payoff at the vow (line 21, closure-adjacent). The action is the hinge: laying the shapes and speaking the vow causes the cameos to return as witnesses (line 22), which then allows Mara to write the stepping-stone ending. Major turn traces to this action. Minor: the mechanics of "solemnize" (a vow that transforms the cameos) are poetic but slightly abstract; a more concrete on-page signal of what the vow does would make it indispensable. Score: setup +0.7, one key beat (the vow) +0.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5, swappability (could be "honored" or "witnessed") −0.5, summary phrasing ("spoke the only vow she trusted") −0.4 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is the method throughout: "The first hope appeared as an ephemeral cameo" (line 12), followed by hero-baker, child, rival reviewer, stranger (lines 12–16), and "More cameos drifted out of the fog" (line 15). The cameos leave shapes (loaf, pebble, ribbon, thimble) that Mara gathers; at the vow they "returned, no longer fleeting, and circled her in mist, their faces smoothing into strangers who might open the book years later" (line 22). Setup by line 12 (early), development across the gathering beats (middle third), payoff when the cameos return as witnesses and enable the writing (lines 22–23, closure-adjacent). The method shapes all attempts and is irreplaceable. Score: setup +0.7, three beats (appear, drift, return) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost (Mara risks losing them to the current) +0.4 = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "feral nexus in mist" is introduced by line 5 ("drawing a map toward a feral nexus in mist"), entered at line 7 ("Mist took her at once"), and sustained through the entire middle: "In that nexus the wind had teeth" (line 8), ink river (line 9), shredded chapters underfoot (line 7), bank of broken metaphors (line 20). The setting constrains choice: the ink river tugs at Mara's ankles and she must wade upstream (line 14), climb the bank with a cut thumb (line 20), and reach the wet book at the source (line 19). Setup by line 5, development across the upstream wade and climb (middle third), payoff at the book and river reversal (final third). Causal pressure across all major beats; closure linkage strong (the nexus rules govern the reversal). Minor: the nexus mechanics (why the vow makes the cameos return, how the writing reverses the river) are slightly abstract; more concrete anchors for the space's rules would make it indispensable. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost (upstream struggle, cut thumb) +0.5, abstract mechanics −0.4 = ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" frames the timeframe in the opening line and recurs at the end: "the manuscript's last page rustled shut, and in the swirling hush" (line 28). The temporal frame is the moment of narrative closure—Mara is inside the act of finishing her novel. The pressure is implicit: the "closing pages" signal deadline urgency, the nexus journey is a compression of that moment, and the return to the desk with the manuscript "rustled shut" marks completion. Setup by line 1, payoff in line 28 (closure). The timeframe charges the final image but does not tighten tactics in the middle (no live clock that alters Mara's choices scene-to-scene). Score: setup +0.8, one beat (final line reprise) +0.4, closure linkage +1.4, lyric resonance +0.6, specificity +0.4, no middle tightening −0.5, vague tracking in middle beats −0.4, swappability (could be "at the moment of finishing") −0.5 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated at line 10 ("she had come: to collect the shapes of different hopes") and dramatized across the gathering beats: the baker's loaf (line 13), pebble/ribbon/thimble (line 16), "tried to clutch them all" (line 17), laid them on the cover at the vow (line 21), and the final scene writes the stepping-stone path as the collected answer (line 25). Setup by line 10 (early), development in the gathering and vow beats (middle and closure-adjacent), payoff in the writing and reversal (final third). The desire is conflicted—Mara risks silence and the contracted ending to gather these shapes instead of sliding toward the "mouth of light." Cost visible (no applause, "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). Score: setup +0.7, three beats (gather, vow, write) +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5, friction (told at line 10, then dramatized) −0.3, swappability (could be "to gather different endings") −0.5 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" is established at line 4 ("the room filled with a swirling hush that sounded like tidewater moving backward"), recurs at line 8 ("every sound was wrapped in the same hush"), and returns in the final line ("in the swirling hush she heard not applause but the quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). The tone is coherent through all turns: the mist and hush wrap the nexus journey, modulate during the upstream struggle (quieting the wind's teeth, muffling the river's promises), and charge the final image (no applause, only "swirling hush" and "quiet shapes"). Setup by line 4, development at line 8 (middle), payoff in line 28 (closure). The tone reweights the stakes—Mara chooses the hush over the loud commercial ending—and is indispensable to the final image. Score: setup +0.7, two beats (line 8, line 28) +0.9, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.7, cost (replaces applause) +0.5, coherence across turns +0.6, tone shifts purposefully with pressure +0.4 = ~7.9 (round down from 8.5 due to slight ornamental feel at line 8, where the hush is restated without added pressure).</comment>
