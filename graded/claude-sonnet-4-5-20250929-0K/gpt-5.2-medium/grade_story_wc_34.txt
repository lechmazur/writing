<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's interior is concrete and particular—his relationship to the ghost driven by recognized hunger rather than sentiment. His micro-choices (drilling the plate, kneeling to encode, striking sparks) accumulate pressure and reveal hierarchy of values. The final realization that the ghost wants routing, not resurrection, and his soft laugh at having practiced quiet his whole life, earn the closure choice. Minor slip: the ghost's agency occasionally bleeds into Lio's decisions without clear dramatized friction between their wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout: density increases from tuning through encoding to sparks and thunder's break, reweighting the dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs via routing). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio's final glyph promises to keep walking, the graffiti travels below, readers find their needs spoken back—options reconfigured, cost felt (he commits to perpetual quiet carrier role). Orientation anchors (courtyard, Lio, tonight, storm coming) arrive cleanly within the first 100 words. One meaningful deepening: the ghost's need clarifies from resurrection to routing, narrowing Lio's tactical choice and foreclosing alternatives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard's wet stones, floating sundials, parapet graffiti layers, and bolt-plate holes as musical stave constrain Lio's encoding method and charge the final spark-strike image. Storm metal smell and phosphor afterglow filter through Lio's attentiveness to atmospheric pressure. The brass-gear lute, memory chip, and charcoal guide anchor micro-setting as tools that enable the encoding action. Spatial choreography (kneeling by parapet, sliding plate under charcoal) remains clear across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulate unspoken needs through encoded graffiti) signaled early and tightens through the ghost's urgency before thunder erases the moment. One meaningful deepening: Lio realizes the ghost wants routing, not resurrection, which narrows his choice to committing as a quiet carrier. The tightening forecloses the alternative (resurrecting the ghost's voice) with visible cost: Lio accepts perpetual silence and walking. Agency is decision and endurance; the final glyph and promise constrain future paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (the routing of unspoken needs through quiet carriers) emerges from concrete particulars: the ghost's list, Lio's own hidden line, the graffiti readers below. The bolt-plate motif shifts from botanist tool to charm to musical stave to spark-maker, reweighting presence across beats. The final image—readers finding their needs spoken back—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Lio's soft laugh at having practiced quiet his whole life avoids epiphany cliché by grounding insight in embodied history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-particular: Lio notices gear clicks, phosphor afterglow, wire loops, memory-chip warmth. Diction ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong melody," "routing") remains voice-motivated and specific. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Lio. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during encoding, slightly wider for the courtyard's listening stones). Minor density slip: "like a moth circling a lamp it could not touch" is vivid but slightly elevates register during a pressure beat without clear payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies (short spark-strike, longer encoding description) and propels through the tightening window. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density: three similes in the opening third (sundials like islands, ghost like moth, drum like being carried) without full payoff, approaching but not crossing the −0.3 threshold. Clarity and momentum remain strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost-in-code seeking routing via graffiti encoding during lightning's silence—is specific and non-obvious. The bolt-plate transformation (botanist tool → encoding guide) and the ghost's need distinction (not resurrection but routing) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (accumulative pressure, lyric attention to objects, quiet closure via promise) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image (readers finding needs spoken back) transforms prior particulars and resists generic template plots.</comment>
