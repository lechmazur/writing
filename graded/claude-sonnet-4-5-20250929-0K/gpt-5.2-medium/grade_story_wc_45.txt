<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rowan's skepticism cracking into responsibility is well-motivated through concrete details: the familiar bone-setting on the substitute body, Lina's circled mistakes, the changeling's aching jaw. His final choice to step through the hedge door follows causally from accumulating evidence. Minor issue: the girl's appearance feels somewhat convenient, though her physical need (misaligned jaw) grounds the encounter in his professional competence. Internal contradiction between grief-informed doubt and methodical investigation operates consistently throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Rowan steps through the hedge door, a Decisive Change driven by accumulated evidence (tooth, star map, bone-setting marks, the girl's jaw) that transforms his skepticism into active pursuit. The Causal lens holds: each discovery narrows his certainty until crossing the threshold becomes inevitable. Orientation anchors quickly (bone setter, morgue, garden, riverbank). One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes "someone else with his lessons" did the work, collapsing coincidence into pattern. Cost is visible: he abandons his skeptic's position and enters literal darkness on a changeling's promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats: weathered sundials beside hybrid roses signal "nostalgia and innovation," the bench hides Lina's notebook, the loose stone conceals her case notes. The garden's silent electric pump and crushed-mint future anchor the tonal blend. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations (morgue, garden, riverbank, garden return). The hedge door opening onto darkness supplies the final threshold that alters Rowan's options. The riverbank reeds and twig splints provide forensic texture that drives plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to accept the changeling and pursue the real Lina—is signaled early through the torn death note and "cleft in certainty widening." Pressure tightens causally: notebook → tooth → case notes → body's bone-setting marks → the girl's misaligned jaw. Each discovery forecloses the skeptic's retreat. The girl's appearance and Rowan's decision to set her jaw, then step through the door, constitute agency with visible cost: he abandons the known world on a supernatural promise. The bone-setting of the changeling's jaw—relief as ordinary work—deepens his professional identity even as it undermines his rationalist stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of "navigating by what we get wrong" emerges concretely through Lina's constellation system (Cassiopeia for failed sets, Orion for late visits) and Rowan's method of turning "mistakes into constellations." The baby tooth and star map literalize this without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the girl's "shrewdly innocent" candor and Rowan's refusal of charm or prayer in favor of his satchel. The final image—tying the tooth to the map "like a new point of light"—offers a resonant answer: error becomes navigation tool. No thematic echo or moralizing; complexity remains in whether forgiveness of the changeling honors or betrays the real Lina.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Rowan's perceptual signature (bone-setter's eye for joints, distrust of legends, yearning for facts that don't bruise) filters all detail. Diction stays within his register: "cleft in certainty," "wrong kind of familiar," "patient methods." The girl's dialogue—"I left it for you," "shrewdly innocent in its candor"—carries distinct voice without head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the jaw examination, pulled back for forensic analysis. Minor slip: "eyes bright as polished seeds" verges on ornamental in a pragmatic POV, though the image serves the uncanny effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Rhythm varies appropriately (shorter sentences during the jaw examination, longer accumulative ones in the garden). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the opening: "a forgiving skeptic who never mocked grief but distrusted legends" front-loads exposition that could unfold through action. "Shrewdly innocent" appears three times, risking motif over-emphasis. Figurative language ("constellations," "polished seeds," "living branches") remains coherent and voice-matched. The final line's compression—"determined to chart whatever came next"—delivers propulsion without explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone-setter protagonist and constellation-as-error-map system offer a fresh synthesis of skepticism and folklore. The changeling's medical need (misaligned jaw) grounds the supernatural in Rowan's practical competence, avoiding mystical passivity. Risk: the piece commits to its premise without hedging the uncanny. Weakness: the substitute-body premise echoes changeling templates widely; transformation lies in the forensic lens (twig splints, healed collarbone) and the professional apprenticeship angle. The star map literalizes "navigate by mistakes" without full inevitability—it's clever but slightly imposed. The hedge-door threshold and tied tooth elevate the ending above stock folklore.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan (forgiving skeptic) drives every major turn: tears up death note, follows star map, examines body forensically, sets the girl's jaw, steps through the door. His skepticism cracking into "responsibility" rather than belief shapes the ending's tone. Early signal (first paragraph). Present in closure (crosses threshold). Causal pressure throughout. Cost visible: abandons rationalist ground.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Baby tooth appears in three distinct beats: found in notebook (setup), Rowan pockets it, ties it to star map at closure. Reweighted meaning: from forensic evidence → navigation point. Charged reprise that transforms prior image. Specific properties (chipped edge, pried early) matter. Closure linkage strong. Slight deduction: middle beat (pocketing) is brief.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cleft in certainty" is signaled early (torn death note) and widens through accumulated evidence, altering Rowan's tactics from signing off to active investigation. It shapes the dominant stake. Present at closure as he steps into literal uncertainty. Functions as both emotional state and structural principle. Modest penalty: the phrase itself is used only once; the concept recurs through action but lacks the iterative pressure of tooth or garden.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" characterizes Lina's questions ("why pain made people lie"), the girl's candor, and the changeling's surprise at ordinary relief. It enables Rowan's final trust (her innocence despite substitution) and constraints his response (he treats rather than banishes). Present in three beats. Visible tradeoff: innocence disarms his skepticism, shrewdness justifies the apprenticeship. Slight swappability: "cunning naivety" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Yearn" is the explicit verb driving Rowan's journey: yearning for non-bruising facts leads him to the garden, and "yearning steadied into work" precedes the jaw-setting. Two key turns trace to it. Present at closure as determination. Replaceability test: "seek" or "long for" would require rewriting the emotional arc. Modest deduction: the word itself appears twice; the emotional engine is clear but not iteratively tested under contrary pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled early (title, Lina watching wrist repairs), drives forensic discovery (healed collarbone, twig splints, small practiced hand), and delivers the climactic act (setting the changeling's jaw with "gentle pressure"). Mechanics matter: Rowan's "patient methods" and the girl's "misaligned hinge" are concrete. Present in four beats. Causal and closure participation strong. Irreplaceable: no other medical skill fits the rural setting and mistake-navigation theme as tightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Secret garden is signaled early (Lina loved it), houses three plot objects (notebook, star map, tin box), and provides the hedge door at closure. "Nostalgia and innovation" (sundials, electric pump, hybrid roses) charges the tonal blend. Micro-setting (bench, loose stone, living-branch door) alters tactics. Spatial specificity (clipped yew, northern turn) grounds the maze. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Essential to the star-map logic and threshold crossing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors in first sentence ("After they found the substitute body") and tracks through morgue visit "that morning," dusk return to riverbank, and final garden encounter. One-day compression tightens decisions. Modest development: time pressure is implied (body discovery forces reckoning) but not dramatized as a live clock. Closure participation weak: the hedge-door crossing is not time-constrained. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Turn mistakes into constellations" is dramatized through Lina's red-circled case notes (Cassiopeia, Orion) and Rowan's final act (tying tooth to star map). Desire drives the garden search and the decision to "chart whatever came next." Friction visible: his yearning for non-bruising facts conflicts with the changeling's ambiguous cost (forgiveness vs. betrayal of real Lina). Present in three beats. Closure strong. Slight swappability: "redeem errors" would require thematic rework but structurally fit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is coherent throughout: weathered sundials/new roses, silent electric pump, Lina's "future should smell like crushed mint," old manor/hedge maze, folklore/bone-setting science. Tone modulates under pressure: wistful in garden, clinical at riverbank, charged at closure. Final image (tying tooth to map) blends past artifact and forward navigation. Slight deduction: tone is more described than felt in some beats (the "nostalgia and innovation always met here" line tells rather than showing through rhythm).</comment>
