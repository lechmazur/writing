<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her chess-tutor lens and physical fidgeting, grounding her internal conflict. The interiority shows genuine contradiction between her tactical mind and regret, particularly visible when she faces her mirrored past self at the gate. However, the prince's war backstory remains abstract—we never see Mara wrestle with a specific remembered move or consequence that would deepen the cost of her exile. The final renunciation ("simply learning to move differently") feels earned but could land harder with one concrete micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path earlier in the maze sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with Mara's renunciation ("offer a draw to the past") that forecloses heroic acclaim and accepts quiet self-forgiveness; the cost is legible in her bowed exit and refusal of credit. The causal lens holds: tapestry decode → labyrinth navigation → gate confrontation → release. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woven hush "pressed on her ears" after she speaks the sequence, raising cost and foreclosing retreat. The platinum labyrinth functions as both constraint and mirror, shaping her tactical choices throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, tapestry, and Mara's body (fidgeting thumb-and-forefinger) all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's chess-tutor perception: "snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "bright maze of metal lines that hummed." The mirrored gate surface forces her confrontation with her past self, a micro-setting move that drives the climax. Spatial choreography across street, inn table, labyrinth junctions, and bell tower remains clear throughout. The frozen ale mid-pour and children mid-skip ground the village's stasis vividly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via puzzle-solving that might free the village—signals early and tightens once when the woven hush "pressed on her ears," forcing Mara to choose the longer labyrinth route that "preserved the frozen townsfolk's unbroken lives" over clever shortcuts. That turn narrows options and raises cost under a causal lens. The final gate confrontation deepens stakes by requiring her to "offer a draw to the past" rather than conquer, a choice that forecloses heroic recognition with visible cost (her exit without applause). Agency is present: decode, navigate, renounce. The coincidental spell-breaking setup (rumor said tapestry could unpick the hush) slightly softens the causal chain, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of self-forgiveness through renunciation of mastery emerges from concrete particulars: the tapestry's frayed border, the chess metaphor of offering a draw, the mirrored gate showing her "sharp, praised, and careless" past. The final image—Mara walking through "now-living streets, forgiven not by law or prince, but by the patient game within her chest"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The woven hush and platinum labyrinth both mirror "pitiless logic," tying premise to character flaw. One small slip: "assuming the pieces were only pieces" edges toward explicit thesis statement, though it's brief and tied to her tactical failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (chess-tutor lens, tactical vocabulary like "winnow," "advance, yield"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "fidgets productively," "fierce repose," "bright, pitiless logic." The innkeeper's brief dialogue at the end provides contrast without head-hopping. However, some figurative phrasing in peak beats ("snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "sky had pinched the hour between two fingers") tilts slightly elevated for a exiled tutor's internal voice under stress, and "the patient game within her chest" in the final line, while resonant, edges ornamental rather than inevitable from her established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well across the piece; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple jobs. Clarity holds throughout spatial and causal sequences. However, figurative language clusters densely in several high-pressure beats: "sky had pinched the hour," "snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "village's trapped heartbeat," "水releases a stone dropped too long in a fist." The phrase "fidgets productively" recurs exactly twice, borderline scaffold. The opening sentence runs long with multiple nested clauses that slightly slow entry momentum. "Fierce repose" (a required element) appears only as a standalone phrase mid-paragraph without integration into action, reading ornamental in that beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor exile, time-freeze puzzle, and self-forgiveness through tactical renunciation feels specific and non-obvious. The platinum labyrinth that mirrors her past logic and the tapestry-as-key both avoid stock fantasy tropes. The final move—offering a draw rather than winning—transforms the chess metaphor freshly. However, the frozen-village-awaiting-hero premise and the solve-the-riddle-to-break-the-spell structure are well-worn fantasy templates. The piece transforms them through Mara's particular guilt and the "woven hush" concept, but the bones remain recognizable. The emotional truth of self-forgiveness through humility elevates the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout, makes the key choices (decode, navigate, renounce at gate, decline credit), and her chess-tutor identity shapes her perception and tactics. Her decision to take the longer labyrinth route and to "offer a draw" at the gate are both on-page turns that alter the outcome. Introduced in the opening line, drives at least three beats, and shapes the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced in paragraph three, constrains Mara's navigation choices across multiple beats (junctions, temptation of shortcuts, final gate), and its dimming signals the closure. It mirrors her "pitiless logic," charging the thematic layer. The maze's "bright, pitiless logic" is handled and crossed with visible cost (longer route to preserve lives). Appears in setup, middle navigation, and closure moment; irreplaceable structural anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "woven hush" is named early, explained as "a quiet stitched into air" that can be unpicked by the tapestry, and Mara's speaking the decoded sequence causes it to "tighten, pressing on her ears." At closure, she "loosened the woven hush enough to breathe," and its release allows time to resume. It shapes stakes and tactics on the page (she must decode and navigate under its pressure) and is causally active at the ending. The concept could be more irreplaceable—similar freeze-spell language would work—but it drives two beats and the release moment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is mentioned twice: tapping imagined pawns on her thigh (opening) and rubbing thumb-against-forefinger at labyrinth junctions (middle). Both moments show her using the habit to maintain tactical focus under pressure. However, the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with felt cost—it colors her character but remains largely ornamental. The action fits her chess-tutor identity but could be swapped for another nervous habit without altering plot or closure. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears twice as a verb: once when Mara must "winnow the true path from its glittering turns" (setup) and again when she "learned to winnow temptation from necessity" at the junctions (middle). The action drives her maze navigation—choosing the correct path over shortcuts—and is causally necessary for her to reach the gate and achieve closure. However, the word itself is somewhat swappable (sift, discern, filter) without major structural loss. The concept of selection under pressure is essential; the exact verb is apt but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph four: "rumor said it could be unpicked only by decoding frayed threads"), dramatized at the inn table where Mara spreads the tapestry and traces the seam to read encoded moves, and explicitly invoked at closure ("by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border one last time, she loosened the woven hush"). The method is specific, its mechanics matter (frayed seam as letters-as-moves), and it shapes her attempts across the middle and ending. Removal would collapse the plot. The method is signaled, used, and pays off with clear causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Brinewick, the time-frozen village, is introduced in the opening line and its stasis creates the central problem Mara must solve. The frozen state supplies immediate pressure (people mid-breath, ale mid-pour) and resources (the platinum labyrinth planted in the cobbles). The setting constrains her choices throughout: she cannot ask for help, must navigate alone, and the environment's resumed motion signals her success. The village's particulars (inn table, cobbles, bell tower) ground spatial choreography. Setup, middle navigation, and closure all depend on the frozen state; highly essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" opens the story and "thunder rolled again beyond the hills" closes it, bracketing the action. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—Mara's urgency comes from internal guilt and the puzzle's difficulty, not a live clock. The thunder's resumption marks the spell's end but does not pressure her choices during the sequence. The element is present and symmetric but largely ornamental; it could be removed with minor rephrasing and no loss of escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is Mara's explicit motivation, signaled early ("to forgive oneself for past mistakes, and the only teacher left for that lesson was the silence she had earned"). It drives her choice to take the harder labyrinth path that preserves lives, her confrontation with her mirrored past at the gate, and her final renunciation of applause. The friction between her tactical skill and her guilt creates visible cost (she chooses the longer route, offers a draw, exits without recognition). Motivation is dramatized through action and choice, not merely told, and shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" appears once mid-story ("Mara stood, steady in fierce repose") and colors the overall register—controlled intensity beneath quiet. The tone is coherent and supports the piece's measured pacing through high-stakes action. However, the phrase itself is somewhat static; it does not modulate visibly with pressure or charge the final image, which leans more toward humble quiet than fierce poise. The tone is present and consistent but does not actively shape turns or the closure moment. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
