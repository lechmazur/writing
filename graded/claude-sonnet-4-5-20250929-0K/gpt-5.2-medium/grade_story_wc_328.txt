<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear—professional bitterness driving her undercover work—and her arc from skeptical researcher to someone who chooses anchored hands over pure documentation feels earned. The interior voice is specific ("grief people carried behind their teeth"), though Jonas's character relies heavily on atmospheric detail rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His final choice to offer bitterness as a punchline rather than price provides the closure shift, but the metamorphosis threat feels more described than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Edda remains functional support rather than a pressure source with her own competing stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly: Mara, Larkspur, post-Jonas's return, underground garden. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (causal escalation via the lure-and-anchor plan, accumulative texture via the music/gravity motifs) that coheres at closure when Jonas converts his bitterness into refusal. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) lands on the page: "jokes, he said, are how you refuse to disappear" reweights the opening grief-and-disappearance frame with visible cost (Jonas keeps the phone, remains a potential doorway). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara plants the arrowhead and the gravity hiccups, narrowing options and forcing Jonas's final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: warm earth, glowing plants, pots that slide uphill establish the gravitational playfulness and pressure Mara's anchor-planting tactic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air tasted of iron, honey, and the old grief"), and the flint arrowhead's hum and Edda's claim it "pins the world down" charge the final beat when Mara uses it as a tent-stake. Spatial choreography remains clear across the shop-to-garden descent and the climactic lure scene. The cordless phone by the potting bench integrates setting and method cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent Jonas from becoming a doorway for the Pulling Choir. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara and Edda lure Jonas into the garden and plant the arrowhead, forcing his choice to offer bitterness rather than vanish. The escalation is visible (music thickens, pots lift, shadow peels), and Jonas's agency—speaking into the phone, making bitterness the punchline—drives the resolution under the Hybrid lens. However, the Pulling Choir remains abstract; its pressure is atmospheric rather than a force with tactics that adapt to protagonist moves, and the gravity "hiccup" reads as convenient coincidence rather than earned consequence of Jonas's decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—how to refuse disappearance, how bitterness can become defiance rather than price—emerges from concrete particulars: the arrowhead as stitch, the Choir's untamed harmony, Jonas's frostbitten hope crystallizing into a joke. The final image ("jokes...are how you refuse to disappear") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Jonas's question whether bitterness can become a cosmic joke and Mara's professional grief mirroring the town's loss. The flint arrowhead's shift from sky-fallen myth to human-knapped anchor charges the ending without symbolic shouting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "the old grief people carried behind their teeth," hears the "soft extra tone that tugged at my ribs," and her voice modulates naturally from clinical researcher to someone who plants an arrowhead "as if nailing down a tent in a storm." Psychic distance is controlled; Mara infers Jonas's state without claiming certainty beyond her senses. The prose has rhythmic variety and the interior lexicon stays consistent, though some phrases ("gravitationally playful," "metamorphose...into a doorway") drift toward elevated diction that straddles Mara's voice and authorial framing. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jonas's lines carry subtext and pursue goals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high across most beats: "Edda said Jonas came to her at night, asking for valerian and silence" does character, setting, and plot work simultaneously. However, a paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "notes that refused to settle into any key" and "a harmony untamed" restate the same concept without added pressure. The phrase "as if gravity had learned to smile" and "gravitationally playful" risk register drift into whimsy that tensions the frostbitten tone. Minor scaffold phrasing ("some evenings," "that night") and one template cadence run ("He told," "He spoke," "He asked") across adjacent beats reduce propulsion slightly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; no major muddle at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid research, underground herbalism, gravity-bending music, and the specific tactic of using a flint arrowhead to anchor reality feels non-obvious and specific to this story's logic. The frame of bitterness-as-punchline transforms a familiar return-changed trope through Jonas's final speech act and Mara's choice to file her report as apprentice diary rather than proof. The Pulling Choir's abstraction and the convenient gravity hiccup keep the piece from full inevitability in hindsight, but the risk-taking (untamed harmony as antagonist, phone as confessional conduit, arrowhead as cosmological pin) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (cryptid researcher undercover) is present from the opening and drives two key beats: revealing her badge to Edda and planting the arrowhead in the climactic garden scene. Her professional bitterness and choice to help "keep him human" rather than document proof shapes the ending when she files her report as apprentice diary. However, much of the middle unfolds via Jonas's phone confessions and Edda's exposition; Mara observes and records more than she decides until the final third. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage (report choice) +0.9, causal pressure (badge reveal, arrowhead plant) +0.8; late-middle passivity −0.4, swappability (another researcher could perform similar moves) −0.5, ornamental use in phone-call beats −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears in three beats: Edda's tin beside it, Mara holding it and feeling its hum, and Mara planting it point-first to anchor Jonas during the climax. Its meaning evolves from "fell from the sky" myth to human-knapped stitch "to pin the world down," and its specific use (planted like a tent-stake) enables the resolution. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (anchors gravity, enables Jonas's choice) +1.2, closure linkage (active in final scene) +1.3, specificity (its hum, its origin correction, its physical planting all matter) +0.7; no major frictions. The arrowhead is indispensable to the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" (Pulling Choir's music) is signaled early via Jonas's phone confessions, shapes the middle pressure (pots slide, coffee swirls, shadow peels), and is present at closure when it "folded into a chord my bones could bear." The concept's mechanics—notes refusing to settle, bodies drifting toward it—constrain Jonas's threat of metamorphosis and enable Mara's anchor tactic. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement (phone calls, climax) +0.9, causal pressure (drives Jonas's transformation threat) +0.9, closure linkage (chord resolution) +1.0, specificity (counterclockwise swirl, uphill pots, peeling shadow all manifest it) +0.6; abstraction (the Choir itself never acts, only Jonas responds) −0.7, swappability (another mystical force could serve similar role) −0.6, summary-only in phone beats −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is demonstrated on the page: pots slide uphill "like children pretending they had not moved," coffee swirls counterclockwise, the room's gravity "hiccuped like a mischievous child." These effects shape Edda's muttering and Mara's recognition of the Choir's influence, and the final gravity hiccup is the physical correlate of Jonas's choice. However, the attribute remains a passive atmospheric effect rather than a constraint Jonas or Mara must navigate tactically; it complicates but does not force trade-offs. Early signal (pots, coffee) +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage (final hiccup) +0.8, cost connection (gravity settling marks Jonas's survival) +0.4; label-only in Edda's line ("gravitationally playful") −0.3, ornamental in middle beats (swirl, slide) −0.4, swappability (another reality-bending effect could serve) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Jonas's metamorphosis—"not into an animal, but into a doorway"—is the central threat that structures the plot: his phone confessions reveal it, Edda and Mara's lure plan aims to prevent it, and his final speech act (offering bitterness as punchline) arrests it. The action is signaled early (phone call: "he could feel himself beginning to metamorphose"), present in the climax (shadow peeling, lamps dimming), and resolved when Jonas remains "crouched beside the arrowhead, sweating and ordinary." Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (drives lure plan) +1.1, closure linkage (resolved state) +1.1, irreplaceability (doorway-specific rather than generic transformation) +0.5; summary-only in phone beat −0.4, the mechanism (why arrowhead + joke stops it) remains opaque −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced early ("by the potting bench"), used across multiple beats (Jonas's confessions, the final call in Mara's pocket), and its specific mechanics matter: "ring without a line," "static-laden," antenna taped, buttons worn smooth. The phone shapes how Jonas communicates his metamorphosis and how he delivers his final refusal to the Choir. Jonas keeping the phone at the end charges the image with future stakes. Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (enables confession and final speech) +0.8, closure linkage (Jonas keeps it, promises to answer) +0.9, specificity (static, worn buttons, ringing in Mara's pocket) +0.6; swappability (another communication device could serve with edits) −0.7, the phone does not constrain choices, only enables −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established early (stairwell drop, warm earth, mint and rue under lamps), supplies the climactic lure location, and its specific features (potting bench for phone, soil for arrowhead planting, grow lights that dim) enable the resolution. The garden's warmth and life contrast with Jonas's frostbitten state, and the uphill-sliding pots demonstrate the Choir's influence. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement (arrival, climax) +0.9, causal pressure (chosen lure site, soil for anchor) +1.0, closure linkage (active setting for final scene) +1.2, specificity (underground, glowing plants, iron-honey air) +0.7; the garden does not constrain Mara's tactics beyond providing soil −0.4, postcard elements (mint, rue) are decorative −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" frames the story's temporal anchor: Jonas vanished in February, returned in March, and the present action occurs in this post-return window. The timeframe establishes the town's grief and Jonas's altered state, but it does not tighten on-page decisions. The action unfolds across "some evenings" and "that night" without a live clock that pressures Mara's or Jonas's choices; the metamorphosis threat is progressive but not time-bound. Early signal (opening line) +0.7, thematic linkage (return and change are central) +0.5; vague elapsed time ("some evenings," "later, as dawn cooled") −0.6, no deadline or time constraint that alters tactics −0.9, swappability (any post-event window could serve) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jonas's desire to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke is signaled in dialogue ("whether bitterness could be turned into a cosmic joke") and dramatized in his final choice: "if they wanted a doorway they could have his bitterness, and he would make it the punchline, not the price." This motivation drives the climax and is mirrored in Mara's professional bitterness, creating thematic friction. The want conflicts with Jonas's fear of disappearing, and the cost—remaining a potential doorway, keeping the phone—is visible. Early signal (dialogue) +0.6, closure linkage (punchline speech) +1.4, causal pressure (motivates final refusal) +1.3, cost connection (ongoing risk) +0.5; the motivation is told in dialogue more than shown through earlier conflicted choices −0.6, secondary (Mara's bitterness) is sketched rather than tested −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frostbitten hope is established in the opening ("a thaw that still stung") and sustained through imagery: Jonas's river-ice eyes, "laugh that never reached his mouth," "a sound cracked with frostbitten hope" when he finally smiles. The tone modulates with pressure—icy distance in phone calls, warming when Mara and Edda act, cracked warmth at closure—and charges the final image (jokes as refusal). Diction and rhythm support the tone: short, clear sentences in crisis beats; longer, lyric constructions in reflective moments. Early signal +0.8, coherent modulation +1.2, closure charge (cracked laugh, dawn cooling) +1.4, specificity (ice, frost, thaw as lived texture) +0.7; one mid-story phrase ("gravitationally playful") tensions the cold tone without clear purpose −0.3.</comment>
