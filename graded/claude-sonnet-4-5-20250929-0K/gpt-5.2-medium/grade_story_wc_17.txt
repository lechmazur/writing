<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is concrete and embodied through her cartography work, though her interior life leans toward abstract philosophical musings ("what walls dream about") more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The decision at the end—to submit a false map and preserve the chamber's privacy—is earned by the diary revelations and her mother's voice, but the choice unfolds through summary rather than a dramatized micro-choice with visible hesitation or cost on the page. Arlen functions well as an off-page architect whose legacy pressures Liora, and the final promise to the corridors closes with credible endurance, though the emotional progression from discovery to deception could show more internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing (discoveries narrow options and reweight the stake). The closure—submitting a false report and playing one final chord—lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Liora forecloses public restoration and accepts the burden of selective silence, a visible renunciation with felt cost. The diary → film strip → hidden chamber → voice archive sequence is tightly causal, and the final act definitively alters her relationship to the legacy, though the drones' arrival and her decision to deceive could have been sharpened with one more beat of hesitation or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, fireplace, and ceramic chamber are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (soot taste, overlapping taps, ceramic murmurs) and each constrains or enables a choice: the passage hides the entrance, the fireplace yields the diary, the chamber reveals the archive. The film strip held to afternoon glare is a micro-setting move that charges the discovery beat. Climate-shifted fog and heat anchor the world without exposition, and spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The ceramic plates speaking in layered murmurs directly charges the final image and Liora's decision, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to restore or protect the wall archive—is signaled early through Liora's dual motivation (Restoration Office commission vs. personal curiosity) and tightens when the drones arrive and she realizes the tourist-installation threat. The diary and film strip discoveries escalate pressure by revealing Arlen's encoded intention and her mother's voice, narrowing her options to public exposure or protective deception. The final choice to submit a false map and play one chord forecloses the public path with visible cost (professional dishonesty, solitary burden), though the escalation could gain sharpness if the drones' pressure or the council's prior refusal created one more on-page complication that forced an immediate tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of legacy's burden—choosing which echoes to restore and which to bury—emerges through concrete particulars (Arlen's hidden vents, his council rejection, the mother's apology) without thesis statements until the final paragraph's "promised the sleeping corridors they would be heard only when someone was ready to listen," which hovers near a moral but is anchored by the prior choice and final chord. The film strip as "key" and the walls as dreamers recur with reweighted meaning: first literal cartography, then emotional archaeology, finally ethical stewardship. The ending offers a resonant answer—selective silence over broadcast grief—that reweights the academy's history and Liora's role without resolving into a binary, though the "one day an heir with true hearing would come" passage edges toward Thematic Echo by articulating the premise too cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices sound texture ("overlapping taps," "layered murmurs") and architectural memory before visual detail, consistent with her profession. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("she understood at last that her own job was not to steal the walls' dreams") to wider reflection on Arlen's encoded intentions. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("descendants would need them to endure the changed world") that reads slightly above Liora's tacit voice under stress, and a few filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") cluster in the final third where immediacy would serve better. No head-hopping, and the ending's promise to the corridors maintains voice coherence with a slight compression that fits the moment's solemnity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (e.g., "the corridor answered in overlapping taps" advances plot and establishes sensory signature), but several phrases loop conceptually: "legacy's burden" appears three times, "what walls dream about" twice in close proximity, and "ivy-veiled passage" recurs without evolving function. The fireplace-as-trash-pit beat and the diary fragments are vivid, but "echoes" and "dreams" become near-synonyms by mid-story without sharper differentiation. The final paragraph's "promised the sleeping corridors they would be heard only when someone was ready to listen" is clear but slightly over-articulated for the moment's pressure. No mixed metaphors or grammar slips; proofreading is clean, and the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—architectural sound archives as family legacy—offers a fresh synthesis of cartography, climate memory, and ethical stewardship, and the film strip as sonic key is a non-obvious invention. However, the "hidden archive discovered by sensitive heir" frame and the "suppress the truth to protect it" climax echo familiar templates (inherited mystery, noble concealment), and the transformation relies more on atmospheric texture than on a surprising moral calculus or structural risk. The walls-as-dreamers motif and ceramic-plate murmurs are specific and memorable, and the choice to deceive the Restoration Office adds ethical friction, but the arc follows a predictable discover-decide-protect path without a beat that fundamentally reweights prior assumptions. Solid synthesis elevated by setting detail, not yet indispensable originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's role as corridor echo cartographer is signaled in the opening sentence and drives every major beat: she uses hand recorder and chalk to map echoes, follows them to the fireplace, aligns the film strip with the passage, taps the stone to find the bricked door, and listens to the chamber archive. Her profession enables the discovery sequence and her final choice—submitting a false structural report—directly exploits her cartographic authority. The character is irreplaceable; a generic archaeologist or historian could not perform these specific sonic-mapping actions. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears mid-story (diary mentions it, then Liora finds it sealed in wax), is held to afternoon glare to reveal annotated frames, and its scratched numbers match Liora's chalked echo intervals, enabling the discovery of the bricked door—two distinct beats of use. The strip returns at the end as the "only true key" that Liora has now used and understood, reweighting Arlen's encoded intention. Its unique property (light-and-sound twin equations) is irreplaceable; no other object could perform this alignment function. Setup in first third, development in middle discovery, closure linkage through the unlocking it enabled. High causal pressure, specificity, and cost connection (decoding the strip is the condition for the ethical burden Liora accepts).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is named early in Arlen's diary ("a burden he could not pass down cleanly") and reappears when Liora feels it "settle on her chest" after hearing her mother's voice, directly shaping her decision about which echoes to restore versus bury. The concept drives the central stake (public broadcast vs. protective silence) and the final choice to submit a false map and promise selective listening. It appears in all three gates: setup (Arlen's design intention), development (Liora's realization of her role), and closure (the promise to the corridors). The burden is not merely thematic decoration; it narrows Liora's options and imposes a visible cost (professional dishonesty, solitary stewardship). High causal pressure and closure linkage, though the phrase "legacy's burden" is repeated slightly more than functional necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive is introduced in the opening paragraph as Liora's ability to "hear where sound lingered like memory," enabling her cartography work. This trait allows her to follow overlapping taps to the fireplace, align the film strip with echo intervals, and recognize her mother's voice in the chamber archive—at least two beats of use. However, the trait is presented more as a professional skill without visible on-page cost or tradeoff; we do not see Liora struggle with sensory overload, misinterpretation, or a moment where heightened perception creates a problem. The attribute enables discoveries but lacks the friction or price that would elevate it to essential. Setup, development, and closure participation all present, but causal pressure and cost connection are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glimpse occurs when Liora reads the half-burned diaries and "began to glimpse a second map drawn in words," which initiates the shift from sonic cartography to uncovering Arlen's hidden archive. This action leads directly to finding the film strip and understanding the vents' purpose—it redefines her task from structural safety assessment to ethical stewardship. The glimpse is signaled mid-story (slightly late for maximum impact) and is necessary for the plot's central turn, though "glimpse" itself is somewhat abstract; a more concrete dramatization of the moment of recognition would strengthen integration. The action shapes two beats (diary discovery, subsequent film-strip use) and directly enables the closure decision. Causal pressure is strong, but the late arrival and summary quality lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace—is introduced early when Liora slips into the ivy-veiled passage and discovers the fireplace used as a trash pit. The diaries' curled, marginally legible pages reveal Arlen's identity, his conversations with corridors, and the existence of the film strip, driving the entire discovery sequence. Liora returns to the fireplace after the chamber revelation to read remaining fragments about the council's refusal, which motivates her final protective choice. The method appears in three beats (initial discovery, film-strip extraction, final fragment reading) and is irreplaceable; no other means could convey Arlen's encoded instructions and backstory. Setup in first third, development through multiple uses, closure linkage via the council-refusal fragment that justifies her deception. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is introduced in the opening as the only accessible entrance after the main collapse, channels Liora's movement, hides the cracked stone and fireplace, and reappears when she aligns the film strip with it to find the bricked door. The passage also frames the final beat: "alone in the ivy-veiled passage at dusk, she played one final chord into the wall." It appears in setup, development (film-strip alignment), and closure (final chord), and its concealment property is essential to both discovery and the story's logic of hidden archives. The setting constrains choices (limits access, guides discovery) and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After the climate shifts is signaled in the opening sentence and establishes the world's changed state (salt fog, heat, abandoned academy, ivy overgrowth), motivating the Restoration Office's commission and the evacuations that left the diaries. The timeframe also pressures Liora's ethical choice: the city is "trying to forget the famine years," and tourism threatens to commodify grief. However, the timeframe does not create a live ticking clock or narrow tactical decisions within the story's present action; it functions more as static backstory context than as a force that tightens moves. Setup is present, closure linkage is thematic (city forgetting vs. Liora's choice to preserve selectively), but middle development is weak—no moment where climate or time urgency alters a tactic. Moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover what walls dream about is named early as Liora's "private motivation" and echoed in her mother's claim, creating a personal stake beyond the Restoration Office commission. This desire drives her to map echoes, interpret the diary, and ultimately listen to the chamber archive where the walls literally "speak in layered murmurs, as if the academy were dreaming aloud." The motivation is dramatized through her choices (following echoes, decoding the film strip, playing the final chord) and faces friction when she must decide whether to broadcast the dreams or keep them private. Setup, development (her persistent exploration), and closure (the promise to let walls be heard "only when someone was ready to listen") all present. The motivation is slightly abstract and could benefit from one more on-page moment where the desire conflicts with a competing need, but it shapes the arc and final choice with visible cost.</comment>
