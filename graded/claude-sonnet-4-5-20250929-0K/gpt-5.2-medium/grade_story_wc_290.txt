<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's trait of claustrophobic-yet-adventurous is shown through concrete choices (listening for the organ, keeping the sky in mind, striking the compass into mortar), and the mentor's transparent form earns pathos. However, interiority relies heavily on metaphor and declaration rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously; peak moments like "fear was only another measurement" read as thesis rather than lived experience. The final choice to plant the compass point feels motivated by the scene's logic, though the emotional cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid): planting the compass cracks the nexus and releases the mentor, reconfiguring space from prison to stable path, with cost legible in the shaking hands and the mentor's century-long wait. The single-sentence structure and compressed timeline maintain coherence; the organ-as-sonar and compass-as-draft-tool mechanics hold throughout. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wall tries to fold the narrator and the compass insists on an exit, narrowing options and raising cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nexus as a space that "argues," "votes," and refuses geometry is specific and charged; the organ reverberation functions as sonar and constraint, shaping the narrator's steps ("only on notes that rang clean"). The compass point as tool constrains choice twice (mortar strike, final planting) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the mutinous architecture; the body's claustrophobia filters perception throughout ("enclosed dark made my lungs tighten"). The shadowed nexus under starlight recurs as frame and final anchor, grounding the drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover the vital key) is signaled early and drives action. Escalation tightens when the wall hinges inward, forcing the compass-point strike that opens a seam—a meaningful choice with immediate cost (fear recalibrated, seam grudgingly given). The mentor's revelation redefines the key from object to consent, and the final planting forecloses the prison-state with visible consequence (corridors snap apart, mentor released). One substantive reversal and one deepening occur under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the organ's pulse and spatial resistance. Cost is conceptual but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—space serves memory instead of rule, rebellion as consent rather than force—emerges from concrete action (speaking erased place-names, transfixing the lock with "wistful rebellion") without thesis statement. The compass point's shift from navigation to drafting possibilities reweights the premise organically. The ending image (silent pipes, reverberation in bones, room for new maps) offers a non-literal answer to the central question with resonance rooted in prior particulars. Subtext operates cleanly in the mentor's smile and the lock's negotiation; no overt moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (architectural metaphors, sonar-listening, geometric vocabulary) remains consistent and distinct. Vocabulary fits an educated explorer's register without jarring leaps. However, diction under peak pressure ("fear was only another measurement," "wistful rebellion that remembered all the maps I had loved and outgrown") elevates into thesis-adjacent phrasing that slightly dilutes immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully. The organ-as-guide conceit is taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, especially in crisis beats ("corridors declared spatial mutiny," "cathedral turned inside out," "clenched like ribs"), risking ornament over propulsion. Several lines paraphrase the same spatial-rebellion concept without adding pressure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm supports the exploratory tone. No outright loops or scaffolding artifacts, but the accumulation of metaphor in peak moments (wall hinging, lock spinning) slightly obscures immediate causality. Information density is strong when grounded in organ-pulse mechanics and compass strikes; softer when abstract ("space gave way with a grudging sigh").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobia, spatial mutiny, organ-as-sonar, and compass-as-drafting-tool feels specific and internally coherent; the "key is consent" turn is non-obvious and grows from established logic. The wistful-rebellion tone and the mentor-as-transparent-dust image avoid stock templates. However, the frontier-towns frame and the "places erased by empire" gesture toward familiar speculative-fiction vocabulary without full transformation. Risk-taking (sustained metaphorical architecture, compressed timeline, lyric cadence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning modest positive adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer trait is signaled early, constrains the descent method (listening for the organ rather than torchlight), and shapes the peak choice to plant the compass despite shaking hands. Present in setup, middle (wall-fold escape), and closure (driving the point into the tightest seam). Causal role in two beats; cost legible in the shaking and the repeated "sky in mind" tactic. Swappability is low; the trait directly enables the organ-listening strategy and the final act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass point is introduced in the opening third (mentor's gift, "bite true north"), used actively in the middle beat (striking mortar to open the seam), and drives the closure (planted to crack the prison). Three distinct on-page uses; irreplaceable—its sharpness drafts possibilities, not mere direction. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost connection is clear (mentor's vanishing, narrator's shaking hands). Specific properties matter; a generic tool could not fulfill the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is the story's engine: distances argue, doorways vote, corridors refuse maps. It shapes tactics throughout (stepping only on clean organ notes, speaking place-names to negotiate aisles, transfixing the lock to align shelves with breathing). Setup, development, and closure all hinge on it. The concept is not merely thematic but mechanically active, narrowing options and forcing adaptation. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous" is declared in the opening and shown in two beats: listening for the organ rather than descending blind (prudence) and striking the compass into mortar when the wall folds (adventure). The final planting (hands shaking but acting) balances both. Present in setup and closure; constrains choice visibly. However, the trait functions more as characterization than a unique story lever—similar beats could occur with a differently labeled temperament. Mid-band for functional but somewhat replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transfix" appears once as the narrator stares at the lock "until my gaze could transfix it, not with force but with a quiet, wistful rebellion." This act triggers the lock's spin and the shelves' reorientation, a key turn. Setup is implicit (the organ tones arrive delayed, teaching negotiation); the action itself occurs mid-story and enables closure. One major beat, closure linkage clear, but the action is brief and could arguably be rephrased as "focus" or "negotiate" with minor tonal cost. Strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The organ reverberation is signaled in the opening third ("lonely church organ…pulsed through stone like sonar"), shapes every descent move (stepping on clean notes, timing floor slides, guiding the spiral stair), and returns at closure (trembling chord held while the compass is planted; silent afterward but still felt). Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure. Mechanics matter: it's navigation system, timer, and negotiation medium. Removing it would require fundamental restructuring. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is the story's spatial and thematic anchor. It frames the opening (place cartographers refuse to name, crack in the world with open sky), constrains every tactic (the mutinous architecture forces negotiation), and closes the piece (climbing out beneath starlight, world with room for new maps). Setup, development, and closure all turn on it. The nexus is mechanically indispensable—its properties (rearranging chambers, arguing distances) drive every pressure point. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The fallow period is mentioned in the opening sentence and evoked once at the end ("fallow silence," "frontier would wake"), but it does not constrain any on-page choice or tighten a deadline. Setup is present but development and closure participation are absent. The story's pressure comes from spatial mutiny and the organ's rhythm, not seasonal urgency. Functional as atmosphere but replaceable; removing it would not alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation (uncover a vital key lost to time) is declared early and pursued on the page: descending, navigating, transfixing the lock, and finally planting the compass. The key's redefinition (from object to consent) deepens the stake and shapes the climax. Setup, development, and closure all involve it. However, the friction between wanting the key and the cost of pursuit is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized; the narrator never doubts or weighs abandoning the search. Causal role clear, but emotional cost is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wistful rebellion is coherent throughout: the narrator's cadence is measured ("curiosity hungry but bridled"), the tone mixes longing (mentor's memory, erased place-names) with defiance (striking the compass, speaking place-names as proof), and the final image charges both (reverberation in bones, new maps by those who dare prudently). Tone modulates under pressure (organ swells, hands shake) without breaking voice. The final line ("change the shape of home") crystallizes the wistful-rebellion synthesis. Strong closure linkage and tonal control.</comment>
