<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's acoustic gift is concretely embodied ("hear a pin tremble inside a pocket") and becomes a burden under the hush, driving her choice to unbind the silence. The father's bonfire wisdom about unfinished beauty motivates her final stance, and micro-choices (lighting the tin-pan fire, pressing the bowl to the cistern) show agency under pressure. Interior contradiction appears when she laughs "without shame," suggesting prior shame now released. Minor slip: the caretaker Jory remains functional but flat, present only to witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara unbinds the hush strand by strand, the greenhouse fills with "ordinary noise," and she plans the next bonfire story, accepting magnificence as "simple and still unfinished." The cost is legible—she relinquishes the quest to restore the old world and embraces incompleteness. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory deprivation, the mendicant's bowl's recurring appearances, and the final cadence shift when sound returns. Orientation anchors quickly (Echo Harbor, post-fire, Mara's gift). One meaningful deepening occurs when resistance at the cistern forces her to change pitch and circle the knot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse—glass ribs, shipwrecks holding hands, trees in brackish pools—functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara's approach and charges the final image. The central cistern's stillness becomes the knot's anchor, and when it ripples, the space transforms. Sensory hierarchy (ash-stained palms, salt-dusted leaves, clicks like seeds trying to split) filters through Mara's acoustically perceptive POV. The post-fire hush saturates every detail, and the wrecks' circle suggests collective failure, grounding tone and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unbinding the chronic hush to find beauty in the unfinished world—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when Mara hears "resistance, like twine around her wrist" and must change pitch, a tactical choice driven by her agency. The cost is visible: she forgoes restoration ("not to restore the old world") and accepts incompleteness. The music hall's final night adds urgency. No antagonist needed; the hush itself applies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty hiding in unfinished things—emerges from the father's bonfire wisdom, Mara's half-formed orchard fruit, and the closure line "magnificence...can be simple and still unfinished." The mendicant's bowl shifts from asking for coins to unbinding silence, a reprise that reweights its function. Subtext operates in Jory's speechless greeting and Mara's private confessions to coals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: incompleteness becomes the new completeness, earned through on-page unbinding and acceptance without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Mara's acoustic perception ("private thunder only she can notice," "faintest tremors of sound"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("chronic hush," "ash-stained palms," "beauty hides"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at the cistern, then pulls back to the harbor walk. Jory's silence and Mara's plain-word storytelling carry distinct texture. No head-hopping or filter stacks. Syntax varies under pressure ("she changes pitch, circling the knot until it loosens").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: "boats glide in without creak, gulls open beaks without cry" compresses multiple sensory losses in one line. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("wet cloth," "whale's skeleton," "like twine around her wrist"). Minor slip: "shipwrecks...lodged in a circle as if they tried to flee together and sank holding hands" edges toward preciousness but stays legible. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("magnificence...can be simple and still unfinished") recharges the father's wisdom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The chronic-hush premise is fresh, and the synthesis of acoustic perception + mendicant's bowl + unbinding through storytelling feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The post-rainforest coastal setting avoids generic apocalypse tropes. Risk-taking (storytelling as magic, the hush as knottable vow) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity (Mara's laugh "without shame") anchors universals. The bonfire tradition transformed into tin-pan confessions offers a non-obvious angle on inheritance and ritual.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo-harbor violinist. Present from the opening, drives the middle choice (changes pitch at the cistern), and shapes closure (violin on shoulder, planning next story). Causal pressure: her acoustic gift makes the hush unbearable and enables her to hear the trapped clicks. Irreplaceable: no generic musician would work; her perceptive ears and violin technique are essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl. Appears in beat one (cloth bundle), beat two (taps rim, hush bends), beat three (pressed to cistern, unbinds strands), and closure (carries it back). Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure (the bowl's tone is the doorway), closure linkage (she carries it forward). Reweighted meaning: from asking for coins to unbinding silence. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chronic hush. Frames the opening ("new weather"), shapes every tactic (Mara must unbind it), and the closure turn (greenhouse fills with ordinary noise). Present in all beats. Highest causal pressure: without the hush, no conflict exists. Cost connection: unbinding requires her to relinquish the old world. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Acoustically perceptive. Early signal ("hear a pin tremble"), enables middle action (hears clicks in cistern), visible tradeoff (private thunder, burden). Constrains two beats. Cost: her gift isolates her. Could be slightly more active in the climax; the unbinding relies more on storytelling and the bowl than pure acoustic perception.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Unbind. Announced as goal ("unbind it"), enacted across three beats (bowl to rim, note to cistern, strand-by-strand loosening), and completes at closure (cistern ripples, noise returns). Causal spine: the entire middle and ending pivot on this action. High irreplaceability; no synonym ("release," "open") would preserve the father's vow-knot metaphor. Visible cost: she accepts incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire. Signaled early (father's wisdom), enacted in middle (lights tin-pan flame, tells coals her fears; Jory lights drum, she tells the girl-and-bowl story), and shapes the closure (plans next bonfire story). Two distinct beats. Causal role: the method enables unbinding ("she begins a story...plain words, steady breath, firelight in the mind"). Strong specificity; generic music alone wouldn't work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. Introduced ~40% mark but immediately active: central cistern anchors the knot, raised beds and brackish pools constrain approach, glass ribs supply atmosphere. Two beats (arrival, cistern work) plus closure participation (trees "newly allowed to be incomplete"). Moderate late penalty offset by strong causal role and closure charge. Irreplaceable: the greenhouse's in-between state (orchard + wreck + skeleton) embodies the unfinished-beauty theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>After the rainforest burns. Opens the story, sets chronic hush as consequence, and the music hall's final night adds urgency. Present in closure (post-fire world persists). Two gates (setup, closure). Moderate causal pressure: the timeframe motivates Mara's quest but does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat. Swappable with another ecological disaster without major edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To find beauty in the unfinished. Signaled early (father's wisdom), dramatized in middle choice (she decides "not to restore the old world, but to find beauty in the unfinished world"), and articulated at closure ("magnificence...can be simple and still unfinished"). Drives two beats. Visible cost: she relinquishes restoration. Strong specificity; the unfinished orchard fruit and half-bound strands embody it. Minor: could show more friction between desire and obstacle mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnificent simplicity. Coherent from opening ("chronic hush," plain diction) through middle (mendicant's bowl, plain-word storytelling) to closure ("magnificence...can be simple"). Modulates under pressure: intimate at cistern, expansive at the harbor walk. Charges the final image: simplicity elevates rather than diminishes. Distinct perceptual signature (ash, salt, clicks) avoids ornament. Strong tonal control without static mood.</comment>
