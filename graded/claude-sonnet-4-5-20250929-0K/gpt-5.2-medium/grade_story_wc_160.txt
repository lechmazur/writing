<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between factions is embodied through her trembling hands and the measured chain work, showing contradictory impulses (hope vs. professional duty) acting simultaneously. The father's chain carries biographical weight that shapes her values without therapy-speak. Rolen's confession and the shared measurement at closure earn the shift from rivals to collaborators. Minor slip: the council's demand for "loyalty to property" and keepers' "loyalty to water songs" edge toward thesis-speak but remain grounded in concrete gate settings.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (amphitheater, Mara, toolbox, mandate). Escalation operates causally: blank note → adhesive analysis → chain decoding → pulse-gate proposal → Rolen's confession → signed accord. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared measurement offers a "third language" that reconfigures the binary conflict, and Mara's trembling easing into "steady hands ready to build" signals visible cost (anxiety transformed into commitment). One meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded settings redefine the problem from sacred-vs-safe to hydraulic engineering with embedded kindness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater's warm vents enable the adhesive analysis (direct constraint on method) and the exhaled ash closes the accord scene with atmospheric charge. The antique chain's link spacing provides the decryption key, functioning as both tool and micro-setting. Spatial choreography remains clear across tiers and stone bench. Minor cap: while the volcano setting is vivid, it does not alter a protagonist choice as directly as the chain and vents do; most work is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize conflicting factions without betrayal—is signaled in paragraph three and sustained throughout. The pulse-gate discovery narrows options by offering a technical solution that honors both sides, and Mara's public explanation forces her to risk faction anger. Rolen's confession escalates by exposing the encrypted compassion, raising relational and political cost. The accord signing forecloses the rigid-seal path with visible cost: Mara's trembling and Rolen's shaking voice make the emotional and social price legible on the page. One clear tightening (decoded settings) drives the resolution under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—kindness encrypted in infrastructure, compassion as engineering—emerges through the chain's spacing, the pulse gate's dual function (silt scouring and wetland feeding), and Mara's line "kindness was already there, encrypted in every safety factor." The closure image (shared measurement as "third language," trembling easing into steady hands) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: technical and sacred are not opposed but interleaved. No overt moralizing; the stress-line drawings prove the theme through physical consequence. The story resists binary resolution by embedding moral complexity in hydraulic particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "river light flicker through reeds," translates dye marks to gate settings, and thinks in terms of "safety factor" and "hydraulic" logic. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Rolen's "voice shaking" distinguishes his urgency from Mara's measured resolve. Minor slip: "dappled resolve" in paragraph 18 reads slightly authorial rather than Mara's idiom, and the phrase "encrypted in every safety factor" in paragraph 20 borders on thesis articulation. Free indirect style remains clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances plot (blank note, adhesive slide, chain matching) or deepens character (father's teaching, Rolen's public slyness). Rhythm modulates well from exposition to discovery to confrontation. Two minor line-level issues: "ingenious floodgate machinist" (paragraph 2) front-loads a label without immediate dramatization, and "dappled resolve" (paragraph 18) is a stock phrase. The metaphor "building breathes" recurs but stays coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Propulsion is strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—political conflict resolved through cryptographic compassion via an antique surveyor's chain and adhesive forensics—is specific and non-obvious. The pulse-gate solution synthesizes hydraulic engineering with ritual timing in a way that feels earned rather than convenient. Emotional particulars (trembling hands, father's kindness encoded in numbers) avoid generic templates. The amphitheater's acoustic property ("every voice seemed less certain") and the volcano's exhalations charge the setting without postcard tour. The story commits fully to its technical and emotional logic. Risk-taking in the adhesive-analysis method and the chain-as-cipher elevates freshness within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara (ingenious floodgate machinist) drives key turns: she decodes the chain spacing (middle beat), explains the pulse gate to factions (climax), invites Rolen to co-build (closure). Her professional skill enables the solution and her choice to credit Rolen publicly alters the political outcome. Setup early (paragraph 2), development in analysis beats, payoff when she "unrolled drawings" and "offered him her chain." Causal pressure is strong; the story's logic depends on her engineering insight. Specificity: her "scalpel from her kit" and knowledge of "stress lines" anchor the role. Cost: public stance risks faction anger.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain appears in four beats: Mara lays it on the bench (paragraph 10), matches dye marks to links (decryption), recognizes her father's teaching (paragraph 11), and offers it to Rolen for shared measurement (closure). Each use reweights meaning: first tool, then key, then symbol of inherited values, finally invitation to collaboration. Setup (paragraph 10), development (matching and memory), payoff (closure gesture). Irreplaceable: the chain's link spacing is the cipher; no generic tool would work. Visible cost: accepting her father's values and sharing them publicly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion shapes the plot: Rolen hides the solution in adhesive dye to protect both factions (paragraph 12), and Mara decodes it as "a way to give her a solution without exposing the messenger" (same paragraph). The concept drives tactics (blank note, adhesive analysis) and charges the climax when Mara admits "kindness was already there, encrypted in every safety factor." Setup by paragraph 6 (blank note as prank vs. hidden truth), development in decryption beats, payoff in thematic articulation. Cost: Rolen's vulnerability when he confesses. Not merely thematic echo; it alters Mara's and Rolen's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rolen's "slyly heartfelt" trait is established in paragraph 13 ("public speeches were slyly heartfelt, always teasing the council while sneaking in concern") and demonstrated when he "pretended indifference" but "swallowed hard" (paragraph 14) and later confesses "voice shaking" (paragraph 22). The trait enables his encrypted message (sly delivery of heartfelt care) and constrains his public stance (he cannot openly propose without faction capture). Setup mid-story, development in his reaction to the chain, payoff in confession. Cost: his voice shaking signals vulnerability. Moderate causal pressure; trait is specific but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's trembling hands appear twice with reweighted meaning: first when she receives the blank note (paragraph 6, "not from fear, but from the hope that someone cared enough to hide the truth properly") and again at closure when "Mara's trembling eased into steady hands ready to build" (paragraph 23). The action signals internal conflict (hope vs. duty) and tracks emotional progression. Setup early, payoff at closure. The closure image depends on the trembling's resolution to show cost and commitment. Swappability test: another physical signal (breathing, posture) could convey anxiety, but trembling/steady hands pair elegantly with the machinist's craft.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The adhesive-analysis method is signaled in paragraph 7 (Mara uses a scalpel to lift adhesive), explained in paragraph 8 ("plant resins clung to paper fibers and carried dyes invisible until warmed"), executed in paragraph 9 (holding slide near vent reveals blue threads), and its result drives the plot in paragraph 10 (decoded message). Mechanics matter: the vent's warmth is necessary, and the dye pattern encodes gate settings. Setup, development (decryption), payoff (solution shapes accord). Irreplaceable: no other method is offered. Cost: public reliance on Rolen's hidden message exposes both to faction scrutiny.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting provides three functional beats: carved into volcano and crumbling (paragraph 1), acoustic property makes "every voice seemed less certain, more human" (paragraph 4), and warm vents enable adhesive analysis (paragraph 9). The exhaled ash at closure (paragraph 23) charges the accord signing. Setup immediate, development via vents (direct constraint on method), payoff in final image. The volcanic warmth is necessary for dye revelation. Minor cap: the acoustic claim is told rather than dramatized through dialogue; we don't hear voices softening on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the building breathes through warm vents" recurs in paragraphs 1, 9 ("amphitheater exhaled"), 17 ("amphitheater inhaled"), and 23 ("amphitheater exhaled again"). The breathing metaphor tracks debate pacing (swelling, hush, exhale at accord) and provides the heat for adhesive analysis. Setup early, development in pressure imagery, payoff at closure. The timeframe is more atmospheric than mechanical; it does not impose a ticking-clock constraint that forces a rushed choice. Swappability: the rhythm is vivid but a static "warm interior" could enable the same adhesive beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to harmonize conflicting values—is established in paragraph 3 ("harmonize conflicting values"), tested when factions demand opposing oaths (paragraph 17), and fulfilled when she explains the pulse gate and invites Rolen to co-build (paragraphs 18–23). The motivation drives her choice to decode rather than dismiss the blank note, and her public stance risks faction anger. Setup early, development across decryption and confrontation, payoff in accord and "third language" closure. Friction between want (technical solution) and cost (political exposure) is visible. Irreplaceable: the story's logic hinges on this mediator role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dappled resolve is named once (paragraph 18, "that dappled resolve she had learned from watching river light flicker through reeds: firm enough to hold, flexible enough to let life through") and demonstrated in Mara's measured public explanation and her invitation to Rolen. The tone is coherent: technical precision layered with emotional care, neither sentimental nor cold. The river-light image primes the tone in paragraph 4 (sound carrying differently) and charges the closure (steady hands, shared measurement). Setup via atmospheric anchors, payoff in stance crystallization. Minor cap: the single direct label in paragraph 18 edges toward thesis articulation rather than purely embodied delivery.</comment>
