<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her measuring of angles on catalog cards, the way she treats the scarf "like a bookmark for the air" embodies her mindset without therapy-speak. The final choice to guide patrons toward the hidden pocket with "small suggestions" feels earned by her isolation ("loneliness had been a kind of closed system waiting for exchange") and foreclosures a path from pure observation to active curation. Minor slip: the graduate student and old chemist remain purely atmospheric; their presence doesn't pressure Mara's choices. Internal contradiction is present but could deepen under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered scarf-memory → geometric measurement → hidden pocket discovery → guiding patrons, culminating in "Found the coordinate of listening; tomorrow I will catalog the way in." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's stance shifts from isolated observer to active curator with visible cost—she's committed to exposing the pocket, foreclosing her private solitude. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The hyperbolic-geometry mechanic is signaled early and pays off at the bookcase moment. One meaningful deepening through the scarf's reawakening and patron guidance is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's nested reading rooms and hyperbolic geometry constrain Mara's search and supply the mechanic for discovery—she must measure angles and rotate her hand "as her diagram required" to open the pocket. The scarf as micro-setting object charges the closure: it's wrapped back "not as a relic but as a key." Sensory detail (river water, coal smoke, grain shifting "like a living proof") is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities. Spatial choreography of the narrow gap behind the non-Euclidean elegies section is coherent. The scientific poetry library's specificity (equations shelved beside odes, "Thermodynamics of Yearning") is purposeful and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled in paragraph six and tightens through Mara's geometric plotting, the bookcase discovery, and her guiding the young patron to the bent aisle. Agency is clear: Mara's measurements and hand rotation unlock the pocket, and her choice to guide patrons is a renunciation of private hoarding with felt cost ("her own loneliness had been a kind of closed system"). The patron's dream feedback provides a visible consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through increasing density (scarf → measurement → discovery → guidance). One on-page reversal (from suspicion to confirmation via the opened bookcase) and one deepening (from discovery to sharing) are sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as material with location, stories as relations rather than objects—emerges organically from the scarf's analog scent, the hyperbolic-geometry architecture, and Mara's realization that "stories were not written objects but relations, stitched between readers and paper in curving space." The closing logbook line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "Found the coordinate of listening" reweights the premise through a fresh metaphor that synthesizes scientific precision with human connection. Subtext operates in the image of the scarf as key and the girl's dream as proof of stories living beyond the page. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion. The premise (analog memories stored in hyperbolic space) is specific and integrates fully with Mara's arc from isolation to exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara hears books' pulses, treats the scarf "like a bookmark for the air," sees shelves "curve away, as if the stacks were the rim of a deeper bowl." Diction remains character-consistent ("sanely eccentric precision," "theorist's patience") and purposefully lyric without register drift. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally—close during the scarf-contact moment, pulling back slightly for the patron-guidance beats. The prose texture (nested clauses, appositive rhythm) reflects Mara's methodical, poetic mindset. Minor density: some lines ("its reading rooms nested like Russian dolls, its staircases bending in ways a carpenter would deny") edge toward decorative but remain voice-motivated and serve the hyperbolic-geometry premise. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift from participial ("At three," "Between questions") to prepositional to declarative without template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She had found it in the returns bin years ago, knotted around a microfilm reel" anchors backstory, object, and time). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity is strong except for one moment: "shifted under her skin like a living proof" leans toward mixed metaphor (grain as proof blurs vehicle). Minor overwriting in cumulative beats: "river water and coal smoke, the way analog memories arrive without asking" stacks metaphor without pattern-teaching, though it remains legible. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Proofreading is clean; no tense slips or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as literal architecture for memory storage is specific and non-obvious; the scientific poetry library housing both equations and odes is a fresh frame. The piece transforms the "hidden room in a library" trope through Mara's geometric method and the analog-memory mechanic, making discovery earned rather than convenient. Emotional specificity in Mara's loneliness as "a kind of closed system waiting for exchange" avoids generic templates. The logbook closing ("Found the coordinate of listening; tomorrow I will catalog the way in") is particular to her voice and role. Risk-taking in the sustained lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight dock: the "stories as relations stitched in curving space" realization, while apt, edges toward abstraction in a single line without full dramatization of its tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as odd-hour librarian is signaled early (paragraph one) and drives multiple beats: she measures angles "with a librarian's ruler," slips behind the stacks during "observed solitude," guides the young patron with "small suggestions," and writes in the logbook at closing. Her occupational knowledge (catalog cards, reference desk, logbook) enables the geometric plotting and patron curation that structure the story. The final logbook entry ("Found the coordinate of listening; tomorrow I will catalog the way in") is both职业行为 and thematic synthesis, charging the closure. Removing "librarian" would collapse the setting access, measurement tools, and curatorial arc. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement across setup, middle discovery, and ending commitment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The scarf appears in four distinct beats: introduced on Mara's desk (paragraph four), lifted with scent-memory (paragraph five), reawakened during pocket contact (paragraph fourteen), and wrapped back as key in the drawer (paragraph eighteen). It enables the discovery (the scarf "tightened gently, reawakened by the contact, pulling her thoughts backward and forward") and is explicitly repositioned at closure from relic to key, charging the final image. The scarf's color shift ("once crimson, now the color of dried rose") and knotted origin (microfilm reel) are specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure: without the scarf's analog-memory trigger, Mara's hypothesis and the pocket's discovery lack a tangible anchor. Cost connection: treating it as key commits her to future exposure of the hidden space.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Analog memories shape the story's mechanics and stakes: the scarf's river-and-coal smell convinces Mara "that memory was not a file but a material" (paragraph six), prompting her geometric search. The hidden pocket "smelled…as if time had been stored without electricity" (paragraph fourteen), and each patron detour yields "a new analog memory, a thumbprint in dust, a faint scratch of fountain pen" (paragraph eighteen). The concept changes Mara's tactics from passive wondering to active measurement and patron guidance. It appears in setup (scarf scent), middle (hypothesis and search), and closure (the logbook's "coordinate of listening" synthesizes analog persistence with human connection). Slight dock: the concept is more thematic fulcrum than on-page constraint—Mara's choices aren't visibly constrained by analog limits; they're enabled by the idea.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is introduced in paragraph two ("sanely eccentric precision") and embodied through Mara's measuring angles on catalog cards (paragraph nine), pressing her palm and rotating per diagram (paragraph twelve), and guiding patrons with oblique suggestions (paragraph seventeen). The trait enables her willingness to pursue an unlikely geometric hypothesis and her comfort operating alone during odd hours. Moderate causal role: the trait colors her method but doesn't visibly trade off against another option with cost—she never faces a choice between eccentric pursuit and conformist safety. Present across beats but not indispensable; "methodical" or "obsessive" could substitute with minor edits. Constraint test: not fully met; the trait describes her approach more than it limits it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the fulcrum action: the scarf "tightened gently, reawakened by the contact" (paragraph fifteen) when Mara reaches into the pocket, enabling her realization that "stories were not written objects but relations." This moment shifts her from discovery to understanding and sets up the patron-guidance beats that follow. The verb recurs in paragraph eighteen's retrospective summary ("each time…the pocket answered with a new analog memory") and underwrites the closing repositioning of the scarf as key. Causal pressure: without the reawakening, Mara's tactile contact remains inert; the scarf's response bridges her geometric method and the relational insight. Strong beat involvement (middle climax, closure shaping) and specificity (the verb's animacy is irreplaceable for the analog-memory premise). Slight dock: the action is metaphorical contact rather than a discrete physical move, which softens immediate swappability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled in paragraph eight ("Mara began to suspect the architects had used hyperbolic geometry…to hide an extra distance inside ordinary corridors") and its mechanics matter: she measures angles (paragraph nine), follows a computed line (paragraph eleven), and rotates her hand "as her diagram required" (paragraph twelve) to open the bookcase. The method shapes her attempts—without the geometric framework, the discovery is coincidence. It returns at closure in the logbook line ("Found the coordinate"), synthesizing math and listening. Strong setup and middle development; moderate closure linkage (present conceptually but not tactically in the final image). Constraint: the method dictates her search path and the bookcase's opening mechanism. Slight dock: the hyperbolic specifics (what makes it hyperbolic vs. Euclidean) remain asserted rather than demonstrated on the page, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is essential across all beats: it supplies the nested rooms and bent staircases (paragraph seven) that house the hyperbolic geometry, the catalog cards and ruler (paragraph nine) Mara uses to measure, the reference desk (paragraph ten) she works between, the non-Euclidean elegies section (paragraph eleven) behind which the gap hides, and the aisle where geometry "gently bent" (paragraph seventeen) to guide the young patron. The setting's specific hybridity (equations beside odes, "Thermodynamics of Yearning") is irreplaceable—only this fusion justifies both Mara's poetic sensibility and her geometric method. Pressure and resource: the architecture constrains access (narrow gap, impossible angle) and enables discovery (the bookcase's rotational mechanism). Closure charge: the logbook is a librarian's tool that synthesizes her professional and thematic stakes. Removing this exact setting collapses causality, tone, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is introduced in paragraph three and recurs in paragraph ten ("the patrons did not notice"), paragraph sixteen ("patrons still browsing"), and paragraph nineteen ("as the last browsers drifted out"). It provides a live constraint—Mara must wait "until the room settled into its usual observed solitude" (paragraph eleven) before approaching the bookcase, and she operates "between questions at the reference desk" (paragraph nine). The closing's "near closing" anchors the final logbook beat. Moderate pressure: the patron presence delays but doesn't fundamentally tighten her choices; she simply waits. The clock is tracked but permissive. Present across setup, middle, and closure with modest causal impact. Specificity: "while patrons browse" (vs. "after hours") matters because Mara's curation later involves guiding live patrons, creating thematic symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find where stories live is dramatized in paragraph six ("she started to suspect…and she started measuring angles"), drives the geometric search (paragraphs eight–twelve), and transforms at closure into active curation: "she began guiding people toward it" (paragraph sixteen) and commits in the logbook to "catalog the way in" (paragraph nineteen). Friction and cost: her loneliness as "a kind of closed system waiting for exchange" (paragraph eighteen) is the price of private hoarding, and sharing the pocket forecloses solitary possession. The desire shifts from finding to opening access, altering her role and foreclosing the reclusive stance. Strong causal pressure across beats, closure linkage (the logbook commits her to tomorrow's work), and visible trade-off. The want (to locate stories' residence) conflicts with her prior isolation, creating earned tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is introduced in paragraph three and sustained through "her lone corner" (paragraph two), the patrons' lives "continuing like low tide" (paragraph ten), Mara's solo measurement (paragraph nine), and her waiting "until the room settled into its usual observed solitude" (paragraph eleven). The tone modulates under pressure: solitude intensifies during the bookcase discovery (paragraphs twelve–fifteen, no other characters mentioned) and shifts at closure when Mara's solitude becomes relational exchange (paragraph eighteen: "waiting for exchange") and communal curation (guiding the young patron, paragraph seventeen). The final tone—solitary work now charged with connection—reconfigures the opening's isolation without breaking coherence. The tone charges the logbook image: "Found the coordinate of listening" synthesizes aloneness with openness. Strong coherence, purposeful modulation, and closure charge.</comment>
