<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amina's philanthropist identity and her coincidence-orchestration trait are signaled early, but the interior texture remains abstract—we're told she "listened for the right hush" rather than shown the micro-choice mechanics that govern her gift-giving. The cave choice (ignoring the "sensible plan") reads as impulse without visible internal contradiction or foreclosed cost until retrospective framing. Toma's shift from suspicious to curious happens via "simple gift" rather than earned pressure, and the ending pivot to "gathering stranded villagers" introduces agency off-page that the prior beats did not dramatize.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by paragraph three. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: the "whispering hush" accumulates pressure through the day's gifts, the cave detour, and the volcanic tremor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Amina "finally felt the texture she sought: change was hot, granular, and shared." Cost is conceptual and relational (shared survival with Toma, release of the lightning bugs), but the final beat—"gathering stranded villagers"—arrives as summary rather than on-page action, softening closure's felt impact. The prophecy frame remains decorative; it does not constrain tactics or narrow options in the cave sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The black sand, lava tube, and mineral-threaded walls anchor the scene vividly and pressure Amina's cave entry through heat and tremor. The lightning bugs function as micro-setting: their spiral "mimicked the moons above" and their flight choices guide the escape, satisfying the constraint test. Spatial choreography (tideline → lava tube → crack exit) remains clear. The volcano's transformation metaphor (stone to sand, air to ash) charges the final realization, though the "stranded villagers" at the end lack concrete spatial placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early. The detour into the cave and the choice to uncork the jars constitute on-page agency, and the tremor raises immediate physical pressure. However, escalation remains narrow: the "safe crack" reveal happens via convenience (lifted lantern) rather than through a trade-off rooted in prior choices, and the insects' path-choosing feels coincidental rather than costly. The ending shift to "gathering stranded villagers" introduces a new action layer without demonstrating how the cave experience forecloses prior options or imposes visible cost on Amina's methods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The transformation question emerges organically from Amina's gift-giving pattern and the volcano metaphor (remake without apology). The lightning bugs shift from possession to release, charging the theme without overt statement. "Change was hot, granular, and shared" delivers a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in the cave experience. Minor slip: the prophecy frame ("captive stars who would turn hunger into giving") reads as thematic echo rather than dramatized irony, and the final line's "every coincidence became a way to give" restates the premise rather than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "orchestrates coincidences the way other people arrange flowers, by listening for the right hush" establishes a distinct perceptual signature. Toma's single line of dialogue ("the elders would call this omen proof") carries goal and subtext without clutter. Minor register drift: "turn hunger into giving and giving into heat" in the prophecy paragraph elevates into abstract phrasing that feels authorial rather than Amina's lived thought. Under peak stress (tremor, ash), sentence rhythm tightens appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the figurative language (e.g., "fine ash sifted from the ceiling like gray pollen") remains legible. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops in paragraphs 5–6 ("She left each of them something she could not afford" immediately followed by "each time her empty pockets grew lighter, fate grew heavier") and template-cadence runs in the prophecy paragraph ("had read," "had meant," "had not come," "had brought"). The final beat summary ("they began gathering stranded villagers") replaces scene with scaffold, dulling closure momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The coincidence-orchestration premise paired with "listening for the right hush" offers a fresh synthesis, and the lightning bugs as borrowed light provide specific texture. The prophecy frame, however, reads as familiar mystic-woman trope without transformation, and the cave escape's insect-guided path echoes familiar animal-guide motifs. The final pivot to "gathering stranded villagers" introduces a new action off-page rather than deepening the established pattern. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic day → night compression) remains legible but does not heighten stakes beyond the cave beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amina's philanthropist identity frames the opening and drives the day's gift-giving, the cave detour, and the jar-uncorking choice. Her decisions (giving away what she cannot afford, entering the cave, releasing the bugs) create key turns. However, the final beat—"gathering stranded villagers"—is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening closure participation. Present in setup, middle development (cave), and ending summary; causal pressure in two beats; cost tied to released possession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lightning bugs appear early (paragraph 11), are handled and uncorked in the cave (paragraph 23), guide the escape spiral (paragraph 24), and stream ahead to choose safe turns (paragraph 28). Their symbolic shift from possession to release charges the transformation theme. Three distinct beats with causal involvement; closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high (no other object could guide the path). Cost connection: Amina relinquishes her "most delicate possession."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "whispering hush" is signaled early (paragraph 7) and recurs as a guiding sensation throughout the day and in the cave ("not louder but closer"). It shapes Amina's gift-giving tactics and her cave entry, but its mechanics remain abstract—"listening" without on-page micro-choices that demonstrate how the hush narrows options. Closure participation: the final paragraph mentions "vibrant hush" as ambient atmosphere rather than active constraint. Setup and middle present; payoff ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amina's coincidence-orchestration trait is labeled early (paragraph 6) and claimed to guide her steps (paragraph 8), but the on-page demonstrations remain vague: "she orchestrated coincidences with a breath" by asking Toma to lift the lantern. The resulting "safe crack" reveal reads as convenience rather than visible trade-off. Setup strong; middle beat present but passive; closure cost unclear. Functional but swappable with "intuition" or "luck" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The detour into the lava tube (paragraph 19) triggers the cave sequence, the tremor, and the escape. It redefines options by placing Amina and Toma in physical danger and forcing the jar-uncorking choice. However, the "impulse for detour" arrives without prior friction or visible cost that would make refusal a live alternative. Setup (paragraph 19), middle development (cave pressure), payoff (escape). Two beats; causal role solid; cost connection indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The prophecy frame is introduced in paragraph 16 ("woman with captive stars") and mentioned again at the end ("as if the prophecy had grown wings"), but its mechanics remain decorative. Amina "kept fulfilling prophecies accidentally," yet the cave events (tremor, escape) do not demonstrate how accident differs from intention or impose cost tied to this trait. Setup present; no middle development; payoff ornamental. Swappable with "fate" without affecting turns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black sand beach and volcano frame the entire piece, anchor orientation, and drive Amina's transformation question (paragraph 15). The lava tube provides immediate constraint (darkness, tremor, ash), and the exposed "path of warm stones" triggers the detour. The volcano's eruption at the end (lava meeting sea) charges the final image with physical cost and metaphor. Setup early, middle constraint active, payoff strong. Environment alters tactics and resonates thematically; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The celestial alignment ("two moons and a bright planet") is signaled in paragraph 2 and reprised at the climax ("The two moons slid apart, the planet winked"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—no countdown pressure, no missed window. The alignment functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than live clock. Setup present, middle absent, payoff ornamental. Time remains vague ("all day," "now," "just as") without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Amina's question—"what is the texture of transformation"—is stated in paragraph 10 and dramatized through the cave experience: "she finally felt the texture she sought: change was hot, granular, and shared" (paragraph 32). The motivation drives the beach visit and the jar-uncorking choice. However, the desire remains abstract rather than conflicted; no competing want (e.g., safety, control) creates friction. Setup strong, middle present, payoff solid. Cost tied to risk and release.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The phrase "vibrant hush" appears in the final paragraph and echoes the "whispering hush" that recurs throughout. Tone modulates subtly—gift-giving calm, cave tension, post-escape relief—without jarring breaks. However, the tonal palette remains narrow; high-pressure beats (tremor, ash) do not sharpen into urgency distinct from the opening dusk. Coherent but static; final image reprises rather than reweights. Setup implicit, middle steady, payoff present but not charged.</comment>
