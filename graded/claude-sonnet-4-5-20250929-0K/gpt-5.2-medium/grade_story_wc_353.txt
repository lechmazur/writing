<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa's interior is consistently embodied through her tactile listening and hand-based perception; her motivation to create music in silence drives each choice without therapy-speak. The "symphonically minded" trait constrains her method throughout—reading cracks as intervals, conducting without sound. Internal contradiction surfaces in "wondering what messages the past tried to send" versus her present-focused practice, and the final choice to leave the insulator hanging is earned by accumulated tactile experience. Minor: the hedgehog framing device adds symbolic weight but doesn't pressure her choices directly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Lysa plans to carry this silence-music to neighbors, crystallizing her role as mediator between bodies that cannot sing, and the final image (insulator hanging "like a pale moon") reweights the grove's hum with conceptual cost (her ongoing solitude as quiet maker). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece deepens through layered wire-stringing beats and the discovery that "cracks were never damage alone," a meaningful tightening that reconfigures her method. One substantive escalation suffices at this length; cost is felt in her acceptance of persistent silence and the responsibility she carries forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grove, monument, and porcelain insulator form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: sap-rise changes tension, the monument's cracks map her score, roots carry vibrations. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cool and dense" porcelain, quivering wire, moss-buried stone—filtered through her tactile attention. The insulator functions as both tool and spatial anchor, charging the final image when left hanging. Spatial choreography (wire between alders, block pressed to insulator) remains clear across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: making connection audible in a mute world. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lysa presses the carved block to the insulator and the grove "seems to sway"—a turn from failed sound to successful tactile transmission. Agency is renunciation (accepting silence) and endurance (continuing to read cracks), with visible cost in her solitary labor and the neighbors who "avoid looking at one another." The plan to carry this method to the settlement narrows options (she commits to mediation) and forecloses retreat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through incremental wire-stringing and the siskins' participation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as embodied transmission rather than speech—emerges from wire-work, crack-reading, and the insulator bridge without thesis statements. The porcelain insulator recurs with reweighted meaning: telegraph relic → offering → bridge → pale moon, each use deepening its role as mediator. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "quiet maker of meetings between bodies that cannot yet sing" synthesizes her refusal of audible music with the promise of tactile connection. The Grove-as-chorus and cracks-as-score motifs charge the final image without overt symbolism. Minor: "nobody is unheard if someone keeps moving toward them" borders on articulated moral but stays grounded in the wire's physical reach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is tactile and patient: "listen with her hands," "hovering palms," "faintest sensation of moving warmth." Diction fits her symphonic frame—"intervals," "score," "conducting"—without register drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: long, careful clauses during wire-work compress slightly at the hedgehog return. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The porcelain's coolness and the wire's quiver are embodied through her touch, not asserted. One minor slip: "though the grove remains intensely quiet" edges toward narrative summary where sensory absence could carry the point.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance tactile discovery or wire mechanics. Two frictions: (1) the opening sentence runs long with nested clauses ("symphonically minded since childhood, yet she has never heard an orchestra, only the hush…"), slightly dulling momentum, and (2) "intensely quiet" in the penultimate paragraph repeats the tone descriptor from midpoint without added pressure. No paraphrase loops, no template cadence. Figurative language ("like a pale moon," "like a held breath") remains coherent and sparse. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong; the line-level slips do not touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—tactile music through telegraph insulators and tree-stress cracks in a post-sound world—feels specific and non-obvious. The Great Muffle avoids generic apocalypse by focusing on sensory absence rather than destruction. Lysa's method (reading frost-pressure as intervals, threading insulators as bridges) transforms familiar tropes (artist in silent world) through verifiable craft detail. The ending's "quiet maker of meetings" avoids sentimentality by grounding connection in physical vibration. Risk: the story commits fully to silence as constraint without retreat. Minor: the hedgehog frame adds lyric polish but doesn't alter the core premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa shapes three beats: deciding the widest crack is "a low opening note," carving the alder block to match crack-patterns, and leaving the insulator to let the grove keep humming. Each choice narrows options (she commits to tactile method, then to sharing it). Present throughout; drives escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator is set as offering (beat 1), threaded as bridge (beat 2), pressed with carved block to carry tremor (beat 3), and left hanging "like a pale moon" at closure. Each use is distinct and causal: it enables the vibration-to-stone transmission that redefines her method. Irreplaceable—its "cool and dense" ceramic properties matter. Charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" appears as label ("she must practice empathy in motion, walking the wire's length") and shapes one tactic (hovering palms to feel tension changes). The concept is present and motivates her method, but the phrasing edges toward thematic echo. It recurs implicitly in the plan to let neighbors "rest fingertips" and "learn the weight of another life," which reweights the stake. Would score higher if "empathy" were enacted without the label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" constrains every on-page action: she reads cracks as intervals, arranges strains into sequences, "conducts without sound." Present from the opening and mentioned again at the midpoint epiphany ("her symphonically minded heart arranges them"). The trait is not merely label—it dictates her perceptual filter and her method of carving/stringing. Cost: she cannot access actual orchestration, only tactile analogs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Strum" appears once, explicitly: "To strum it would be easy, but to make it mean something she must practice empathy in motion…" It triggers the shift from potential sound to tactile transmission and constrains her method (she plucks after walking the wire's length). The action is signaled, gates a key choice, and the "pluck" beat delivers the first successful tremor. Would be indispensable if repeated; here it's essential but singular.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By analyzing stress cracks" frames her method from the title beat onward: "she traces hairline maps where frost and root-pressure have argued for decades, and she reads them as intervals." The analysis dictates every subsequent move—lashing wire to match the widest crack's arc, carving the block's cavity to match crack-patterns. Present early, causal across three beats, and the epiphany ("cracks were never damage alone, but records of pressure endured") reweights her entire project. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove supplies materials (alder that bends, siskins as moving rests), constrains her method (sap-rise changes wire tension, roots carry vibrations), and charges the closure (left to "keep humming through touch"). The monument within the grove provides the crack-map she reads. Present throughout, micro-setting that alters tactics. Would reach higher if a live environmental pressure (weather, decay) forced a timed choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" opens and closes the piece, framing a single day's work. It marks duration but does not tighten decisions—Lysa has all day, and no clock pressure forces choices. The hedgehog's return signals twilight, but this is scenic closure rather than a tactical constraint. Functional as lyric bracket; does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To create music in a silent world" is dramatized through each wire-stringing, pluck, and carved block. Friction surfaces when she "wonders what messages the past tried to send" versus her present focus, and the cost is visible: she can never produce audible music, only tactile analogs. The final plan to carry this method to neighbors demonstrates persistence with cost (ongoing isolation as "quiet maker"). Present throughout, drives all choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is established in the opening ("footsteps feel too loud in a world that has forgotten how to answer") and sustained through "no sound comes back," "grove remains intensely quiet," and the ending's "portable silence-music." Tone modulates under pressure—the wire "quivers like a held breath," the siskins hop in silence—and charges the final image: insulator hanging while "the grove can keep humming through touch." Coherent, purpose-driven, integral to closure effect.</comment>
