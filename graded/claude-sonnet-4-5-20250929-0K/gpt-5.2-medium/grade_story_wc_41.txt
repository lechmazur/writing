<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is consistently filtered through her recording project and mother's decline, yielding specific sensory choices (the rasp in her throat, chalk hand trembling). Orrin's precognitive forgetfulness operates as a trait that constrains action—he must arrange markers and rely on external clues—but his moments of sudden memory feel more atmospheric than psychologically contradictory. The final choice to add her mother's name is motivated by accumulating longing, though the gesture reads more thematic than agonized. Minor deduction for Orrin's inner life remaining opaque; he functions as catalyst rather than co-protagonist with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The fog garden, videotapes, driftwood markers, and capsule archive build density toward the final image of Mira adding her mother's name and copying recordings onto sleeping tapes—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where longing crystallizes into preservation with felt cost (the intimacy of aging amplified, the act of listening rather than letting hush win). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (Mira, low tide, fog sculpture garden, field recorder, chalk). The closure reweights the premise of "clinging to echoes" through the layered archive voices, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—Mira's specific forfeiture is understated. One meaningful deepening occurs when Orrin whispers her own rasp, tightening the personal stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden supplies vivid, purposeful details: metal arches breathing sea air, broken figureheads and glass whales rising from gravel, the fog bell's stone spiral, and the shed stacked with salt-furred videotapes. The chalk marks on stones and driftwood arrows constrain the search, shaping Mira's path through the garden. The recurring videotapes and their "magnetic hush" charge the final image when silence is turned into future echo. Spatial choreography is clear (shed → sculptures → fog bell → shed return), and the tidal clock subtly pressures the driftwood map before fog rearranges everything. Micro-setting (chalk, recorder, videotapes) functions as both tool and atmospheric anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: capturing the sound of aging before her mother stops speaking. Pressure coheres through the search (driftwood map, Orrin's slipping memory) and tightens when Orrin whispers Mira's own rasp, making the project intimate and urgent. The discovery of the capsule archive and decision to add her mother's name constitute a meaningful deepening—Mira shifts from solitary recording to contributing to a communal archive, accepting that preservation requires sharing rather than hoarding. The cost is felt (trembling chalk hand, "tidal longing") but remains oblique; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Escalation is driven by accumulation and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation against forgetting, the intimacy of aging, and the archive as communal act—emerges organically from the driftwood markers, videotapes, and layered voices without didactic statement. The final image of copying recordings onto "sleeping videotapes, turning unwatched silence into a future echo that neither of them could quite remember, but both could feel" reweights the premise with quiet resonance. Orrin's precognitive forgetfulness and Mira's mother's impending silence interlock to charge the act of listening over erasure. The rasp Orrin channels becomes a non-literal answer to the question "what does aging sound like?" Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on atmospheric phrasing ("hush," "fog," "echo") that occasionally substitutes texture for sharper conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the rasp moment, wider during the search). Perceptual signature is specific: Mira notices the "wet halo" on statues, imagines her recorder filling with blank tape, hears gulls "soundlessly in her mind." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated phrasing ("tidal longing," "magnetic hush thick as fog") flirts with purple without crossing into opacity. Orrin's dialogue ("precognitively forgetful," "the garden hid a microphone that could hear time") carries fairy-tale register that fits the speculative frame. Minor deduction for a few filter-verb clusters ("she would answer," "she imagined," "she heard") that slightly dull immediacy in mid-passage beats, though the final image remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("cases furred with salt and dust," "pale branch like an arrow that pointed not north but toward a feeling"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "hush of the unwatched videotapes seemed to leak into the air" recurs in varied forms; "echo" and "hush" and "fog" are invoked repeatedly without always adding new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("After every marker he paused, frowned, and asked…") and stacked filter verbs ("she imagined," "she would answer," "she heard") reduce propulsion. The closure image is clean and evocative, but mid-passage scaffold costs ~0.8. No single artifact obscures causality, so penalty remains in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of precognitive forgetfulness, fog sculpture garden on a landfill of art and shipwrecks, and a microphone archive for aging is specific and non-obvious. The driftwood navigation and videotapes-as-echo-container feel fresh. Emotional truth—Mira's fear of her mother's silence, the intimacy of aging amplified—grounds the speculative premise. The final image (copying onto sleeping videotapes) synthesizes the elements into a resonant whole. Minor deduction for the "Junkyard Prophet" sign and license-plate coat, which risk quirky ornament, and for the fog-as-metaphor reliance that occasionally substitutes atmosphere for sharper turn. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative logic and follows through without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orrin is present throughout, guiding Mira with driftwood markers and offering cryptic warnings. His choices—arranging driftwood, pausing to ask what they're doing, whispering the rasp, tracing the final arrow—create key turns in the search. His precognitive forgetfulness constrains the navigation (Mira must draw chalk circles to anchor him) and enables the emotional peak (he channels her rasp). He appears early, shapes middle beats, and is present at closure when he "smiled, relieved to have located his own purpose in her hands." His decision to build the archive drives the premise. Scores mid-6s for strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though his interiority remains opaque and his role partly catalytic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chalk appears in the opening ("She carried a field recorder and a piece of plain chalk") and is used functionally in the middle: "she would answer patiently, drawing a small circle with the chalk on the nearest stone to anchor his slipping foresight to the present." It returns with emotional charge at the rasp moment ("her chalk hand trembled at how intimate aging sounded when amplified"). Three beats (setup, anchoring circles, trembling hand) with causal and emotional work. The chalk enables the search by stabilizing Orrin's memory and embodies Mira's care. However, it does not appear in or directly shape the final image (capsule, recording, videotapes dominate closure). Scores mid-5s for functional middle use and emotional reprise, but lacks closure participation to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Clinging to echoes" is named early ("she confessed she had begun clinging to echoes because she feared her mother would soon stop speaking") and structures the entire quest: Mira seeks to capture aging's sound before it vanishes, the archive preserves voices "kept alive by the simple act of listening rather than letting the hush win," and the final image turns "unwatched silence into a future echo." The concept shapes tactics (recording, searching for the hidden microphone, adding her mother's name) and charges closure when layered voices resist erasure. It operates as both stake and thematic spine. Scores low-7s for strong causal and closure linkage, though the phrase itself is somewhat abstract and the piece occasionally tells the concept rather than purely dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Precognitively forgetful" is introduced early ("cursed to glimpse tomorrow and then misplace it like a dropped bolt") and constrains every beat: Orrin must leave clues, arrange driftwood markers, and repeatedly ask what they're doing. The trait enables the rasp moment (future coughs through him) and necessitates Mira's chalk circles. It drives the archive's purpose ("building an archive for the day he would forget himself entirely") and charges the ending when he locates "his own purpose in her hands." Visible trade-offs: his memory slips force external aids, and the forgetting creates urgency. The trait is specific, irreplaceable, and integral to plot and theme. Scores mid-7s for strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Locate" structures the entire narrative: Mira seeks the hidden microphone, follows the driftwood map, and discovers the capsule beneath the fog bell. Each beat (arranging markers, reaching the rebar woman, finding the spiral) is a locating action. The search redefines options when Mira shifts from solo recording to contributing to the communal archive. The verb is irreplaceable—without the search, no discovery, no archive contribution, no closure. Early signal, three+ beats, causal pressure, closure linkage (she locates the capsule, adds her mother's name, and will copy recordings). Scores high-7s for indispensable causal role across the arc, though the final action (copying) slightly exceeds pure locating.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Driftwood markers are introduced early ("Orrin began arranging driftwood as directional markers, laying each pale branch like an arrow that pointed not north but toward a feeling") and used throughout the middle: markers guide Mira through the garden, and each requires a chalk circle to stabilize Orrin's memory. The method shapes attempts and tactics (she must follow the arrows, pause at each marker) and constrains the search under the tidal/fog deadline. The final driftwood arrow points back to the shed, enabling closure. Three beats, clear mechanics, causal pressure. Scores mid-6s for strong functional integration and closure linkage, though the method could theoretically be swapped for another navigational aid (map, breadcrumbs) with moderate rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden anchors every beat: metal arches breathing sea air, figureheads and glass whales rising from gravel, the fog bell, the shed with videotapes. The setting pressures choices (tide threatens to rearrange the fog and driftwood paths) and supplies resources (the hidden capsule, the archive). The landfill-of-art-and-shipwrecks detail roots the world logic. Spatial choreography is clear and micro-setting (chalk marks, videotapes, driftwood) constrains tactics. The garden charges the final image when Mira copies recordings onto the sleeping tapes in the shed. Scores mid-7s for strong causal and atmospheric integration across setup, beats, and closure, though the setting could be replaced with another liminal, artifact-rich space with moderate rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched" functions more as atmosphere than a tight timeframe. The videotapes appear in the shed early, their "magnetic hush" recurs as motif, and they become the repository at closure. However, no urgent clock tied to the tapes pressures Mira's choices—the tidal deadline and fog rearrangement supply temporal pressure, not the tapes themselves. The "hush" reweights silence thematically but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. The element is present and thematically resonant but functionally replaceable as a time constraint. Scores low-4s for atmospheric integration and closure participation without causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to capture the sound of growing older before it vanished into quiet" is named early and drives every choice: carrying the recorder, seeking the hidden microphone, following the map, pressing record when Orrin whispers her rasp, and adding her mother's name to the archive. The desire is dramatized through action (recording, marking stones, trembling) and charged with conflict (fear her mother will stop speaking, imagining the recorder filling with blank tape). Friction between want (preserve her mother's voice) and cost (intimacy of aging amplified, longing exposed) is visible. The motivation shapes closure when preservation becomes communal act. Scores high-7s for strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tidal longing" is named late ("Mira, in tidal longing, spoke her mother's name") but the tone saturates the piece: the tide's rhythm, the fog's advance and retreat, the hush and echo, the accumulation of voices. Tone modulates with pressure (calm search, trembling rasp moment, quiet final image) and charges closure when Mira's act of recording becomes a gesture of preservation against erasure. The phrase itself appears only once, but the tidal cadence—ebb and flow, approach and withdrawal—structures the narrative rhythm and emotional arc. Scores low-7s for coherent atmospheric charge and closure linkage, though the single late naming and slightly abstract phrasing prevent higher bands.</comment>
