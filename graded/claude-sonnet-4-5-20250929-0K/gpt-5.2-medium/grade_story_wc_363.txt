<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara's motivation to reach Jun is consistently embodied through physical acts (weaving, pressing the amber bead), and her micro-choices—leaving the loom still for three winters, then recommencing—register internal conflict. The final sacrifice (her voice) is causally earned and forecloses speech with visible cost. Minor deduction: Jun's interiority in the penultimate paragraph ("a man had forgotten how to hope") briefly violates single-POV distance, and Yara's contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) are primarily told rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence accreting, then released through the weaving act). Orientation anchors appear by line three (Yara, hut, orchard). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Yara pays her voice and teaches Jun the loom, forecloses further speech, cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening: the puzzle edges unlock direction, then the finished panel travels. Deduction: the mechanism by which the woven panel physically appears on Jun's cot and compels his return remains under-motivated; the cost (voice) is clear, but the causal chain from weave-to-arrival elides key steps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo culms, and loom constrain Yara's space and choices (she cannot leave, must weave within the puzzle-edge frame). The puzzle edges function as micro-setting: they map the coast and fence the loom, shaping tactics. Sensory details (mulberry bark thread, soot on amber, salt crust on Jun) are selective and POV-filtered. Deduction: the village square and market rummage sale remain generic placeholders without spatial choreography or lived texture; the orchard's transformation ("faded beyond" the puzzle frame) is asserted but not grounded in concrete perceptual change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach Jun across impossible distance) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the puzzle edges provide direction, unlocking the weaving after three winters of paralysis. The weaving steals her laughter then her voice—escalating cost that narrows options and charges the final act. Yara's agency (pressing the bead, mouthing Jun's name, teaching him the pattern) drives closure. Minor deduction: the arrival of Jun "weeks later" after the weaving succeeds feels coincidentally timed rather than causally motivated by the panel's delivery; the mechanics of how the message compelled him to return remain off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (communication across loss, cost of connection) emerges from the weaving act and voice sacrifice without overt statement. The amber bead shifts meaning: gift from Jun → light-sealing tool → final knot in the cloth, charging closure. The raveling silence motif recurs purposefully, pooling in Yara's throat as the price paid. The ending offers a resonant answer—teaching Jun the pattern ensures continuity without taking another voice—that reweights prior material. Minor slip: "impossible distance" as a phrase appears three times, edging toward thematic echo; the final line's explicit teaching moment slightly explains rather than trusts the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV (Yara) with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (thread, silence, resin light). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated. Deduction: the barracks scene ("a man had forgotten how to hope") briefly leaks into Jun's interiority without transition, violating POV modesty. Peak-stress compression is purposeful ("mouthed Jun's name without sound"), but several filter verbs ("felt years loosen," "watched seasons slide") dull immediacy in high-texture passages. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the weaving sequence. Deduction: paraphrase loop in opening two sentences (silence as thread / years as strand sliding away). Repeated phrase "raveling silence" appears five times, twice in identical constructions ("through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry"), creating template cadence. The phrase "stoically sparkling" (bead trait) recurs verbatim without variation. Figurative density in early paragraphs (silence as thread, years as strand, seasons as cards) slightly slows momentum before the market-day beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis (weaving as communication, puzzle edges as map, voice as price) is specific and non-obvious. The orchard setting and bamboo forest anchor freshness. Deduction: the "message sent across distance by weaving" premise echoes familiar myth/fantasy templates (Penelope, sympathetic magic); transformation here rests on the puzzle-edge mechanic and voice cost, which are concrete but not fully integrated into world logic. The wistful loom spinner in a forgotten place leans toward stock pastoral melancholy without sharp counter-detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara's choices create key turns: walking to market (unlocks puzzle edges), laying edges around loom (enables recommencement), pressing bead into cloth (sends message), teaching Jun the pattern (enables future continuity). Present in setup, drives middle beats, shapes closure. High causal pressure and closure linkage; score reflects strong integration across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber bead appears in setup (brother's gift, pinned to wrist), middle (warmed by puzzle edges, passed under shuttle to seal crossings), and closure (pressed into cloth center as knot). Handled physically in multiple beats, returns with reweighted meaning (gift → tool → message anchor). Strong causal and closure participation; irreplaceability is high (resin light, warmth cue Jun's presence).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Raveling silence" shapes stakes (three winters of stillness, fear of final price) and constrains tactics (Yara must weave within it, silence pools in her throat as cost). Present in setup and closure; recurs as both concept and felt presence. Mid-range score: the concept charges the ending but remains partly abstract; its mechanics (how silence drinks voice) are asserted more than dramatized through specific action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears twice as description of the bead (under soot, at dawn); does not constrain or enable a discrete action. The attribute colors atmosphere but remains label-only without visible tradeoff or tactical consequence. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears twice: Yara understands she can recommence weaving (market-day insight), and she teaches Jun how to recommence the pattern (closure). The action drives the major turn (unlocking three winters of paralysis) and shapes the ending (legacy transfer). High integration; deduction for slight interchangeability—"resume" or "begin again" could substitute with minor wording shifts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle edges found in rummage sale box: signaled at market day (~40% mark), mechanics matter (amber bead warms, pieces tug, borders form map that guides weaving). Shapes the middle beat (enables recommencement) and indirectly shapes closure (weaving succeeds because puzzle edges provided direction). Deduction: late first appearance (second third) and the method's logic (why border pieces = coastline map) is asserted rather than grounded in prior world rules.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard deep in bamboo forest: present in setup, isolates Yara, frames the loom work, and "fades beyond" the puzzle frame during weaving. Bamboo leaves signal Jun's return at closure. The setting supplies atmospheric pressure (quiet, isolation) and the orchard's "raveling silence" ties to the concept. Deduction: the orchard does not constrain a tactical choice on the page (Yara could weave anywhere); its primary function is mood and symbolic frame rather than altering available moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" recurs as phrase; time is felt as accumulative pressure (three winters, night after night, seasons slide, weeks later). The timeframe signals endurance cost and shapes pacing. Deduction: no live ticking clock that alters tactics within the weaving sequence; time accrues atmospherically but does not force a discrete decision under deadline. Lyric reprise (opening phrase → closure) reweights meaning but does not tighten choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Yara's motivation (carry message to Jun) is dramatized early (sworn after his vanishing), drives all major choices (market trip, weaving, bead-pressing), and friction between desire and cost (fear of final price, loss of voice) charges the ending. The motivation is indispensable; removing it collapses the story logic. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" as tone: coherent through setup (three winters of stillness, fear), middle (cloth steals laughter), and closure (voice pooled in throat, mute mouth). The tone modulates with pressure—quiet dread intensifies to embodied loss—and charges the final image (teaching without speech). Strong tonal control; deduction for slight abstraction—"latent" itself is not felt as much as the concrete acts of weaving and silence.</comment>
