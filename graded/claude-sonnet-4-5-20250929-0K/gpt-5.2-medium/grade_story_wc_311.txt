<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper's interiority is richly embodied through specific gestures (palm to paper, fingertip in dust) and the voice maintains consistent contradiction between duty and grief. The motivation to name fears is rooted in personal loss (the lover "carried away without goodbye") and drives concrete choices throughout. Minor slip: the phrase "echo of sacrifice" risks abstraction, though it's grounded in the recordings' cutoff voices. The final choice to carry "new names like distant intimacies" earns stasis with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (recordings → light → crystals → names) that reweights the stake of managing grief through ritualized naming. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the reaper accepts that naming fears can ease their burden, foreclosing raw grief for structured memorial work. Orientation anchors clearly (observatory, dusk, reaper with recordings) within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when scattered light crystallizes voices into nameable shards, altering the reaper's relationship to collected deaths. Cost is legible: "that hurt was why I needed other names to survive."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: mirrors must be angled, the lens "waited," and the phonograph requires manual turning. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("cold brass and rain," "thin bridges" of light beams). The atlas page with sea monsters provides a surface that "seemed to breathe" and accepts the crystallized names, directly enabling the final act of tucking the crystal "where the ocean was blank." The setting charges the closure by providing the mechanism (scattered light through the great lens) that makes the transformation possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: to give names to nameless fears in order to ease grief. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens as each recording yields a crystallized name that softens terror ("the sea monster...shrank to a mere wave curl"). One meaningful tightening: when the reaper's own chest loosens after naming the cook, proving the method works on their personal grief. The final act of tucking the crystal under the blank ocean forecloses the path of carrying these specific deaths as raw wounds. Agency is present: the reaper chooses to angle mirrors, write names, and preserve discoveries for future keepers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: naming transforms terror into manageable memory, and grief becomes survivable through ritual witness. The atlas page's margin note "Light makes truth visible, but only if you scatter it" functions as earned wisdom that the protagonist enacts rather than states. Subtext operates in the lover's phantom presence ("almost saw...behind my shoulder") and the phrase "Tell the sea I paid" which captures sacrifice without explaining it. The final image—carrying names "like distant intimacies that might outlive my grief"—offers a resonant non-literal answer: memorial work provides survivable distance from loss. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and consistent: elevated diction ("bruised relics," "salt bright shards") remains stable throughout and reads as the reaper's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled; the reaper's way of noticing privileges metaphysical connections over mundane detail. One minor register slip: "distant intimacies" in the final line edges toward abstraction, though it remains anchored in the concrete act of carrying. No dialogue present; interior voice maintains compression and purpose under accumulating pressure. The phrase "my footsteps keep distance from the lives I take" exemplifies voice as character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (advancing action, building atmosphere, layering motif). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: light as "thin bridges," syllables "crystallized into tiny salt bright shards." Minor overwriting in the middle third where metaphoric vehicles crowd consecutive sentences without breathing room: "vibrating against the lens," "sound gained edges," "syllables began to crystallize" stack in quick succession. No loops or scaffold present. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. The closure beat is clean and propulsive: "tucked the crystal under the atlas page where the ocean was blank."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of reaper + grief work + crystallized sound through scattered light offers a specific angle that avoids stock mourning narratives. The transformation of sea-monster marginalia into memorial cartography is fresh. Emotional truth drives the premise: the reaper uses others' deaths to process their own loss, which reads as psychologically specific rather than generic. Minor limitation: the observatory-as-ritual-space and light-as-revelation carry familiar symbolic weight, though the execution through wax cylinders and atlas annotations adds texture. The premise commits fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper shapes key turns: spreading the atlas, angling mirrors, naming victims in dust, and choosing to preserve the final crystal for future keepers. Present by the opening line and drives all major beats. The character's grief directly motivates the method and the stakes. Closure participation is strong: "shouldered my scythe, and left...carrying new names" shows the reaper transformed by the ritual. Cost is visible: accepting that naming others eases personal grief means the lover's loss remains un-addressed on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in beat one (spread on the table), reappears when crystallized phrases "lodged beside a painted serpent," and closes the sequence when the reaper tucks the final crystal "under the atlas page where the ocean was blank." The page's sea monsters are reweighted from "terror" to "mere wave curl" after naming, and the margin note provides the method's guiding principle. Removing this exact object would break the cartographic metaphor and eliminate the surface that accepts and transforms the names. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice shapes multiple beats: the recordings capture "prayers cut short, jokes left hanging," the man who "pushed...did not climb after," and the cook who "went down with an empty pot, laughing." The concept drives the reaper's stake (naming those who sacrificed eases the burden of collecting them) and appears in the closure reflection: "the echo of sacrifice is easier to carry when you can point to who bore it." Development is present but slightly abstract; the concept operates more as thematic frame than concrete constraint. Cost connection is moderate: the reaper must witness and preserve these sacrifices to ease personal grief.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echoes of forgotten phrases drive the inciting action (finding recordings), provide the raw material (prayers, jokes, a child's call), and become the crystallized shards the reaper names and maps. Present from the first paragraph ("voices clung to my ribs") through the closure ("forming one of the forgotten phrases I never answered"). The attribute constrains method: only recorded voices can be crystallized through light. Two distinct beats: playing the cylinders and threading phrases into beam paths. Cost is visible: the lover's unspoken phrase haunts the ending, showing that not all echoes can be resolved.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystallization is the pivot action that transforms abstract grief into manageable memorial: "syllables began to crystallize into tiny salt bright shards." Signaled early through the method's description and executed in multiple beats (the man's phrase becomes crystal, the cook's laughter becomes beads, the sob becomes "a drop of light"). The action enables the closure choice (tucking the crystal under the atlas) and cannot be swapped without losing the story's central mechanic. High irreplaceability: removing crystallization collapses both method and metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Scattered light is signaled early ("Light makes truth visible, but only if you scatter it"), shapes the method (angling mirrors to fracture dusk into beams), and enables crystallization ("Where the beams overlapped, sound gained edges"). Present in three distinct beats: setting mirrors, threading phrases into beam paths, and holding the final sob between mirrors. The method's mechanics matter: overlapping beams allow sound to gain physical form. Learned from the lost lover, which ties method to motivation. Removing this exact means would eliminate the mechanism by which voices become preservable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient observatory provides essential resources: the great lens, mirrors, the phonograph, and the atlas page left by the previous keeper. Setting is present from the opening line and constrains every major choice (must angle mirrors, must use the lens, must turn the phonograph handle). The observatory's history (previous keeper's margin note, mariner manual) supplies the method's guiding principle. Dusk timing matters: "the sun slid behind broken clouds" provides the light to scatter. Spatial elements (central table, stairs, glass dome) are handled concretely. High participation across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after finding the old recordings" establishes sequence and motivates the return visit, but does not tighten decisions or create temporal pressure. Dusk provides atmosphere and the necessary light, yet no countdown or urgency shapes tactics. The frame is present in setup (establishes why the reaper has returned) and implied at closure (night has crept higher), achieving two gates. Functional but replaceable: the ritual could occur at any single sitting. No visible cost tied specifically to timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to give names to nameless fears drives every beat: spreading the atlas, playing recordings, crystallizing voices, writing names in dust, and preserving the final crystal for future discovery. Present by the first paragraph ("I had come to give names to nameless fears") and tested through concrete choices under pressure. Friction between want (to ease grief by naming others) and cost (the lover's name "tasted like iron") creates authentic tension. Closure fulfills the motivation: "carrying new names like distant intimacies that might outlive my grief." Dramatized rather than told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distant intimacy is coherent throughout: the voice maintains elevated remove ("bruised relics," "hollow that grief has carved") while charged with personal loss. Tone modulates with pressure: opens with cold brass and clicking scythe, warms when "voices clung to my ribs with a private warmth," tightens during crystallization, and closes with the phantom lover "behind my shoulder." The final line crystallizes the tone perfectly: "carrying new names like distant intimacies that might outlive my grief" fuses formal distance with acute longing. No lapses into sentimentality or cold detachment. The tone charges the entire final image.</comment>
