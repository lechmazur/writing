<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concretely embodied through the applique and the sketching ritual, with choices constrained by the "blessed pariah" status and temporal disorientation. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between accepting blame and seeking alignment, driven by grief and professional exile. The temporally stretched sensation is well-embodied through breath and sound delays. Minor deduction: the shift from confusion to clarity at the hatch feels slightly accelerated given the weight of accumulated blame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist achieves alignment through the star-sketch compass, opens the hatch, and walks toward earned direction with visible cost (accepting solitude, leaving the station). The cost is felt in "alone and yet connected" and the station becoming "just another dark landmark." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (station, deck, post-shutdown). One meaningful deepening occurs when the double-sky reveals directional drift, transforming confusion into navigation. The accumulative pressure—grief anniversary, temporal stretching, calibration through sketching—coheres and tightens to the final walk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observation deck's double-pane treatment becomes a functional instrument that constrains the protagonist's navigation choice, charging the closure by revealing true north. Sensory details—ventilation fans slowing, moonlight striping water, air tasting clean—are filtered through the protagonist's relief and temporal distortion. The deck setting is not merely backdrop but the tool that makes the resolution possible. Spatial choreography (deck to hatch to coast road) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: turning confusion into exploration, signaled early and sustained through the protagonist's return despite crew exile. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sketch reveals directional drift, forcing the choice to trust the alignment and open the hatch. Agency is decision with visible cost: accepting solitude and leaving the station behind. The temporally stretched sensation creates escalating disorientation that the protagonist must navigate. No antagonist required; the situational pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the grandmother's teaching—"the world lies about direction but true north never does"—earned through the on-page act of sketching and calibration rather than assertion. The applique functions as both inherited wisdom and concrete tool, reweighted at closure when its rays match the star-drift intersection. The final walk offers a resonant answer: direction is earned through patient observation, not assigned by institutional authority. Complexity lives in the protagonist's simultaneous isolation and connection to lineage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters everything through temporal disorientation ("breath unspooled behind me," "sound arrived with a delayed twin") and maritime/navigational idiom inherited from the grandmother. Diction remains consistent—"blessed pariah," "echoed silence," "patient pencil dust"—with purposeful compression in the lyric mode. The narrative voice maintains confidence calibrated to the protagonist's specialized knowledge of the station and grief ritual without withholding key information.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the sketch discovery and breathing at the final walk. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the navigation problem simultaneously. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting: "temporally stretched feeling loosened into ordinary time" could compress, and "a direction earned rather than assigned" slightly telegraphs theme. No loops or major artifacts. The opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, time-dilation technology, and navigational calibration through ancestral wisdom feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "cursed protagonist" trope by making the supposed curse a calibration gift. The double-sky observation deck as instrument rather than experiment site is fresh. Risk-taking in the accumulative/lyric structure and temporal disorientation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction: the station shutdown as convenient backdrop remains somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" character drives two key beats: the decision to return despite crew exile (opening) and the choice to open the hatch and leave (closure). The status shapes tactics—sketching alone on the deck, trusting personal calibration over institutional markers. Visible cost: accepting solitude and walking away from the station. Early signal in paragraph one; closure participation through the walk toward the coast.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in four beats: pressed to the pane to line the page, laid over the drawing to match drift intersections, held in palm during the walk, and mentioned in the opening as inherited marker. Its geometry constrains the sketching method and validates the directional finding. The object is causally essential: without its rays, the protagonist cannot verify the alignment. Early signal (paragraph four); closure participation (final paragraph); high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"True north" shapes stakes and tactics throughout: the grandmother's teaching frames the quest, the sketch reveals where "the sky insists" north lies versus "the station's painted arrows," and the final walk follows "the north my page had revealed." The concept drives the middle beat (discovery) and closure (walking toward earned direction). It is not merely thematic but alters on-page options by revealing the service hatch direction. Early signal; middle and closure participation; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "temporally stretched" sensation enables the protagonist to "feel the difference between now and later," functioning as calibration rather than curse. It constrains action by creating disorientation that must be navigated and enables the recognition of the double-sky drift. Visible in three beats: initial stretching on the deck, realization of calibration function, and loosening into ordinary time during the walk. Cost: enduring disorientation to achieve alignment. Early signal; middle development; closure edge participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "glimpse through the upper corner of the window" where the treatment is thinnest reveals the single needle of direction, a key turn that defines the protagonist's next action (opening the hatch). However, the glimpse could be replaced with another method of verification (e.g., comparing the two star positions more carefully) without fundamentally breaking the story. Present in middle beat; contributes to but does not solely own the closure. Mid-band: functional and purposeful but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries drives the entire plot: it compels the protagonist's return during evacuation, structures the method (using the applique to line the page, connecting stars across panes), and provides the ritual frame that links grief to navigation. The method is signaled early (paragraph six) and executed across multiple beats. Without this specific custom, the protagonist has no reason to be on the deck or to create the star-drift map. High causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is indispensable: its double-pane treatment showing "two skies at once" provides the unique resource that enables the directional discovery. The deck supplies the instrument (treated glass), pressures the protagonist with temporal stretching, and points toward the service hatch. The setting is not interchangeable; no other location could provide this specific capability. Early signal (paragraph seven); middle beat (sketch discovery); closure participation (hatch direction revealed by deck alignment). The deck is both setting and tool, constraining method and enabling resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" provides context and motive (crew scattered, protagonist alone with keys and blame) but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The timeframe enables the plot by removing obstacles (no crew to stop the protagonist) but does not escalate pressure through temporal scarcity. The anniversary of the grandmother's death imposes a ritual deadline that shapes the return, adding some urgency. Present in setup and context; moderate contribution to stakes; replaceable with other isolation premises.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is dramatized through the protagonist's choice to return, to sketch despite disorientation, and to follow the revealed direction out of the station. The desire conflicts with the safer option of accepting exile passively. Visible cost: leaving the station, accepting solitude, walking into uncertainty. The realization "turned the confusion in my chest into a map" marks the shift. Early signal (implied by return); middle dramatization (sketch discovery); closure execution (walking the coast road). High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone of "echoed silence" is coherent throughout: corridors carry echoed silence, footsteps feel like trespass, ventilation fans slow "like animals settling to sleep," and the protagonist walks into "ordinary time" while holding the cold applique. Tone modulates appropriately—solemnity during sketching, relief at the hatch opening, quiet resolve during the walk—without breaking the established register. The final image charges the tone with earned alignment. Present across all beats; contributes to atmosphere and closure mood.</comment>
