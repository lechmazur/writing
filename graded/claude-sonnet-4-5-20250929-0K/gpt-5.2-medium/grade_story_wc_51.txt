<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weaver's interiority is consistently particular (lamp burner as alignment cue, "fear of empty hands" reveal) and the final choice to "orient properly" each time demonstrates earned agency. The widow's test at dawn adds pressure. However, the stakes remain abstract—the collection task lacks immediate personal cost until the late "fear of empty hands" admission, which arrives close to the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: the weaver moves from trapped passivity to self-aware orientation practice, with visible cost (calcified thread, acceptance of the recurring task). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through shingled hush, drowned constellations, whalebone lattice, then shifts cadence at the final turn toward starlight alignment. One meaningful tightening (grotto trap → orientation → release) is sufficient for this length. The orientation test is satisfied by line 4 (grotto entrance, lamp lit, stone scales visible).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bronze grotto constrains choice: the "boundary-lessly trapped" effect forces the burner-alignment solution, and the whalebone lattice becomes a functional tool rather than decoration. Starlight through the crack anchors the climax. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (kelp/tide, drowned constellations, thawed moss) and filtered through the weaver's craft lens. The micro-setting (burner holes, shadow match) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens without becoming stone) is signaled early and tightens once: grotto traps → orientation → calcified thread → release with cost. The final choice (marking palms, orienting each time) forecloses drift and accepts ongoing discipline. Escalation reads under Accumulative lens as a cadence shift that reweights the task. However, the trap itself feels self-resolving once the alignment trick is discovered; the protagonist's prior choices don't deepen the predicament.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (bearing others' grief without ossifying) emerges through whalebone lattice, calcified thread, shingled hush layering—each image shifts meaning at closure. The widow's answer ("fear of empty hands") reframes the work without moralizing. Final image (soot-marked palms, starlight orientation) offers a non-literal answer: vigilance over technique. No expository claims; the progression from stealing weights to sheltering roof is earned by particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: "kelp reads tide," "constellations drowning," "whalebone reverie" establish a specific craft-and-natural-systems idiom. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The widow's brief dialogue ("fear of empty hands") feels natural and distinct. One slip: "boundarylessly trapped" is a coined term that reads slightly forced, though voice-motivated. Compression in the grotto beat maintains legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful figurative work ("silence layered on silence," "drowned constellations"). Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Two minor deductions: "cupped like a whale's rib" and later "whalebone" risk redundancy, and "shingled hush: silence layered on silence, each panel overlapping" paraphrases itself within one sentence (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high but coherent; no muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis (grief-work as alignment practice, burner shadow as escape key) feels specific and non-obvious. Whalebone lattice transforms "burden collection" from a stock fantasy trope into a precise structural metaphor. Risk-taking (abstract setting, lyric compression) heightens without obscuring closure. The grotto trap mechanism could be swapped for other magical puzzles, but the orientation-via-burner solution and the "fear of empty hands" payoff are tightly braided.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractal weaver drives the opening hire, the weaving attempt, the lamp-burner alignment discovery, and the final soot-marking ritual. Present in all three gates (setup, middle trap, closure choice). Causal pressure: the weaver's craft creates the calcified lattice, and the widow confrontation delivers the "fear of empty hands" insight that reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner appears in three beats: lit at grotto entrance (functional, establishes light-sinking effect), used as alignment tool to break trap (causal), soot-marked on palms at closure (charged reprise). Irreplaceable: its holes, threads, and shadow are the escape mechanism. Strong closure linkage and cost connection (marks as reminder).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" introduced early, intensifies in the trap ("thickened until my own thoughts made no echo"), and reappears at closure ("became a sheltering roof"). Changes tactics: the hush is the trap's weapon, and accepting it as shelter marks the weaver's stance shift. Two beats plus closure participation, with visible cost (must orient to survive it).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Boundarylessly trapped" arrives in the middle, triggers the alignment solution, and its resolution (seam opens) enables escape. Constrains action on the page with immediate cost (weaver cannot leave until oriented). Causal pressure is clear. Present in development and payoff gates; absence from setup slightly limits score, but middle introduction is justified by grotto entry.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calcify is the story's pivot: silver thread calcifies into whalebone struts, enabling both trap release and burden-carrying without collapse. Drives the major turn (from pliant to fixed) and the widow's reaction (lead tear no longer pins gaze). Irreplaceable mechanics; swapping it would require narrative overhaul. Strong closure linkage (lattice on stump, permanence of change).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled in teacher's advice mid-story, demonstrated immediately (burner shadow match, body rotation), and echoed at closure ("orientation must be chosen each time," turning body to stars). Shapes two beats: escape and final ritual. Mechanics matter: alignment is action, not metaphor. All three gates; causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto frames the entire middle third, supplies the trap (boundary-less curve, shingled hush), provides resources (starlight crack for shadow-matching), and its interior physics (light sinking into bronze, constellations drowning) establish the sensory logic. Present setup to payoff; alters tactics and charges imagery. Indispensable to the escape sequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors the opening and reappears as "thawed moss" at closure, establishing seasonal frame. Does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the weaver's task is not time-bound. Swappable with other seasonal markers. Functional mood-setting but no causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is stated early, drives the weaving action, and the widow scene tests it with cost ("no longer pinned her gaze"). Widow's counter-question reveals the weaver's own burden. Friction between task and personal cost emerges late but lands. Two beats plus closure participation; could be slightly more conflicted in middle moves.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and implicitly present throughout (drowned constellations, calcified lattice, suspended lightness). Tone modulates from descriptive mystery (grotto entrance) to trapped compression (thickened hush) to elegiac acceptance (sheltering roof). Charges the final image; coherent across turns.</comment>
