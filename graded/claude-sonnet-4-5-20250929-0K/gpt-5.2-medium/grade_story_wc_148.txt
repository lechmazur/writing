<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—chasing hush to finish his father's story—and the internal contradiction between wanting eyes away while also needing to name the dead creates genuine tension. The hovering ability is embodied through listening until "my weight forgot itself," avoiding magical convenience. The choice to leave the door ajar and whisper into the lattice demonstrates agency with visible cost (accepting disbelief), though the emotional progression through the discovery could be more contradictory and less controlled. Minor deduction for the slightly too-articulate self-awareness in "I wanted eyes away, a space where the dead could be named without spectacle."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (cry-wolf boy), where (lighthouse prison), and when (before bodies are found) within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (scuffs as map, lattice sustaining impossibilities, keepers folded in light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist sets the lattice against glass, whispers his father's warning, and leaves the door ajar, crystallizing his stance with felt cost (accepting he'll be called delusional). The escalation operates through density increase and pattern break rather than causal links. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds the bodies and chooses documentation over spectacle. Cost is legible: "the hush would belong to them, not me."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting constrains movement and choices throughout: the beam's rotation lulls guards, the oldest wing's impossible architecture (stairs to nowhere, cells opening into walls) literalizes the labyrinth metaphor, and the Fresnel lens becomes the repository for the hidden bodies. Sensory detail is purposeful—copperlight pooling, salt-mottled glass, reef showing teeth at dawn—and filtered through the protagonist's mission. The scuffs on the door function as micro-setting, a physical map that guides both the protagonist and future searchers. Spatial choreography remains clear across the vertical movement from cells to lantern room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finishing the story his father began—is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative/Textural lens: discovering the corridor sounds through the lattice, learning to hover, following the scuffs, hearing Morrow's voice, finding the bodies, and finally leaving evidence for searchers. The choice to whisper his father's warning into the lattice rather than announce the discovery represents a meaningful tightening with visible cost: he forecloses the path of vindication to preserve "hush" and accept being called a liar. The final image—waiting for the shout, knowing the hush will belong to the dead—charges the resolution with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the inheritance of disbelief, the desire for truth without spectacle, and the cost of being believed versus being true. The lattice and scuffs function as concrete anchors rather than symbolic ornament, accumulating meaning through use. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the protagonist achieves his goal (naming the dead, finishing the story) while accepting its cost (continued disbelief, isolation). The piece resists moralizing—there's no redemption for the father, no vindication for the son, only the earned stance of choosing hush over spectacle. The copperlight repose returns at closure, reweighted from warning lantern to quiet vigil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature throughout. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and character-specific: he tracks sound through lattice holes, reads scuffs as maps, interprets the beam's "polite" avoidance. Diction stays within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—lyric but grounded, with phrases like "copperlight repose" and "hush spoke back" feeling voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The compression in "folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens" and "illumination itself could avert its gaze" reflects the narrator's particular way of seeing impossibility. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the lantern-room discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with longer accumulative passages contrasting shorter declarative beats ("I did not touch them"). Information density is high—most lines advance story, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. The opening and closing images bookend with purpose. Minor deductions for occasional template cadence in the middle section ("I followed...using...and I entered") and a few near-paraphrases ("the hush finally took the words and held them still" echoes earlier "hush" descriptions without adding pressure). The figurative language is mostly controlled, though "folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens" strains slightly against physical logic. No significant loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes Gothic architecture, inherited reputation, and the concept of "chasing hush" into a fresh configuration. The lattice sustaining impossibilities and the scuffs-as-map transform familiar lighthouse-prison and family-legacy tropes through specific, grounded mechanics. The emotional calculus—choosing to be disbelieved in order to preserve space for the dead—avoids the safety middle. The turn from "my father cried wolf because he wanted eyes on him" to "I chased hush because I wanted eyes away" reweights the inherited curse through character-specific choice rather than redemption arc. The hovering ability earns its strangeness through listening rather than magic, and the final vigil resists both vindication and despair.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (identified by heritage), middle development (choices to follow hush, use lattice, enter wing), and payoff (choice to whisper warning and leave door ajar). Drives two major beats: discovery of bodies and decision to document without announcing. The character's specific history (son of cry-wolf) creates the central tension and final choice accepts being called delusional with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup in second paragraph (chaplain gives it), development through multiple uses (hearing corridors, pressing to Morrow's cell, whispering father's warning), payoff ("warmed in my pocket like a coal"). Appears in at least three distinct beats, enables the hovering and discovery, and carries reweighted meaning at closure. The lattice's property of sustaining impossibilities directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Framed early ("I came to chase hush"), drives middle choices (following hush like compass, entering wing, not touching bodies to preserve quiet), and shapes closure decision (leaving evidence while preserving hush). The concept constrains tactics throughout—avoiding spectacle, choosing whisper over shout—and the final line crystallizes its cost: "the hush would belong to them, not me."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup when chaplain describes lattice's property, development through concrete uses (hearing corridors, voices speaking back, hovering), payoff in final whisper that "the hush finally took the words and held them still." The attribute enables key actions with cost (accepting impossibility means accepting disbelief). Would score higher if the mechanics were more constrained or if the cost were more visible in moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup (learning to hover through listening), development (skating above wet floor, hovering up iron ladder), closure participation (physical access to lantern room where bodies are hidden). Enables two beats and shapes final discovery, but the action itself could be replaced with climbing without fundamentally altering the emotional or thematic arc—it's the discovery and choice that matter, not the means of ascent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup (scuffs described as map with child's WOLF scratching), development (entering through the door, understanding its history), payoff (deliberately leaving it ajar to guide searchers). Present in three beats, shapes the middle turn (understanding the labyrinth), and charges closure choice. The method matters specifically—it's both entry and exit, and the choice to leave it open becomes the protagonist's deliberate flaw in prison geometry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup in opening line, development through multiple constraints (beam rotation, oldest wing's impossible architecture, cells and spiral, Fresnel lens as body repository), payoff (reef showing teeth at dawn, sitting in chapel under copperlight). The setting pressures every choice: guards' patrol patterns, vertical access, lens as hiding place. Micro-settings (lattice, ladder, glass) constrain tactics and the lighthouse's dual nature as prison and lantern charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup in third paragraph ("before they find the bodies"), maintains pressure (wardens play cards, "sure that silence meant safety"), payoff (waiting for first shout from docks, "after the bodies were found"). The timeframe creates urgency and shapes the choice to leave evidence rather than announce, but the clock doesn't visibly tighten tactics beat-to-beat—it's more a framing boundary than an active constraint on moment-to-moment decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup ("I came to chase hush...to finish one that began with my father's shout"), development through active choices (following hush, entering wing, setting lattice against glass), payoff (accepting hush will belong to the dead). The motivation creates friction between wanting truth and avoiding spectacle, drives the key choice to whisper rather than shout, and the final cost is felt: isolation and continued disbelief accepted for the sake of quiet.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup in opening phrase, maintained through lyric compression and contemplative pacing, modulates slightly during discovery (urgency without panic), returns at closure ("under the same copperlight repose"). The tone remains coherent through turns and charges the final image by framing the vigil as repose rather than victory or defeat. Would score higher if the modulation under peak pressure were more pronounced or if the tone itself created greater friction with events.</comment>
