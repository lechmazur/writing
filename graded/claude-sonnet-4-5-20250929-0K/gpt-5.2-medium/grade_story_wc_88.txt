<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "kindle empathy where none remains" is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The choice to haul up the teenage thief shows micro-decision work, and refusing the stolen wallet demonstrates value hierarchy under pressure, but the interior voice relies heavily on philosophical summary ("Wonder survived in me like a bruise you keep pressing") rather than embodied contradiction. The final testimony choice feels more thematically required than earned by visible internal struggle on the page. The reflection-heavy mode keeps interiority at arm's length from visceral consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the labyrinth journey accumulates symbolic pressure through newspaper clues, murals, pinholes, and quotes rather than tight causal linkage. Closure appears to land via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: choosing testimony over escape), but the final cost is told rather than shown—"I carried no miracle, only a statement" summarizes rather than dramatizes the forfeiture. The orientation is delayed: who, where, and when are not fully anchored until the aquarium hatch (~30% in), though the post-procedure clinical frame arrives earlier. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4), and thematic summary in the final lines ("maybe empathy can be rebuilt word by word") replaces scene pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground bioluminescent lake functions as more than backdrop: it "answers by turning on" and its glow "outlined dozens of branching passages," making spatial navigation concrete and choice-dependent. The baseball as micro-setting element constrains the thief-rescue choice (used as counterweight) and charges the final image when tossed to the traveler, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet stone and algae," "lake light," "leather thin as old skin." The aquarium hatch, pawn shops, and service tunnels anchor the journey's phases without catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming humanity through choice—is signaled early and guides the journey, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is more thematic than tactical. The thief-rescue and wallet-refusal show micro-choices with modest immediate consequence, yet the labyrinth's harder quotes and the final testimony decision are presented as inevitable rather than earned through visible narrowing of options. The time traveler's late exposition ("I had seen you choose cruelty in a hundred timelines") tells rather than dramatizes the cost of the protagonist's past. No persistent material constraint (stamina, tool, social credit) shapes tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the journey's structure and the recurring baseball signed with a future date, avoiding overt thesis until the final line's "maybe empathy can be rebuilt word by word"—which tilts toward summary. The labyrinth as a "maze to make doubt grow" and the lake "shimmering like a jury" offer resonant images, though the time traveler's direct explanation ("he planted the baseball as a seed of doubt") over-articulates the mechanism. The protagonist's internal arc—from blankness to testimony—links to the thematic question, but the ending's philosophical tilt ("jaded wonder") leans more toward assertion than earned transformation through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "delicately robust," "ozone and second chances," "bruise you keep pressing." Diction modulates between hard-boiled compression ("a clean slate seeker with a dirty past") and lyric register ("the water itself was thinking"), sustaining the "jaded wonder" tone. The boy's thanking and wallet-offer show purposeful dialogue economy, and the time traveler's exposition serves plot without head-hopping. The voice stays consistent under pressure, though the final paragraph's philosophical turn ("empathy can be rebuilt word by word") briefly elevates register beyond the established noir-lyric blend without breaking coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Information density is high ("clinic room with my file wiped clean and my heart wiped cleaner"), and rhythm varies purposefully across beats. However, synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear: "clean slate seeker with a dirty past" echoes "wiped clean/cleaner," and "delicately robust...thin as old skin yet refusing to crack" restates fragility twice. Template stems recur ("I realized," "I wanted to believe," "I tossed") without taught pattern. Figurative density peaks in the lake scene ("water itself was thinking," "lake shimmered like a jury") without muddling clarity, but the final line's "word by word" moralizes rather than charging the image. Apply paraphrase-loop and stem penalties: −0.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—emotion-wiped assassin navigates a literal labyrinth to regain empathy via cryptic newspaper clues and a time-traveler's baseball—synthesizes noir, speculative, and fable elements with specificity (bioluminescent lake, pinholes mapping constellations, quotes welded onto placards). The combination feels fresh and purposeful rather than checklist-assembled. The time traveler's late exposition and the protagonist's choice between escape and testimony follow familiar redemption-arc logic, but the "labyrinth not built to trap bodies, but to force decisions" and the baseball-as-counterweight turn the trope through concrete, grounded action. Risk-taking in voice and structure (reflection-heavy, elliptical journey beats) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring causality, earning a modest within-band lift (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "clean slate seeker with dirty past" protagonist is introduced immediately and drives three key beats: hauling up the thief (using the baseball), refusing the wallet, and choosing testimony over escape. Setup is early, middle choices narrow options (wallet refusal surprises "us both"), and the final decision to testify participates in closure by foreclosing the escape path. Causal pressure is moderate: the choices demonstrate a hierarchy of values, but the testimony decision is more thematically mandated than tactically constrained by prior beats. All three gates present; causal involvement across beats with visible cost at closure justifies mid-7 eligibility, reduced slightly for the thematic-mandate feel (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The signed baseball appears in three beats: received pre-procedure, used as counterweight to rescue the thief (enabling a choice with cost), and tossed to the traveler at closure ("the future itself demanded a throw"). Setup is early, middle use constrains the rescue tactic, and the toss at closure visibly reweights prior material—returning the seed of doubt with felt cost. The "future date" detail charges each appearance with thematic resonance. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate but reprise at closure strong. Mid-7 band fits: essential across beats and ending, though the toss itself is more symbolic than tactically decisive (cap near 7.8 for that limit).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "labyrinth of choices" frames the entire narrative: hinted pre-procedure, mapped via newspaper clues, physically entered at the aquarium hatch, and navigated through branching passages with welded quotes that "read like commands." It shapes stakes (every junction "carried a cost") and tactics (left/right decisions, reading quotes). The labyrinth's purpose—"to force decisions"—is dramatized across multiple beats and the ending choice (testimony vs. escape) occurs within its conceptual frame. Setup early, middle beats engage its mechanics, closure depends on the final chamber choice. All three gates; high causal pressure; irreplaceable. Strong 8-band: the labyrinth is the story's skeleton.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Delicately robust" describes the baseball ("leather thin as old skin yet refusing to crack") and is used once as a constraint: the ball's durability allows it to serve as counterweight without breaking. The phrase reappears near closure ("the delicately robust ball in my hand felt suddenly heavy"), charging the final image with thematic weight. Setup early, one middle action enabled, closure image charged. Two gates met (setup + closure reprise); middle gate weak (single enabling action). Lyric reprise reweights the stake, placing score in mid-5s per the allowance. Swappable adjective and ornamental at times lower ceiling (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "journey" structures the entire narrative: from clinic exit through pawn shops, service tunnels, murals, aquarium hatch, ladder descent, lake discovery, passage navigation, and final chamber. Each leg introduces new choices (thief rescue, wallet refusal, quote-reading) and the journey's physical progression mirrors the thematic arc from blankness to testimony. Setup immediate, middle beats depend on it, closure choice occurs at journey's end. All three gates; strong causal linkage; irreplaceable. High-7/low-8 band: the journey is the vessel for all other elements, though the elliptical structure means some legs are summarized rather than dramatized (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reading between newspaper lines" is introduced early ("follow his hints by reading between newspaper lines"), demonstrated in daily practice ("watched the gutters of print for odd gaps, misaligned letters, and accidental acrostics"), and executed on-page at the aquarium ("classifieds punctured with pinholes that mapped a route"). The method guides the journey and is referenced at closure ("reading between their lines for the missing words"). Setup early, middle beats shaped by it, closure alludes to it. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure. Mid-6 band: the method enables but does not deeply constrain choices, and its mechanics remain somewhat abstract (−0.5 for limited on-page demonstration of cost or tradeoff).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "underground bioluminescent lake" is discovered at the hatch, "turns on" in response to the match, and its glow "outlined dozens of branching passages"—making navigation possible and choice-dependent. The lake "shimmered like a jury" at the final decision. Setup mid-story (~40%), but strong middle function (enables passage selection) and closure participation (jury image charges the testimony choice). Two gates solid (middle + closure); late setup applies −0.3 cap penalty but strong causal role in middle and ending keeps score in low-7s. The lake is setting-as-resource and symbolic weight, satisfying micro-setting criteria.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the opening and frames the protagonist's blank-heart state, but time as a constraint or live clock is absent. The journey unfolds over "each morning after" without urgency or deadline. The timeframe is a static backdrop rather than a pressure that tightens decisions. Setup early, but no middle or closure function as ticking constraint. One gate only (setup); ornamental beyond establishing the post-op state. Low-4 band: present and coherent but replaceable with "after the accident" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To kindle empathy where none remains" is stated explicitly ("my motivation was not profit anymore but to kindle empathy") and dramatized through the wallet-refusal choice that surprises the protagonist. The testimony decision at closure enacts the motivation by choosing testimony despite "wanting to believe I was past consequences." Setup clear by thief-rescue beat, middle choice shaped by it, closure choice directly serves it. All three gates; moderate friction between stated want and immediate cost. Mid-7 band: the motivation is present and causal but relies partly on summary articulation rather than fully embodied contradiction (−0.3 for tell-heavy articulation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" tone is established early ("I did not believe in miracles, but I believed in schemes") and sustained through contradictory diction: hard-boiled ("a man who cannot feel for anyone can be hired to do anything") layered with lyric yearning ("Wonder survived in me like a bruise you keep pressing"). The tone modulates under pressure: the lake scene elevates ("the water itself was thinking"), and the final image lands on "jaded wonder that maybe empathy can be rebuilt." Setup immediate, tone coherent through turns, closure charged by it. All three gates; strong rhythmic control and voice consistency. High-7 band: the tone is indispensable and charges the ending, though the final phrase explicitly names the tone rather than letting it resonate implicitly (−0.2).</comment>
