<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's observational skill and professional identity are established early and drive several key moves (reassembling letters, reading landscape, recognizing the beacon pattern). Internal motivation is concrete—grief-fueled truth-seeking for Salma—but interiority remains somewhat instrumental; we track tactical choices more than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final decision to distribute evidence shows agency with visible cost (Ministry seizure imminent), though the emotional texture of that choice is compressed. Backstory reflection (liquidation context, debunker work) anchors present stakes but occupies substantial word count without always tilting present micro-choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with textural accent (investigative accumulation → revelatory turn → distributive gambit). The closure lands on-page with a clear tactical shift—mailing ledger copies to rival bureaus—that reconfigures options and accepts imminent cost (agents arriving). Causality holds: shredded letters → coordinates → orchard discovery → ledger → public dissemination. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the diamond is a detector, narrowing the mystery and raising stakes. The orientation is slightly delayed (dusty city established, but "after the liquidation" context front-loads abstraction before grounding who/where/when), though the effect does not obscure closure. Cost is legible: evidence seized, protagonist now exposed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains and reveals: the Stillpoint's physical boundary is felt ("world stop humming"), the basin's calm becomes tactile proof, and workers' presence supplies immediate social pressure. The flawed diamond's violet pulse within that field charges the closure by converting superstition into evidence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"glossy and unburned" leaves, "gray masks," airborne grit that "circled but never fell"—filtered through the debunker's investigative lens. The city's "concrete ribs" and "dust storms like walls" establish broader wasteland plausibility without catalog. The orchard's discovery and interior both constrain the protagonist's next moves and supply the ledger that drives the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: excavate truth from the Ministry's lie. Pressure tightens when the reassembled letters reveal coordinates, deepens when the protagonist risks the storm journey, and peaks when the ledger proves systemic relocation. Agency is present—choosing to travel, staging findings, mailing copies—with visible cost at closure (Ministry seizure). One meaningful reversal: the "cursed" diamond reweights from superstition to beacon, which narrows mystery and raises tactical risk. The ending gambit (mailing ledger to rival bureaus) is driven by protagonist decision and accepts imminent consequence. However, the middle sequence (cart journey, orchard entry) compresses several investigative beats into summary, slightly dulling escalation texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete investigative particulars: truth as counter-pressure to institutionalized comfort, the debunker's pattern-reading applied to state lies, and the tactical use of inter-bureaucratic rivalry. The final image—betting that "in the cracks between their competing lies, the Stillpoint of fact might hold"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The flawed diamond's journey from curse-object to detector integrates thematic repricing across the arc. "Truth, once tasted, is harder to dismiss than any ministry weather report" edges toward summary assertion but remains grounded in the sensory apple-sack detail. Subtext operates in the supervisor's correction ("The beacon") and Salma's steady voice, implying collective awakening without spelling it out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person investigative, with perceptual signature clear: the debunker reads land "the way a debunker reads a hoax, for what it tries to hide." Diction stays within professional-investigative register, though some phrases ("the storms were natural," "comfort line") lean slightly expository. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "The curse" / "The beacon" exchange lands subtext efficiently. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to investigative framing throughout. One voice slip: "made my hands go cold" is generic embodiment in an otherwise precise narrator. Sentence rhythm varies but occasional template stems appear ("I packed… then rode"; "I stepped… and felt"). Filter verbs ("I learned," "I saw") appear but remain voice-consistent for report-mode narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance investigation or world logic. Sentence variety is present but several adjacent beats use similar "I [verb]" stems, creating mild template cadence in the journey and orchard-entry sequence. One paraphrase loop: "debunker reads a hoax, for what it tries to hide" echoes the earlier "sharply observant… survival habit" without added pressure. Clarity is strong; causality and spatial choreography remain legible throughout. The "comfort line" / "comfortable lies" phrase recurs purposefully to charge theme, so pattern-teaching holds. Overwriting is minimal—figurative language ("bones under sand," "walls" of storms) is precise and spaced. Proofreading is clean. The final beat's syntax ("betting that in the cracks…") is dense but legible, fitting the investigative voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—debunker protagonist + flawed-detector diamond + hidden Stillpoint orchard—feels fresh and internally consistent, avoiding template conspiracy plots through the specific investigative method (reassembling shredded letters) and the physical proof mechanism (diamond's field-responsive flaw). The gambit of mailing evidence to rival bureaus rather than a single heroic confrontation offers a non-obvious tactical turn rooted in bureaucratic reality. Emotional specificity is present in Salma's grief and the protagonist's methodical professionalism. However, the post-liquidation dust-storm setting and "Ministry suppresses dissidents" premise are familiar genre territory; the story transforms them through investigative texture and the Stillpoint's concrete physics rather than upending core tropes. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear investigative, and the ending's hope ("Stillpoint of fact might hold") is earned but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conspiracy debunker role is signaled immediately, frames expectation, drives three distinct beats (reassembling letters, reading landscape for what it hides, staging evidence to reveal planted curse), and shapes the closure gambit (mailing ledger to rival bureaus exploits the debunker's institutional knowledge). The character's professional skill enables the investigative method and constrains choices (pattern-reading replaces confrontation). Irreplaceability is high; another archetype would require major rewrite. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 = strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is seeded early (client brings it), recurs in four beats (tin box mention, theft detail, violet pulse in Stillpoint, staged reveal to neighbors), and its reweighting—from curse to beacon—drives the thematic and investigative turn. The diamond's "cloudy core would shimmer only in the Stillpoint's field" is irreplaceable physics that enables orchard discovery and closure proof. Early signal +0.7, four-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection (husband's theft led to disappearance) +0.5 = essential integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hidden Stillpoint is introduced at midpoint (reassembled letter), defines the investigative target, supplies the orchard setting where ledger proof is found, and shapes the ending's conceptual image ("Stillpoint of fact might hold"). The concept's physical properties (calm pocket, field that makes diamond glow) constrain protagonist tactics (must travel, must use detector) and enable the Ministry's logistical secret. Setup slight delay −0.2, two-beat development +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage (metaphor reprises literal discovery) +1.6, specificity +0.7 = indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is labeled early ("survival habit"), demonstrated twice with visible action (reading torn fibers to reassemble letters, reading land "for what it tries to hide"), and enables the investigative method that drives discovery. However, the trait itself does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff on the page—observation succeeds without error or blind-spot penalty. Early signal +0.5, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure support (trait frames final institutional gambit) +0.4, specificity +0.4 = functional but not indispensable; no cost lowers ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intuit" is invoked once at a pivotal beat ("intuit the boundary as if it were drawn in ink") and enables orchard entry, but the action itself could be replaced with "perceive," "sense," or "feel" without structural change. The intuition is prepared by prior pattern-reading (reassembled coordinates, debunker training), so it fits causally, yet the verb is not irreplaceable. One-beat involvement +0.4, causal linkage +0.8, closure support (intuition feeds ledger discovery) +0.6, swappability −0.6 = solid but replaceable with near-synonyms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled early (Salma brings them, protagonist promises to excavate truth), demonstrated on-page with tactile detail ("matched torn fibers," "sentences reappeared like bones"), supplies the coordinates and Stillpoint concept that drive all subsequent action, and is referenced at closure when findings are staged. The method is irreplaceable—no other mechanic would yield hidden text from Authority coat. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement (reassembly, staging) +0.9, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8 = indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is introduced at story midpoint, supplies the physical proof location (ledger in root cellar), demonstrates Stillpoint mechanics (grit circles but never falls), and provides workers who confirm the beacon versus curse distinction. The setting constrains protagonist movement (must cross storm belt) and charges the ending by literalizing the metaphor of hidden truth. Setup delay −0.3, two-beat involvement (entry, ledger discovery) +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage (Stillpoint concept reprises orchard discovery) +1.4, specificity +0.7 = essential to structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" frames the dystopian context and explains Ministry motive (cover for dissident relocation), but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The timeframe is static background rather than dynamic pressure. The journey is marked ("by day three") but elapsed time does not constrain choices or escalate cost. Setup present +0.4, causal linkage (explains Authority stakes) +0.6, swappability (any post-crisis frame would work) −0.5, no closure urgency −0.3 = functional context, not essential pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated early, dramatized through three on-page acts (reassembling letters, traveling to orchard, mailing ledger copies), and tested with visible cost at closure (Ministry seizure imminent). The motivation is concrete—grief for Salma, professional identity—and generates friction when truth-seeking risks exposure. Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage (final gambit is pure truth-distribution) +1.5, cost connection (accepts Ministry retaliation) +0.5 = drives the arc.</comment>
