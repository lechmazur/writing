<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior contradictions are present—signing consent as "a thin mask over a plan"—and the final choice to return alone demonstrates agency with cost. However, much interiority leans on elevated poetic phrasing ("auroral sorrow," "constellation of gestures") that occasionally distances embodied emotion. Dr. Sato's arc from scientist to co-mourner is sketched but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than enacted through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the shared trance deepens via the drug's effects. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—both characters choose to "hold the dream steady" despite alarms, then the narrator returns alone to sustain the shared memory, foreclosing solitary grief with visible cost. The orientation anchor (institute, garden, lagoon, two characters) lands early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator's drumming reveals his brother and Sato admits her motive, tightening stakes from treatment to mutual resurrection attempt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: reeds, basalt bench, gold algae that glows with sound. Spatial choreography is clear (glass doors, courtyard center, narrow rim). The lagoon constrains the climactic choice—perching on the rim, feet dangling, becomes the posture for the shared trance and the narrator's solo return. Sensory selection (cold fire in veins, breathing amplified, light moving across reeds) reflects urgency and anchors the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to breathe life into the narrator's brother through the entangled-memory experiment—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator's drumming becomes audible to Sato, forcing her to admit her own motive and raising the cost (neural overload alarms). The final choice to stay perched and "hold the dream steady" forecloses safety with visible cost (shaking, wet-eyed, data handed over). Agency is present in both the shared defiance and the solo return, though the reversals are modest in number for a piece of this density.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as shared witness rather than resurrection, and the ethics of using science for grief—emerges through action: the lagoon translates the children's voices as light, Sato cuts the feed, the narrator returns alone to sustain the ritual. The final image (drumming at the gate, perching beside the dimmed lagoon "not for an experiment now") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The story resists tidy closure; the children "did not ask for bodies, only for witnesses," reweighting the rebellion from literal revival to sustained presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close during the trance, wider during aftermath). However, diction frequently elevates beyond the narrator's plausible stress register: "auroral sorrow," "memories arrived not as scenes but as chords," "sorrow turned auroral, a curtain of color." These lyric reaches are consistent but border on committee voice, smoothing the narrator's panic into polished metaphor. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Sato's whispered objection and admission land naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but several patterns recur: repeated participial openers ("using taps and hums to steer," "leaving us shaking"), stacked modifiers in peak beats ("cold fire spread…the lagoon answered, brightening in rings"), and paraphrase loops ("the drug would let memories be stored like harmonics" / "our memories were now tied"). The metaphor density in the trance sequence (chords, constellation, auroral curtain) occasionally muddles rather than clarifies. Clarity holds at closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for template cadence and figurative excess in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-tech and sound-garden ritual feels specific and non-obvious; the auric lagoon and drumming-as-summoning avoid stock SFF tropes. The turn—Sato revealing she built the garden for her own daughter—reframes the experiment with earned irony. However, the "secretly rebellious test subject" and "scientist with hidden motive" frame remains familiar, and the emotional template (mutual mourning leading to shared catharsis) follows predictable beats. Risk is present in the lyric density and the quiet ending, though the piece hedges slightly by making both characters sympathetic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator as guinea pig is signaled early ("signed in ink and saline, wired with silver electrodes") and drives two key beats: the decision to reveal his brother via drumming, and the choice to stay perched despite alarms. The role enables the entanglement and constrains options (electrodes, drug effects). Present in the ending as the returning solo participant, reweighting the guinea-pig role from passive subject to active witness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears early (center courtyard, gold algae, glows with sound) and is handled across multiple beats: narrator perches on rim, lagoon brightens in rings during injection, shimmers with two lost faces, dims to "simple water" post-drug, then reappears in the solo return. It constrains the climactic choice (perching position, neural feedback via glow) and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: the conductive glow mechanism is intrinsic to the shared-memory visualization.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Entangled memories are introduced early ("the drug would let memories be stored like harmonics, entangled across two minds") and shape tactics throughout: the narrator tastes Sato's winter, drumming becomes shared signal, both faces appear in the lagoon. The concept enables the core reversal (Sato's hidden motive revealed through entanglement) and defines the resolution (sustained witness requires the shared link). Cost is legible: neural overload risk. Slightly abstract in execution but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is signaled early ("my consent was a thin mask over a plan") and enacted twice: the narrator drums to summon his brother against protocol, then returns alone despite institutional bounds. The trait enables the plot but remains somewhat label-dependent—rebellion is asserted more than it complicates choices with visible tradeoff. Present in ending (walking out with data, returning to gate), lending coherence but not driving a distinct cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Perch" appears early (Sato motions narrator to perch on lagoon rim) and recurs at every major turn: the injection beat, the shared trance, the alarm moment ("we stayed perched on the rim"), and the solo return ("perched beside the lagoon under starlight"). The posture is load-bearing—feet dangling above the conductive liquid enables the entanglement interface. Removing "perch" would require rewriting the mechanics and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drumming is introduced early ("I began drumming on everything, fingertips tapping bamboo rails, knuckles striking the basalt bench") and employed across three beats: hunting the chest-loosening frequency, matching Sato's buried funeral beat (making rebellion "audible"), and steering the shared trance ("I drummed softly…to hold the dream steady"). The method defines the communication channel (sound triggers lagoon glow, translates children's voices) and anchors the ending ritual. Mechanics matter: drumming rhythm = memory signal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established in the opening paragraph (courtyard of reeds, resonant stone, every step returns as music) and constrains choices: narrator hunts frequencies by striking materials, the garden "amplified our breathing," reeds translate vibrations into light movements. Present in the ending image (narrator drums on the gate, returns to garden alone). The garden's acoustic properties are load-bearing for the entanglement visualization, though its pressure is somewhat ambient rather than creating discrete tactical obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"At the hush of the universe inhaling" opens the story as a lyric timestamp but exerts no clear temporal pressure. The narrative unfolds in one extended scene with vague duration; the alarms signal overload but no running clock shapes tactics. The phrase reprises only obliquely in tone, not as a constraint. Present and atmospheric but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation ("to breathe life into a shared dream my brother and I had sketched before the accident erased him") is dramatized early and drives the drumming revelation, the choice to show Sato his brother, and the final solo return. Friction between want (literal resurrection) and cost (neural risk, the children's own preference for witness over bodies) generates the key turn. Stated clearly but also enacted through the trance sequence and ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is introduced mid-piece ("her sorrow turned auroral, a curtain of color") and recurs in the aftermath ("the auroral sorrow lingering like afterimage"). The tone charges the shared trance and final image, modulating from clinical setup to lyric grief. However, the phrase itself leans abstract and is applied more than embodied—sorrow is often labeled (shaking, wet-eyed) rather than texturally varied under pressure. Coherent and purposeful but not fully woven into moment-by-moment perception.</comment>
