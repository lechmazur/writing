<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jun's motivation—trading skills for a rare seed to brew "serenity within motion"—is concrete and evolves under pressure when Etsu's test forces her to witness decay rather than steal. Her olfactory sensitivity is embodied in the "sulfur and honey tang" and the "clean as crushed fern" thread during the bloom, showing perception under stress. The final shift from "ambition settle into service" is earned by the trial, though the phrasing edges toward abstraction. Minor slip: "tired of healing frantic bodies" tells rather than dramatizes the underlying frustration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story unfolds causally: Jun's request is denied, her sensitive nose leads her to the garden, Etsu's test reframes the seed's purpose, and her observation earns the gift with a condition that reconfigures her role from taker to contributor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts service over theft, and the condition (send back observations) forecloses the path of pure ambition with visible cost. The causal lens holds cleanly. One tightening—Etsu's bloom-watch condition—narrows options and the final act (wrapping the seed, drawing the spiral) lands the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is spatially coherent—spiral ladders, rope bridges, canopy gardens, compost shrine—and the olfactory layer (sulfur/honey, crushed fern) anchors Jun's POV. The corpse flower's stench and the moths' role in rot management constrain Etsu's choice to withhold the seed, and the mudflats below frame her return. Minor limitation: the "turning of the tide's thought" phrase recurs but remains ornamental; it does not shape a tactical choice or tighten the window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—obtaining the seed to brew serenity—is signaled early and tightened when the wardens refuse, then deepened when Etsu reveals the flower's ecological role and tests Jun's motive. The bloom scene is the escalation point: Jun must endure the reek and observe without stealing, and her discovery (moths follow decay, serenity is riding motion) changes her understanding. The conditional gift forecloses pure ambition and binds her to reciprocal service, a visible cost. One meaningful tightening (the test) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—wisdom as undercurrent, serenity within motion rather than absence of motion—emerges from Jun's journal habit, the village's rot-as-compass ecology, and her final realization during the bloom. The wrapping-paper custom and the spiral doodle that means "both stink and grace" are concrete anchors. The ending avoids overt moralizing; the act of wrapping the seed inward and drawing the spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "ambition settle into service" edges toward summary rather than remaining fully imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all perception through Jun's olfactory and observational bias. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "wildflower hush," "reek… like a wave of graves and ripe pears," "matching her inhale to the branch's swing." Etsu's speech ("wisdom… ran like an undercurrent, doing its work unseen") is slightly more aphoristic than Jun's narration, creating mild distinction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter in peak beats, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure (the bloom scene tightens, the descent relaxes). Purposeful compression ("journalize her days") fits the character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. The opening sentence ("At the turning of the tide's thought, when the sea wind paused as if listening to itself") is lyrical but does not clarify time or urgency, creating minor orientation friction. A few phrases edge toward overwriting: "olfactorily sensitive" is clinical, "corpse flower seed… to make a medicine that could teach the body serenity within motion" is abstract. The bloom scene is vivid and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and syntax varies purposefully across beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of treetop village, olfactory herbalist, corpse flower ecology, and wrapping-paper journaling is specific and non-generic. The turn—Jun earning the seed not by theft but by witnessing and committing to reciprocal documentation—feels earned in hindsight. The ecological role of the flower (summoning carrion moths to manage rot) is a fresh inflection on the "rare seed" trope. Minor limitation: the "serenity within motion" framing is conceptually familiar; the story elevates it through the sensory bloom scene and the spiral doodle, but the phrase itself trends abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jun's choices create key turns: she follows the scent map at dawn (middle beat), endures the bloom without stealing (climax beat), and accepts Etsu's conditional gift, which reconfigures her role. She appears in all three story phases and her agency drives the causal chain. The final act—wrapping the seed inward and drawing the spiral—embodies her shift from ambition to service. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is the object of Jun's quest (setup), the bloom test dramatizes its ecology and stench (middle beat), and Etsu's conditional gift binds the ending. It appears in at least three distinct beats and its unique properties (stench, carrion moths, rot management) are irreplaceable and shape the choice. The seed's wrapping and spiral doodle in the final image charge the closure. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept "undercurrent of wisdom" is verbalized by Etsu and by the narration ("the undercurrent of wisdom was not in grand sayings, but in small repeated motions"), and it reframes Jun's understanding during the bloom: serenity is not absence of motion but a way to ride it. It shapes her final acceptance of the conditional gift. Present in setup (family custom), middle (Etsu's lecture), and payoff (the spiral doodle). However, the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint; it changes Jun's stance but does not directly narrow her options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jun's olfactory sensitivity enables her to detect the "sulfur and honey tang" that leads her to the garden (middle beat) and to notice the "clean as crushed fern" thread during the bloom, which reveals the moths' compass role. It is signaled early ("a nose so olfactorily sensitive that even distant rain had a signature") and affects two key beats. The trait is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it for generic observation would weaken the causal chain. Present in setup, development, and payoff (she uses scent to map, endure, and interpret the bloom).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in setup (family custom, wrapping-paper doodles), middle (Jun doodles the map that leads her to the garden), climax (she "journalized every sensation in tight lines and soft doodles" during the bloom), and payoff (she wraps the seed and draws the spiral, and Etsu's condition is "send back paper pages of her observations"). The action drives at least three beats and is causally indispensable: without the journal-map, she does not reach the garden; without journalizing the bloom, she does not earn Etsu's trust. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping-paper interiors is signaled early ("their custom was to save the wrapping paper from parcels and doodle on its interior"), used in the middle beat (Jun "turned the pieces inside out, and doodled the wardens' faces… until the map in her lap showed a path"), and shapes the ending (she wraps the seed inward and draws the spiral, and Etsu's condition requires paper pages). The method is specific and enables two key beats. Swapping it for a generic notebook would lose the "inside-out" motif that mirrors the theme of hidden wisdom.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Larkroot is introduced early ("the treetop village… hovered in its nets of rope and living branches"), and its spatial features—spiral ladders, rope bridges, canopy gardens, compost shrine—constrain Jun's access and tactics. The village's ecology (corpse flower summons moths to prevent rot) is the reason the seed is withheld, and the bloom occurs in the forbidden garden. The setting is causally active in at least three beats and the final descent image ("the village swaying above her and the sea moving below") charges the closure. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" appears in the opening and recurs when Etsu tells Jun to stand watch "at the turning of the tide's thought when the petals would open." It frames the bloom event and ties the village calendar to "moon and tide." However, it does not create a live countdown or tighten Jun's tactical window; the bloom happens when scheduled, and no urgency is dramatized. Present in setup and climax, but pressure is conceptual rather than temporal. Lyric resonance is present, but the timeframe does not constrain choices mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jun's motivation—"tired of healing frantic bodies and wanted to brew a quiet that could travel"—is signaled early and tested in the bloom scene, where she must endure the reek and match her breath to the branch's swing. The goal is dramatized rather than told-only, and the friction between her initial ambition (steal the seed) and the cost (witness, commit to service) is visible. The final shift ("ambition settle into service") embodies the transformation. Present in setup, tested in climax, and resolved in payoff with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "wildflower hush" is established in the opening ("every leaf held a wildflower hush") and recurs in the final line ("felt, in that wildflower hush, her ambition settle into service"). The quiet, observational register is maintained across the climb, the refusal, the bloom, and the descent. The tone modulates subtly—tightening during the stench, easing in the final descent—but remains coherent. It charges the final image by returning with reweighted meaning (hush now encompasses both the village calm and Jun's internal shift). Lyric reprise with purposeful closure linkage, but mid-story pressure is carried more by event than tonal shift.</comment>
