<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to unravel Varga's code is clear and drives her through the space, but her interiority remains abstract—"inspired by silence itself" and belief in the ghost never crystallize into embodied contradiction or concrete stakes that test her commitment. The piece shows micro-choices (tapping wood, holding still) that reveal method but not hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression is muted; no visible cost forecloses a path, and the final gathering of musicians feels convenient rather than earned by prior struggle or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (water-stain images accumulate into a map-following ritual). Orientation is prompt but complete by the opening beat. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (musicians gather to play Varga's hidden arrangement), yet cost remains implied rather than legible—no on-page sentence shows what Lena forfeits or what the collective performance precludes. The linked moves (program → gaps → ledger → musicians) cohere under the lens, but the ending summarizes arrival rather than dramatizing a decisive pressure point or reweighted image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded pit, velvet seats, drowned music stands, and swollen rehearsal door are vivid and filter through Lena's musician's attention. The lanterns, water, and in-between spaces constrain her path and charge multiple beats (pit, bass drum gap, balcony stairwell, rehearsal room). The oilcloth-wrapped ledger and the fermata-beside-keyhole image tie setting detail directly to plot turns. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the environment enables Varga's hidden arrangement concept at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unravel Varga's code to understand how the ruined house can sing. Pressure accumulates through the program's water-stain maps, each marking a new in-between space, and deepens when the ledger reveals the dispersed-instrument plan. However, the escalation is lateral (moving from mark to mark) rather than tightening options or raising cost; no reversal tests Lena's commitment, and the final gathering occurs off-page ("other displaced musicians came quietly") without dramatized friction or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present but cost legibility at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—performance persisting through ruin, music in gaps—emerges from concrete moves (tapping wood, drops on paper, instruments in corridors) rather than statement. The ledger's dispersed arrangement and Lena's wordless guidance of musicians offer a resonant answer to "how does a flooded house sing," and the final image (antique program facing rising light, lanterns in aisles) reweights the opening hush. No overt moralizing. The theme resists easy closure but remains legible, and the particulars (water damage, unstruck chords, in-between spaces) cohere without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Lena's musician attention (lantern light "fluttered like a nervous bow stroke," set pieces "leaned like wrecked ships"). Perceptual signature is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Diction occasionally elevates ("in between space," "ghost of Maestro Varga") but remains voice-motivated and legible. The piece carries purposeful compression (ellipsis between moves, the final gathering told briefly) that fits the Accumulative lens and does not obscure causality. No dialogue appears; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the wandering, discovery-driven movement. Clarity is generally strong, though the opening sentence's metaphor ("river into its ribs") and later figurative density ("false applause," "as if water damage were developing photographs") occasionally layer without advancing pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She followed… she felt… she did not draw… she tapped") and paraphrase loops (program unfolded/dampened/opened again across three beats) flatten momentum. Information density is high in the ledger-reveal beat; the final paragraph compresses the musicians' arrival efficiently but summarizes rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The water-damage-as-code mechanism and Varga's dispersed-instrument arrangement offer a fresh synthesis of ghost story, musician's craft, and architectural ruin. The in-between-spaces motif is purposeful and specific to opera-house geography. The piece avoids template ghost-hunt beats by replacing confrontation with wordless ritual exchange (taps, breath, bowing to the empty room). Emotional truth—mourning through recovery of method—grounds the fantastical elements. Risk-taking in the quiet, process-driven arc and the lyric compression heighten stakes without gimmickry; the ending's communal gathering feels earned in hindsight though lightly sketched on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (pit violinist) is present throughout, drives every beat (unfolds program, follows maps, taps wood, opens ledger, arranges lanterns, guides musicians), and her choices create all key turns. Her occupation shapes perception (bow-stroke simile, first-position gesture, music-rack placement) and enables the dispersed-instrument plan at closure. The final gathering depends on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Antique opera program appears in the opening exposition (stagehand's gift), is unfolded and dampened three times (pit rim, bass drum gap, rehearsal door), reveals stained maps and music, and sits on the music rack in the final image facing rising light. Its evolving use (code → map → melody → keyhole) structures the entire search and charges the closure. Removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>In-between spaces (gaps between doors, under stairwells, slit behind bass drum, balcony stairwell, corridors) are named in the opening, mapped by the program's stains, visited in sequence as Lena's path, and form the tactical premise of Varga's arrangement (instruments placed "not onstage but in corridors and stairwells"). The concept constrains every middle beat and defines the closure plan.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired by silence itself" is stated early and motivates Lena's return, but the inspiration remains a label rather than a trait that visibly constrains or enables action under pressure. The hush drives atmospheric texture but does not create a trade-off or cost that another trait would not supply. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is named twice: "disrupt the fear that kept everyone away" (mid-story) and "disrupt the old notion of performance" (near end). The second instance frames the ledger's dispersed-instrument plan and Lena's lantern arrangement, but the action itself is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows fear giving way or a performance convention breaking. Present and thematically coherent but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled early ("let a drop fall… ink swelled into pale shapes"), used three times (pit rim → maps, next page → broken measures, final page → keyhole), and its mechanics matter at every turn (drops must land, stains develop, images guide). The method structures the entire search and enables the code-unraveling premise. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns anchors every beat, supplies the water for the damage-images method, creates the in-between pressure (drowned pit, collapsed stair, swollen door), and returns at closure when Lena arranges lanterns in aisles. The flood justifies Varga's dispersed plan and the ruin charges the theme. Environment and light constrain choices throughout and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" is the timeframe label, present in the opening and closing lines, but the hush functions as atmosphere rather than a ticking clock. No urgency compresses decisions; Lena moves at her own pace with no rival claim or decay forcing acceleration. Present and tonally coherent but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to unravel the code left by a ghost" is stated early (stagehand's whisper), drives Lena's return and every map-following beat, and culminates in the ledger discovery. Friction is light—no cost or competing want tests her commitment—but the desire is dramatized through repeated action (unfold, dampen, wait, move) rather than summary. The wordless exchange with Varga (taps, breath, bow to empty room) adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone "wordless conversation" is signaled early ("answering whatever the dead could say through damp paper and music she did not dare play"), sustained through silent exchanges (taps, droplets, held fermata, bow to empty room), and charges the closure ("guided them without speech… they finally played, answering Varga"). The tone modulates with pressure (anticipation, stillness, collaborative hush) and integrates with method and theme. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
