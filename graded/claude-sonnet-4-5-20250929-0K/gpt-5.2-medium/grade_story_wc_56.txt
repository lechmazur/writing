<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—understanding deceptive architecture—is consistent and embodied through concrete choices: salvaging evidence, checking the sundial against logs, broadcasting the tape. Her internal experience ("serene upheaval") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the ending choice to expose the myth carries visible cost (stripping comfort from the canal folk). Minor weakness: the bargeman's late confession feels slightly convenient, and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("architecture of lies") rather than sharply embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Mara discovers the taped order → realizes the silence was engineered → broadcasts the evidence → the community begins to reconsider its faith. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the canal "began…to talk in its own voice") with conceptual cost visible in the community's slow turning and Mara's knowledge that she has "salvaged choice." One tightening (the tape discovery narrows her options from investigation to action) is sufficient for this length; the inferred lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The barge canal setting is vivid and purposeful: the half-sunk barge supplies the key evidence, the floating relay shack provides the mechanism for broadcast, and the stilted warehouses and black water establish atmospheric pressure. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's forensic method (comparing shadow to tide chart) and charging the final image when she uses it to watch "a single shadow moved across fixed marks." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's investigative priorities. The setting directly shapes the climactic choice and the ending's conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the engineered myth versus preserving communal comfort—is signaled early and tightens through discovery (tape/notebook), decision (splice and broadcast), and consequence (the slow turning). Mara's agency drives escalation: her training and forensic instinct enable the salvage, her choice to broadcast forecloses the option of private knowledge, and the visible cost is the community's loss of faith-as-comfort. The bargeman's confession deepens the moral calculus. One meaningful pressure point (broadcast) narrows options with felt cost, meeting the length requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the engineered silence, the Flood Saint legend, the sundial's shifting shadow as metaphor for truth versus fixed lies. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"the canal…began…to talk in its own voice"—without moralizing, and the sundial's return reweights prior material (lies as architecture, truth as shifting light). Mara's internal arc (from seeker to liberator) is inseparable from the thematic question. Minor slip: "architecture of lies" and "beams and bolts of deception" trend slightly abstract in mid-passage, though the surrounding investigation grounds them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, maintaining Mara's perceptual lens with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("shadows always confess after the fact," "serene upheaval ran through her as gently as current") that modulates under pressure. The prose remains within Mara's investigative idiom, though some constructions—"trained her instincts the way divers trained their lungs"—feel slightly elevated for peak action moments. No dialogue on the page; the bargeman's admission is reported rather than dramatized, which limits voice contrast but preserves focalization. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, with most lines advancing investigation or stakes. However, several constructions loop conceptually: "architecture of lies" / "beams and bolts of the deception" / "scaffolding behind their own prayers" recycle the structural metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in paired noun phrases: "serene in posture yet carrying upheaval," "objects pulled from muck…fingerprints of the stories." The final third avoids these patterns and propels cleanly to closure. Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective beats ("began to understand," "began to salvage") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—state-engineered silence to manufacture legend—offers a fresh angle on propaganda and communal myth-making. The pocket sundial as forensic tool (shadow-length dating) is specific and non-obvious. The emotional calculus (exposing truth strips comfort) resists simple moralizing. Risk-taking in the lyric, compressed style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "errant legend seeker" frame and the salvage-as-investigation arc follow recognizable investigator-uncovers-conspiracy beats, though the execution particularizes them through the canal setting and the sundial's recurring metaphoric charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara ("errant legend seeker") drives all major turns: she chooses to investigate the wreck, interprets the tape and notebook, decides to broadcast, and faces the cost of stripping communal comfort. Present in setup (opening lines), middle (salvage and analysis), and ending (broadcast consequence and bargeman conversation). Her choices alter tactics twice (from observation to salvage, salvage to broadcast) and the closure hinges on her decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pocket sundial appears in three beats: Mara receives it with her mentor's advice (setup via backstory), uses it on the barge deck to date the taped order by shadow-length (middle causal work), and employs it again on the far bank to observe "a single shadow moved across fixed marks" (ending reprise that reweights the truth-versus-lies theme). Each use is concrete and on-page. However, the closing use is more thematic echo than causal constraint; it charges the final image but does not foreclose options or impose cost at that moment. Strong lyric integration but not indispensable to plot closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hindsight clarity" shapes stakes and tactics throughout: Mara's forensic method relies on post-hoc reconstruction (sundial dating, tide-chart comparison); the text states "Only in hindsight clarity did the pattern sharpen"; and the ending envisions the community looking back "with hindsight clarity and revise its own story." The concept drives her investigative approach and reappears in the closure image with conceptual cost (the community must now re-evaluate its past). Not merely thematic; it alters how Mara engages evidence and frames the resolution's reconfiguration of communal narrative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears twice: the notebook instruction is in "thoughtfully clear script," and Mara speaks after the broadcast "in a voice kept thoughtfully clear." The trait contrasts with engineered ambiguity (the state's silence) and signals Mara's moral stance. However, its causal role is modest: clarity enables the broadcast's persuasive impact but does not constrain prior choices or impose visible cost. Present in setup (notebook discovery) and payoff (broadcast), but middle development is thin. Functional accent rather than weight-bearing element.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Salvage" is the engine of the plot: Mara salvages the tape and notebook from the wreck (inciting discovery), salvages the truth by broadcasting it (climactic action), and the text closes with "she had salvaged more than evidence, she had salvaged choice" (thematic closure). Present in setup (barge investigation), middle (locker discovery), and ending (broadcast and its consequence). The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse both the investigation and the moral resolution. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is signaled early ("Mara had trained her instincts the way divers trained their lungs, listening for small mismatches") and enables the relay-shack infiltration ("by training instincts that told her which guard would nap and which lock would stick"). The method shapes one key choice (slipping inside to broadcast) but does not constrain earlier beats or appear in the ending. Present in setup and middle; modest causal work. Functional but not indispensable; the broadcast could occur via other means with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "twilight barge canal" is present throughout: establishes mood and stakes in the opening, supplies the wreck (evidence source), provides the floating relay shack (broadcast mechanism), and houses the community whose response constitutes the closure. The setting constrains Mara's tactics (she must motor to the shack, navigate the canal) and charges the final image ("the canal behind her began…to talk in its own voice"). Strong causal and closure linkage; the canal is both physical site and metaphoric actor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" frames the story's premise and timeline: the opening notes the silence, Mara discovers it was engineered ("CUT THE DAWN BULLETIN"), and she breaks it "At first light, when the city expected another blank hiss." The timeframe tightens decisions (she acts before the next scheduled silence) and the broadcast's timing is causally necessary (filling the expected slot). Present in setup, middle discovery, and climactic action. Strong integration, though the passage of hours within the investigation is compressed and not tracked beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to understand the architecture of lies" is dramatized throughout: she came to the canal because "every tale she chased had been used to move people like cargo," salvages evidence "not for profit but for proof," and the discovery that "the lie was built like a bridge, plank by plank" intensifies her resolve. The motivation drives her choices (investigate, date the tape, broadcast) and creates friction at closure (exposing the mechanism strips comfort from the canal folk, a visible cost). Present in setup, middle, and ending with consistent pressure and moral complexity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is established in the opening ("serene in posture yet carrying upheaval in her chest") and recurs at the climax ("Serene upheaval ran through her as gently as current"). The tone modulates under pressure: calm investigative focus coexists with moral vertigo, and the ending sustains the paradox (quiet broadcast, slow communal turning, Mara's calm departure). The oxymoron charges the final image and reflects the story's thematic tension (truth as both liberation and loss). Coherent through turns; strong tonal signature that supports closure.</comment>
