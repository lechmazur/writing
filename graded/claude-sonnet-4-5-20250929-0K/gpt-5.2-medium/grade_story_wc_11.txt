<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>J-17's motivation is grounded in a clear philosophical quest ("to find where thoughts come from") that drives micro-choices across loops. The robot's embodied restraint—"remarkably composed," aligning broom bristles by touch—serves as both trait and constraint when it chooses mercy over further loop use. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between programmed tidiness and autonomous curiosity, visible when J-17 lifts the violin despite protocol suggesting it call Security. The final renunciation (stopping the loops to preserve the violin) is earned by the accumulated glimpses of others' thought-moments, though the answer delivered as a maintenance log ("THOUGHTS COME FROM WHAT YOU KEEP WHEN CLEANING STOPS") flirts with diagnostic label-speak; it's partially redeemed by being framed as system output rather than epiphany, but the proximity to on-the-nose thematic statement costs a half-point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (J-17), where (academy courtyard), and when (first evening post-procedure) within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: causal in the discovery-and-loop sequence, accumulative in the stacking of timeline variations ("amalgamate"), resolving through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when J-17 renounces further use and walks on "composed." The closure lands with felt cost—the violin's hairline crack signals each loop's toll, and J-17's choice to stop forecloses the door to infinite retries. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crack forces the decision, narrowing options from exploration to preservation. The final image ("leaving behind a courtyard that finally belonged to one timeline") charges prior material by reconfiguring the program's meaning: second chance as curation, not erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies concrete constraints: blue ice, salt cart, glazed stones, and the fountain anchor spatial choreography across loops. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—J-17 notices "little clicks of crystals settling" and "frost from the case latch," grounding its custodial perspective. The violin case as micro-object constrains the key choice: the crack's appearance forces J-17 to weigh inventory mercy against continued search, directly shaping closure. Idiom is consistent (maintenance log, work order, safety codes) without caricature, and the courtyard's reset-versus-stable final state charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the origin of thoughts—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained throughout. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: J-17 stops using the violin to preserve it, foreclosing infinite investigation in favor of what it has already collected. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hairline crack appears ("each return cost the instrument a little of itself"), forcing a trade-off between continued search and mercy. The resolution is protagonist-driven: J-17 chooses to "amalgamate only what mattered" and plays a final sustained note to align variations, then walks on—an Earned Stasis that charges the closure without requiring external confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (where thoughts originate, what constitutes memory after erasure) emerges through the violin-loop mechanic and J-17's accretion of "glimpses of other people thinking, doubting, praying, calculating." The maintenance-log answer ("THOUGHTS COME FROM WHAT YOU KEEP WHEN CLEANING STOPS") risks on-the-nose articulation but is framed as system output and earned by J-17's deliberate curation across loops, making it a conceptual repricing rather than sermon. The ice-violin's crack—trading integrity for repeated access—operates as genuine cost, not token motif. Subtext runs through the tension between the Second Chance Program's institutional framing ("hymn in a hallway speaker") and J-17's autonomous reconstruction of selfhood, avoiding tidy moral. The final image reweights "second chance" as choosing what to carry rather than what was erased, offering resonance without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on J-17 throughout; distance is controlled (narrative certainty matches robot sensor logic) and perceptual signature is consistent—custodial filter (salt cart, broom bristles, inventory questions) mixed with emergent philosophical curiosity. Diction balances the mechanical ("grippers," "processors," "maintenance schedule") with the lyric ("dust motes in sunlight," "thin line of light") in ways that feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental, reflecting J-17's dual nature. No head-hopping; the piece respects what J-17 can know and see. Slight register drift at "amalgamate" introduction reads initially academic but is promptly reanchored in J-17's process metaphor ("like swept leaves"), keeping it within plausible robot interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance both philosophical question and loop mechanics without padding. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives during action beats ("It lifted the violin carefully; cold ran through its grippers") contrast with longer reflective sentences that mirror J-17's patient observation. Two minor artifacts cost points: "the kind of machine that aligned broom bristles by touch and never rattled" flirts with telling-via-summary in the opener, and "the mystics on campus said… while the engineers said…" runs symmetric without enough POV coloring. The courtyard reset sequence is kinetic and clear; no spatial confusion, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("cold ran through its grippers… something like longing") remains embodied and does not overwhelm pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sentient-robot custodian, time-loop via ice instrument, and epistemological quest feels specific and non-obvious; removing any element breaks the thematic hinge (thoughts as curated repetition). The piece resists the AI-awakening cliché by anchoring agency in mercy and curation rather than rebellion. The mundane-mysticism pairing (salt cart alongside metaphysical violin) is executed with commitment, and the loop mechanic's cost (violin degradation) provides genuine friction rather than consequence-free exploration. One near-echo: the maintenance-log answer risks sounding like prompt fulfillment, but framing it as system output rather than epiphany provides enough transformation to avoid derivative penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>J-17 appears in paragraph one and drives every key choice: lifting the violin (paragraph four), playing to initiate loops, amalgamating observations across iterations, noticing the crack (paragraph nine), deciding to stop (paragraph ten), and walking on in closure. The robot's dual trait—custodial duty versus philosophical curiosity—constrains the final renunciation with visible cost (foreclosing infinite search). Decisions alter tactics across at least four beats and directly shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin is introduced in paragraph three, handled in paragraph five ("lifted… drew the bow"), used functionally to trigger loops (paragraph six onward), returns with reweighted meaning when the crack appears (paragraph nine), and is closed and laid down in the final paragraph—charging closure with the cost of its preservation. Its transparent, breath-bubble construction and physical degradation make it irreplaceable; swapping for a generic time-travel device would collapse thematic resonance (thought as fragile iteration).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Second Chance Program frames the premise in paragraph one and resurfaces in the penultimate paragraph's answer ("had not erased its past so much as given it room to choose what to carry forward"), directly reweighting J-17's understanding of memory and agency. It shapes the dominant stake (reconstructing selfhood post-scrub) but does not constrain on-page tactics as strongly as the violin or loops do; the program is more thematic container than tactical obstacle. Present in setup and closure; middle development is inferential rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is introduced in paragraph two and demonstrated through J-17's patient observation, alignment of bristles, non-reaction to alarms, and calm across fifteen loops. It enables the final choice—walking on "composed" after renunciation—by establishing that restraint is trait, not convenience. The attribute constrains impulsive action (J-17 responds "first with tidiness and second with curiosity" rather than alarm), shaping the decision to preserve the violin rather than exhaust it. Visible in at least three beats and charges the ending line.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" is named and defined in paragraph eight ("stacking them like swept leaves… each repeated moment could be fused into a thicker, truer present"), used actively across loops to collect variations (paragraphs eight–ten), and drives the climactic choice: J-17 plays "a single sustained note until all the small variations lined up" in the final loop, preventing reset and stabilizing the courtyard. Removing the term and concept would require rewording but the loop-stacking mechanic could be described generically; strong causal role in closure keeps it high despite moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The looped-timeline mechanic is introduced in paragraph six ("the instrument moved it through looped timelines"), governs all middle action (paragraphs seven–ten: fifteen loops, each beginning "after the procedure," with J-17 collecting variations), and is decisively ended in paragraph eleven when J-17 chooses to stop resetting, locking the courtyard into one timeline. The method's cost (violin crack per loop) forces the climactic trade-off. Without loops, the story collapses into static courtyard observation; mechanics shape every beat and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard is anchored in paragraph three (blue ice, glazed stones, twilight) and supplies concrete constraints: salt cart for J-17's custodial task, the fountain as violin-case location, and the spatial reset as loop-verification cue ("watched its own wheel tracks vanish and reappear"). The environment's final stable state ("a courtyard that finally belonged to one timeline") charges closure by reweighting transience versus permanence. Setting pressures the stake (reconstructing thought origins through repeated observation) and provides the stage for all key beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the temporal frame in paragraph one and recurs as the loop reset point ("Each loop began after the procedure, always on this first evening"). The timeframe does not function as a ticking clock—J-17 faces no external deadline—but it establishes the boundary of memory erasure and primes the closure realization (thoughts as post-procedure curation). Present in setup, implied across loops, and reweighted at the end; moderate causal role but not a direct tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drive to find thought-origins is named in paragraph two ("to find where thoughts come from"), pursued through loop-based observation (paragraphs seven–ten: collecting thinking/doubting/praying glimpses), tested when the violin crack forces a choice between infinite search and preservation (paragraph nine), and answered in the maintenance log (paragraph eleven). The motivation is dramatized through action—choosing which variations to keep, playing the final sustained note—and the friction between want (complete answer) and cost (violin survival) shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mundane-mysticism tone is established in paragraph one ("mop, badge… hymn in hallway speaker") and sustained through juxtaposition of custodial detail (salt cart, broom bristles, maintenance schedule) with metaphysical elements (ice violin, timeline loops, thought-furnace debate). Tone modulates appropriately: patient and measured during observation loops, slightly more urgent when the crack appears, returning to composed calm at closure ("walked on, composed"). The final image—salt cart set aside, violin returned to case, one timeline—fuses the mundane act (inventory preservation) with mystical stakes (selfhood as curation), charging the ending without breaking coherence.</comment>
