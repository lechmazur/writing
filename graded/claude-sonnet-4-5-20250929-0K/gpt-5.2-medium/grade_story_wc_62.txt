<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jonas's motivation to understand collective grief is clear and drives his choices—tracing stones, tying ribbons, hosting the final dinner. The spirit mentor offers guidance without undermining agency, and the final act (placing the communal stone) feels earned. However, interiority leans abstract ("fiercely meditative" recurs as a label) and the spectral encounter lacks embodied fear or resistance that would sharpen internal contradiction. The siblings at dinner remain undifferentiated voices, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Jonas gathers observations, ties ribbons, and layers poem fragments toward a communal memorial. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The closure—placing the finished stone at dawn as the spirit releases—reconfigures private mourning into shared form with visible cost (the spirit "let go," Jonas's question answered). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spirit teaches him to read clusters and braid losses. The cost is felt but somewhat diffuse; pointing to "the spirit let go" as the exact cost moment keeps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered (sweating panes, vines swallowing benches, rain drumming) and functions as both workshop and liminal meeting place. Butterflies settle on ribbons, their weight making fabric tremble—a tactile detail that charges the migration timeframe. The potting table anchors repeated ribbon work. Setting constrains choice (greenhouse as the only place "where echoes felt willing to answer") and the final placement at the cemetery gate completes spatial logic. Spatial choreography across cemetery and greenhouse remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure accumulates through retracing stones, spirit mentorship, and the family dinner, then tightens when Jonas carves interlocking arcs and sees "every family had repeated the same three pauses." The dinner braids private losses into one chord, and the final stone placement reweights the question with visible cost (spectral release, butterflies lifting). Agency is clear: Jonas initiates, the spirit guides, and the communal tablet emerges from his synthesis. One meaningful deepening—identifying shared pauses—narrows options and alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: ribbons as grief markers, poem lines as measured sorrow, interlocking arcs mapping shared pauses. The final stone answers "what is the shape of collective grief" without stating a thesis—arcs become "a map of shared pauses," and the spectral breath turns "private mourning into one chord." The piece resists tidy resolution; the spirit's departure feels elegiac rather than triumphant. Recurring motifs (ribbons, poems, butterflies, pauses) constrain choice and charge closure. Minor slip: "fiercely meditative" and "thundering calm" edge toward ornamental repetition without always deepening meaning on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering greenhouse visits and stone tracings through Jonas's perspective. Diction ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") establishes a contemplative register consistent with a craftsman-philosopher. The spectral encounter avoids horror tropes, maintaining tonal coherence. However, voice flattens under pressure: Jonas "centered his breathing" reads generic, and the siblings' dinner dialogue is absent—they "traded favorite poems" in summary rather than distinct speech. Perceptual signature (limestone dust, chisel hesitations) is present but could sharpen under emotional load. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the spirit encounter, longer reflection on family dinners), and imagery is often precise ("orange wings drifted over the glass like embers"). Information density is high in middle beats—ribbons, rubbings, poem fragments layer quickly. However, several lines loop conceptually: "fiercely meditative" appears three times, "thundering calm" twice, both as decorative markers rather than evolving constructs. "The spirit taught him to read the cemetery like a field" and "guiding his hand to tie the matching ribbon" edge toward summary where dramatization would tighten. Pronoun clarity and spatial choreography hold; no grammar breaks. Metaphor ("butterflies...like embers," "weight made the fabric tremble") stays coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone carver meets spectral mentor to map collective grief through ribbons, poems, and butterfly migration—feels specific and non-obvious. The interlocking-arcs memorial and the notion of "three pauses where grief joins" offer fresh angles on mourning and craft. The greenhouse-as-liminal-workshop and family poem custom ground the premise in lived detail. Risk-taking (spectral mentorship without horror, accumulative structure, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: the spirit figure and ribbon-tying ritual echo workshop-prompt templates, but transformation through carver's lens and communal tablet elevates execution above derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jonas initiates retracing, ties ribbons, hosts the dinner, carves the tablet, and places the stone—each action advances the arc. His choices (which stones to study, inviting siblings, accepting spectral guidance) create key turns. Present across all three gates (setup, development, closure). Causal pressure is clear: without Jonas's agency, no communal memorial emerges. Cost is visible (time, inheritance of father's grief, spectral release). Character is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears in setup (brought from mother's basket), development (tied around studied stones, laid on potting table, used to record poem lines), and closure (siblings choose colors, tie to tablet). Handling is concrete and evolves: first as marker, then as poem carrier, finally as communal braid. The butterflies' weight on ribbons creates a charged image. Removing the ribbon would break the poem-grief linkage and the sibling ritual. Strong integration across beats and closure; irreplaceable in current form.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes stakes: the spirit teaches Jonas to read cemetery clusters, guides ribbon placement, presses his wrist at pause points, and validates the communal approach. It appears in middle beats and closure ("seemed to breathe through them all"). The concept enables Jonas's breakthrough—seeing shared pauses—and charges the ending (spirit "let go" as cost). However, mentorship mechanics are summary-driven ("The spirit taught him," "guiding his hand") rather than dramatized exchange. With sharper on-page instruction beats, would reach higher band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" recurs three times but functions mostly as label. It enables one on-page action: "Jonas did not run; he centered his breathing, fiercely meditative" when encountering the spirit. The trait signals his contemplative method but rarely constrains choice with visible cost—he could be "patient" or "focused" with minor edits. Present in setup and linked to carving metaphor ("carving air"), but lacks middle-beat friction or closure linkage that would demonstrate irreplaceability. Trends mid-band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Retracing is the motor: Jonas retraces old headstones to follow hesitations, takes rubbings, compares them in the greenhouse, and discovers the three shared pauses—the story's conceptual hinge. The action appears in setup, drives middle investigation, and grounds the closure tablet's interlocking arcs. Removing retrace would collapse Jonas's methodology and the communal insight. Specific mechanics (chisel marks softened, strongest grooves) make the action irreplaceable. Essential across beats and ending; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The family poem custom is signaled in backstory (setup), motivates Jonas writing lines on ribbon scraps (development link), and structures the greenhouse dinner where siblings trade poems and tie ribbons to the tablet (closure payoff). All three gates present. However, the dinner itself is summarized ("traded favorite poems as they always had") without on-page recitation or sibling voice distinction, weakening dramatization. The custom enables the communal ritual but could be replaced by another family tradition with moderate edits. Lyric reprise reweights stake; mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse anchors every evening visit, supplies the potting table for ribbon work, hosts the spectral encounter, and frames the final dinner. Its liminal quality ("only place...where echoes felt willing to answer") constrains Jonas's ritual location. Sensory detail (sweating panes, rain drumming, vines swallowing benches) is vivid and purposeful. Setting appears in setup, shapes middle beats (retracing and mentorship occur there or nearby), and houses closure dinner. Removing greenhouse would require wholesale spatial redesign. Essential to atmosphere and tactics; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Butterfly migration brackets the action: Jonas comes "each evening across the butterfly migration," butterflies settle on ribbons (charging mid-beats), thicker waves mark climax, migration thins at the final dinner, and "butterflies lifted" at dawn closure. The timeframe is poetic rather than a ticking clock—it does not tighten decisions so much as provide seasonal rhythm and a visual motif (orange wings as embers). Present across all gates and linked to closure image, but lacks urgency that would force tactical shifts. Lyric integration is strong; causal pressure is lighter than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Discovering the shape of collective grief is the explicit question ("throbbed in him like calm thunder"), drives every choice—retracing, ribbon tying, seeking spectral guidance, hosting the dinner—and is answered in the closure tablet's interlocking arcs and "map of shared pauses." Desire is dramatized through investigation beats and conflicted in Jonas's inheritance of father's death (grief becomes heavier, measured in meter and breath). Cost is visible: time, spectral bargain, sibling ritual. The motivation is indispensable to plot and theme; removing it collapses the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" recurs as phrase and concept: distant thunder without fear, rain drumming steady enough to think by, family dinners when storms pushed everyone close. Tone modulates subtly—contemplative in greenhouse beats, quietly communal at dinner, elegiac at dawn release. The oxymoron charges the final image: "thundering calm of understanding as butterflies lifted and the spirit let go." Coherent through turns and integral to closure resonance. However, the phrase appears twice as direct repetition rather than evolving construct, limiting top-band entry. Strong thematic and atmospheric fit; minor execution slip prevents higher score.</comment>
