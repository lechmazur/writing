<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's sensory-mapping profession shapes perception consistently ("my palms already reading the grit and oil like braille," "my tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere"), and the guilt over Jalen creates coherent internal pressure. The final choice to amend the log is motivated by accumulated cost ("the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled"), though the brother's sudden fury and wire-bound state arrive without prior dramatization of his imprisonment's cause. Interiority remains specific to the trade and the guilt, with embodied sensory detail anchoring emotional states throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (abandoned repair bay, sensory mapper, green shard, brother's disappearance). The causal chain—shard creates seam, seam enables weaving, weaving reaches Jalen, narrator corrects the lie—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when the beacon reveals Jalen's location. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the withheld truth is shared via the log entry, and the narrator feels both relief and the weight settling. The "older, alive, and furious" reveal of Jalen risks convenience (how did he survive, why bound by the bay itself?) but the correction of the record provides a Decisive Change that reweights the lie's consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair bay's "broken conduits and unfinished hull plates" and coolant smear guide sensory mapping choices, and the shard functions as both prop and constraint (clamp, prism, seam-opener). Spatial choreography remains clear across parallel-universe shifts, with each Dock Seven variant offering distinct atmospheric detail (fresh coolant, open hatch, intact terminal). The green shard charges the final image by enabling the log amendment, satisfying the 9+ gate, but occupational detail (sensory mapping kit: chalk, microphone) decorates more than it constrains mid-scene choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering and correcting the withheld truth about Jalen—is signaled early and tightens when the beacon clicks with his call sign. The narrator's agency drives escalation: using the shard to redirect the seam, stepping through universes, and amending the log. Visible cost appears on-page ("the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled"), and the correction forecloses the lie-protected path. The bound-Jalen confrontation compresses motive into a single speech, reducing earned friction, but the stakes remain coherent under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of truth's weight emerges through the shard (warm as stolen heat), the beacon (steady tapping that "gave the lie a mass"), and the final shared burden without explicit moralizing. Jalen's line "the truth has weight because it anchors worlds" risks thematic echo but remains dramatized through his bound state and the narrator's corrective action. The ending offers a resonant image (quiet after the jump, log entry, truth settling) that reweights the opening's "withheld truth, the kind that presses on the ribs." The recurring "weight" motif accumulates pressure and charges closure without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable in first-person with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping ("tongue could taste which choices had been taken elsewhere," "breathing, letting the sweet chemical bite define corridors"). Jalen's single speech ("you cut my anchor when you told them I was nowhere") carries goal-driven accusation, though brief. Diction stays consistent and profession-specific, and the psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the rhythmic control through longer sentences matches the narrator's deliberate, sensory-focused attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing setting, character, or pressure ("Its green edge caught the bay lights and redirected them into a thin line across the far wall, and in that line I heard, faintly, my mother's voice saying, You promised"). Several long sentences risk opacity ("Every cycle of my life had been like this, calm days punctured by leaps that were cyclically spontaneous, arriving on a rhythm I could sense but never schedule") but remain syntactically clear. Minor paraphrase loop: "the withheld truth" appears three times in similar framing without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, and the final beat lands cleanly with concise action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sensory-mapper-as-parallel-universe-weaver synthesis is specific and non-obvious, grounding the speculative mechanic in occupational skill (chalk for temperature, microphone for silence, shard as prism). The guilt-driven correction of a scapegoat lie adds moral complexity beyond standard portal-fantasy rescue. Risk-taking appears in the compressed, single-scene structure that moves through multiple universes without scene breaks, sustaining coherence. The "weaving between worlds" and "truth has weight because it anchors worlds" imagery risks abstraction but remains tethered to the shard's physical properties and the narrator's embodied choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker trait is present from the opening ("my palms already reading the grit and oil like braille") and shapes key choices: tasting which choices were taken elsewhere, using the kit to chart the seam, and breathing the coolant to define corridors. The profession enables the weaving mechanic and the final log amendment. However, the mapping itself does not constrain or create visible cost; the narrator's sensory skill facilitates but does not force the turns. Present in setup, development (coolant mapping), and payoff (log entry), earning two-gate eligibility; causal pressure and specificity lift the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in beat one (pocket, warm, viewport contradiction), beat two (set upright in clamp, redirects light into a seam), beat three (used as prism to open the hatch), and implicitly in beat four (Jalen stares at it, narrator steps back to the seam). Its unique properties (green edge, warmth, light redirection) enable the seam-opening and universe-weaving, and Jalen's glance reweights its role as the lie's physical anchor. Early signal, three-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no generic tool could substitute) justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is introduced early ("I did not travel by engines or gates; I wove between worlds, threading my body and my attention through parallel universes") and drives the core mechanic: the seam opens, senses slip through, the narrator redirects via the shard, and finally "wove us together through parallel universes until we reached one where my statement could be amended." The concept shapes stakes (reaching Jalen), tactics (using the shard as prism), and closure (finding the universe with the intact log). Present in setup, development (multiple weaving beats), and payoff; high causal pressure and closure linkage support the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is introduced early ("calm days punctured by leaps that were cyclically spontaneous, arriving on a rhythm I could sense but never schedule") and the "cyclic pulse" triggers the seam-opening in beat two. However, the trait functions more as atmospheric dressing than as a constraint with visible cost; the narrator does not struggle against the rhythm or pay a price for its unpredictability. Present in setup and one development beat, but swappable with "periodic ability trigger" without structural loss. Lyric color without strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears in multiple beats: the shard "redirected" bay lights into a seam (beat two), the narrator "redirected the seam again, aiming it through the hatch's locking mechanism" (beat three), and the action is implicit in the final weaving to amend the log. Each redirection creates a key turn (opening the seam, opening the hatch, reaching the correct universe), and the specificity of "redirect" (versus "open" or "use") ties to the light-prism mechanic. Early signal, three-beat causal involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "through parallel universes" is signaled early ("I wove between worlds, threading my body and my attention through parallel universes") and governs the mechanics: senses slip sideways into the next Dock Seven, the narrator steps through with Jalen, and the final weaving reaches the universe where the log can be amended. The mechanic shapes every major attempt after beat one and provides the path to closure. Present in setup, development (multiple uses), and payoff; high causal involvement supports the score, though the parallel-universe rules remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors the opening, supplies the broken conduits and hull plates that "hummed with choices," and houses the workbench (beacon), service hatch, and log terminal. The setting provides resources (terminal, hatch) that affect the outcome, and the multiple Dock Seven variants across universes offer atmospheric variation (coolant smear, open hatch). Present in setup, development (hatch, beacon), and payoff (terminal); the bay shapes tactics more than it constrains, trending mid-6s for functional micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" is the opening phrase and sets a lyric tone, but it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks elapsed duration. The story unfolds in a continuous present without urgency tied to a clock. The phrase provides atmospheric color and a minor thematic link to the "half-remembered" viewport memory, but it is swappable with any evocative opener. Present in setup only; no development or payoff involvement; ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is introduced immediately ("I needed to discover the weight of a withheld truth, the kind that presses on the ribs") and drives every choice: following the shard's pull, mapping the seam, pursuing the beacon, confronting Jalen, and amending the log. The desire is dramatized through physical embodiment (pressure on ribs, truth lifting and settling) and faces friction (Jalen's fury, the visible cost of sharing). Present in setup, development (beacon pursuit, hatch opening), and payoff (log entry, truth settling); causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost justify high integration.</comment>
