<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's professional identity is vividly embodied through micro-choices (kneeling, tracing the seal, speaking aloud, methodically unweaving), and her motivations drive each beat. Interior access is consistent and her "warmly methodical" approach creates a credible perceptual signature. The stakes are clear and the final act of filing under dual categories with a public reading demonstrates earned agency. However, the faceless diplomat figure remains abstract, and Mara's emotional response to the revelation (anger, then purpose) feels slightly summarized rather than embodied in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a single POV and follows one continuous scene in the tower mechanism room. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraph. The causal chain—seal found, rope braided, door opens, text forms, Mara files publicly—is legible and motivated. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act of filing under merged categories and scheduling a public reading reweights the university's erasure with visible cost (institutional accountability). The drive lens reads as causal with accumulative texture; the ending holds that lens cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is anchored early and used concretely: gears click, the pendulum slows, iron struts and oak door materialize. The ceremonial rope is handled tactilely across multiple beats (kneeling, unweaving, threading, re-braiding), and its physical properties constrain Mara's method. The "gap archive" image charges the conceptual payoff. Sensory details (cool draft, oil and rain scent) are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the tower's physical logic supports rather than decorates the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the erased treaty to correct institutional harm—is signaled early and shapes every beat. The progression tightens meaningfully: seal discovered, rope puzzle solved, diplomat encountered, text revealed, public filing scheduled. Mara's agency drives each turn, and the final act forecloses the path of continued erasure with visible cost (institutional reckoning). The "merge" concept operates both literally (braiding the seal into the rope) and thematically (merging river and scholarship categories), creating layered escalation. One reversal (the door opening to a gap archive rather than a hallway) deepens rather than deflects pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise that "absence was not emptiness…but a story told by what remained." The concept of institutional forgetting choosing silence over students and town is dramatized through the rope-seal puzzle, not stated. The faceless diplomat offering "a silence shaped exactly like the missing treaty" is a strong non-literal image. Mara's dual filing and public reading schedule constitute a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The final line—"the university's conscience, finally given a door it could not deny"—feels slightly over-articulated for the ending's conceptual weight, but the thematic arc is otherwise clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled throughout; Mara's perceptual signature (methodical, archival framing: "translate confusion into clarity," "sender, recipient, and witness") is distinct and consistent. Diction reflects her professional idiom ("misfiled treaty box," "finding aids," "deliberate merge of categories"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("she remembered," "she understood") appear occasionally but remain voice-motivated and legible. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with pressure, and psychic distance tightens during the braiding sequence. One minor slip: "the tower forgot its own shape" reads slightly precious for the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and spatial choreography is clear. However, several template-cadence runs appear ("she did not see…but," "she copied…leaving…and when she stepped back") and a paraphrase loop in the opening ("archives were always changing around what they refused to say" followed by "tales that described missing doors, vanished letters") restates the absence concept without advancing pressure. The phrase "as though ink and fiber shared one alphabet" and "warmly methodical" recur but the repetition serves motif rather than loop. The final paragraph's exposition ("it was not the gears that had been repaired; it was the university's conscience") slightly over-explains the thematic payoff. These artifacts touch proximity to closure but do not obscure causality, so the penalty remains within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist solving a door puzzle by re-braiding a ceremonial rope to restore an erased treaty—synthesizes archive-mystery, institutional critique, and material semiotics in a specific, non-generic way. The "fables of absence" frame and the gap archive (shelves holding only labels) offer fresh angles on institutional memory. The faceless diplomat is evocative but borders on symbolic convenience. The merger of wax-into-fiber feels earned in hindsight by the three-strand pattern established early. The dual-filing closure and public reading transform the metaphor into grounded consequence. Risk-taking is present (the gap archive, the rope-as-sentence conceit) and coherent, but the piece does not fully escape the template of "archivist discovers hidden truth and corrects injustice."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present from the opening and drives every key turn: she climbs to the tower, holds the seal near the door, unweaves and re-braids the rope, copies the text, files it dually, and schedules the public reading. Her adaptability and methodical approach constrain her tactics (naming each strand aloud, threading the seal as a missing page). The closure—filing under merged categories—traces directly to her professional identity. Her choices are causally active across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wax seal appears early (Mara takes it out, holds it near the door, traces its crest), drives the middle beat (threaded between rope strands), and merges into script at the ending. Its three-strand pattern links to the rope's braids, making it causally indispensable. The seal's absence from every catalogue establishes the problem it helps solve. It is handled concretely in at least three distinct beats and its reweighted meaning (from orphaned signature to restored treaty text) charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fables of absence" is signaled in the folder title and operative premise ("absence…a story told by what remained"). The concept shapes Mara's understanding and tactics (reading the fable, merging missing and present records). The gap archive literalizes the concept, and the ending reframes absence as a lesson of presence. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than a constraint that alters on-page tactics; Mara's choices are driven more by the physical rope puzzle than by the fable's instruction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" is stated twice and embodied in Mara's actions: she kneels, sets her lantern steady, speaks each motion aloud, names the braids. The trait enables her success (careful fingers, methodical re-composition) and reflects her professional identity. However, no visible tradeoff or cost is tied to this attribute on the page; it functions as consistent characterization rather than a constraint that forecloses an alternative approach. The attribute is present in setup and development but not charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Merge" appears on the brass plate, is enacted literally (seal threaded into rope, wax merging into fiber), and thematically (dual filing under river and scholarship). Every major turn traces to this action: the door opens when Mara merges present and missing records, the treaty text forms through the physical merge, and the closure filing is a deliberate institutional merge. The action is signaled early, executed in the middle, and reweighted at the end. Removing "merge" would collapse the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rope is present from the opening (hanging beneath the brass plate), its mechanics are detailed (three-strand pattern matching the seal's crest), and Mara's method (unweaving, naming each strand, threading the seal, re-braiding) is dramatized across multiple beats. The fable instructs that reconfiguring the braids will open the door, and the tactic succeeds. The rope tightens at the climax and reappears implicitly in the merger imagery. The method is indispensable to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is anchored in the opening and supplies concrete resources: gears that click, iron struts framing the door, the pendulum that slows to a listening hush. The setting pressures Mara's choices (she must climb at night, work by lantern, position herself between gears) and the tower's physical properties (forgetting its own shape) enable the door's appearance. The mechanism room's logic charges the closure image ("the tower kept perfect time"). The setting is essential to tactics and ending resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"The night the autumn term began" anchors the timeframe, and the door appears "only when the tower forgot its own shape." The temporal condition is operative (the door shouldn't exist, yet does) but not tightly tracked; no live countdown or escalating deadline pressures Mara's moves. The timeframe enables the event but does not constrain tactics within the scene. It is present in setup and implied at closure (morning arrives, tower keeps time) but not developed as a middle pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to translate confusion into clarity" is stated early and dramatized in every choice: reading fables, tracing the seal, methodically unweaving the rope, copying the text, filing it publicly. The motivation frames her professional identity and drives the closure act (returning the story to those it excluded). A friction appears when she feels anger before steadier purpose, suggesting want versus cost. The motivation is causally active across setup, development, and payoff, though the internal conflict could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" is maintained through turns: Mara's methodical approach coexists with paradox ("clarity arrived by way of paradox"), the gap archive presents absence as presence, and the ending balances institutional critique with measured consequence. Tone modulates appropriately (quiet opening, tactile middle, purposeful close) without veering into didacticism. The final line ("the university's conscience, finally given a door it could not deny") slightly over-articulates but remains coherent with the established register. Tone charges the final image by sustaining the balance of archival precision and moral weight.</comment>
