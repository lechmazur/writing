<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inez is strongly characterized through contradictory impulses: the engineer of manufactured drought who carries an extinct bird's egg with throat-tightening sentiment. Her internal contradiction drives the final choice to shatter the egg, embodying both the grace she broke and the grace she still chooses. The philanthropy-as-arithmetic metaphor is concretely anchored in her actions (ordering droughts, building clinics), and the final renunciation feels earned. Minor: some interiority edges toward diagnostic phrasing ("the wrong kind of tenderness"), though it remains within voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the egg's shattering is a Resonant Reconfiguration (bordering on Decisive Change) that forecloses redemption and crystallizes her stance with visible cost—the wafer cracked, the recording lost, the shell fragments scattered. The accumulative lens holds throughout (manufactured drought → convergent cracks → failed playback → deliberate release). Causality is tight: she ordered the drought to sharpen the map, followed it to the stake, attempted playback, and when the device failed she chose to release the shell. One meaningful tightening (the hiss of failure) deepens into the final act of letting go, and the cost is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt flat constrains and charges every beat: "sheet of broken glass," salt cutting her soles, the converging fissures she counts and follows, the dark oval pool drained by her pumps, the rusted survey stake from her dam project. The crack-map is both navigational tool and accusation, its geometry guiding her pilgrimage and indicting her. The storm's lull functions as temporal pressure, and the final image of wind carrying shell shards along the crack-lines directly charges closure. Micro-setting (the stake, the egg, her bleeding feet) shapes the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atoning for extinction she caused) is signaled early and tightens through escalation: she follows the fissures, finds the convergence, kneels at the stake, presses the egg to her ear—then the wafer cracks. The reversal (silent hiss instead of chorus) forces the climactic choice to shatter the egg, a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses any mechanical redemption. Her agency drives every beat, and the final act is hers alone. The drought's engineering and the petrels' island both feed the pressure with specific prior harm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: philanthropy as arithmetic versus the unbuyable egg, manufactured drought versus the grace she broke and still chooses, the crack-map as both navigation and scar. The final image—shell shards carried along the fissure lines, hiss turning to remembered note inside her—answers the thematic question (can power atone?) without stating a moral. "No amount of rain would wash clean the grace she had broken and the grace she still chose" reprices her entire calculus with undeniable cost. The egg is not a ledger, and the story honors that refusal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinctive: "white coat flapping like a flag that had forgotten its nation," "chapel," "arithmetic," "unbuyable." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the throat-tightening, wider at the board justification). Perceptual signature is consistent—she counts angles, lets salt cut her soles, hears or imagines wingbeats. One line edges toward thematic echo: "the grace she had broken and the grace she still chose" articulates the premise directly in the final beat, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid full sermon. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: nearly every sentence advances situation, character, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor scaffold in the mid-section: "She told the board it was research, but in the privacy of her glove she carried…" and "Secretly sentimental, she had paid smugglers…" are adjacent restatements of the same contradiction, creating a brief paraphrase loop (−0.2). "The egg belonged to the storm-petrel of Kandar, wiped out when her first dam drowned their nesting island" is efficient backstory that primes closure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of manufactured drought, extinct-bird recording, crack-map navigation, and sentimental industrialist feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the philanthropist trope (amoral yet grieving) through lived detail (counting fissures, salt cutting soles, the hollowed egg fitted with a wafer) is bold and coherent. The final choice—shattering the egg when the recording fails—grows inevitably from prior particulars and carries genuine risk (no redemption, no mechanical payoff). The crack-map as flight-path memory and the stake as relic anchor originality in world logic rather than quirk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inez Marrow's choices create every major turn: ordering the drought to sharpen the crack-map, walking alone to the convergence, snapping off her security chief, kneeling at the stake, and—crucially—lifting and shattering the egg when the wafer fails. Her amorality (buying aquifers, engineering drought) and her sentiment (carrying the egg, throat tightening) collide in the final beat, and the climactic act of release is hers alone. Setup early, drives at least three beats (the walk, the kneeling/playback attempt, the shattering), and shapes closure with visible cost. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The egg appears in beat one (carried in her glove), is detailed in beat two (storm-petrel shell, hollowed, wafer inside), is pressed to her ear at the stake, fails to play, and is lifted high and shattered in the climactic action. Its specificity (last field recordings, Kandar petrel, her first dam) makes it irreplaceable. The shell's shattering and the ivory shards carried along the crack-lines directly constitute the closure image. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all score high. The egg is the story's central object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The manufactured drought shapes stakes (she ordered it to sharpen the crack-map), alters the landscape (riverbeds dried into readable scars, the pool drained), and provides the navigational logic for the pilgrimage. It is signaled early ("The drought that emptied this basin was not an accident") and its consequences constrain her tactics (following fissures, counting angles). It also charges the final lines: "the drought would end when she allowed it." Setup, development (the walk depends on it), and payoff (her knowledge she controls it) are all present. Strong causal pressure but not quite indispensable—another method could theoretically guide her to the site.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is dramatized early (throat tightening, carrying the egg) and drives the final choice: she whispers the birds' name like a prayer and shatters the shell to release the echo. The trait creates visible tradeoff—her power depends on "no one witnessing the wrong kind of tenderness," yet she enacts that tenderness alone on the salt flat. The sentimentality constrains her (she snaps off the radio, walks alone) and enables the climactic release. Setup, middle constraint (the radio snap), and payoff (the prayer and shattering) all present with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Release" is the story's climactic action: "she lifted the egg high above the salt, whispered the birds' name like a prayer, and let it fall to release whatever echo remained." The act is irreplaceable—it embodies both renunciation and honoring, foreclosing mechanical redemption while enacting the only honest gesture left. The entire narrative builds toward this release (ordering drought, following cracks, kneeling, pressing the egg, discovering silence). The shell's shattering and the scatter of shards along the crack-map constitute the closure image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The crack-map is introduced early ("a map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds"), shapes her tactics throughout the walk ("She followed the fissures with slow feet, counting angles"), and provides the convergence point where she kneels. Its mechanics matter: she ordered the drought so the cracks would sharpen, "because when water lingered the pattern blurred." The final image (shards carried along the crack-map's lines) reprises the map with charged meaning. Setup, development (the navigation), and payoff (the shard-scatter) all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt flat pressures every choice: it cuts her soles, provides the crack-map she navigates, holds the dark oval where the pool was, and anchors the rusted survey stake. The environment is handled across multiple beats (walking, counting angles, kneeling, shattering) and its specificity (salt, broken glass appearance, the dried pool, the stake from her dam project) makes it irreplaceable. The final image (wind carrying shards along the crack-lines) depends entirely on the flat's geometry. Setup early, constrains middle tactics, and charges closure. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" frames the opening and the lull's pause creates the moment when she hears (or imagines) wingbeats. The storm resumes at the end ("before the thunder resumed"), closing the window. The lull functions as a tonal and temporal container that isolates her pilgrimage, and the pause intensifies the listening beat. Setup (opening line), development (the pause when she hears wingbeats), and payoff (she walks back before thunder resumes) all present. The timeframe tightens the ritual atmosphere but does not constrain decisions as directly as other elements. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve the echo is dramatized early (carrying the egg, paying smugglers and scientists) and drives every beat: ordering the drought to sharpen the map, walking alone, following the cracks, pressing the egg to her ear, and—when preservation fails—choosing to release the echo via shattering. The friction between preserving (the wafer and recording) and honoring through destruction (letting the shards scatter) charges the closure. Her throat tightens, she whispers the birds' name, and she enacts the only honest gesture left. Setup, conflicted middle choices, and climactic payoff with visible cost. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" coheres through every image: the salt flat as broken glass, the flag that forgot its nation, philanthropy as arithmetic versus the unbuyable egg, the crack-map as flight-path scar, the wafer's cracked silence, and the final "grace she had broken and the grace she still chose." Tone modulates with pressure (the throat-tightening intimacy, the radio snap, the kneeling prayer, the shattering) and charges the final image when the hiss turns to remembered note inside her. The tone is neither single nor static; it braids judgment and tenderness, guilt and ritual, across the entire arc. Indispensable.</comment>
