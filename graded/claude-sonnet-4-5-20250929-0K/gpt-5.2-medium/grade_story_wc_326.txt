<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's compulsive heartbeat counting is embodied and shapes her perception under pressure, stopping at "six thousand, two hundred, and one" when she realizes she's been "counting heartbeats to deny loss, not to honor life"—an earned shift. Lyle's digital ghost persona remains consistent through voice and fragmented memory. The final stance ("correctly recorded, a living person carrying a ghost's hard-won calm") feels earned by the ink-ritual micro-choices and his guidance. Minor: the "officially dead" bureaucratic struggle is declared more than dramatized in micro-choices before the resolution file arrives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors (Mara, opal observatory, after static clears) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The ink-spiral ritual accumulates pressure through sensory density and Lyle's fragmented-memory metaphor, culminating in the file that flags the certificate error and the annotated mistakes file—Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stops counting, feels the room "hold her gently," and leaves "correctly recorded," forecloses the counting reflex with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is visible in the stopped count and the shift from denial to embodiment. Lens holds; closure lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome, telescope, snow, and server-room hard drives "tick like small insects" provide spatial grounding and sensory texture. The porcelain shard (warm from her palm, "as if it remembers the hot coffee") and the ink-soaked charts function as micro-setting that charges the ritual beats. The "snow shifts on the dome" and "static free sky opens" bracket the ritual and final image. The shard and ink constrain the repair-script method and charge the closure gesture (leaving a clean cup on the console). Environment and recurring object shape choice and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: defragmenting Mara's bureaucratic erasure by repairing Lyle's fragmented code through the ink ritual. The spiral drawing and Lyle's instructions tighten pressure ("my memory is fragmented…so we will defragment together"), narrowing options to this ephemeral-pattern method. The file that rewrites the ledger and the annotated-mistakes archive arrive as closure moves with visible cost: Mara stops counting, a renunciation of the denial reflex. One meaningful tightening (the ink ritual's irreversibility and Lyle's guide) escalates under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Mara's strokes and the decision to stop counting foreclose the prior defensive stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme: honoring failure's pattern versus denying loss through compulsive proof. "The first crack teaches you where the stress truly lives" and "defragmenting is not only moving data, it is making space for what could not fit before" emerge from the ink ritual and shard, not authorial assertion. The final image ("correctly recorded, a living person carrying a ghost's hard-won calm") reweights the counting obsession and the "officially dead" premise without stating a moral. The porcelain shard and annotated-mistakes file anchor the theme in concrete objects. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Mara embodies acceptance through the stopped count and the clean cup left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: Mara's counting metronome, the shard's warmth, and sensory focus (ink blooming, drives ticking, snow shifting) remain character-specific. Lyle's voice via speaker is indirect dialogue, thin but steady, with purposeful compression ("soul's interference," "fetch wisdom from failure"). Diction ("opal observatory," "sleeping spear," "dark lake bloom") is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated, and legible. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats. One elision (the employer-folder obstruction) is brief and paid off when Mara finds the email. Dialogue (Lyle's guidance) advances the ritual and thematic stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, memory metaphor, or Mara's internal shift. "After the radio static clears" and "the night returns to the opal observatory under snow" anchor immediately. The ink-spiral and shard-through-ink beats are concretely rendered. Minor scaffold: "Its dome is a pale gem in the drifts, and the telescope points like a sleeping spear" stacks two metaphors in quick succession without added pressure (−0.3). "She keeps the shard in her pocket, its white curve warm from her palm, as if it remembers the hot coffee" is purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the figurative load is mostly integrated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise (digital ghost guiding ink-ritual defragmentation to fix a death-certificate error) offers a fresh synthesis: bureaucratic Kafkaesque trap meets fragmented AI and ephemeral-pattern repair. The porcelain shard as "first crack" teaching and the heartbeat-count refusal feel specific and non-obvious. The ink-on-star-charts alphabet and camera-to-code translation transform the ghost-mentor trope. Mara's final stance ("correctly recorded…carrying a ghost's hard-won calm") avoids the explain-everything ending. Risk: the accumulative structure and lyric compression heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The annotated-mistakes constellation and the clean cup left behind anchor the emotional turn in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (death certificate error survivor) drives all on-page choices: bringing the shard, performing the ink ritual, stopping the count at 6,201, leaving the clean cup. Her decisions shape the middle ritual beats and the closure stance. Early setup (opening paragraph), middle ink-spiral choices, and closure renunciation satisfy all three gates. Causal pressure: her erasure motivates the visit and the ritual; her realization (counting to deny loss) alters the final stance. Cost: stopping the count forecloses the defensive reflex. Specific to this character; swapping would require rewriting the core conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in setup (email request, pocket warmth "as if it remembers the hot coffee"), is used in the middle beat (dragged through ink to trace a spiral), and charges the thematic lesson ("the first crack teaches you where the stress truly lives"). Three beats: mentioned/pocketed, used in ritual, recalled in Lyle's teaching. Causal: the shard's broken history parallels Mara's fragmentation and Lyle's failure. Closure linkage: the annotated-mistakes file echoes the shard's "first crack" lesson. Minor: the shard does not reappear in the final image (clean cup substitutes), limiting top-band elevation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Digital ghost (Lyle in the observatory servers) shapes all ritual stakes: his fragmented memory requires the ephemeral-pattern repair, his voice guides the ink strokes, and his dual files (ledger fix, annotated mistakes) deliver closure. Setup (second paragraph: "what remains is a digital ghost stitched into the observatory servers"), middle (cannot read ordinary commands, only ink patterns), and closure (files sent, speaker click "like a heartbeat answered"). Causal pressure: the ghost's constraints dictate the ink method and the shard request. Cost: Mara must trust this non-corporeal guide and adopt his failure-wisdom. Indispensable; removing the ghost collapses the repair logic and thematic pairing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting (attribute) anchors Mara's denial reflex across the piece: "she counts heartbeats constantly to prove it," "counting began in the hospital," "her heartbeat count climbs in her head, a metronome that keeps fear from flooding," and the closure turn: "She stops at six thousand, two hundred, and one." Setup (opening), middle (count as pressure valve during ritual), closure (stopping the count forecloses the defensive stance). Causal: the count constrains her attention and shapes the realization that she's been "counting heartbeats to deny loss, not to honor life." Cost: stopping requires letting go of the proof-of-life reflex. Strong integration; the exact number and the pause carry weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Defragment (action) drives the core ritual and thematic arc: Lyle says "we will defragment together," guides Mara to "draw blocks and bridges in ink" that become repair scripts, and defines defragmenting as "making space for what could not fit before." Setup (Lyle's invitation), middle (ink-stroke repair), closure (ledger file sent, Mara's internal defragmentation via stopped count). Causal: the action structures the entire middle sequence and delivers both the bureaucratic fix and the emotional shift. Cost: the ritual's irreversibility (spilled ink, ephemeral patterns) and Mara's renunciation. Swapping "defragment" for a generic "fix" would lose the memory-storage metaphor and thematic resonance. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink (method) is signaled early (Lyle "asks her to spill the ink without thinking," "only the ephemeral patterns in spilled ink that cameras translate into numbers"), used in the middle ritual (Mara tips the bottle, "watches a dark lake bloom," drags the shard through spirals), and pays off at closure (final ink spiral sends the file). Setup, development, closure gates satisfied. Causal: the method's constraints (observatory sensors perfect for this "strange alphabet," ink-stroke irreversibility) shape the ritual beats. Minor: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (how cameras parse ink into repair scripts is asserted, not dramatized), limiting top-band reach. Still, the method is indispensable to the ghost-repair logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Opal observatory under snow provides spatial grounding (dome, telescope, control room, server room below with ticking drives, snow shifting on dome) and sensory texture that charges the ritual. Setup (opening lines), middle (control room console, cameras, drives through floorboards), closure (snow shifts, static-free sky opens, telescope wakes). The observatory's sensors are "perfect for this strange alphabet," enabling the ink method. Snow and dome anchor the "midnight solace" tone. Minor: the setting enables rather than pressures; Mara's visit is voluntary, and the environment does not constrain her choices beyond providing the technical infrastructure. Solid integration but not indispensable; a different sensory-rich lab could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After the radio static clears (timeframe) anchors the opening and signals a shift from prior interference to the present clean-air ritual. The phrase appears in the first sentence and implicitly brackets the entire scene (static was past; now resolved). Setup satisfied. Middle: no explicit time pressure or clock mentioned; the ritual unfolds at Mara's pace. Closure: "tonight" and "when she steps into the snow" confirm the single-night window, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or escalate stakes. Functional framing but replaceable; swapping to "after dawn" or "before the storm" would require only minor tonal edits. Mid-band: clear setup, weak development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fetch wisdom from failure (motivation) is declared by Lyle ("I asked for the shard, because the first crack teaches you where the stress truly lives") and dramatized through Mara's realization: "she has been counting heartbeats to deny loss, not to honor life." Setup (Lyle's lesson promised, shard requested), middle (shard used, failure lesson articulated), closure (Mara stops counting, accepts the annotated-mistakes file). Friction: Mara's initial drive is bureaucratic (fix the certificate), but the ritual shifts her toward accepting failure's pattern. Cost: she must stop the defensive count and "carry a ghost's hard-won calm." The motivation reweights from instrumental fix to existential acceptance. Strong causal role and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Midnight solace (tone) is established through sensory quiet (snow, pale dome, "sleeping spear" telescope, "thin but steady" voice, room "hold her gently"), modulates under ritual pressure (ink blooming, drives ticking, Lyle's fragmented confessions), and charges the final image ("static free sky opens," "correctly recorded"). Coherent across turns; the tone supports the defragmentation theme and Mara's shift from frantic counting to embodied calm. The "speaker clicks once, like a heartbeat answered" crystallizes the solace. Minor: "midnight" is declared but not deeply integrated into time-based pressure; the solace is more atmosphere than plot constraint. Still, tone shapes the closure's emotional weight and remains consistent.</comment>
