<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation is clear—he seeks patterns, not treasure—and his micro-choices (scattering seeds, aligning breath with ink shimmer) embody embodied decision-making under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he reenters a place that rearranged his memories, showing simultaneous fear and purpose. The final choice (copying combinations and speaking them aloud) is earned by prior causality, though the cost of extraction remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular throughout, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spiral unfolds through density increase (green ink shimmer → footprints on ceiling → calcite door → brass dial) with clear cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the cliff-mouth paragraph (~15% mark). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ilya copies the combinations and speaks them aloud, an act that reconfigures the grotto's harvest-logic with conceptual cost (sharing resists theft by silence). The inferred lens holds without contradiction, and the cost is legible in the final image of him clutching notes as mist reclaims secrets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto's inverted gravity, upward-dripping water, and calcite door constrain Ilya's choices at multiple beats (seeds settle into a crack-stair, door ripples when seeds are pressed). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "viscous air," "fog and salt," "books hung like bats." The prism compass functions as micro-setting, filtering gray into bands that reveal carvings and sort dial marks—directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the spiral descent and antechamber ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find forgotten combinations before smugglers/kings) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the door test (SOW, WATCH, RETURN) that transforms his vigilance seeds from habit into keys. Agency is decision and renunciation—he enters knowing memories may rearrange again, a visible cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via the spiral path, lost memories resurfacing, and the final dial discovery. The grotto's threat (feeding on forgetting) remains abstract rather than forcing a live tradeoff between staying and leaving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: vigilance seeds shift from superstition to keys, the grotto stores what minds cannot hold, and speaking combinations aloud resists silence-theft. The closing image (clutching notes as mist reclaims) offers a non-literal answer to the central question—how to preserve what fear shakes loose—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the door's inscription and the act of sharing versus hoarding. The spiral-as-path metaphor integrates organically, though "latent blaze" as descriptor trends towards assertion rather than fully earned embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature ("prism-minded") filtering world through light-sorting metaphors. Diction stays character-particular: "seeds of vigilance," "threshold effects," "clandestinely luminous." Psychic distance tightens during the spiral descent without head-hopping. The prose modulates with intensity—short clauses during threshold crossing, longer rhythm in the antechamber discovery—and maintains voice coherence under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed," "realized") appear sparingly and serve comprehension without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "He scattered three vigilance seeds at the crossing, and watched them float, then settle into a crack that was suddenly a stair"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops appear. Minor overwriting clusters in the opening third: "prism-minded" + "cipher manuals, funeral songs, and the blank spaces between them" + "quiet summons" stacks elevated register without immediate pressure justification. Template cadence appears twice in mid-section ("He stepped forward…" / "He followed the spiral…"), but remains legible. The closure beat is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-logic applied to a memory-harvesting grotto is specific and non-obvious. The spiral-as-path inflection (a drawing that is navigation instruction) feels earned in hindsight. Vigilance seeds transform from quirky habit into functional keys without late-rule introduction—the grotto's test was signaled by the margin doodle. The frame resists genre templates (not treasure-hunt, not pure puzzle-box) through the archivist lens and the choice to share rather than hoard. Risk-taking in structure (dense accumulation, minimal scene breaks) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya makes on-page choices that create turns: entering the grotto despite prior trauma, scattering seeds at the crossing (which become the stair), pressing seeds into the calcite door, and speaking combinations aloud. Setup occurs early (paragraph 1), middle choices constrain path (seed → stair, seed → door), and closure participation is direct (copying + speaking). The archivist lens shapes perception throughout ("prism compass," "cataloged cipher manuals"). Swappability is low—the sorting-light metaphor and vigilance method are character-specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The manuscript doodle appears in paragraph 5 (setup), its spiral matches cave maps (beat 1), green ink shimmer dictates Ilya's breathing pace during descent (beat 2), and the calcite door bears the same luminous ink with instruction (beat 3, closure zone). The object's clandestine luminosity enables navigation and door-opening. It is handled across three distinct beats and charges the closure by linking margin doodle → spiral path → door inscription. Irreplaceability is high: the specific ink property (breath-activated green) matters causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seeds of vigilance shape stakes and tactics on the page: Ilya drops them to trace decisions (paragraph 11), three seeds at the crossing become a stair (paragraph 20), and three seeds unlock the calcite door (paragraph 27). The concept is signaled early (paragraph 10), constrains middle choices (navigation + door), and is reweighted at closure (understanding they are keys, not superstition). The door inscription "SOW, WATCH, RETURN" crystallizes the concept's function with visible cost (prior seeds were necessary). Removing this element would break the navigation and door-opening logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clandestinely luminous ink is introduced in paragraph 6 (setup under magnification), enables path-following in paragraph 22 (breathing dictates pace), and reappears on the calcite door in paragraph 26 (inscription). It constrains two on-page actions: navigation via shimmer-pacing and door recognition. The trait is specific (breath-activated green) and not easily swappable. However, the ink's luminosity does not impose a visible tradeoff or cost—it functions as enabler without complication. Closure participation is indirect (door inscription uses the ink but the act is seed-pressing).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reenter is the action that redefines options: Ilya fled the grotto years ago with rearranged memories (paragraph 8) and now reenters (paragraph 9), knowing the cost. The decision is signaled early, enables all middle beats (spiral descent, memory recovery, door unlocking), and the closure beat (extracting combinations) is possible only because he reentered. The action carries visible cost (memories may rearrange again, urgency as gravity hour ends). Swapping "reenter" for "enter" would lose the earned fear and prior pattern. The action is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Threshold effects appear in paragraph 15 (air turns viscous, shadow slides ahead) as the means of passage into the grotto's spiral. The method is signaled at entry, shapes one middle beat (crossing the seam), and is reversed at closure (paragraph 32: "reentered the threshold effects in reverse"). It constrains navigation by adding sensory/physical friction. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—viscous air and shadow-slide are described but do not force a tactical choice or visible cost during crossing. The method is present across three beats but does not independently drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is introduced in paragraph 7 (setup), its mist and question-mark entrance anchor the cliff-mouth scene (paragraph 12), inverted gravity alters movement (paragraph 14), the winding throat and spiral path constrain navigation (paragraphs 16–22), and the antechamber holds the brass dial (paragraph 29). The setting pressures choices at multiple beats: seeds settle into crack-stair (setting enables), door opens upward (setting orients), and the hour's end forces extraction urgency (paragraph 32). Removing the grotto's specific properties (inversion, spiral, mist reclaiming) would break closure logic and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when gravity inverts for an hour" is signaled in paragraph 13, alters movement (water drips upward, bones tugged in pulses), and creates urgency at closure (paragraph 31: "When the hour ended, the chamber trembled"). The hour tightens extraction decisions—Ilya must copy and exit before reversion. However, the clock is not actively tracked across middle beats; the hour functions as bookend pressure (entry condition + exit trigger) rather than a live countdown that alters tactics beat-by-beat. Closure participation is direct but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where forgotten combinations hide" is stated in paragraph 4 (setup: Commission summons, lead is the doodle) and dramatized through on-page choices: following the spiral, pressing seeds into the door, copying dial sequences. Friction appears between the want (retrieve combinations) and cost (memories rearranging, grotto feeding on forgetting). The motivation drives all major beats and is fulfilled at closure (he copies the combinations). However, the internal conflict between professional duty and personal fear is asserted more than enacted—Ilya's "purpose burned with a latent blaze" (paragraph 24) tells rather than showing hesitation or struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Latent blaze as tone (restrained intensity, slow-burn purpose) is signaled in paragraph 24 ("his purpose burned with a latent blaze that steadied him") and modulates with pressure: quiet determination at entry, sensory compression during threshold crossing, focused urgency in the antechamber. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (clutching notes as mist reclaims). However, the phrase "latent blaze" is asserted once rather than texturally sustained—diction elsewhere is cooler and more archival ("prism-minded," "calcite," "clandestinely luminous"), creating slight tonal variance. The ending's tone (urgency + extraction) coheres with the concept but the "blaze" metaphor does not recur or constrain a choice.</comment>
