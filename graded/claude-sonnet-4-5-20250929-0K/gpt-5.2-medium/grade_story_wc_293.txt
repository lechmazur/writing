<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and specific ("bridge-song fiddler," observation habits), but agency remains limited—most key events (hitchhiker appearance, his vanishing, discovery of the camera) happen *to* the protagonist rather than through protagonist-driven choices that narrow options. The decision to photograph oneself arrives late and feels more like following instructions than wrestling with contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present in lines like "felt a legal future loosening its grip," yet the final choice lacks visible on-page cost; no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by ~80 words. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: the hitchhiker's gift → scaffold clue → pullout discovery → self-exposure layers meaning, and the final image (hitchhiker glimpsed again, narrator ready to play under a new name) attempts Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"ready to recount my old name as only a tune" tells transformation without showing a foreclosed path or felt price on the page. The causal chain from glass flake to pullout relies on convenience (the flake fits the lock "as if measured"), weakening earned escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bridge, scaffold wrap, mountain pullout, and collodion process are rendered with concrete sensory detail ("white plastic stitched to steel, billow and snap," "poured collodion like moonlit syrup"). The scaffold wrap functions as both clue and atmospheric device, its fluttering revealing the arrow and later reappearing to frame the hitchhiker's spectral return. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains the middle choice (hidden box, service road) and charges the final image (wrap flashing white through pines), lifting the score into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding refuge from a traumatic past and legal constraints—is signaled early and coheres through the discovery sequence. Pressure tightens once (finding the camera, deciding to expose oneself), but the escalation lacks a meaningful trade-off or visible cost: the protagonist follows clues without internal friction, and the self-exposure decision arrives as a smooth epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence (the flake fitting the lock, the hitchhiker reappearing) complicates but does not resolve, yet agency remains passive. One tightening without clear cost places this in mid-6s under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—refuge, erasure, and the reconstruction of identity from loss—emerges organically through the collodion process, pixelated portraits, and the sister's fire metaphor. The final image (playing for strangers, "old name as only a tune") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the thematic climax leans on summary ("felt a legal future loosening its grip") rather than dramatized embodiment, and the hitchhiker's "luminous disbelief" phrase recurs as a motif without sufficient reweighting. Particulars anchor theme well enough for mid-6s, but the ending skirts earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "bridge-song fiddler," "dynamically observant," and the extended metaphors (collodion as "moonlit syrup," scaffold wrap as "flag that refused to choose a country") maintain a consistent lyric register. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (noticing tire hiss, boot prints ending midstride) is character-specific. Under peak pressure (developing the plate, seeing the hitchhiker), diction compresses without breaking coherence. Minor slips: "luminous disbelief" is repeated exactly without evolution, and some figurative language in the middle third (pixelated amnesty "as if mercy itself required deliberate forgetting") tilts toward abstraction. Overall, strong voice with minor texture slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high ("wet-plate collodion glass flake into my palm, cold as creek ice"). Clarity holds across most beats. However, several sentences loop conceptually: "pixelated portrait" and "broken into pixels" restate without adding pressure; "luminous disbelief" appears three times with identical phrasing (baseline −0.2 paraphrase-loop, −0.3 for stock metaphor repetition in peak beat). The final paragraph stacks elevated diction ("kindly pixelation," "legal future loosening") that drifts slightly from the established register under peak stress. No scaffold or template cadence, but the figurative density in the pullout sequence approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching. Cumulative artifacts: −0.6 in Q7; caps remain below 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The wet-plate collodion amnesty program and bridge-song framing offer a fresh synthesis, and the scaffold-wrap clue is specific and non-obvious. However, the hitchhiker-as-mysterious-guide and "magical object grants transformation" template are familiar, and the story does not fully transform them—the protagonist follows instructions rather than wrestling with moral calculus or physical constraint. The sister's fire is mentioned but not dramatized, reducing lived-detail specificity. Emotional arc (grief → refuge) is recognizable and sincere but not surprising. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, earning mid-6s; risk-taking is present but does not heighten stakes enough for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bridge-song fiddler character is present throughout and makes one key choice (to photograph oneself), but most plot turns are driven by external cues (hitchhiker's gift, scaffold clue). Observation is foregrounded as a trait, yet it does not constrain later action with visible cost. Setup early, one middle beat (driving to pullout), closure participation (playing under new name). Two gates plus modest causal pressure place this in mid-5s; agency is limited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass flake is introduced early (page ~15%), handled in two distinct beats (given by hitchhiker, used as shim in latch), and reappears conceptually at closure (the developed plate as transformation). Its unique property (fitting the lock "as if measured") enables the middle turn. Setup, development, closure all present; causal pressure and specificity lift it into 7.8. Not indispensable (a key or code could substitute), capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty is the premise and appears in three beats (hitchhiker's explanation, the field camera plates, the narrator's self-exposure), but it functions more as backdrop than live stake—the protagonist never wrestles with whether to use it or what cost it extracts. The concept is told ("grant pixelated amnesty") rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Present across acts but replaceable with any refuge mechanism; functional but not causally indispensable. Mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dynamically observant" is named early and demonstrated (noticing tire hiss, boot prints ending midstride, scaffold arrow between gusts). It enables one key discovery (the arrow) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—observation is always successful without trade-off. Setup early, one middle beat, modest closure echo (the hitchhiker glimpsed again). Two gates plus one causal beat place this at 5.6; no dramatic cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Recount" appears in two pivotal beats: the hitchhiker asks the narrator to recount the last song, and the closing line ("ready to recount my old name as only a tune"). The action frames the story and reweights meaning at closure, but the middle arc does not hinge on recounting—discovery and exposure dominate. Early setup, lyric reprise at closure with thematic charge earns 6.3 under the lyric-resonance allowance; not causally indispensable across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The scaffold wrap secret is introduced early (~20%), its mechanics demonstrated (watching for flutter, spotting the arrow), and it enables the middle turn (finding the service road). The method is specific and irreplaceable in this beat. Setup, development, and weak closure participation (wrap flashes white in final image) meet two gates strongly. Causal pressure in one major beat and charged reprise at closure lift it to 6.9; not essential to the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain scenic pullout is introduced in the second third, serves as the location for the camera discovery and self-exposure, and its shadow provides developing space. The setting supplies resources (the hidden box, interpretive-sign cover) that alter tactics. Middle development and closure participation present; no setup penalty since arrival is motivated. Two gates plus tactical constraint earn 6.4; the location is functional but a similar remote spot could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the hitchhiker vanishes" anchors the opening and creates a retrospective frame, but time within the story is loose ("three nights ago," "at dawn," no urgency or deadline). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the protagonist proceeds at a contemplative pace. Setup present, no middle constraint, no closure pressure. One gate only; cap at 4.6 per missing development, small bump for framing function to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" is articulated mid-story and drives the decision to self-expose. It connects to the sister's fire backstory and reappears in the closing beat. The want is told more than dramatized—no visible friction between competing desires or costs. Setup (mid-story clear statement), development (motivates exposure), closure (playing for strangers). Three gates present but weak causal pressure and summary-only depiction place this at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" is named twice (hitchhiker's gaze, final glimpse) and attempts to carry the story's emotional register—wonder tinged with skepticism. The tone modulates slightly (contemplative opening, discovery urgency, quiet ending) but remains largely static; the phrase recurs without evolution. Present early and at closure but not woven through middle pressure. Setup and closure participation, no middle development. Two gates plus weak tonal charge earn 5.9; the tone could be rephrased without breaking the story.</comment>
