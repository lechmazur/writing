<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is characterized through specific, embodied skill (identifying walks, map-folding) and her choices meaningfully alter tactics under pressure. The stevedore rescue demonstrates competence tested against genuine obstacles. Internal experience differs from external composure in a character-specific way ("calculated spontaneity"). Minor slip: the trait of keeping secrets "not for power but because secrets travel best when they are quiet" edges toward self-aware diagnostic phrasing that no one has mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accent. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Len signs the reroute, Mara refoldsher maps, and the maze "listen[s] to her softer world"—a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her whisper-system as validated with felt professional and social consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crane brake slips, forcing coordinated whisper-commands that prove the system under real emergency pressure. Cost is legible: the challenge stakes her job, and the ending image shows the professional acceptance she sought.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with concrete spatial detail (numbered corners, ARIES/LIBRA stamps, steel grating). Micro-setting (the acoustic conduit, the hidden door) constrains Mara's choices and directly enables the whisper proof. The geomagnetic storm affects action (frozen cranes, dead radios) and sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (footfall identification, seam acoustics). The final image charges the maze itself as a listening entity, fulfilling the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prove the whisper system to save her job and prevent future harm. The challenge from Len creates a clear tightening with visible professional cost. The crane-brake slip escalates from test to genuine emergency, forcing real-time application under duress. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to use the secret conduit and orchestrate whispered coordination forecloses the option of retreat. The resolution is earned by protagonist action with felt cost (job security, professional validation). One small dock: the stevedore rescue, while dramatic, slightly dilutes focus from the central whisper-proof stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet power versus loud command emerges organically from action and image without thesis statement. The whisper/shout opposition is embodied in concrete choices (the conduit, the coordinated pulls) and tested under genuine pressure. The final image—"the maze listen to her softer world"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise with conceptual cost (acceptance of a counter-intuitive principle in a loud industrial world). The zodiac coin and "secrets travel best when they are quiet" motifs recur with charged meaning. Minor penalty: "because quiet moved farther here" in the penultimate beat edges toward authorial summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (aural focus, spatial-kinesthetic intelligence). Diction fits her professional idiom. Len's brief dialogue feels purposeful but there is insufficient exchange to test true voice distinction between characters. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "calculated spontaneity was her style" reads as external character-summary rather than lived thought. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the rescue, longer syntactic flow in the opening). The piece avoids filter-verb stacks and head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or character. Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the challenge and rescue beats. Minor loop: "whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated twice in nearly identical phrasing (once as Mara's argument, once as enacted proof). The phrase "the storm was not done" is a stock transition. A few elevated constructions ("aurora writhed," "taut thread") elevate diction slightly above the established working-voice in peak moments but remain legible. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops; action sequence is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The whisper-versus-shout premise in an industrial labyrinth is a fresh synthesis; the acoustic conduit and walk-identification traits feel specific rather than generic. The geomagnetic-storm frame adds urgency without gimmick. Execution transforms a mentor-protégé or workplace-conflict template through grounded sensory detail and the counter-intuitive acoustic principle. The zodiac-coin motif and "key with no apparent lock" add texture without feeling ornamental. Risk-taking is moderate: the narrative commits to its premise and the closure is earned, but the emotional arc (professional validation) follows a recognizable shape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as labyrinth maintenance worker appears immediately, frames her specific skills (numbering corners, folded maps, walk identification), and drives all major turns: accepting Len's challenge, opening the conduit, orchestrating the stevedore rescue. Her professional identity is causally inseparable from the stakes and closure. The role could not be swapped without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is introduced early (Len flicks it under ARIES), reappears at the challenge ("raised the coin"), is tapped on the map to mark north during the storm, and returns at LIBRA when Len admits defeat ("held up the zodiac coin, now warm from his palm"). It participates in three beats and the ending image. However, its causal pressure is limited: it marks a symbolic north when compasses lie, but Mara's pre-creased map is the true navigational tool. The coin's constellations "catching the storm light" and final warmth add atmospheric texture without altering tactics. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Folded maps appear in the opening (Mara "worked by folded maps she had made"), define her method ("each fold was deliberate, a crease that turned a rectangle into a route"), enable navigation when technology fails, and return in the closure ("Mara refolded her maps"). The maps are causally active: she pulls out "her folded map, already pre creased for this stretch" to execute the challenge, trusts "her map folds more than any sign" during the rescue, and the final refolding signals professional confidence restored. The concept shapes stakes (analog skill vs. tech failure) and the ending image. Removing folded maps would collapse story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's ability to identify walks by sound is introduced early ("from the rhythm and drag of footsteps on steel grating, she identified people's walks the way others recognized faces"), enables the inciting event (the night watch calls because a runner moves without a badge, and Mara identifies Len by gait), and is used again during the rescue ("she identified another walk, heavy and irregular, a stevedore limping"). The trait constrains her sensory method and demonstrates professional expertise under pressure. It participates in two key beats but does not directly shape the closure. Essential to setup and middle development; less prominent at the end.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The challenge ("if she could send him a whispered phrase from the far end of Pier Nine, he would sign the reroute order, but if she failed, the maze would be cleared and her job with it") establishes the dominant stake, triggers Mara's use of the secret conduit, and structures the entire middle and ending. The crane-brake slip escalates the challenge into a real emergency. Len's signature and admission at LIBRA complete the arc. The challenge is causally irreplaceable: removing it would eliminate the story's central pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The key with no apparent lock is introduced early ("the odd brass key the previous maintainer had left her, a key with no apparent lock"), used twice on-page to open the hidden acoustic conduit (once for the whisper test, once for the stevedore rescue), and appears in the final image ("slipped the coin into her pocket beside the key with no lock"). Its mechanics matter: the key unlocks a service door that reveals the conduit, directly enabling the proof and the coordinated rescue. The "no apparent lock" detail adds mystery and emphasizes Mara's insider knowledge. Essential to tactics and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established immediately ("towering labyrinth of shipping containers in our port city"), provides all spatial pressure (numbered corners, ARIES/SCORPIO/CANCER/LIBRA stamps, steel grating, narrow alleys, acoustic seams), and is inseparable from the whisper-versus-shout premise. The vertical towers and steel corridors create the acoustic properties Mara exploits. The setting supplies the hidden conduit, the crane-brake hazard, and the spatial choreography of the challenge and rescue. The final image ("the maze listen to her softer world") charges the setting as an active entity. Story logic collapses without this exact environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present from the opening ("During the geomagnetic storm, when cranes froze mid swing and compasses lied"), disables technology (radios dead, compasses useless), creates the aurora lighting, and triggers the crane-brake slip that escalates the challenge into genuine emergency. The storm tightens decisions by removing electronic communication and forcing reliance on Mara's analog methods. It appears in setup, middle (crane failure), and ending (aurora backdrop). The timeframe constrains tactics throughout and the storm's ongoing presence ("the storm was not done") drives escalation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts is stated early ("she wanted to prove it before someone got hurt"), dramatized through her acceptance of Len's challenge with job-on-the-line stakes, tested under real emergency (the stevedore rescue), and validated in the ending when Len admits he "heard her first whisper clearly while the shouted orders had fractured." The motivation drives every major choice and is inextricable from the closure. Friction between professional reputation, personal conviction, and immediate risk is embodied in action. The motivation shapes the arc from setup through final validation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity is established early ("Calculated spontaneity was her style, so she smiled as though improvising and pulled out her folded map, already pre creased for this stretch") and reflected in Mara's blend of preparation (pre-creased maps, secret conduit knowledge) and real-time adaptability (the crane-brake response). The tone modulates: controlled confidence during the challenge, urgent precision during the rescue, quiet authority in the ending. The phrase "calculated spontaneity" itself is slightly meta and label-like, but the behavior pattern is consistent. Tone charges the final image of quiet mastery. Coherent through turns but the explicit labeling in the text slightly reduces organic integration.</comment>
