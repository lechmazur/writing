<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's undertaker identity is concretely embodied through occupation-specific choices (burial linen patches, cemetery ledgers, cataloging the dead). His "inadvertently stubborn" trait drives the key choice to follow the note despite hesitation, and the final act of wiring the lens into the receiver shows goal-directed persistence under literal pressure (bleeding ears, seam whispers). Internal contradiction appears when he acknowledges he "should have thrown it back" yet proceeds—a micro-choice that forecloses safer paths. The ending renunciation (keeping the cracked lens as proof, accepting the ledger) carries visible cost in the form of bodily harm and permanent entanglement with the drowned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertow. The piece teaches its pattern early—flooded streets, kelp curtains, wax-sealed books—and maintains coherent pressure as Marek descends through impossible spaces toward the brass receiver. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the library "accepts my ledger," distress signals resolve to "a single long tone," and the "chased stillness" stops running. Cost is legible on the page: bleeding ears, seam whispers, hours of bracing the beam, and the permanent burden of "keeping the cracked lens as proof." One meaningful deepening occurs when the catalog card lists Marek himself as "the last volume to be shelved," reweighting his stake from external duty to existential entanglement. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Marek, coast, package, dusk descent).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is not postcard description—it constrains every choice. Kelp curtains must be cut; tables chained to the floor signal the librarians' foresight; aisles "rearranging" into impossible angles force Marek to "occupy the gap" between volumes, a body-level tactic that advances the plot. The brass receiver, plankton light, and wax-sealed books supply resources Marek uses to stabilize the lens. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal geometry: descent path, rotunda, stacks, alcoves are legibly staged. The final image—Marek surfacing, "the sea feels lighter"—charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: he notices catalog cards, ledger entries, coffin coordinates before ambient décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address when land forgets names." Pressure tightens through accumulative layers—kelp curtain, clicking receiver, catalog card in Marek's handwriting—culminating in the realization that "the dead are drifting through impossible spaces into the open sea, unnamed and cold." One meaningful escalation: Marek must "brace it with my hands" despite bleeding ears and seam whispers, a visible trade-off between bodily integrity and the task. Agency is clear: he wires the lens, uses his own breath bubbles, and refuses to quit. The resolution is earned by his persistence, not luck. Cost is on the page: hours of physical suffering, the library's acceptance binding him as "the last volume," and the permanent scar of the cracked lens. One micro turn—the catalog card listing him—deepens personal stakes without fracturing momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rest, address, memory, and the city's refusal to let the dead drift unnamed. The broken lens gathers meaning across three beats (arrival, threading light, final proof), shifting from broken tool to functional relic to permanent burden. Marek's profession and the library's original purpose (mausoleum of stories) braid seamlessly into the thematic question of permanence versus erasure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the underwater city has accepted my ledger, giving rest a permanent address while I keep the cracked lens as proof." No overt moralizing; the final image—sea "feels lighter," chased stillness "sitting beside me"—charges the resolution with quiet inevitability. Subtext operates in silence and image: the taps spelling lost coffin coordinates, the catalog card dated "years ahead," the kelp-knitted curtain all imply more than they declare. Minor slip: "REVITALIZE THE QUIET" on the note skirts thematic echo but the phrase is immediately dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and apt; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is profession-specific: Marek notices cemetery ledgers, catalog cards, coffin coordinates, and undertaker's burial linen before ambient detail. Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—"weary undertaker," "inadvertently stubborn," "chased stillness"—while reaching for poetic compression ("kelp has knitted a curtain," "city is folding its last secrets"). Psychic distance narrows under stress: at peak pressure (bleeding ears, seam whispers), sentences compress without losing interiority. One minor register drift: "stone arches lean like drowned ribs" and "impossible spaces" edge toward elevated metaphor, but the sustained voice anchors them as Marek's occupational lens transforming surreal architecture into anatomical terms. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift from declarative ("I am Marek") to participial ("carrying the lens") to subordinate ("When I hold the broken lens"). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "diving suit patched with burial linen" conveys profession, resourcefulness, and setting constraint in one image). Clarity remains strong through surreal content: "step between two volumes and let my body occupy the gap" is legible despite impossible geometry. Minor loop: "chased stillness" recurs four times, always with slight variation, but the final reprise ("stops running, sitting beside me") reweights it sufficiently to avoid pure redundancy. One figurative muddle: "stone arches lean like drowned ribs" mixes architectural and anatomical metaphors without clear vehicle logic, though it does not obscure cause/effect. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Grammar and tense are consistent; pronoun references clear. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by charged image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library as mausoleum-of-stories is a fresh synthesis of archive, flood, and undertaker's duty. The broken lens used to gather tapping into light-beams is a non-obvious mechanical solution that grows from established constraints (brass receiver, wax, wire). Risk-taking in structure—aisles bending into "impossible spaces," catalog card dated "years ahead"—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Transformation test: the premise does not work unchanged with different names and places; Marek's profession, the specific lens mechanics, and the library's dual role are irreplaceable. Minor proximity concern: "the sea itself is listening" and "impossible spaces" echo genre conventions (cosmic dread, non-Euclidean geometry) without full transformation, but the undertaker lens and wax-sealed catalog cards ground them in specific lived detail. Conceptual integrity is strong: the piece commits fully to its flooded-archive premise and follows implications through to the ledger acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's choices create key turns: following the note despite hesitation (early setup), cutting through kelp curtain (middle beat), wiring the lens into the receiver and bracing it with bleeding hands (climax). Decision to keep the cracked lens as proof rather than return it to the water charges the ending. Trait "weary" and "inadvertently stubborn" both constrain and enable: he walks "long after the funeral is over," refuses to quit despite seam whispers. Occupation shapes tactics: uses burial linen, recognizes cemetery ledger coordinates, understands the library's mausoleum function. All three gates met; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens appears in three distinct beats: package arrival (setup), gathering taps into light-beams in the rotunda (causal middle turn), and kept "as proof" in the ending (closure charge). Specific properties matter: "shattered glass" gathers tapping into beams; "broken" state requires wiring and wax; "smelling of lamp oil and storms" primes its lighthouse origin. Removal would collapse the plot: without the lens, Marek has no tool to revitalize the receiver or stitch catalog numbers onto bones. Cost tied to the element: he must brace the beam despite bleeding ears. Minor friction: the lens is described but not handled until the rotunda, delaying tactile integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distress signals shape stakes immediately: the brass receiver "translates distant distress signals into faint taps," which spell "coordinates I recognize from cemetery ledgers." This changes Marek's understanding—signals are "not from sailors but from the restless, begging for a place that will not sink away." The concept drives the middle beat: lens gathers taps into light-lines that point deeper. Closure hinges on signals resolving: "the distress signals become a single long tone, like a sigh settling into a pillow." All three gates met; causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is dramatized in two beats: the opening choice to follow the note "yet I am inadvertently stubborn, the kind who keeps walking long after the funeral is over," and the climax where he refuses to quit "even when the pressure makes my ears bleed." The trait constrains a safer path (throwing the package back) and enables the final success (bracing the beam for hours). Visible cost on the page: bleeding ears, seam whispers, exhaustion. Setup and payoff clear; middle development present but lighter than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears on the note early, priming the goal. Marek executes it in the climax: "I revitalize the old machine with my own breath bubbles." The action is irreplaceable: without revitalizing the receiver, the library's wards fail and the dead drift unnamed. The result—"Light bursts, not whole but workable"—directly produces the resolution (stitching catalog numbers onto bones). Mechanics are specific: wire, wax, breath bubbles, hand-bracing. Cost tied to the action: hours of physical suffering. All three gates met; high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method is signaled in setup: "step between two volumes and let my body occupy the gap where there should be only water, a trick the old librarians used to hide during raids." Used once on the page to reach the reading desk where the catalog card is found. Mechanics matter: occupying the gap is the only way to access "squeezed corridors" where "sound dies" and "chased stillness becomes a pursuer." The method enables a middle turn (finding the catalog card) but does not directly shape the climax or ending. Present in two beats (corridor navigation, implicit in the "impossible spaces" throughout) but not as causally central as other elements. Setup and development gates met; payoff indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library supplies all key resources: kelp curtain (obstacle), brass receiver (tool), wax-sealed books (material for repair), chained tables (signal of foresight), alcoves labeled by surnames (destination for bones). Setting constrains every choice: Marek must navigate flooding, cut through kelp, occupy gaps between volumes, and brace the lens in the rotunda. The library's dual role—archive and mausoleum—is irreplaceable to the thematic and plot closure. Spatial choreography is coherent despite surreal geometry. The ending hinges on the library "accepting my ledger" and growing "quiet in a way that is not empty but housed." All three gates met; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled early: "After the mysterious package arrives at my door." The descent occurs "at dusk" and the task spans "hours" before Marek surfaces "before dawn." Time tightens tactics: the receiver "taps faster, pleading," and the beam "falters" repeatedly, forcing Marek to brace it continuously. Clock is tracked loosely ("hours pass, measured by the slowing taps") rather than with minute-level precision, but urgency is legible. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development present through the "hours" of bracing. Not as tightly integrated as other elements; time functions as backdrop rather than hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized early: "my work is to give rest a permanent address when land forgets names." The goal drives every choice: following the note, descending to the library, wiring the lens, bracing the beam despite bleeding. Friction between want and cost is visible: Marek acknowledges he "should have thrown it back" but proceeds; he suffers physical harm (bleeding ears, seam whispers) to complete the task. The ending directly fulfills the motivation: "the underwater city has accepted my ledger, giving rest a permanent address." All three gates met; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" recurs four times, modulating with pressure: "patient, chased stillness" in the helmet, "chased stillness becomes a pursuer" in the corridors, "at last stops running, sitting beside me" at closure. Tone is coherent through turns: eerie calm pervades the flooded streets, kelp curtain, and plankton-lit rotunda; urgency builds as the receiver taps faster; resolution arrives as the stillness stops chasing and "the library grows quiet in a way that is not empty but housed." The final image—"the sea feels lighter"—charges the tone shift with thematic weight. Setup and payoff strong; middle development present but lighter. The phrase "chased stillness" borders on abstraction but is anchored by concrete sensory cues (water pressure, helmet, kelp, taps).</comment>
