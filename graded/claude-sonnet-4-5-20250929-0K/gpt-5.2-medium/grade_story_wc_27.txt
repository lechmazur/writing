<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority shows specificity ("awkwardly confident" manifests in physical gesture and delayed reactions), and her motivation to find meaning drives micro-choices like sitting in the circle and tuning the console. The notebook functions as an anchor for goal pursuit, and her shaking hands embody contradictory resolve. However, the final moment lacks visible cost; she "did not hide" but the stakes of being discovered remain abstract, and no relationship pressure tests her stance on the page—Sael is absent, the footsteps are a shadow without consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ilya has reignited contact with the rebellion via the stone-circle hum and receives acknowledgment, crystallizing her role as messenger with the next coordinates in hand. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory detail (hum, opera glasses, coordinates, console alignment) and culminates in the reply that reweights the lull into active resumption. Orientation anchors are present early (spaceport bay, barefoot stargazer, post-raid lull). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum becomes a communication method, narrowing her options to this risky transmission. Cost is conceptual—she has exposed herself and the network—but the on-page consequences remain abstract; the footsteps pause without confrontation, and we don't see tactical forfeiture or immediate danger materialized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: cold plating, cracked skylight, unpowered shuttle, and the ancient stone circle all constrain and enable Ilya's actions. The circle's hum is both sensory anchor and plot mechanism, guiding her console tuning. Thunder and serenity interweave to charge the final image. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, filtering perception through brass-and-scar texture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the bay's emptiness reflects the rebellion's lull, making setting inseparable from stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting the fractured rebellion—is signaled early and tightens when Ilya decodes the hum, tunes the console, and sends the burst. One meaningful escalation occurs: moving from passive observation (opera glasses, notebook) to active transmission with jammer-evading risk. The console reply validates her method and supplies new coordinates, deepening commitment. However, agency at closure is muted; the footsteps arrive but produce no on-page choice or tactical shift. Cost is implied (exposure, next mission) but not viscerally demonstrated—no loss of resource, no immediate danger crystallized, no visible price paid that alters her next move on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—meaning discovered through method and persistence—emerges organically from Ilya's decoding of the hum and her promise to "return to meaning." The stone circle operates as both literal tool and conceptual anchor, linking ancient pilgrimage to present rebellion without overt allegory. The final image (standing on the stones as footsteps approach) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: rebellion persists through small, resonant acts rather than grand declarations. Subtext operates in gesture (barefoot contact, shaking hands) and in the choice to send "Reignite" as instruction rather than slogan. No thematic echo mars the ending; the piece trusts image over statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Ilya; perceptual signature is specific (stargazer who refuses boots, judges distances through opera glasses, counts beats by star positions). Diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("thunderous serenity," "margin of daylight") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. However, some filter verbs ("realized," "saw," "felt") dull immediacy in peak beats, and a few constructions drift toward omniscient framing ("as if the storm were a drummer") without full grounding in Ilya's interiority. The phrase "awkwardly confident" is told early but demonstrated in gesture; overall voice is distinct and controlled, with only minor slips under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and textured with strong imagery ("oily gusts," "seams between stones," "thin carrier wave"), and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. Information density is high in the middle section where opera glasses, hum, and coordinates converge. However, several passages loop or over-elaborate: "the bay held only the thunder outside and the serenity of empty metal" paraphrases the earlier mood without added pressure; "awkwardly confident" is restated in varied phrasing across beats; and metaphoric density occasionally muddles clarity ("the bay breathed in slow, oily gusts" anthropomorphizes without clear POV anchor). Template cadence appears in chains like "She sat… lifted… watched… realized." A few figurative choices strain coherence (thunder as drummer, bay breathing), and the final third's sensory catalog (thunder, skylight, console, stones) risks saturation. No severe artifacts touch closure, but mid-section loops and filter-verb stacks reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient pilgrimage stones, sci-fi rebellion, and opera glasses as navigation tool is fresh and specific. The hum-as-communication method avoids stock radio tropes by grounding transmission in resonance and star-position mapping. Ilya's barefoot sensory choice and the notebook's cryptic instruction ("Find the hum") supply memorable particulars. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, and the final image—standing on stones as footsteps approach—feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the "lull in rebellion" frame echoes familiar resistance-narrative templates, and the serenity-amid-storm tonal choice, while executed well, is not wholly novel. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than linear confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ilya (barefoot stargazer) is present throughout, her barefoot stance signals sensory priority early, and her choices—sitting in the circle, mapping beats, tuning the console—create key turns. She shapes the reignition action directly. Closure shows her standing on the stones as footsteps approach, a stance that reweights her earlier solitary observation. However, the "stargazer" label is told more than used; opera glasses serve navigation but star knowledge remains abstract. The barefoot trait constrains how she experiences the bay but does not visibly cost her or enable a climactic move. All three gates are present; causal involvement is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear early, are used to watch star positions and decode the hum's coordinates, and return in the final paragraph ("raised the opera glasses one last time") with shifted meaning (dawn replaces stars, yet the circle's note persists). Two beats: initial star-watching and final dawn observation. The object enables the coordinate mapping but could be replaced by another optical tool with minor edits; its vintage-patron history adds texture but does not constrain choice. The reprise reweights but does not charge the closure with cost. Three gates present; causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lull in rebellion frames the entire stakes: leaders jailed/fled, prayers over, the bay empty. It shapes Ilya's isolation and the risk of reigniting contact. The concept surfaces in multiple beats (opening context, Sael's vanishing, the decision to send "Reignite," the reply affirming resumption) and drives the climactic transmission. Closure directly answers the lull by ending it via the stone-circle network. The lull is not merely theme; it alters options on the page—Ilya acts because the silence has lasted too long. All three gates present; causal pressure strong; cost tied to exposure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is told early and demonstrated in "shoulders too square and smile too late," and again in "awkwardly confident enough to pretend she understood" when opening the notebook. At closure she remains "awkward in her confidence" as a stance. However, the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a key action with cost—it colors her manner but does not narrow her tactical options or force a tradeoff. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent (introduced after first third as repeated label). Swappable with "uncertain but determined" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reignite" is the climactic action: Ilya sends the code-word as instruction, receives acknowledgment, and the lull ends. The verb structures the final third and redefines the rebellion's state from dormant to active. It appears in her message ("Reignite, she wrote") and as thematic answer to the central question. Setup via the lull context, development through console tuning, payoff at transmission and reply. Removing "reignite" would require wholesale reframing. Causal pressure high; closure linkage direct; cost is exposure. Not fully indispensable—another action-verb could serve—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle is introduced early under the tarpaulin, its hum noted and linked to rebel radio history. Ilya counts beats, maps them to star positions, then tunes the console "by the hum" to align carrier wave with the resonance. The circle's mechanics matter throughout: it listens, answers, and enables jammerless transmission. The method shapes multiple beats (discovery, coordinate decoding, console alignment, reply receipt) and charges the final image (she stands on the stones as the note holds steady). All three gates; strong causal pressure; high irreplaceability. The circle's sibling-network concept is told but not fully dramatized; slight abstraction at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is established immediately and supplies concrete resources: cold plating, cracked skylight for star-watching, tarpaulin hiding the circle, mothballed console. The bay's emptiness reflects the lull and its acoustic properties (hangar doors rattle, rivets quiver) support the hum's presence. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The bay constrains her to this location and enables the console use. Present in all three gates; causal involvement in one major beat (console scene); closure shows her on the stones within the bay as footsteps approach. Not irreplaceable—another rebel site could function—but tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" is named in the opening sentence and "first true light" edges into the skylight at transmission, dawn washes stars away at closure. The timeframe brackets the action and creates a visual progression from dusk/storm to dawn. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Ilya's moves are not racing the clock. Setup and payoff present; middle development minimal. The time passage is atmospheric but swappable with "one night" or "hours of storm" without structural loss. Lyric reprise reweights mood but does not carry cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Discovering meaning is stated as her promise to herself and enacted through her investigation: examining scattered tools/banners, sitting in the circle, mapping the hum, sending the burst. The motivation drives her choices across beats and culminates in the reply that validates her method. Desire is dramatized in action rather than told-only. Setup early, development through decoding and transmission, payoff when the reply arrives. However, internal friction is modest—she never doubts the search itself, only her competence ("pretend she understood"). Cost is implied but not sharply felt. All three gates; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is named explicitly and sustained: thunder rolls/strikes while the bay holds serenity, "as if the storm were a drummer keeping time." The paradox charges the opening, middle (console scene), and closure (footsteps pause in serene space). Tone modulates subtly—urgency rises during transmission, calm returns as she waits—but the oxymoron remains stable rather than developing. The final image integrates both elements (she lets "the thunderous serenity of the place speak for her"). Setup, development, and payoff present; tone supports closure but is somewhat static. A tighter modulation or visible cost tied to maintaining serenity under threat would elevate.</comment>
