<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core choice—to confess the false report—emerges from reflection rather than dramatic pressure in scene, weakening motivation at closure. Her interiority leans toward articulate self-diagnosis ("scars, she knew, were stories that refused to be private") rather than embodied contradiction under fire. Jonah's arc from freeze to resolve reads schematic; his fear is told more than shown through micro-choices that test commitment. The backstory with Eli is vivid but occupies significant real estate without on-page friction that would charge Mara's present decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece reads under a Hybrid lens (reflective accumulation into a causal decision to confess), but the closure—Mara's stated intent to confess and Jonah's promise—lands as declaration rather than dramatized cost; we see no on-page consequence or foreclosed path, only a vow. The cost is conceptually legible (sleep debt, Eli's lost lesson) but remains in summary, not a visible beat that alters present options. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara shares the bargain, shifting Jonah's stance, but the final image ("carrying the lesson like a lantern") abstracts rather than grounds the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, porcelain box, and Pulaski anchor setting and prop with specificity. The box's "hairline fractures held together by wax" recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (climb, lookout tower, flat stone). The setting does not pressure a choice in scene—it is a reflective backdrop—but the porcelain box constrains the confession moment and charges Jonah's understanding, meeting the micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's moral debt and Jonah's paralysis—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when Mara narrates the Eli bargain, which shifts Jonah's fear into resolve, but this turn is conveyed through monologue rather than contested action. The cost (Mara's lost sleep, Eli's lost responsibility) is conceptually clear but not paid on the page; we see intent to confess, not consequence. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; coincidence (Jonah waiting) enables the teaching moment without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—innocence versus accountability, care as both gift and theft—emerges from the Eli backstory and the box metaphor without overt moralizing. "Courage is not unbroken; it is held together" verges on thesis statement but is anchored to the singed marbles. The final image ("carrying the lesson like a lantern") offers resonance but leans abstract; it gestures toward transformation without a non-literal answer grounded in scene particulars. The piece invites reflection yet risks delivering wisdom as aphorism rather than through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Mara with clear psychic distance. The perceptual signature—"the moon glazing its fractures so they looked like small rivers," "the forest began to scream in sap and snapping limbs"—is distinct and sensory. Dialogue between Mara and Jonah feels purposeful and goal-driven, though brief. Register occasionally elevates ("translate pain into a universal language," "a new grammar") in ways that read more literary than character-particular under stress, but the lapses are minor and the voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Two friction points lower the score: "reflecting deeply on the cabin fire and on every shouted command that had not reached her own heart" is overwritten and abstract where concrete embodiment would serve; the final paragraph relies on template phrasing ("understood a new grammar," "carrying the lesson like a lantern") that blunts specificity. No loops or scaffold in the closure beat, and propulsion is clear, but the peak teaching moment leans on elevated diction that distances rather than charges the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—firefighter mentor sharing a moral bargain to unstick a rookie—is familiar but executed with specificity (the porcelain box, the flare, the wax-held fractures). The Eli backstory adds texture, yet the ridge-top teaching scene itself follows a recognizable template: guilt confession, object lesson, redemptive vow. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece plays safely within its lane. Transformation is partial: the box and marbles do particular work, but the emotional arc remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's choice to share the Eli story shifts Jonah's stance (middle beat) and her stated intent to confess frames closure, but both are conveyed through monologue rather than contested action with visible cost. Present by setup, involved in two beats, but swappable with another mentor figure without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The box appears in setup (pocket), is placed on the stone and opened in the teaching beat, and returns in the final paragraph when Jonah picks it up. Its fractures anchor the "courage is not unbroken" line and charge the closure image. Causal role in two beats; irreplaceable as the physical embodiment of the bargain theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Bargained innocence drives the Eli backstory, shapes Mara's stated intent to confess, and informs Jonah's shift. The concept is named and explained rather than tested through on-page friction, but it reweights prior material at closure. Present in setup (via backstory), middle (confession to Jonah), and ending (vow to confess).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gently skilled with a Pulaski and a hose line" appears once in the Eli flashback. No on-page moment where gentleness constrains or enables a present choice with cost. Ornamental label without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Enlightenment occurs when Mara tells the Eli story, shifting Jonah's understanding. The beat is summarized ("she chose to enlighten him") rather than dramatized through contested exchange. Present in the middle and shaping the ending vow, but swappable with "teach" or "confess to" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By reflecting deeply on the cabin fire and on every shouted command" is named in one sentence as the trigger for Mara's decision to enlighten. The mechanics are asserted, not shown; we see no on-page moment where reflection visibly alters her stance. Late signal, summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path frames the entire scene and anchors spatial movement (climb, lookout tower, descent). It does not pressure a choice—Mara and Jonah could have this exchange anywhere—but it provides coherent choreography and the "moonlit" detail recurs to glaze the box's fractures. Setup and ending present; no middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears in one early sentence. No tracking of elapsed time, no clock that tightens decisions. Ornamental phrasing without stakes or pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "translate pain into a universal language" is named early and motivates the ridge walk and the teaching moment. It shapes her choice to share the Eli story but remains abstract; no on-page friction where this desire conflicts with another want. Present in setup and middle, informs ending, but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is glossed ("her voice held a hard softness that made rookies listen") and enacted in Mara's blend of confession and instruction. Tone modulates from reflective climb to charged teaching beat to resolved descent. Coherent through turns and present in the final image ("promised to stand steady"), but the diction occasionally elevates past the established register.</comment>
