<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction—wanting to reach the pre-decision moment rather than rewrite the past—is embodied through her physical choices (carrying the shard, tearing letters, staying three nights). The brother Elias arrives drawn by "rumors" and "the ache of all the messages he never received," yet his emotional state remains under-rendered; we see him only as "older, wary." The apology at closure feels earned by the three-night vigil, but Mara's internal texture leans toward diagnostic clarity ("tired of decisions made in loneliness") rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene, and the final beat summarizes the apology rather than letting us hear its specific words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early: Mara, mangrove labyrinth, dusk. The story reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the three-night vigil, spirit messages deepen the ritual frame, and the brother's arrival crystallizes the stakes into an on-page apology with the shard as witness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology spoken, the choice made, condensation fading) with felt cost—Mara forfeits the rehearsed safety of unsent letters. One continuity slip: "heals in moonlight" repairs the shard's edge, yet the shard was already "chipped" when she arrived, and no prior wound to the stone is dramatized on the page; the healing reads more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid, purposeful detail: roots clasp ankles "like questions," the stilt house window is "filmed with salt," and the spirits' song sharpens "into rain, into footsteps on stone." The shard and the condensation messages function as micro-setting, constraining Mara's choices (she must carry the shard through the maze, wait for moonlight, interpret spirit script). Spatial choreography is clean—stilt house, window, sill, water below, skiff arrival—and the brother's breath mingling with hers at the window charges the final image with physical intimacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the moment before deciding" to rehearse an unsent apology—is signaled in the opening and tightens across three beats: reaching the stilt house, tearing the first letter (spirit warning "DO NOT CHOOSE YET"), and the three-night vigil that earns the brother's arrival. Mara's agency drives each step (carrying the shard, evoking the courthouse scene, staying until she can speak), and the cost is legible: she renounces the fictional safety of sealed letters for live vulnerability. One escalation note: the spirits' warning and the subsequent vigil deepen pressure accumulative-textural rather than narrowing options causally, consistent with the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring motif of "before deciding" versus "after": the shard's healing, the torn letters floating as "proof," and the condensation script "NOT BACK, BEFORE." The spirits' role as witnesses and the brother's arrival both anchor the apology in presence rather than rehearsal. The final image—condensation fading "not from magic failing but from the choice finally being made"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One debit: "fierce tenderness" is stated twice (once in narration, once at closure) rather than fully embodied through contradictory action, and "tired of decisions made in loneliness" edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close on Mara with a lyric, elevated register ("a state of courage," "the smallest mercy"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices the shard, the spirits' song, the condensation script—but diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("the exact hinge of time," "a state of paper but a state of courage") that sits above her embodied stress. No dialogue appears on the page despite the brother's arrival and the apology being "spoken," which robs the closure of specificity. The repeated phrase "fierce tenderness" functions as a tonal anchor but also as a label rather than enacted subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("satchel of unsent letters pressed to her ribs as if paper could steady a heart"), but the piece suffers from multiple paraphrase loops: "the stone healed in moonlight" is stated, then "knitting its jagged edge smooth" restates the same fact without new pressure; "she tore it into strips that she floated on the dark water" is followed by "offering the spirits proof" which summarizes the same beat. Template cadence appears in clusters: "and the spirits' song sharpened… and she reached… and she understood… and writing new letters… and spoke the apology." Filter-verb stacks ("she dared to press," "she felt fierce tenderness flare") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. One root artifact: the apology is summarized ("spoke the apology that had lived only in unsent letters") rather than shown, which flattens the closure line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of unsent letters, a gargoyle shard as memory anchor, and mangrove spirits offering "the moment before deciding" is specific and non-obvious. The frame resists easy rewind fantasy by offering rehearsal-in-presence instead, and the spirits' condensation script supplies a fresh mechanism. Two debits: the "cryptic medium" role and the mangrove spirit chorus both lean on familiar magical-realism furniture, and the apology's content remains generic ("she had come to find the moment before deciding because she was tired of decisions made in loneliness") rather than irreplaceably particular to Mara and Elias's shared history.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—carrying the shard, reaching the stilt house, tearing the letter, staying three nights, placing the shard in Elias's hand—create all major turns. She reads as a medium only in the sense of spirit contact; her "cryptic" quality is told rather than demonstrated through obscure speech or ritual ambiguity, and the medium role does not constrain her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shard appears in five beats: carried in the satchel, set on the sill, traced as a conductor's baton to evoke the courthouse scene, healed by moonlight (edge smoothing), and placed in Elias's hand at closure. Its evolving state—jagged to smooth—charges the apology with physical proof of transformation. One gate slip: the shard's "healing" introduces a new property mid-story without prior setup, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the opening, are torn and floated as proof in the middle beat, and reappear as "new letters that she did not seal" and "the apology that had lived only in unsent letters" at closure. The concept shapes Mara's tactics (she must offer proof of wanting the unwritten moment), and the spirits teach her "unsent was not a state of paper but a state of courage." The final spoken apology converts unsent to sent, closing the arc. One debit: the letters' content remains generic, reducing specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" appears twice: the shard's edge "knitting… smooth as a tongue learning gentleness" and Mara's own scraped palms healing over three nights. The trait enables the shard to become a tactile gift ("its edge now smooth") and metaphorically mirrors Mara's rehearsal-into-readiness. One gate slip: the healing is introduced mid-story without setup, and no prior wound to the stone is dramatized, so the trait reads symbolic rather than causal. No visible cost is tied to waiting for moonlight; Mara stays three nights, but the story does not dramatize urgency or sacrifice during that wait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Evoke" drives the courthouse-gargoyle ritual: Mara traces the shard "like a conductor's baton" and the spirits' song sharpens "into rain, into footsteps on stone, into her brother's face turning away." This beat grants her access to "the exact hinge of time" and enables the rehearsal that earns the final apology. The action is signaled early ("believed the shard remembered that moment and could evoke it again") and paid off on the page. One debit: the evocation itself is summarized rather than dramatized in real-time sensory detail, reducing specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Condensation messages appear in three beats: the spirits write when Mara's breath touches the glass, "DO NOT CHOOSE YET," "NOT BACK, BEFORE," and "SAY IT HERE" at closure. The method is signaled early ("spirits answered by writing messages in condensation") and its mechanics matter—Mara must wait for the window to fog, interpret the script, and act on the warnings. The messages constrain her choices (she tears the letter after "DO NOT CHOOSE YET") and charge the final image (brother's breath mingles, script blooms between them). One debit: the spirits' agency and criteria remain unexplained, so the method reads more atmospheric than systematic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid detail (roots clasp ankles, air hums with names, spirits sing through the slats) and functions as the ordeal Mara must traverse to reach the stilt house. The setting pressures her journey and houses the spirits whose messages constrain her choices. The singing spirits are woven through all major beats, and the water below receives the torn letter strips. One debit: the labyrinth itself does not alter tactics after the opening—once Mara reaches the stilt house, the maze recedes into backdrop and the window/shard/spirits become the active micro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken" frames the opening and is reprised at closure ("the choice finally being made"). The timeframe is conceptual—a liminal zone before decision—and Mara's goal is explicitly to dwell there. The three-night vigil measures her rehearsal, and the brother's arrival on "the fourth dawn" signals the end of waiting. One debit: the conceptual frame is stated more than dramatized through ticking urgency; Mara's three nights pass in summary rather than escalating pressure, so the timeframe charges theme but does not tighten tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to find the moment before deciding" drives every major choice: carrying the shard, reaching the stilt house, tearing the letter, evoking the courthouse scene, staying three nights, and speaking the apology. The spirits teach her the distinction between rewind and rehearsal, and her final confession to Elias—"she had come to find the moment before deciding because she was tired of decisions made in loneliness"—articulates the motivation. One debit: the motivation is told more than shown in contradictory friction; Mara's internal conflict (pride versus surrender) is named in the evocation beat but not enacted through competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is stated twice: once when Mara interprets the spirits' warning ("she felt fierce tenderness flare in her chest") and again at closure ("with fierce tenderness she confessed"). The tone is coherent—care mixed with determination—and charges the final image (breath mingling, apology spoken, spirits as witnesses). One debit: the tone is labeled rather than enacted through contradictory gesture or subtext; Mara's actions read tender (placing the shard, confessing) but the "fierce" quality is asserted more than embodied through resistance or cost on the page.</comment>
