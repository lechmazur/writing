<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sava's motivation is clear—restore balance through sound—and his methods (patient walking, tuning fork, footstep rhythms) are specific and consistent. The character remains cryptic by design, but his interior contradiction is thin: he never doubts, never faces a genuine cost that forecloses a path. Mara's arc from watcher to participant adds mild pressure, but her choice to join reads convenient rather than conflicted. The ending grants success without visible sacrifice; Sava tucks away the fork and watches, having won without bleeding beyond his soles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (Sava, Lumen Gate, before collapse) and follows an accumulative lens: footstep rhythms layer until the decree carrier stops. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the town proves itself alive, decree is folded), and the final image reweights prior material—ghost town becomes home. Cost is legible but light: Sava's bleeding soles are mentioned once and not revisited; the threat of abandonment is resolved by collective sound without genuine trade-off. The lens holds, but the victory arrives without a felt price at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway functions as both spatial anchor and conceptual throat/ear, shaping Sava's method and constraining the final collective measure. Cobblestones, kiln, fountain, and belfry are tactile and purposeful, each responding to rhythm with physical consequence (shutters unwarp, lintel levels). Sensory detail is selective—dust spirals, hush, dull ring—and filtered through Sava's tuning mission. The micro-setting (archway, street, fork) charges the ending when the footsteps set the fork singing and the town answers, though the decree carrier's sudden stop relies on told effect rather than embodied response.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove the district alive to prevent abandonment—is signaled early and tightens when the decree carrier arrives. Pressure accumulates through each corrected cadence (shutters, lintel, bell ringing untouched), but escalation is additive rather than forecloses options. Sava's agency is present (he walks, tunes, recruits), yet the final solution—collective footsteps make the carrier fold his paper—arrives without visible cost or hard choice. The carrier's reversal is told ("proven itself alive") rather than dramatized as a difficult calculus, reducing the felt price of success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—community as instrument, neglect as dissonance—emerges from concrete action (footsteps, fork, bells) without thesis statements. The archway-as-ear/throat metaphor and the notion of "shared balance" are purposeful and consistently developed. The ending reweights prior material: "ghost town revival turned into home, shared balance restored" completes the thematic arc without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Sava's riddles and the town's physical responses. One weakness: the decree carrier's capitulation tells the thematic payoff rather than letting the final image carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Sava; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent—elevated, patient, tuned to sound—and perceptual signature is clear (Sava hears confession in a tuning fork, treats footsteps as metronomes). Dialogue is sparse and functional: Mara's question and Sava's riddle answer establish his cryptic nature. Minor drift: "infinitely patient" and "cryptic" are told labels rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Diction remains stable, though phrases like "basalt that swallowed sound" and "ebony tuning fork...black as drowned wood" edge toward decorative doubling without narrative cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no obvious template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character method, or town response. Minor loop: "infinitely patient" appears twice as a descriptor without added nuance. "As if hearing a confession" and "as if the tower were waking" rely on stock simile stems. The phrase "ghost town revival turned into home" summarizes rather than images the transformation. Overwriting check: figurative language is dense but controlled; "frozen river," "drowned wood," "contented resonance" are vivid without contradicting each other. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—tuning a town's architecture and rhythm to prevent collapse—is specific and non-obvious. Combining sound, urban decay, and collective action through footsteps feels fresh. Execution avoids generic ghost-town tropes by grounding revival in acoustics and patient ritual. Risk: the cryptic tuner and communal footstep solution could veer into fable, but concrete detail (bleeding soles, sagging lintel, dry fountain giving a wet note) anchors it. One derivative note: the "prove the place is alive to save it" arc is familiar; transformation comes through the tuning-fork method rather than emotional calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sava is introduced immediately and present in every beat. His choices—strike the fork, pace and count steps, recruit Mara, lead the final measure—drive all major turns. The character is cryptic by design, but his decisions alter tactics (walking patterns, dog rhythm, collective measure) and enable the closure (decree carrier stops). Cost is light: bleeding soles mentioned once without later constraint. Strong setup, continuous development, and closure participation, but the final choice feels collective rather than Sava's alone, diluting protagonist agency at the peak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in the opening third, is used in multiple beats (struck against archway, held near ear, tapped to adjust dogs, set singing by footsteps), and is present at closure (Sava tucks it away after success). Its frequency matters: Sava uses it to diagnose imbalance, guide rhythm, and validate correction. The fork's final tucking-away marks resolution. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure participation. Minor friction: the fork is more diagnostic tool than constraint—it never fails or forces a hard trade-off—reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's spine: the premise (half-ghost town, doors latched, ovens cold) frames every action, and the ending ("ghost town revival turned into home") completes the arc. The concept shapes stakes (prevent abandonment), tactics (walking patterns to restore resonance), and closure (decree carrier acknowledges life). Sava's entire mission is to reverse the town's decline through sound. The concept is indispensable: remove it and the story collapses. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with high causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is stated twice and shown through Sava's repeated nightly walks ("Night after night, before the collapse...he walked until his soles bled"). The trait enables his method—accumulative tuning requires endurance—and constrains his approach (no shortcuts, no impatience). Present in setup and development. Minor friction: the trait is told more than tested; Sava never faces a moment where patience costs him an option or where impatience would serve better. The bleeding soles hint at cost but aren't revisited. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's action: Sava explicitly intends to "rebuild the place from its own pulse." Every beat—pacing streets, correcting rhythms, recruiting townsfolk—enacts rebuilding. The term appears early and the action shapes all major turns: shutters unwarp, lintel levels, bell rings, decree is folded. Closure depends on the collective rebuild (footsteps set the archway singing, proving life). Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Minor friction: the action is more restoration than construction, and "rebuild" could be swapped for "revive" or "restore" with minor edits, reducing absolute irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Footsteps on cobblestones are introduced early ("counted his steps on the cobblestones, heel to toe"), developed continuously (dogs pad in counterpoint, Mara joins to braid rhythm, townsfolk walk in threes), and deliver closure ("footsteps...set the fork singing so deep that dust rose"). The method is specific—rhythm corrects architectural dissonance—and shapes all attempts. Mechanics matter: each pattern makes the fork hum differently, and the final collective cadence proves life. Indispensable: remove footsteps and the tuning logic collapses. High causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient archway is introduced in the opening line, functions as "the town's ear" and conceptual anchor, and hosts the final collective measure. Sava sits beneath it, strikes his fork against it, and leads townsfolk under it for the climactic test. The archway supplies the spatial constraint (sound is swallowed and echoed) and charges the ending (footsteps under the archway set the fork singing). Strong setup, development, and closure participation. Minor friction: the archway could be replaced by another resonant structure (belfry, plaza) with moderate edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is signaled in the opening and repeated at midpoint ("before the collapse that everyone predicted but no one named"). The timeframe creates urgency—abandonment is imminent, decree day arrives—and tightens the final beat (decree carrier stops on the morning it's due). Time shapes tactics: Sava walks "night after night" until the deadline. Present in setup and closure. Friction: the collapse is abstract and never dramatized as a ticking clock; the decree's timing is told rather than felt, reducing pressure. Functional but could be sharpened to higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sava's motivation—"restore shared balance"—is stated early and drives every choice: he tunes not bells but "balance shared between streets and hearts." The desire shapes tactics (walking patterns, recruiting townsfolk) and closure (balance restored, town revives). Present in setup, development, and payoff. Friction: the motivation is told and conceptual rather than dramatized as conflicting want versus cost. Sava never doubts, never faces a trade-off where balance competes with another need. The motivation enables but doesn't constrain, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is established early ("that wild hush between leaving and staying") and modulates through the narrative: the hush is frightened, then becomes "less frightened," then resolves into communal sound. The tone charges key beats—"wheel snapped...air shivered," "low, contented resonance," dust rising in spirals—and holds through the ending (quiet acknowledgment, no fanfare). Coherent under pressure and present at closure. Minor friction: "wild hush" as a phrase is poetic but slightly ornamental; the tone could be called "eerie quiet" or "tense silence" with similar effect, reducing absolute irreplaceability.</comment>
