<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's characterization is embodied through his sensory methodology—listening to tools, feeling warmth shifts on knuckles, counting sizzles—and his calm authority emerges through action rather than assertion. His blindness functions as a genuine constraint that shapes his repair technique rather than a label. The courier and Captain Sera remain functional but thinly sketched; they apply pressure without interior contradiction. Lio's final instruction to Sera ("treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering") carries thematic weight but stops short of a visible internal cost or renunciation that would elevate the arc into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (depot, Lio, repair shop, morning cheers) and sustains a clean causal chain: broken drone arrives under time pressure → Lio diagnoses through his signature method → repair succeeds → Sera departs with renewed faith. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the Meridian lifts anchor, Sera turns toward the drone's song, "guided by repaired faith"—the final image crystallizes trust and direction with undeniable emotional cost (the risk of navigation by sound in fog). The cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits Charged Poise. The lens is Causal throughout, with one meaningful tightening (the repair under deadline) and a legible before/after in Sera's stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, slate fountain channel, and glass roof are not mere backdrop; the fountain becomes the diagnostic instrument ("light told him angles, and angles told him where a broken thing wanted to go"), and the mist/harbor setting frames the navigation stakes. Lio's blindness inverts the usual sensory hierarchy—he listens to the hiss where colors meet stone, feels warmth shift across knuckles—so the environment is filtered through his particular skill set. The anchor chain at the quay, "water spilling from each link like beads from Lio's channel," charges the final image by echoing the repair method in the ship's departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (repair the drone before the Meridian departs) is signaled early and tightens through the harbor horn booms and Sera's arrival "boots dripping." Lio's agency is clear—he diagnoses, patches, calibrates—and the cost is implicit in the timeframe and Sera's trust. The piece offers one meaningful tightening (the two-hour window, the ship beginning to drift) rather than multiple reversals, which fits the length. The final turn is Sera's acceptance of Lio's method and her choice to navigate by sound, but the cost remains atmospheric (fog, risk) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page that would push this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: repair as a form of faith ("lived by decoding feedback into direction"), blindness enabling rather than limiting perception, and the closing image of navigation by trust in repaired systems. The hummingbird drone and fountain recur with shifted meaning—first diagnostic tool, then metaphor for the ship's anchor chain—without overt statement. The final line ("guided by repaired faith") risks a thematic echo but is anchored in the concrete image of Sera turning her wheel toward the drone's chirps, so it reads as resonance rather than moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Sera's success is open, and the fog remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Lio with stable distance; his perceptual signature (listening, warmth on skin, angles inferred from refraction) is consistent and voice-specific. The prose modulates subtly—calm and methodical during repair, slightly urgent as the harbor horn booms—without breaking texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Lio's "That is how I oversee" and his final instruction to Sera carry subtext (trust in indirect perception). One minor slip: "the depot trembled with distant cheers" and "the depot's glass roof shivered" repeat the same device (building personification) within a short span, a small rhythmic echo that doesn't materially harm but prevents a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (the fountain doubles as diagnostic tool, the prism warms his knuckles, the solder "sizzles" counted by sound). No loops or scaffold. Two craft slips prevent higher scoring: "He asked the courier to open the depot doors, so mist and harbor light could slip inside. At his request, the courier poured clear water into the slate channel" repeats the request-fulfillment pattern redundantly across adjacent beats. Additionally, "Though blind since childhood, he oversaw every bench by listening to tools and to people" front-loads exposition that could be dramatized first; the telling is efficient but slightly dulls the opening's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of blindness enabling advanced repair through light refraction and sound is a fresh synthesis; the fountain as diagnostic instrument and the translation of chirps into bearing cues avoid stock "magical artisan" templates. The premise (drone repair under time pressure) is familiar, but the execution through Lio's specific methodology—feeling warmth shift, hearing color hiss on stone—transforms it into something particular. The courier and Sera remain functional archetypes without distinct interiority, which keeps this from the 8.5+ band where every element would be irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio ("heartfelt artisan") is present throughout and drives the repair action; his diagnosis, patching, and calibration are on-page choices that alter the outcome. His attribute (blindness) constrains and enables his method. Present in setup, middle action, and closure instruction to Sera. Causal pressure is strong; specificity high (his listening, prism use). Not indispensable in the sense that another skilled repairer could theoretically fill the role, but his particular method (sound, refraction) is tied to the story's thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone appears in setup (crate arrival, "faint whir"), is handled across multiple beats (lifted, frame examined, wing aligned under spectrum, lenses cleaned, released above fountain, chirps described), and is causally active at closure (darts into fog, Sera turns wheel toward its sound). Its broken state creates the problem; its repair and chirp pattern enable navigation. Irreplaceable: the drone's feedback-as-direction function mirrors Lio's own methodology and charges the final image. Cost is tied to its use (Sera's navigation risk).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair shop (Bay Twelve, oil and cedar smell, tools, fountain channel) is the setting and frames the action, but "repair shop" as a concept is somewhat generic—any skilled workspace could serve. The story specifies *how* Lio repairs (refraction, sound), which deepens integration, but the shop itself does not impose unique constraints or resources beyond the fountain. Present in setup and throughout; shapes logistics but is not irreplaceable in the way the drone or Lio's method are.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is not ornamental; it constrains and enables Lio's entire repair process (listening to tools, feeling warmth, counting sizzles). His blindness is dramatized through action in at least three beats: diagnosis by touch and sound, prism alignment by warmth on knuckles, calibration by listening to chirp patterns. Visible trade-off: he cannot see the drone but reads it through refraction and sound, a methodology no sighted repairer would use. Present in setup, middle action, and implicitly at closure (his instruction to Sera mirrors his own indirect perception). Cost is conceptual and operational throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Patch" (cutting brass, shaping until water lights it evenly, soldering by sound) is the central repair action and occupies a distinct middle beat. It is causally necessary—without the patch, the drone cannot fly—and is shown on the page with specificity (sound count, warmth). However, it is one of several repair steps (lens cleaning, calibration also matter) and does not alone redefine the story's options. Present in middle and implicit in closure (the drone's flight). Functional and specific, but not uniquely irreplaceable compared to the overall repair sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Examining light refraction through water features" is Lio's signature diagnostic method, signaled early ("Light told him angles, and angles told him where a broken thing wanted to go"), used on-page in the repair beat (prism above stream, feeling warmth shift, hearing hiss where colors meet stone, aligning the wing under the spectrum), and echoed at closure (anchor chain spilling water "like beads from Lio's channel"). The method is irreplaceable—it is how a blind artisan diagnoses a physical problem—and its mechanics matter causally. Present in setup explanation, middle action, and charged reprise at the ending. Cost and specificity are both high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot provides atmosphere and frames the navigation stakes (fog hides buoys, drone scouts currents). The fountain channel is a functional resource (Lio pours water to create the refraction diagnostic). The depot's condensation pipes feed the fountain, linking setting to method. Present in setup, used in middle action, and the anchor/quay appear at closure. The depot itself does not constrain choices as sharply as the drone or method do; it is more backdrop than active pressure, though the mist/fog stakes are real. Two-gate fulfillment (setup, closure echo) but middle development is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"As an anchor lifts for a ship's maiden voyage" establishes urgency (the Meridian is departing, the drone "failed two hours before launch") and recurs at closure ("anchor chain rise"). Time pressure is dramatized through harbor horn booms and Sera's arrival. The timeframe tightens decisions (Lio must repair quickly) and is tracked adequately. However, the two-hour window is declared rather than counted down beat-by-beat, and the story does not show Lio racing a visible clock. Present in setup and closure; shapes middle urgency but is not irreplaceable—the repair could occur under other deadlines with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To decode feedback into direction" is Lio's core motivation, stated early ("he, too, lived by decoding feedback into direction") and dramatized through his repair method (listening to wrong tensions, aligning by refraction, writing calibration in raised dots, instructing Sera to "treat every chirp as a question the sea is answering"). The motivation is not conflicted—Lio does not struggle with doubt—but it is enacted on the page with specificity and cost (the risk of trusting indirect signals). Present in setup, middle action, and closure instruction. Functional across beats and thematically charged, but the lack of internal friction keeps this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is established early ("ran it with a magnetic calm that made hurried travelers slow their steps") and sustained through the repair sequence (Lio's patient diagnosis, his invitation to the courier to "feel the vibration," his measured instruction to Sera). The tone does not shift into urgency even under deadline pressure, which is consistent with the character and charges the ending (calm as a form of mastery). The final image of Sera turning her wheel "toward the sound, guided by repaired faith" carries that tone forward. Coherent and purposeful, modulating subtly without breaking, but the static quality (no sharp contrast or pressure-driven modulation) prevents a score above 8.0.</comment>
