<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to return the ribbon and her pride in strictness facing the guild's betrayal supply internal contradiction. Her improvisational repair earns the ending choice, though the boy's scowl-to-surprise beat is lightly sketched. The canon's grandson and sister remain functional but occupy more stage space than their pressure justifies, and the sister's vow-reversal feels convenient rather than inevitable. Embodied emotion appears ("stung," "laughed despite herself"), but several beats rely on summary tags rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: who (Mira), where (cathedral), when (post-firing) anchor by the third sentence. Drive lens reads Situational/Hybrid: the encounter forces Mira to act despite her voided license, and the sister's ribbon-return reweights the premise. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—"deciduous vows" returns with new cost as Mira pledges to repair "contract or not"—though the cost (professional risk, social standing) is implied rather than shown in a concrete price paid on the page. One reversal (boy demands help despite her refusal) narrows options; the ribbon payoff shifts meaning but feels slightly orchestrated rather than causally inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is vivid and purposeful: apples glowing where candles hung, pear tree rooted in cracked marble. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's irritation ("saints should have swept"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (aisle, altar, beam, choir stall), and the carved vow on bark supplies a recurring image that charges the final pledge. The orchard constrains the boy's position (beam) and supplies the visual/thematic anchor for closure, meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's tension between contract-bound ethics and direct care—is signaled early and tightens when the boy demands help. One meaningful reversal (boy's challenge, "vows were for adults and adults broke them first") forces Mira to act with improvised tools. The repair and ribbon-return narrow her future path (she vows to keep repairing illegally), but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no guild consequence, client reaction, or tangible forfeiture appears on the page. Escalation is coherent under the Situational lens but lacks a visible price that would enter the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" emerges from graffiti, recurs in the sister's line ("Vows should stay where you can see them"), and reweights Mira's final pledge without a stated moral. The theme—repair as respect, promises renewed by shedding—arises from concrete action (the improvised socket ring, the ribbon). Minor slip: "accidental wisdom" is name-checked twice, nudging the theme toward overt claim rather than pure emergence. The ending avoids summary and offers a resonant answer through Mira's vow to the children, though "until their generation could teach hers what faith meant" edges toward mild abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (grumbling at dust, recognizing "accidental wisdom" in graffiti) is consistent. Dialogue ("vows were for adults and adults broke them first," "Vows should stay where you can see them") pursues goals and carries subtext. Distance control holds except for one phrase: "endearing even to herself" intrudes as light meta-commentary mid-pressure. Filter use is minimal and voice-motivated. Diction stays within Mira's register, and the prose rhythm modulates across beats without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are mostly clean; information density is high in the repair sequence. Two scaffold patterns deduct: "She came for one thing: the daughter's hair ribbon that the canon's child had dropped… If she could give the ribbon back" loops the ribbon setup across adjacent sentences without advancing pressure, and "small objects carried large lessons… to bridge generational wisdom" paraphrases the same concept. "Accidental wisdom always arrived for her like that, uninvited, from graffiti or gossip, then refused to leave" feels slightly over-written for the beat. No loops touch the closure; apply −0.8 for two distinct issues (paraphrase, slight overwriting) under the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral synthesis and "deciduous vows" conceit are fresh; the quartz-eye trade feels lived-in rather than ornamental. The emotional truth—pride facing institutional betrayal—avoids generic templates. Risk: foregrounding philosophy ("promises renewed by shedding") in a child-repair plot. The boy's wrist-ribbon reversal is a clever turn but feels convenient; replacing the grandson with a different child would not fundamentally alter the arc, suggesting moderate rather than high irreplaceability. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive both turns: she retrieves the ribbon (setup), improvises the repair despite her voided license (middle escalation), returns the ribbon and vows to continue repairing (closure). Present in all three gates with causal pressure at each beat and irreplaceability—only a mender with her exact breach could generate this arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ribbon is mentioned in the setup (reason for the visit), sought mid-scene, and returned at closure where the sister ties it on the boy's wrist, reweighting "vows should stay where you can see them." Three-gate presence and a lyric reprise, but the ribbon's middle development is weak: Mira merely notices its absence rather than the ribbon constraining a choice. Cap at ~6.3 for strong early-final reprise with thin middle work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is discovered mid-scene on the pear bark, shapes Mira's final pledge ("she would keep repairing, contract or not"), and is reweighted by the sister's line. Present in middle and closure; missing early setup. The concept alters Mira's stance (from contract-bound to independent) with conceptual cost. Lyric reprise partially compensates for late seed; score ~6.4 for solid closure linkage and stake reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" appears as narratorial label ("Her feisty grumble was endearing even to herself") without constraining an on-page choice. Mira's grumble at dust is present but does not create a trade-off or visible cost. The attribute is ornamental rather than causal; swappable with "irritable" or "stubborn" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Persist" anchors the repair action: Mira persists using forgotten bag contents after the kit is confiscated, enabling the socket-ring improvisation that steadies the boy's eye and proves the breach's injustice. Present in setup (bag kept despite firing) and middle escalation (repair), shaping closure (vow to persist illegally). Two beats with causal pressure and irreplaceability; the specific verb charges the final vow.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is signaled early ("nothing but a forgotten bag slung on her shoulder"), its contents (thread, crumbs, cracked lens) enable the middle repair, and the method implicitly charges the ending vow. Three-gate presence with causal work at the repair beat. Slightly swappable—any improvised-tool method could serve—but the "forgotten" detail ties to the breach and closure pledge, lifting it above purely functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is introduced immediately, supplies the beam that traps the boy (forcing the repair), provides the pear bark for the "deciduous vows" carving, and frames the final pledge ("Under the orchard rafters she offered her own deciduous vow"). Three gates with strong causal and closure linkage; the setting's specificity (rafters, altar-rooted tree) is irreplaceable and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" anchors the opening and frames Mira's loss of license, shaping her initial refusal to touch the boy's eye. The timeframe motivates the dominant stake but does not tighten decisions during the scene; elapsed time is untracked and does not pressure moves. Two-gate presence (setup, motivates middle choice) without closure participation; functional but not escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To bridge generational wisdom" is stated early, motivates the ribbon retrieval, and recurs at closure when Mira vows "until their generation could teach hers what faith meant." The motivation shapes two beats (visit, final pledge) and charges the ending. Present in setup and closure with thematic linkage, but middle development is thin—Mira's ribbon-quest does not face friction or trade-off until the very end. Score ~6.6 for strong early-final work with weak middle dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is named twice and demonstrated throughout: graffiti supplying "deciduous vows," the boy's challenge reframing ethics, the sister's wrist-ribbon reversing the lesson. Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with pressure (irritation → surprise → warmth). The label-claim ("accidental wisdom always arrived for her like that") slightly over-articulates, but the tone charges the final image and the two-fold mention signals intentionality. Reaches ~7.2 for multi-beat presence and closure participation despite mild over-naming.</comment>
