<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The investigator's interiority is concrete and professional—measured observations, embodied response to the patch's tactile feedback. Motivation evolves under pressure from procedural inquiry to emergency intervention, with the sprint through the lanes foregrounding embodied choice. Minor weakness: the investigator's blind spots or internal contradictions are minimal; competence dominates without meaningful struggle that compounds before resolution, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the investigator breaks the convergence by disrupting the spiral, sound returns, and the final line reweights prior motifs ("measuring the haze until it becomes a map"). Orientation anchors emerge by ~150 words (port city, container yard, post-silence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the data spiral tightens to Dock Twelve and the cylindrical stack reveals the hidden plane. Cost is legible in the cut fingers and frantic action. Eligible for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains choice throughout: wind patterns guide the search, the cylindrical stack functions as both concealment and acoustic weapon, and the investigator's final sprint to crack seals directly depends on spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cold vapor, muted rhythm, air behaving like liquid. The patch and sensor rig function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. The convergence concept depends on spatial configuration, earning high marks for constraint-driven choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solve the vanishing plane and break the silence. One clear tightening when the data spiral converges at Dock Twelve, forcing entry into the cylinder. Escalation is agency-driven—lifting the patch as sensor, completing the circuit, then sprinting to ruin the spiral's symmetry. Visible cost: cut fingers, minutes before crew returns, the risk of re-engagement. The forklift cough creates urgency that narrows options. Entering 8+ requires the tightening forecloses a live option; here the investigator's sprint alters tactics under time pressure, meeting that test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: foresight built by "measuring the haze until it becomes a map," silence as engineered convergence rather than natural absence. The final line offers resonance without moralizing. Weakness: the protagonist's articulation of foresight ("cultivate foresight in action," "how foresight is built") occasionally edges toward explicit thesis rather than full dramatic inference, preventing access to 8.5+. The convergence motif recurs purposefully, but the stated theme in the closing beat slightly over-articulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person investigator; distance controlled throughout. Diction is technical-professional with purposeful compression: "pressure waves met their inverse," "rapidly adapting sensor rig," "wind machine designed to hide the work." Perceptual signature is consistently procedural and observant. No head-hopping. Minor note: a few elevated constructions ("labyrinth of shipping containers," "collapse into nothing") approach ornamental register but remain within investigator idiom and do not obscure clarity under pressure. Elision is minimal and always resolved on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propels; information density is high. Minor loop artifacts: "the patch warmed in my hand" echoes prior tactile cues without advancing new pressure; "the patch, now tied to a pole, fluttered hard enough to cut my fingers" partially revisits the injury motif. Figurative density ("air behaved like a liquid," "sound returned in a rush") appears frequently but remains legible and voice-consistent. A handful of near-synonyms ("muted rhythm," "muting people") and one template stem run ("I came to the container yard... I set my... I began documenting...") in early exposition. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and stem repetition, preventing 8.5+ entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The convergence-as-silence premise and container-spiral weapon are fresh syntheses of acoustic physics and investigative procedural. The patch-as-sensor and wind-pattern documentation feel specific and non-obvious. Risk: the piece commits to technical specificity and compressed action without gimmickry. Weakness: the investigator's professional role and procedural approach are well-executed but not transformed; the emotional arc is minimal, and the final epiphany ("measuring the haze until it becomes a map") is earned but somewhat abstract, limiting access to 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from opening; drives survey, data interpretation, circuit completion, and the sprint to break the spiral. Choices (lifting patch, pressing to latch, cracking seals) create all major turns. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost (cut fingers, time pressure) all present. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Appears in opening quarter (frayed patch from apron), used as sensor flag at intersections (middle beat), completes circuit at container door (late middle), tied to pole and cuts fingers in final sprint (closure). Four distinct beats; evolving function from clue to tool to cost-bearing object. Irreplaceable: conductive thread and turbine embroidery are specific properties that enable the plot. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced as "singular convergence" in data spiral, explained as pressure-wave cancellation mechanism, and broken by protagonist's action. Shapes stakes (town silenced), tactics (disrupt spiral symmetry), and closure (sound returns when convergence collapses). Three beats; causal pressure and closure linkage clear. Specific mechanics (inverse waves, cylindrical resonators) matter to the solution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensor rig "rapidly adapting" appears in early survey and again when "rig adapted as airflow changed" during final sprint. Two beats; enables wind-pattern tracking and real-time response. Constraint: the investigator depends on automated filter rewriting. Cost is implicit (speed vs. accuracy tradeoff not dramatized on page). Functional but payoff lacks visible price; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Survey is the framing action: investigator surveys container yard, documents wind patterns, marks eddies, walks intersections. The data spiral emerges from this survey, guiding all subsequent moves. Three beats minimum; drives discovery and tactics. Closure (breaking the spiral) is the survey's payoff. Swapping "survey" for "investigate" would weaken specificity but not break logic; however, the methodical mapping is essential to the convergence discovery. Strong integration with minor swappability reservation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("documenting wind patterns between buildings of corrugated steel"), demonstrated with sensor rig at intersections, and paid off when charts show the convergence mechanism and guide the disruption. Three beats; method shapes discovery and solution. Specificity: wind-pattern data creates the spiral map. Causal and closure linkage solid. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth present from opening, dominates all action. Spatial pressure: lanes narrow/fold, cylindrical stack as convergence engine, doors must be cracked to break symmetry. Every turn depends on this setting. Protagonist sprints through lanes, alters container positions to ruin spiral. Closure image (sound returning) is inseparable from the disrupted container geometry. Indispensable; story logic fails without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the town went silent" frames entire piece; silence is ongoing pressure. Brief urgency spike when forklift coughs ("minutes before the crew returned"). Two beats; shapes stakes (solve the silence) and final tactic (sprint before wind machine restarts). Cost: time constraint visible in rushed action and cut fingers. Solid integration; timeframe could be tighter (no countdown clock), preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stated explicitly early ("My motive was not just to assign blame but to cultivate foresight in action") and restated in final line ("how foresight is built: by measuring the haze until it becomes a map"). Desire informs survey methodology and data interpretation. Weakness: motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants; the investigator's professional drive faces minimal internal friction. Two beats (opening statement, closing reprise) but lacks on-page friction between wants and costs. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone sustained throughout: technical precision layered with sensory uncertainty ("precise, hazy strokes," "muted rhythm," "cold vapor," "haze until it becomes a map"). Modulates with pressure—clinical in survey mode, compressed in sprint. Final image charges tone: "noisy relief" after silence, foresight crystallized from haze. Coherent through turns; the oxymoronic pairing of precision and haze is the story's signature and recurs purposefully. Strong integration.</comment>
