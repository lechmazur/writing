<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior work is strong: the drawer pull anchors a specific history of living "between apology and forgiveness," and her thoughtfulness manifests in concrete choices—leveraging brass to free wire, extending the object as proof of repair. Her motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" drives the exchange beats. Minor weakness: Sarin and Vek remain functional pressures rather than fully individuated presences; their contrition feels gestural at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal lens: Lena's inspection discovers wire restraints, she uses the drawer pull as lever, the boy's recognition shifts both commanders toward apology, and the final crossing is earned by witnessed contrition. Orientation anchors quickly (parapet, neutral line, exchange night). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the exchange completes with felt cost—Sarin's "shaking hand," Vek's borrowed shame—and the drawer pull now carries collective repair. One tightening deepens stakes when the boy's mother is named, humanizing the abstract exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet, mist, crack in flagstones, and moon phase all ground the exchange and constrain choreography (both sides watch the crack "as if it burned"). The drawer pull functions as micro-setting—its scrollwork, brass warmth, and lever curve enable the wire-removal beat. Sensory hierarchy fits the lens: chains chiming, wire's "cruel" efficiency, brass "complaining in a tiny squeal." The environment charges the final image (boy stepping "onto Ridge ground" under full moon) but does not decisively alter a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: complete the exchange without reprisal, with Lena as first hostage if anyone breaks protocol. Pressure tightens when wire restraints appear (a field cruelty that tests procedure) and Lena's choice to untether with the drawer pull becomes the pivot—humanizing the boy triggers both commanders' apologies. The exchange completes with visible cost: Sarin's trembling signature, Vek's murmured apology to an absent mother, and the boy crossing with memory in hand. One meaningful tightening and deepening, consistent with causal lens; cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of repair versus erasure emerges organically: Lena "recycles mistakes into wisdom, not to erase them," and the drawer pull—taken before forgiveness—becomes the token that both sides send back as "proof that someone meant to repair what was broken." The commanders' "borrowed shame" and the boy's mother waiting for letters ground abstraction in particulars. Final image (boy carrying the handle as "memory") reweights the exchange without moralizing. Minor drift: the moon-phase method remains largely procedural backdrop rather than thematic lever.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Lena's perceptual signature filters weather as breath, commanders as "weather," and the crack as boundary that "burned." Diction stays consistent—"furrowed hush," "chains chimed softly," "jaw worked like he was swallowing a stone"—with purposeful compression that fits the tense parapet meeting. Dialogue is spare and subtext-driven: Vek's rough "the boy's mother was alive" and Sarin's muttered field-excuse both pursue goals (deflect blame, humanize loss) without exposition. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well ("Boots scraped behind her" / "Across the mist, Ridge soldiers emerged"), and information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled: "stones narrowed to a knife edge," "lanterns smudged halos," brass "complaining in a tiny squeal." Minor deductions: slight template cadence in the reflection block ("Living in that gap… was what had taught her to listen…" followed by "She told herself she worked exchanges to recycle…"), and one near-paraphrase loop (wire "pretended to be efficient" / "not by his order, but the prisoner flinched"). Artifacts do not touch closure; apply −0.6 for two distinct loops in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prisoner exchange on neutral ground is familiar; the story transforms it through the antique drawer pull as both lever and inheritance, and the moon-phase synchronization method. Lena's stance—mistrusted by both sides, living between apology and forgiveness—feels specific rather than stock. The wire-restraint beat and commanders' shared contrition avoid symmetry by assigning unequal responsibility (field cruelty versus systemic theft of letters). The final image (boy carrying memory) is non-obvious but leans slightly toward anticipated resonance. Risk is moderate; the piece does not attempt bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (prisoner exchange negotiator) drives multiple beats: she reads commanders' "quiet like weather," inspects restraints, uses the drawer pull as lever, and signals the timed crossings. Her choices create the wire-removal turn and the final send-back of the brass handle, altering both commanders' stances. Present in setup (opening), middle (untethering), and closure (walking the boy to both sides, binding the moment to witnesses). Causal pressure is strong; specificity high; closure linkage direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The antique drawer pull appears in at least four beats: Lena rolls it (opening), sets it beside the crack as human token, uses its curved stem to lever wire free, and extends it to Sarin to send back with the boy. It evolves from personal talisman (father's apology) to tool to proof of repair. Causal: enables the wire removal; shapes commanders' recognition. Closure: the boy takes it "as a handle to carry memory." Irreplaceable: its scrollwork, brass warmth, and curve matter. Cost tied: represents withheld forgiveness and borrowed shame.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Neutral territory (the abandoned fort parapet, crack in flagstones) frames stakes: "no army could keep it," and breaking protocol makes Lena "the first hostage." It constrains choreography (both sides watch the crack) and enables the exchange method. Present in setup and enforced throughout. Causal role is moderate: the crack serves as stage boundary but does not drive a tactical turn; the neutrality permits the meeting but does not impose a unique cost. Closure participation is spatial only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is asserted early ("uncommonly thoughtful for someone paid to count bodies like coins, and that thoughtfulness was its own shield") and demonstrated in her reading commanders "like weather" and her careful untethering of wire. It enables the lever choice and the decision to send the handle back as proof. Constraint: her thoughtfulness forbids simply cutting or forcing the wire. Cost is implied (the reflective pause under time pressure) but not sharp. Swappable with "careful" or "empathetic" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Untether" drives the wire-removal beat (lever action) and the prisoner releases (chains falling, "untethering knots"). The wire untethering is the story's hinge: discovering cruelty, using the drawer pull, triggering the boy's recognition and both commanders' shame. Present in middle and closure (final pairs "untethered" to cross). Causal pressure strong; specificity high (brass flexing, "tiny squeal"). Replacing with "free" or "release" would lower texture but the beat structure holds; the specific lever method matters more than the verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is described in exposition ("Messages were planted in river stones and salt barrels, each marked with a crescent or gibbous") and the full moon times the crossings ("each crossing timed to the slow climb of the full moon"). Present in setup (method explanation) and closure (Vek watches moon, crossings synced to climb). Does not shape a tactical choice or create friction; it functions as procedural constraint that prevents tampering but does not test Lena or alter stakes. Swappable with other time-witness methods (e.g., tidal schedule, solstice light).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The storm-worn windblown parapet supplies mist (obscures visibility, forces closer trust), narrowing stones (physical pressure), and the crack as boundary. Wind as "held breath" charges atmosphere. Present throughout; the crack anchors all positioning. Causal role is moderate: the setting enables the meeting and constrains choreography but does not impose a unique tactical cost (no slippery stones forcing a choice, no visibility failure altering moves). Closure participation: the boy steps "onto Ridge ground" under moon, spatially resolved but not reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is established early (father's apology, withheld forgiveness) and motivates Lena's stance ("listen past insults for the shape of regret"). It shapes her offer of the drawer pull as repair proof and frames the commanders' apologies at closure ("borrowed shame," "shaking hand"). Present in setup (backstory anchor) and closure (boy carries the handle toward repair). Does not impose a ticking clock or alter tactics beat-by-beat; functions more as thematic frame than pressure device. Cost is conceptual (the gap persists) rather than felt in real-time choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Recycle mistakes into wisdom, not to erase them" is told in exposition but demonstrated when Lena uses the drawer pull (a mistake-token from her own past) to repair present cruelty and sends it forward as proof. Present in setup (stated motive) and closure (the boy takes memory, not erasure). Shapes the wire-removal choice and the send-back decision. Friction is light: no on-page moment where she is tempted to erase or where recycling costs her tactically. The motive directs action but is not tested by competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" anchors tone early ("the kind that made even soldiers speak with their lips barely moving") and modulates under pressure: mist and held-breath gusts, chains "chiming softly," Sarin's muttered excuse, Vek's "rough as gravel" voice, the parapet's exhale when chains fall silent. Tone tightens when wire appears and softens at closure (whispered recognition, murmured apologies). Coherent through turns; charges the final image (boy stepping into quiet resolution). Does not break or surprise; steady control without dramatic shift.</comment>
