<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior state is richly embodied through concrete actions—counting silences, uncorking moonlight, incising absence—and the "mindfully scattered" trait influences perception and method. However, the central motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") remains abstract until the final reveal, and the climactic recognition that the vendor is reading their own origin feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices that test commitment. The shift from blankness to self-knowledge lacks visible internal contradiction or cost; the protagonist moves smoothly toward insight without the friction of competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density—glass orchard, bottled moonlight, fragments on petals—and the closure moment (vendor recognizing the story as their own origin) reweights all prior material with felt cost: the protagonist steps toward a beginning that was withheld. Orientation is clean by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the moonlight map makes silences countable, narrowing the task to a single incision. The cost is legible in the final line ("stepped toward the beginning"), which forecloses the vendor's prior blankness, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vividly anchored early and charges the final image: the protagonist moves toward "the root of the orchard." Spatial choreography (cart beneath glass boughs, reading table hung over open sky) remains coherent, and the bottled moonlight functions as micro-setting, constraining the incision method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"pale pulse," "swirling sea of clouds"—filtered through the vendor's bias toward blanks and patterns. The environment enables the closure choice by providing the root-address in the margin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the place where stories begin—is signaled early and ties to the protagonist's erased past. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira presents the parole docket and the task shifts from selling blanks to measuring absence, narrowing options. The incision opens a doorway, and the final discovery that the freed story is the vendor's own origin forecloses the blankness, a credible cost. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies heavily on symbolic accumulation rather than a series of narrowing choices or visible trades; the protagonist succeeds without friction, and no live option is dramatized as foreclosed until the very end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—stories as acts of recovery, the labor of beginnings—emerges from particulars: blank ledgers for the hopeful, moonlight as witness, counting unprinted pauses. The final image (vendor entering the orchard root) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the vendor's name sliding away, the library's parole system, and the match between the title-hole and the protagonist's hollow. The conceptual repricing is clear: freedom is not granted to the book but to the vendor, reweighting all prior "clean slate" rhetoric with personal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the vendor notices "pattern of cloud vortices," "unprinted pauses," and sensory metaphors tied to blankness and edges. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("glimmering parole," "incise, not in paper but in absence"). Under peak stress (the incision moment), syntax tightens without losing internal texture. One brief elision—"my own past had been wiped so clean that even my name slid away"—is paid off when the final page leaves an address. No head-hopping, and the narrator's uncertainty about their own origin is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but occasionally borders on opacity: "speech broken into photons," "incise along the doorway's edge, carving a clean curve through pure lack until it shone" stacks metaphor without grounding in physical sensation. One paraphrase loop appears: "the hole where the title should be matched the hollow in me" is echoed by "I wondered if this was my own beginning under a different cover" within two sentences. Information density is strong, and no scaffold or template cadence is evident, but the final third leans heavily on abstraction ("pure lack," "doorway forming") that slightly dulls the closure image's concreteness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of blank-slate vending, bottled moonlight as witness, and parole-as-self-liberation is specific and non-obvious. The vendor's job (quantifying absence to free a story) transforms the recovery-of-memory trope through occupational detail and sensory particulars. However, the "amnesiac protagonist discovers their own origin" arc is widely used, and while the glass-orchard metaphor is vivid, the emotional stakes at closure feel more conceptual than lived. The piece takes a bold risk with lyric accumulation and succeeds in coherence, earning modest positive adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; the vendor's choices to accept the docket, uncork the moonlight, count absences, and incise the doorway create the key turn at closure. The character's role shapes stakes (selling blanks vs. freeing a story) and the final recognition. Introduced early, involved in at least three beats, and essential to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight is handled in multiple beats: paid by the library to carry it, uncorked onto the table to map silences, and tucked away at the end. Its mechanics (remembers what it touches, makes silences countable) enable the incision method and the closure choice. Specificity is high; removing it would break the measurement and parole system. Directly shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Glimmering parole frames the task: freeing a story by cutting its beginning free. The concept shapes stakes (earn the parole by measuring absence) and the twist (parole freed the vendor, not the book). Introduced in the second third via Mira's docket, it reweights the entire arc at closure. However, it does not constrain middle tactics beyond naming the task; the mechanics feel more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" is attributed by librarians and mentioned as necessary to track blanks and notice cloud patterns. It subtly colors perception but does not visibly constrain or enable a key action with cost. The trait remains largely label-only without a dramatized tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The incision—"pressed its tip into nothing, and incised along the doorway's edge, carving a clean curve through pure lack"—is the pivotal act that snaps fragments into a single page and triggers the closure recognition. Introduced as the vendor's job, executed once at the climax, and indispensable to the resolution. Swapping it would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quantifying absence (counting unprinted pauses, character almost-speeches, blank margins) is signaled when Mira explains the task and executed in the central beat. The method's mechanics matter: each sum forms a doorway, and totals must match the docket's seal. It shapes the attempt and enables the incision. Present in setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating on clouds is anchored early, supplies the reading table over open sky (a tactical space), and the "root of the orchard" becomes the final destination. The setting pressures the task (fragments on separate petals, book in shards) and charges the closure image. However, much of the description is atmospheric rather than causal; the floating aspect does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the lull on a store's very first opening day" is mentioned in the opening and final lines. The lull provides quiet for the task but does not tighten decisions; no clock pressure is visible, and the timeframe could be swapped for "quiet afternoon" without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To find the place where stories begin is stated early, drives the vendor to accept Mira's task, and is satisfied when the margin reveals the orchard root address. The motivation ties to the protagonist's erased past (want) and the blankness that kept them outside their own life (cost). However, the desire is more told than dramatized in conflicted choices; the vendor moves toward it without visible friction or competing impulse until the reveal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Integrated fragmentation—paragraphs on petals, dialogue on bark, a title that is only a hole—is both described (the book in shards) and enacted in the prose's layered, lyric accumulation. Tone modulates from catalog calm to urgency at the incision, and the final line ("stepped toward the beginning") unifies fragments into forward motion. The tone charges the closure image and coheres across turns without becoming static.</comment>
