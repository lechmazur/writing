<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is richly embodied—crocodile tooth rubbed smooth, chest burning—and her contradictory impulses (compassion vs. old guilt in her wrists) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to recite the frog rhyme is earned by her own plague-era loss, and Elowen's shift from frozen rocking to unwilling laughter feels causally rooted. Minor slip: Elowen's confession structure ("I counted contractions… I wanted to run") tilts toward therapeutic articulation rather than messy breakdown, softening the peak slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph ("Echo Gorge… Mara walked… today she pursued Elowen"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the distorted harp notes and gorge echoes multiply confession into choir, then Mara's laughter cracks the calcified grief, resolving via Charged Poise when the invisible bundle dissolves and Elowen's shoulders loosen. Cost is visible—the bundle vanishes, forgiveness embodied—and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge constrains Mara's tactics (distorted harp in a ribcage cave, ledges where sunrise cannot reach) and charges the final image when light slides into the cleft. The crocodile tooth and harp strings function as micro-setting, shaping how confession is heard and cracked. Sensory hierarchy—mist beading on lashes, river as pewter ribbon—reflects Mara's urgency and the gorge's amplifying pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (bring back Elowen's soul by finding the note that turns to laughter). One meaningful tightening: Elowen's confession escalates from "missed the moment" to "wanted to run," forcing Mara to recite the frog rhyme—a choice rooted in her own plague-era guilt. The invisible bundle dissolving is a visible cost that forecloses Elowen's calcified loop, and Mara's own grief "laugh[s] softly, integrating into healing" with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grief calcifies, honest laughter cracks it without breaking the heart. The crocodile tooth (godling's laughter memory) and the frog rhyme recur with shifted weight, and the final image—gorge returning the laugh gentler, light sliding over ridge—offers a resonant answer to the healing question without moralizing. Elowen's invisible bundle dissolving is embodied forgiveness, not stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is selective (lantern unlit, crocodile tooth rubbed smooth by anxious fingers, mist beading on lashes). Diction remains consistent under pressure—"luminous ache," "woman of water glass"—and rhythmic control tightens during the confession exchange. Dialogue ("the gorge repeats what you hide," "Take it, and tell me the rest") pursues goals and evades, though Elowen's lines occasionally tilt toward perfect articulation for a specter mid-breakdown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful compression: "She was a lost soul collector, paid by the river towns to bring back the ones who wandered after death" anchors role and method in one sentence. Rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during the confession exchange, longer syntax during the walk. Zero loops or scaffold. Minor density slip: "integrating into healing" in the final line edges toward abstract label rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of soul collector, distorted harp as confession medium, and laughter as grief-cracker feels specific and non-obvious. The crocodile tooth from a swamp godling, Mara's plague backstory, and the frog rhyme offer fresh particulars. Risk-taking (spectral confessions via misaligned harmonics, laughter as medicine) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight proximity concern: the "invisible bundle" as emblem of lost child trends toward familiar symbol, though execution is grounded.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create key turns: plucking the harp to pursue the voice, laying the tooth in Elowen's palm, reciting the frog rhyme. Present in setup (opening), middle (harp cave), and closure (hand offered like a bridge). Causal pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Crocodile tooth appears in setup (cord, rubbed smooth), hooked under harp string in the cave, laid in Elowen's palm (heavy with laughter memory), and shapes the final turn when Elowen laughs. Four distinct beats with evolving use; irreplaceable properties (godling's laughter) narrow Mara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spectral confessions shape stakes on the page: "every soul arrived with a confession stuck in its throat," and Elowen's confession ("I counted contractions… I wanted to run") drives the middle escalation and enables the laughter-crack. Present in setup (opening exposition), middle (voice in broken harmonics), and closure (confession empties).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is signaled early ("modestly fearless in a place that loved echoes") and constrains Mara's approach: she does not scold Elowen but pursues the laughter note. The trait enables her to step closer until mist beads on her lashes. One visible on-page action with cost; not deeply integrated into multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Pursue" structures the entire arc: Mara pursues Elowen's soul, follows distorted notes along ledges, and keeps plucking until confession empties. Major turns trace to this action—reaching the cleft, the laugh-crack. Present in setup (opening line), middle (pursuing sound), and closure (playing through distorted notes). Irreplaceable; swapping for "find" or "seek" would lose the active momentum.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled in the cave (setup), its distorted notes guide Mara along ledges (middle), and she "kept playing through the distorted notes until Elowen's confession emptied" (closure). Mechanics matter: the harp's warped frame translates confession into luminous ache, and plucking with the crocodile tooth alters tactics. Three beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge supplies the ribcage cave, ledges where sunrise cannot reach, and the narrow cleft—each altering Mara's tactics. The gorge "moans back her shame, multiplying it into a choir," then catches Elowen's laugh and returns it gentler. The final image (light sliding over ridge into cleft) charges closure. Three beats; indispensable pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" is present in setup ("hush of a hidden sunrise") and closure ("thin sunrise," "light sliding over the ridge"). The dawn clock tightens atmosphere and paces the pursuit from darkness to glow, though elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not impose urgent ticking pressure mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's desire to integrate laughter into healing is dramatized in choices: pursuing the laughter note, reciting the frog rhyme, and plucking until Elowen laughs. Friction between want (heal Elowen) and cost (reopening her own plague grief, "chest burn") is visible on the page. Present in setup ("laughter was her strange medicine"), middle (frog rhyme attempt), and closure (grief "laugh[s] softly").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" coheres through all turns: "air filled with luminous ache" at the harp, gorge "moans back her shame," and the final laugh returns "gentler, like light." Tone modulates with pressure—darkening during confession, brightening at the crack—and charges the final image when light slides into the cleft. Indispensable texture that supports closure.</comment>
