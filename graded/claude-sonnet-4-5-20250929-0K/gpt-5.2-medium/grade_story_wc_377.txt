<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa's motivation is clear and her actions are goal-driven throughout, but her interior life remains abstract—we see "muted vigor" and determination without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The Auditor arrives as pure opposition without interior complexity, functioning as a symbolic obstacle rather than a character with his own pressures. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("dimming of color, the slow bleaching of wonder") but these remain conceptual claims rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lysa builds, the Auditor challenges, the sculpture's light transforms the crowd's perception. However, the closure relies on summary ("the gathered crowd learned to listen again") rather than a concrete on-page change with visible cost. The fragment's consumption over time and the basin-tuning are told in retrospective summary, flattening what could have been a charged final image. The Auditor's palm-burning offers a micro-turn but his subsequent passivity ("let go and watched") deflates rather than crystallizes the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, cloud sea, and kinetic sculpture are vivid and specific, anchoring the story in a distinct sensory world. The iceberg fragment's physical properties (cold, light refraction, melting) constrain and enable key beats—Lysa's initial tuning, the Auditor's confrontation, the basin's evolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image as the sculpture continues to turn "throwing borrowed rainbows from glass alone."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder against standardization—is signaled early and sustained. The Auditor's arrival creates one meaningful tightening (ledger stone vs. sculpture), but his defeat comes too easily: the cold burns him, he releases, he watches passively. No trade-off or visible price is paid by Lysa; the crowd's conversion happens off-stage in a summary beat. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break, but the resolution delivers convenience rather than cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the kinetic sculpture and mute bells as vehicles for truth that resists standardization. The iceberg fragment's "honesty" and transformation (snow→pressure→archive→droplets) operates as a concrete particular rather than abstraction. However, lines like "truth had a spectrum" and "symphonies of truth" edge toward overt statement, and the ending's "enough to keep speech unnecessary without making life colorless" moralizes rather than letting image resonate. The basin's droplet-chime offers a quieter, more effective thematic note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("whispering like cloth," "slow bleaching of wonder"). However, the diction occasionally drifts into explanatory abstraction ("the gray rules had been written by fear of the unknown colors") that flattens rather than charges. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific—the observations could belong to any sympathetic observer of the scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythms, but accumulates minor artifacts: "seasonally mute" appears three times in identical phrasing, "the fragment" is repeated as a stem across multiple paragraphs, and "truth" appears eight times, creating semantic saturation. The opening ("After words became unnecessary, the last conversations lived in vibration") is striking, but the final stretch summarizes rather than dramatizes: "By the time the trader returned for payment, the fragment was gone" compresses what could have been charged into retrospective telling. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—a post-verbal society where bells and kinetic sculpture preserve wonder through "symphonies of truth"—offers a fresh synthesis and commits fully to its speculative logic. The iceberg fragment as honest archive and the seasonally mute bells as intentional silence are specific, non-obvious choices. The Auditor's ledger stone dissolving under light is a bold image. However, the conflict follows a familiar pattern (artist vs. bureaucrat) and the resolution (crowd awakens, rules dissolve) lacks the friction or moral ambiguity that would distinguish it from template uplift narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysa tunes clappers, builds the sculpture, sets the fragment, adjusts vanes, and retunes for the coming season—her choices create multiple beats and the closure hinges on her sustained effort. However, the peak confrontation (spinning the sculpture faster in response to the Auditor) is her only high-stakes decision under direct pressure, and it succeeds without visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears early, is handled and used across multiple beats (Lysa sets it in the hub, it flashes during the Auditor's challenge, it burns his palms, it thins over days, droplets chime in the basin), and its disappearance reweights the closure ("borrowed rainbows from glass alone"). Its specific properties (cold, light refraction, melting) constrain and enable actions throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named explicitly and frames Lysa's goal, but the concept remains abstract—truth as spectrum, light matching harmonics. It shapes her tactics (tuning, adjusting patterns) and the crowd's awakening, yet the mechanism by which truth operates is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seasonally mute bells are seeded early and honored at closure ("stayed quiet as foretold, yet their silence now carried the remembered shimmer"), offering a lyric reprise. However, their muteness does not constrain any on-page choice or impose a visible trade-off; they function as thematic color rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears when the fragment is first set ("began to glisten, throwing pale rainbows") and drives the visual transformation that the crowd witnesses. The action is specific to the fragment's properties and ties to the closure image of borrowed rainbows, but it could be replaced with "refract" or "shimmer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture is introduced early, its mechanics (glass vanes, counterweighted pendulums, wind-driven motion) are detailed, and it constrains multiple beats: Lysa adjusts vanes, sets the fragment in the hub, spins it faster to answer the Auditor, and it continues turning at closure. Removing the sculpture would collapse the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff is named in the opening and anchors spatial choreography throughout ("feet braced in the grit," "With the bluff whispering like cloth," "the cloud sea"). It provides the elevated, liminal setting that enables the Carillon's reach and the crowd's gathering, and charges the final image as the bells carry across cloud tops. However, the bluff itself does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it functions as stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The post-verbal timeframe is seeded in the opening line and establishes the story's speculative premise ("After words became unnecessary, the last conversations lived in vibration"). It contextualizes why the Carillon matters and why the Auditor's ledger stone is mute, but it does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock. The passage of time (fragment thinning "over days," winter rising, trader returning) is retrospective summary rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lysa's desire to preserve wonder is stated early ("To preserve the color of wonder, she built a kinetic sculpture") and drives her construction of the sculpture, her tuning adjustments, and her response to the Auditor. However, the motivation is asserted more than dramatized—we do not see her struggle with doubt, cost, or competing wants. The resolution grants her success without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" appears explicitly in one beat ("shoulders tight with muted vigor") and the prose sustains a lyric-elevated, restrained intensity throughout—Lysa's quiet determination, the Auditor's silent arrival, the crowd's dawning realization. The tone modulates slightly as the Auditor intrudes (tension rises) and resolves into the quiet, sustained hum of the final image. The tone charges closure effectively without shouting.</comment>
