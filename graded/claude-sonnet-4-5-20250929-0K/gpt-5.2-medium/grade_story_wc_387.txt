<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jiro's motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is embodied through concrete teaching actions and consistent perception filtered through craft. Ren's arc from mockery to reverence is earned through on-page instruction and the smuggler resolution. Internal states remain consistently particular: Jiro's patient attention to "knots that held," Ren's embarrassment and confession. Minor slip: the final bow and tea ceremony risks sentimental closure, but the prior causality supports it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ren's promise and ritual honor hidden effort with visible cost—he bows "anyway" when fishermen ignore Jiro, enacting the philosophy. The piece operates under Accumulative lens: pattern (moon paths, nets, whistling, whisk) deepens through two nights and reweights at closure. Causal linkage is clean: night one teaches repair philosophy, night two applies it to catch the smuggler. One meaningful tightening occurs when the market-net sabotage forces application of the lesson. Cost is legible in Ren's shift from scorn to discipleship and the quiet, unrewarded labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The parapet after rain functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: wet stone seams guide the moon-path lesson, puddles reflect fireflies, crenels snag nets. Spatial choreography is clean across two nights. The whisk, nets, moon pools, and river currents form a coherent sensory lattice filtered through craft-worker perception. The setting charges the closure: Ren brews tea "on the parapet," embedding the philosophy in place. Selective detail (tarred twine, bamboo ribs, lattice shadows) advances both atmosphere and theme without catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching Ren to see hidden effort—is signaled early and tightens when the smuggler crisis forces application. Agency is decision and instruction: Jiro chooses to teach, Ren chooses to learn and then act on the pattern. The market-net sabotage escalates by requiring active watchfulness rather than passive reflection. Cost is visible: Ren's mockery stance is foreclosed, and he accepts unrewarded labor. One micro turn (the sliced nets) pivots reflection into investigation. The piece leans accumulative, so pressure coheres through pattern recurrence rather than multiple reversals, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—valuing unseen labor and pattern recognition—emerges through particulars: knots, whistling, whisk shadows, moon paths, net repairs. The final image (Ren brewing tea, using the whisk, honoring Jiro despite being ignored) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The whisk's "many thin risks bent together" and the guard's shift from scorn to gratitude embody the concept without abstraction. Subtext operates in Jiro's deflective whistle, Ren's confession, and the fishermen's indifference. Minor slip: "quiet courage behind a watch" edges toward theme statement, but remains anchored in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady through Jiro's and Ren's experiences across two nights; no head-hopping within paragraphs. Perceptual signature is consistent: craft-specific noticing (seams, knots, current lines). Diction is elevated but coherent, matching a philosopher's lens. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: Jiro's teaching through image rather than lecture, Ren's confessions. Minor register drift: "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," and "philosophy: you honor what cannot be seen" occasionally tilt ornamental, slowing immediacy without breaking voice. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks flatten peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: each beat advances teaching, relationship, or the smuggler plot. Rhythm varies with purpose, accelerating during the investigation sequence. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweights stakes. Minor scaffold: "See, he said softly, hidden patterns are not secrets kept from us; they are the paths our eyes refuse because they are made of small repetitions" and "Jiro explained that every repair was a philosophy" edge toward exposition rather than dramatization. Paraphrase micro-loop in "honoring the hidden effort that kept every net, wall, and heart from tearing" (final line) recaps theme without fresh pressure. No template cadence or filter stacks; metaphors remain coherent. Deduction totals −0.6 for expository moments and minor loop at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher teaching hidden-pattern philosophy to a guard is a fresh synthesis; the whisk as teaching tool and the moon-path method are specific and non-obvious. The smuggler plot arising from net-pattern forensics feels earned rather than convenient. Emotional truth—Ren's scorn-to-reverence arc—avoids template beats. Risk: the two-night structure and philosophical register elevate ambition. Minor hedge: the closure leans toward tidy satisfaction (Ren catches smuggler, honors teacher) without sharper cost or ambiguity. The piece transforms "appreciate hidden effort" from prompt abstraction into lived particulars, but the ending's symmetry (problem solved, lesson learned, ritual performed) slightly softens edge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jiro appears by end of first paragraph (setup). He teaches Ren to mend nets and read cut patterns (development across both nights), decisions that enable Ren's smuggler capture. His choice to "invite" Ren and "lead Ren along the wall again" drives two beats. Closure: Ren bows to Jiro and brews tea, honoring the teaching (payoff). Cost: Jiro's philosophy is ignored by fishermen yet transmitted to Ren. The character is indispensable to the arc; removing him breaks the teaching structure and closure ritual.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The whisk appears in paragraph one (setup). Jiro holds it to moonlight to cast lattice shadows (first use, teaching metaphor), and Ren uses its handle to hold the net open (second use, repair tool). Closure: Ren uses the whisk to brew tea and raise froth, enacting the philosophy (third use, ritual). The object constrains teaching method and charges the final image. Cost: the whisk's "thin risks bent together" metaphor shapes Ren's understanding. Strong lyric reprise, but mid-scene use (net-holding) is brief and instrumental rather than causal pivot. Two clear beats plus charged closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Hidden patterns" is signaled in paragraph one and articulated explicitly mid-story. It shapes stakes: Jiro teaches Ren to see patterns in nets, moon paths, currents, and finally cut marks. Development: the pattern-reading skill enables Ren to solve the smuggler case by tracing "a repeating angle." Closure: Ren honors "the hidden effort that kept every net, wall, and heart from tearing." The concept constrains teaching method (following moon paths, reading weaves) and alters tactics (placement of guards). Cost: Ren must abandon his prior scorn and accept that "watchfulness left no mark" was a misbelief. The concept is indispensable; removing it collapses both the teaching arc and the investigation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" appears once in paragraph one as atmospheric descriptor: "the air was scintillatingly somber, lit by fireflies." It sets tone but does not constrain action or return with reweighted meaning. No middle development; no closure participation. Ornamental use; easily swappable with "luminously melancholy" or similar. Late cap (missing development and payoff) plus swappability cap limit score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Whistling appears in setup (paragraph one mentions "the one fishermen used to coordinate pulls in fog"). Jiro whistles to answer Ren's question, shifting the conversation to teaching mode (first use). He whistles again after the repair lesson, "and the tune threaded through the parapet's damp gaps; Ren heard in it not command but gratitude" (second use, shifts Ren's understanding). The action enables two teaching beats and signals philosophy (coordination, gratitude) but does not drive the smuggler resolution. Closure: not directly present in final image. Two beats, causal enabler, but not indispensable to closure unit itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Following moon paths" is introduced in setup: "Jiro invited him to learn net mending by following moon paths along the wall's wet seams." Development: they walk "where the moon pooled in cracks, stepping from silver to silver," finding frayed nets to repair. On night two, Jiro "led Ren along the wall again, reading the cuts by moonlight." The method shapes teaching and investigation tactics. Closure: "a clear moon path ran straight downriver" as Ren makes his promise. Three beats, method constrains both teaching and forensic work, charged reprise in final paragraph. Specificity: moonlight as navigational and forensic tool is unique. Minor: the method could be replaced by lantern-light with structural edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "whispering parapet after rain" is introduced in opening line. Setup: Jiro comes "each night" to this location. Development: wet seams guide the moon-path teaching, crenels snag nets, puddles reflect fireflies. Night two: "Jiro led Ren along the wall again, reading the cuts by moonlight until they formed a repeating angle that pointed toward the gate." Closure: "Ren bowed anyway, brewed tea on the parapet." The setting enables teaching (wet seams as map), forensic work (wall vantage for pattern reading), and ritual (parapet as philosophical locus). Three beats, causal constraint, charged closure presence. The parapet's verticality and permeability (whispering gaps, rain-soaked stone) are specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During firefly season" appears in opening phrase. Fireflies are present in paragraph one ("lit by fireflies that blinked over puddles") and once more ("Fireflies drifted through the new mesh"). The timeframe sets atmospheric tone but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No deadline, no seasonal constraint on action. Ornamental; the story's two-night structure could occur in any season with minor edits. Missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To appreciate hidden effort" is signaled in paragraph one: Jiro comes "not to preach to fishermen who wanted only profit, but to learn why their hands ached, and to appreciate hidden effort the way he appreciated the knots that held." Development: this desire drives his teaching of Ren, the repair lessons, and the explanation "that every repair was a philosophy: you honor what cannot be seen." Ren's confession ("I felt useless on nights without raids") creates friction: he must learn to value invisible watchfulness. Closure: Ren enacts the motivation by honoring Jiro's hidden effort despite being ignored. Three beats, desire dramatized through teaching actions, friction between Ren's want for visible impact and the philosophy's cost (unrewarded labor). The motivation is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" appears once in paragraph one: Jiro "came there each night with demure audacity." It characterizes his approach (quiet yet bold teaching) but does not modulate with pressure or return. The tone is coherent—philosophical patience threaded with decisive teaching—but "demure audacity" itself is label-only. Middle development: tone is enacted in Jiro's indirect teaching methods (whistling, showing shadows) and Ren's gradual conversion. Closure: Ren's act of bowing "anyway" and brewing tea embodies the tone without naming it. The phrase serves as thematic anchor but is not mechanically active. Lyric setup and enacted closure, but single static mention limits integration.</comment>
