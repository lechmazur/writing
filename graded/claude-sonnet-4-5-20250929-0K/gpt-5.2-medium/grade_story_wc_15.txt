<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ila's motivation is present and her "haunting optimism" is embodied through her brother's return and the choice to use thread-as-guidance, but key decisions feel more described than enacted under pressure. The sleepwalking method distances agency; when the smuggler apologizes "he could not explain," we lose the contradictory impulse acting in scene. The final choice—sewing nets across gaps—arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. Internal conflict is gestured at ("grief without denying it") but not dramatized in a peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Ila, wharf, tide-pool timing) arrive early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: details layer toward a final reconfiguration where reverence is "sewn back into being." However, the closure effect—children walking awake, orchids replacing torches—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality; no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible in the ending lines. The Orientation Test passes, but cost proof at closure remains elusive, capping upward movement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: orchid-woven shed roof, red canyon spirals "like waves frozen mid crash," tide-pool timing. The illustration plate and thread at ankle height constrain sleepwalking navigation, shaping tactics. The altar of broken oars reveals backstory that reweights the labyrinth's purpose. Spatial choreography—corridors, collapses, iron rings—remains clear and the orchid/thread details charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the labyrinth from forbidden ruin to passable covenant place—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through rockfalls, vanished lovers, and smuggler misuse, but no on-page reversal tightens options; the smuggler's "soft apology" and children's safe passage arrive without dramatized cost or a visible trade-off. Escalation reads as texture rather than causal narrowing, fitting an Accumulative lens, yet the lack of a felt price at closure limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—reverence as continual repair rather than obedience—emerges through image (thread in cracks, orchid perfume) and the altar discovery. The final line "reverence is not a rule you obey, but a path you keep sewing back into being" edges toward stated moral, but it grows from the sewing action and altar particulars. Subtext operates in the sleepwalking method and "overlaps" metaphor. The lack of on-page friction or counter-example keeps thematic complexity muted, holding the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: "pale petals give the night an orchid solace," "sweet, bruised perfume." Diction remains elevated throughout without jarring register shifts. Distance is stable third-limited on Ila. However, perceptual filtering is thin—Ila's way of noticing reads generically poetic rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears. The elevated register occasionally drifts toward ornament ("haunting optimism," "bruised perfume") without tactical purpose, and the final paragraph's phrasing flirts with theme-echo, limiting upward reach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("entrances like open mouths," "waves frozen mid crash"), but density issues accumulate: "hauntingly optimistic" is glossed twice in adjacent lines; "reverence" and "precedent" recur without reweighting; the phrase "after the tide pools empty" bookends without causal change. Template stems appear ("she wondered," "she proposed," "she understood"). The final paragraph stacks exposition rather than propelling through image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence per the artifact pack, preventing entry to 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—sleepwalking as communal labyrinth navigation, sewing as literal and thematic repair—is fresh and purposeful. The illustration plate as shifting map and the "overlapping footsteps" motif feel specific. However, the emotional arc (fear → careful songs) and the revelation (labyrinth as covenant, not prison) follow familiar redemption-of-sacred-space templates without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. Risk-taking in the sleepwalking conceit is notable but does not fully escape the well-worn "community heals forgotten wound" frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ila appears throughout, interprets the plate, proposes the sleepwalking method, sews thread, and follows it to the altar. These choices advance plot, but key turns (smuggler's apology, children walking awake) happen around her rather than through her on-page decision under pressure. She is present in closure but not causally active in a peak choice. Two gates (setup, closure presence) met; middle development is observational. Score reflects causal presence without decisive agency at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plate is introduced early, held to the moon (paths shift), laid on stone to match corridors, and placed upright "like a window" at closure. It functions in three beats: discovery, navigation anchor, and final installation. Its shifting-path property enables the method. However, the plate does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is used, not wrestled with. Presence across beats and closure linkage earn mid-6s; lack of friction or visible trade-off caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" shapes stakes from the outset: smugglers violate the no-entry rule, prayer ribbons turn to warnings, old reverence curdles. The core conflict—repairing covenant after precedent collapse—drives Ila's sewing project and the townsfolk's shift from fear to careful songs. The concept appears in setup, middle (rockfall exposes corridors, "broken precedents of the map"), and closure (reverence redefined). It constrains tactics (cannot obey old rule, must invent new path) and charges the ending image. All three gates met with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is introduced early and tied to Ila's brother's survival, but it functions primarily as label. The trait is told ("her optimism was haunting, the kind that walks beside grief") rather than shown through a choice with visible cost. The sleepwalking proposal might reflect optimism, yet no on-page moment demonstrates grief-plus-hope constraining an action or forcing a trade-off. Setup gate met; middle and closure gates rely on summary. Swappable with "resilient" or "hopeful" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sewing drives the method: Ila sews orchid thread into cracks at ankle height, creating a tactile guide; later she sews nets across unstable gaps. The action is present in setup (spools carried), middle (thread laid after tracing footprints), and closure (nets laced to iron rings, stitched route walked by children). It is irreplaceable—the story's central metaphor and literal tactic. Removing sewing would collapse both plot and theme. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; score reflects essentiality across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sleepwalking method is proposed early, enacted in the middle (smuggler lies down, rises with dust, scuffed footprints traced), and mentioned at closure (children walk "awake for the first time" implies prior sleepwalking). It shapes the central tactic and is specific. However, the mechanics remain vague—how does sleep enable correct navigation? The method enables rather than constrains; no cost or failed attempt dramatizes its difficulty. Setup and middle gates met; closure reference is oblique. Functional but not charged with friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth is present throughout: entrances "like open mouths," collapses erase turns, iron rings anchor nets, altar revealed by rockfall. It supplies the unstable terrain that necessitates the sewing method and provides the historical freight (covenant place, forgotten grief) that reweights the ending. Spatial detail (spirals, thresholds, cleft door) is concrete and constrains movement. The setting charges the final image (orchids in corridors, wind blessing passages). All three gates met with strong causal and atmospheric pressure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" appears in the opening and as a meeting cue, but exerts no pressure on pacing or decisions. No clock tightens choices; the piece spans weeks ("came from the tide line weeks ago") without tracking elapsed time or using tidal rhythm to escalate. The timeframe is ornamental. Setup gate barely met (opener anchor); middle and closure gates absent. Swappable with "at dusk" or any atmospheric marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated explicitly and drives the sewing project, altar discovery, and communal transformation. It appears in setup ("she chose to sew a path from ruin to reverence"), middle (following thread to altar, mending gaps), and closure (reverence as ongoing path). However, the desire is more narrated than dramatized through on-page friction; no moment shows Ila torn between reverence-as-rule and reverence-as-repair with visible cost. Present across beats but not deeply conflicted in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is introduced early (orchids calm dockhands), recurs in middle (spools "dyed the color of orchid throats"), and charges closure ("orchids instead of torches," "sweet, bruised perfume"). The tone is lyric, gentle, and consistent. However, it does not modulate under pressure—grief, fear, and transformation all receive the same soft-focus treatment. The tone supports theme but does not deepen through turns. Setup and closure gates met; middle presence is descriptive. Coherent but static, trending mid-5s.</comment>
