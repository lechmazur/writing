<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's disguise strategy ("wisdom disguised as foolishness") is established but her internal contradiction remains static—she reads as consistently clever throughout without genuine vulnerability or misstep. Her choices are purposeful (stitching errors, nudging the orrery) but the embodied stakes feel muted; we're told she's at risk yet her affect is calm competence. Master Kest applies pressure but remains functional; his danger to her or hers to him never sharpens. The ending forecloses the path to silence (she sends the chart), but the cost—social, physical, or relational—is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Liora, observatory, three weeks before coup). The drive lens reads Causal: intercepted manifests → stitched errors → orrery synchronization → beacon match → evidence sealed and sent. Each move narrows options logically. Closure is Decisive Change with cost: she sends the chart, forecloses her safety, and the city "could still choose another story"—yet that final cost is conceptual and distant rather than immediate bodily or relational price paid on the page. One meaningful tightening (boots on stair, lieutenant confrontation) tests her under pressure and she survives via misdirection, but the sequence feels more like a demonstration than an escalation that costs her something irretrievable in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, brass rail, clockwork orrery, and eternal flame are vivid and purposeful. The orrery constrains Liora's method (she must align beacon timings) and the flame's "never flickers between realities" property is load-bearing for the adjacent-possibilities logic. Sensory detail is selective (autumn wind, dry leaves, echoed silence) and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves. The flame in a glass cup over the orrery is handled twice and charges the final proof, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: expose the coup conspiracy before it hardens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Guard lieutenant enters, forcing Liora to deflect via misdirection (orrery nudge). That move is clever but the on-page cost is minimal—he leaves "puzzled and laughing," she succeeds without visible forfeiture. The escalation reads more as puzzle-solving than forced trade-off. Under the Causal lens, the sequence tightens logically but the final act (sealing and sending the chart) is recounted rather than dramatized with immediate bodily or social price, leaving the cost conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges organically from Liora's stitching, the "chorus trapped inside numbers," and the city's choice between violence and another story. The eternal flame as "the one light that never flickered between realities" functions thematically without overt moralizing. The final image—"echoed silence, but now it sounded like a held breath"—reweights prior material with earned resonance. No lecture or prompt-echo contaminates the ending. The piece resists tidy closure while maintaining coherent thematic pressure tied to particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Liora notices thread, light, signal patterns). Dialogue between Liora and Kest carries subtext and code ("Do the stars still giggle at you?") and advances plot efficiently. Voice is distinct with elevated diction ("adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") that fits the setting and narrator. One friction: the prose occasionally tilts toward exposition ("to prove it, they had to synchronize…") that tells rather than dramatizes, flattening urgency mid-beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple sentences begin with conjunctive or sequential stems ("To the sentries…," "But in her stitches…," "When the beacon tones…") creating template cadence. The phrase "echoed silence" recurs three times without functional reweighting, trending toward motif over-reliance. Figurative language is dense in places ("whole chorus of unheard stories trapped inside numbers") but remains legible. One paraphrase loop: "she began unraveling conspiracies" / "watched the conspiracy unravel thread by thread." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 to −0.8 deduction in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery-as-espionage, adjacent possibilities as method, and eternal flame as multi-reality anchor is fresh and non-obvious. The "disguise wisdom as foolishness" tactic transforms the competent-spy trope through specific craft (stitched errors, humming off-key). Risk-taking in voice and concept (reality-flicker mechanics, synchronizing light with thread) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "adjacent possibilities" logic is asserted more than it is dramatized with on-page cost, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Overall, the premise feels purposeful and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout, her choices drive all key turns: stitching the error-map, placing linen over the orrery, holding the eternal flame to reveal conspirators' chosen possibility, nudging the orrery to misdirect the lieutenant, and sealing the chart for publication. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. Her decisions alter tactics and enable the conspiracy's exposure. Cost is tied to her sending the evidence, foreclosing safety. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eternal flame appears early (brass rail), is lifted and used over the orrery to cast twin shadows that reveal the chosen possibility (beat two), and its property ("never flickered between realities") is load-bearing for the proof. Three distinct touches across setup, development, and closure. The flame's unique property constrains method and charges the evidence-gathering climax. High specificity and irreplaceability; visible cost connection (the proof depends on it).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the dominant stake from paragraph three onward. Liora stitches errors, synchronizes the orrery to match signal logs, surfaces the "chorus of unheard stories," and seals the chart to expose the coup. The concept shapes tactics (she must decode manifests, time beacons, and misdirect guards) and drives closure (sending evidence to printers). Setup, development, and payoff are clear. Solid causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is signaled early (humming off-key, letting braid unravel, "no one feared a seamstress") and enables her deflection of the Guard lieutenant ("babbled about 'singing planets'"). Setup and one development beat are clear. The trait constrains on-page action with visible benefit (lieutenant leaves). However, closure does not revisit the trait; she acts openly with Kest throughout, reducing payoff linkage. Functional but mid-band due to limited closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Synchronization is signaled early ("orrery that could synchronize with the city's signal beacons"), executed mid-story (placing linen over turning spheres, waiting for light/thread alignment, "the air itself seemed to click"), and the successful sync surfaces the evidence that drives closure. Three beats: setup, execution, and result. The action is irreplaceable—without it, the conspiracy cannot be proven. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is introduced early (Liora traces routes "that existed only as adjacent possibilities") and the eternal flame reveals "which possibility the conspirators had chosen." The method shapes her inquiry and the proof's logic. However, the mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—what it costs her to perceive or toggle between possibilities is never shown on the page. Setup and closure participation are present; middle constraint is weak. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory frames all action, supplies the orrery and signal beacons essential to the proof, and its "echoed silence" recurs to charge atmosphere and closure. The brass rail holds the flame, the dome returns sound, and the stair brings the lieutenant. Setup, development (orrery use), and payoff (held breath ending) are clear. The setting constrains method (she must be here to sync beacons) and charges the final image. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Three weeks before the coup" anchors urgency and the phrase "before the coup the city could still choose another story" returns at closure, reweighting the window. The timeframe shapes stakes (conspiracy must be exposed now) but does not tighten on-page tactics—no scene clock, no visible countdown that alters her moves mid-action. Setup and thematic payoff are clear; middle pressure is implied rather than dramatized. Functional with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to listen for unheard stories in the gaps between official reports" is stated early and drives her stitching, orrery use, and decision to publish the "chorus of unheard stories trapped inside numbers." Setup, development, and closure participation are present. The motivation is coherent but not visibly conflicted—she pursues it without friction or cost that makes her reconsider. Solid integration; mid-high band due to lack of on-page want-versus-cost tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears three times: opening ("the halls answered with echoed silence"), mid-story ("the dome returned her words as echoed silence"), and closure ("the observatory fell back into echoed silence, but now it sounded like a held breath"). The tone is consistent, modulates with pressure (held breath charges the ending), and the final reprise reweights the motif with poise rather than resolution. Strong setup and payoff; the recurrence charges the closure image effectively.</comment>
