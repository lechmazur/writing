<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's talent for naming and its burial under grief provides a coherent internal motivation that drives the quest and shapes the final choice to reclaim it. The embodied moment—"the pain tried to shut my throat"—anchors the climactic seeding action with visceral cost. However, the seer remains largely a guide with minimal internal contradiction, and the protagonist's emotional progression from numbness to release follows a relatively smooth arc without the messy irrationality that would elevate this into the 8+ range. The final reclamation of the naming gift feels earned but not fully tested by competing impulses in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: remembering becomes painful → seek the stone → trade a memory to access it → reclaim the naming talent → escape the nightly shuffle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure—stepping through with the stone while the bookstore quiets—delivers a Decisive Change (reclaiming agency and the path home) with visible cost (the raw memory seeded, the refusal of kinder lies). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the hidden thunder motif, the substitution mechanic); it holds through the ending without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nightly shuffle begins and the naming pins corridors in place, narrowing options with immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: shelves like cliff faces, book spines glittering with mica, the locked case. The environment constrains choice (the nightly shuffle threatens to strand the protagonist in "kinder lies") and the feather—a micro-setting object—enables the stone's unlocking and acts as a compass during the reality substitution. The hidden thunder recurs as atmosphere that charges the final beat ("the hidden thunder quieted"). Spatial choreography remains clear across descent and corridor navigation. The setting does more than backdrop; it pressures the protagonist's tactics and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home by recovering the lost language stone and reclaiming the naming talent—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates in a clear sequence: the seer's recognition triggers numbness, the stone demands a true memory (raising cost), midnight approaches and reality begins to shuffle (narrowing the window), and the protagonist must name each turn aloud to resist the mountain's substitution. Agency is visible: the choice to seed the raw memory and the active naming that pins corridors in place both foreclose retreat and earn the final escape. The cost is legible on the page (the spilled grief, the refusal of gentler histories). One meaningful tightening—midnight's approach and the blur of shelves—forces the protagonist to commit the talent in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images and choices: the bookstore as archive of donated memories, the substitution of reality for mercy, the protagonist's refusal to trade pain for a polished lie. The lost naming talent and the feather's texture of air both avoid overt symbolism while charging the ending with layered meaning. The final image—stone warm in pocket, thunder quieting, released toward "the true curve of home"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can one bear memory and still find home?) without stating a moral. The seer's request to "teach others to carry their pain" articulates theme but does so in dialogue and in service of world logic, not as authorial intrusion. Subtext operates in the contrast between the mountain's mercy and the protagonist's refusal, and in the cost of reclaiming a buried gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with tight control over the protagonist's perceptual signature: "I told her… I said… I thought of…" The diction carries a consistent lyric-folk register—"soundless grammar," "seed it with one true memory," "compass needle made of breath"—that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. The seer's voice is distinct in its soft formality ("she called me by the name I had refused to remember"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the memory-seeding beat and the final escape. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; focalization is clean. The prose rhythm accelerates subtly as midnight nears, and the final sentence's syntactic sweep mirrors the release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with longer exploratory sentences early ("shelves rose like cliff faces, and every corridor bent back on itself, as if the building listened for footsteps the way a storm listens for trees") and tighter, more urgent beats as pressure mounts ("We walked fast, naming each turn aloud"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language (hidden thunder, scales on sleeping fish, compass needle made of breath) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor paraphrase appears in adjacent phrases ("not a polished story" / "the raw moment," "nightly shuffle" / "kinder lies"), and a few template stems recur ("the seer…" as sentence opener across multiple beats), but these do not measurably dull the closure image. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout; no major loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of buried talent, memory-as-currency, and a mountain that substitutes reality offers a fresh angle on the familiar grief-and-return arc. The feather as method (remembering air better than minds do) and the naming-as-navigation twist transform standard fantasy tropes through specific world logic and embodied cost. The protagonist's choice to seed a raw memory rather than accept a polished substitute avoids the safety middle. The "hidden thunder" motif and the seer's mercury-glass eyes read as particular to this voice and world, not generic ornament. The final image—stone warm, thunder quieting, released toward the true curve—feels earned in hindsight and irreducible to a different configuration of names and places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seer appears in the first junction, leads the descent, explains the mountain's substitution mechanic, offers the feather method, warns about seeding a true memory, and whispers the final insight about the naming talent. She enables multiple beats and constrains choice (the stone will not open for an empty seeker). However, her own decisions do not create key turns; she guides and facilitates rather than forcing reversals. Present in setup, development, and closure participation (she asks the protagonist to return and teach others). Causal involvement is moderate; her role is essential but largely as catalyst rather than antagonist or co-actor with conflicting goals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lost language stone is introduced in the first third as the quest object, appears in the locked case (middle beat), is opened via the feather and seeded with the true memory (climactic beat), and is carried warm in the protagonist's pocket through the final escape, directly shaping the closure. It is handled or used across at least three distinct beats: the case unlocking, the seeding, and the walk with the stone as anchor. Its specific properties (stores maps of return in soundless grammar, demands a true memory, hums with unsaid rooms) are irreplaceable; a generic talisman would not serve. Visible cost is tied to its use (the raw memory must be spilled). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Buried talents shape the protagonist's motivation and the stone's access condition: the seer asks "what talent I had buried to survive," and the protagonist's confession of packing the naming gift under years of labor is the key that allows the case to open. The talent's underground persistence and eventual reclamation drive the final escape (naming each turn aloud pins corridors against the shuffle). The concept is not merely thematic backdrop; it alters on-page options and tactics. Cost is visible: the protagonist must acknowledge and deploy the buried gift with accompanying pain. Present in setup (the question), middle (the answer and unlocking), and payoff (active naming during escape). Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is introduced early (the seer's explanation) and becomes the live constraint at the climax: "As midnight approached, reality began to substitute itself again, and I felt shelves blur." The nightly shuffle forces the protagonist to name each turn aloud to pin corridors in place, directly enabling the protagonist's tactic and raising stakes (stranding in kinder lies is the alternative). The attribute constrains action with visible cost (must act before midnight, must use the naming talent actively). Present in setup (explanation), development (implicit threat), and payoff (active resistance during escape). Causal involvement is strong; the trait is not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Seed" as action is signaled mid-story ("the stone would show me home only if I was willing to seed it with one true memory") and executed in the climactic beat: "I pressed the feather to the stone and let the raw moment spill." This action triggers the mountain's response (rumble, aisles shift), reveals the true shape of home in the stone's surface, and earns the final escape. The seeding is irreplaceable; no other action (touching, asking, offering a polished story) would satisfy the stone's demand or honor the thematic stakes. The action defines the protagonist's choice and forecloses the path of trading pain for comfort. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection. Present in setup (the seer's warning), executed in climax, and its consequence carries into the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The feather is introduced in the middle third ("to read the stone via the texture of a feather, because feathers remember air better than minds do"), used immediately to unlock the case ("When I stroked it, syllables rose under my skin, and the case clicked open"), and recurs during the escape as a compass ("the feather kept a steady texture, like a compass needle made of breath"). The method is specific and irreplaceable (via texture, not sight or sound). It appears in two distinct beats (unlocking and navigation) and charges the final image with its compass function. Cost connection is present (the feather channels the raw memory and pins reality). Setup occurs slightly late (mid-story), capping upside, but development and payoff are strong. Causal involvement is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain frames the entire narrative, supplies the archive-of-memories world logic, constrains movement (corridors bend, the nightly shuffle threatens), and provides resources (the locked case, the seer, the method of naming to pin reality). The setting is irreplaceable; no other locale would generate the substitution mechanic or the descent into wetter stacks. It shapes multiple choices: the protagonist must navigate switchback stairs, descend to the locked case, and name turns aloud to resist the shuffle. The final beat explicitly involves the setting: "behind me the hidden thunder quieted, as if the bookstore had accepted my seed." Present in setup (opening lines), development (descent and navigation), and payoff (the mountain's response and release). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after remembering became painful" anchors the protagonist's motivation and is restated in the opening line, but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions on the page. The midnight deadline (reality substitutes nightly) provides some urgency in the final third, but the story does not track elapsed time beat-by-beat or show the protagonist racing a visible countdown. The timeframe is more atmospheric anchor than tactical constraint. Present in setup (opening) and implicitly in the midnight complication, but not actively shaping multiple beats with visible cost. Functional but not indispensable; another temporal frame (e.g., a fixed number of steps, a fading spell) could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the shape of home" is stated in the opening line, dramatized in the quest for the lost language stone, and conflicted by the cost (must seed a raw memory of the last goodbye). The protagonist's desire faces friction: the temptation of the mountain's mercy (gentler histories) versus the refusal to trade pain. The final payoff delivers the shape of home as "a curve, a crescent of shoreline and a doorway cut into basalt" and releases the protagonist toward it. The motivation drives choices across setup (the climb and request), middle (the seeding choice), and payoff (the escape and the seer's request to return). Visible cost is tied to the motivation throughout. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone of "hidden thunder" is introduced in the third sentence ("The air held hidden thunder, a pressure behind the paper dust") and recurs across the narrative: the rumble after seeding, the reality shuffle, and the final quieting ("behind me the hidden thunder quieted"). The tone modulates with pressure—anticipatory in the opening, active during the seeding and shuffle, resolved in the closure. It is coherent through turns and charges the final image with a sense of release and the mountain's acceptance. The tone is not static; it evolves as the protagonist moves from suppression to reclamation. Specific to this story's voice and stakes; not swappable with a generic "eerie" or "melancholy" atmosphere. Strong presence across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>
