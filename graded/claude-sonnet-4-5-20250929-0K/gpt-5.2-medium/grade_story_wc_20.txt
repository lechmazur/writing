<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the craft mechanics—dripping her own name into the crucible to find Orin costs her childhood, and returning stolen names makes her tongue "honest and raw." Internal contradiction appears when her heart wants resurrection but her craft denies it, forcing the smaller redemption. The final choice to lighten her name "by one lie" and bring Orin home with his true name intact is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of shortcuts. Minor deduction: Ellis's agency is summarized rather than dramatized in the culvert scene, and the transition from showing him the coin to his sobbing confession feels compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (inferred as Hybrid, judged under Causal dominant at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The coin's transformation via Mara's name-sacrifice causally reveals Ellis, who then leads to Orin's body—a clear because/therefore chain. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara places the mended coin on the anvil, her name now lighter, accepting responsibility in place of resurrection. Cost is visible: she surrendered borrowed names and childhood, and tomorrow she returns Orin with his true name intact. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inlay resolves to ELLIS. The mosaic structure (foundry search → Ellis confrontation → culvert → return) coheres under a single POV and contiguous night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry constrains Mara's search—quench pit reflection shows ORIN, gold-flecked clay becomes the reagent for the coin's inlay. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "gutters spilling silver water into slag heaps," "air holds the old heat," rivets shining "as if grief itself were luminous." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from broken doors to casting bays to quench pit to culvert to anvil. The foundry's cold furnaces and pooled rainwater anchor the night's urgency and Mara's solitary work. Minor gap: Ellis's shack and the culvert receive less grounding, though they function adequately for their brief scenes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: redeem Orin (or at least his name) for his mother. Escalation occurs when Mara's first name-drop into the coin reveals only a partial clue (the gold line sketching a circle), forcing her to grind her own kintsugi cup and speak all stolen names to complete the inlay—narrowing her options and raising the cost. The coin then resolves to ELLIS, opening the path to Orin's body. Agency is consistent: Mara chooses the smaller redemption and pays with her shortcuts. The confrontation with Ellis and the culvert retrieval feel slightly compressed, reducing the visceral cost of that turn, but the final placement of the coin reweights prior material with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—balance as accountability, the weight of names as both power and obligation—emerges organically from the alchemy mechanics and Mara's arc. The kintsugi imagery (gold-flecked clay, mended cup, the coin's inlay as "not decoration but a vow") threads through without over-announcement. The ending's "luminous regret sharpen into responsibility" resonates as a non-literal answer: Mara cannot resurrect Orin, but she can return his name intact and lighten her own by surrendering lies. Subtext operates in the contrast between Mara's discipline ("measure gain against loss") and her prior shortcuts. No thematic echo or label-speak; the final image of the glowing coin and the promise to bring Orin home carries the conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable throughout. Mara's perceptual signature—alchemical precision, focus on names as substance, regret coded as "newly polished shame"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches her craft expertise without jargon excess: "reagent," "distilled," "quench pit," "inlay." Rhythm modulates with pressure: the opening is reflective and detailed, the coin transformation accelerates, the confrontation with Ellis tightens, the ending slows into resolution. Dialogue with Ellis is brief but functional, his flinch and sob conveying guilt without exposition. Minor slip: "luminous regret" in the final sentence edges toward over-articulation, though it stays within Mara's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer sentences for reflection and shorter beats for action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight the coin image effectively. Minor issues: "factually mystical" in paragraph one feels slightly self-conscious, and "the sort of deliberate mending that announces what was shattered" edges toward over-explanation when "kintsugi intentions" already carries that meaning. Filter verbs ("I see the reflected word ORIN") are voice-appropriate but cluster lightly in the quench pit beat. Figurative density ("grief itself were luminous," "shame that feels newly polished") is high but coheres under Mara's craft lens without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemy-of-names premise is fresh and the kintsugi integration is purposeful rather than decorative. The coin's empty face as a puzzle that costs Mara her shortcuts to solve offers a non-obvious synthesis. The choice to aim for "a smaller redemption" rather than resurrection avoids the stock fantasy resolution. However, the core mystery structure (item → clue → confrontation → retrieval → closure) follows a familiar template, and the transformation hinges more on world-building specificity than on a bold structural or emotional risk. Ellis's role as thief-turned-confessor is functional but not surprising. The ending's emotional truth elevates the execution within familiar beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as balanced alchemist drives all major turns: she chooses to drip her own name into the crucible (beat one), grinds her kintsugi cup and surrenders stolen names to complete the inlay (beat two), confronts Ellis and trades the coin's resolution for Orin's location (beat three), and places the mended coin on the anvil with the vow to return Orin's name intact (closure). Her discipline—"measure gain against loss"—shapes every tactic and the final acceptance of responsibility over resurrection. The profession is irreplaceable; swapping "alchemist" for another role would collapse the name-as-substance mechanics and the cost structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is handled in four beats: received from Orin's mother (setup), warmed and inscribed with the gold line when Mara drips her name (development one), receives the kintsugi-clay inlay and resolves to ELLIS when she surrenders stolen names (development two), placed on the anvil at closure with its "mended face glowing like a small sunrise." Its empty thirteenth face is the puzzle that structures the night's work, and the Ram sign settles to bind Ellis. The coin's transformation from broken token to vow charges the final image. Causal role is strong, though the mechanics of how the signs "revolve" and settle on the Ram could be more explicitly tied to Mara's agency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions appear in three moments: the gold-flecked clay found by searchers signals "deliberate mending that announces what was shattered," Mara grinds her own kintsugi cup into powder to mix with the clay, and the coin's inlay becomes "not decoration but a vow." The concept shapes Mara's method—using her practice piece and stolen names to mend the coin—and thematically underwrites the ending's acceptance of visible cost. However, the kintsugi logic is more symbolic than mechanical; it does not constrain a choice so much as flavor the redemption arc. The concept could be replaced with another craft metaphor (say, soldering or binding) without fundamentally altering the plot, though thematic resonance would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" anchors the world rule: names can be weighed, distilled, and used as reagents. This trait enables every on-page action—Mara's name-drip warms the coin and loosens her childhood, the stolen names harden the inlay, Ellis's real name seals the shroud. The phrase "in the strictest sense, factually mystical" signals that alchemy here is not metaphor but physics, which prevents Mara from resurrecting Orin and forces the smaller redemption. Cost is visible: surrendering names costs Mara her shortcuts and makes her tongue "honest and raw." The attribute is weight-bearing but introduced via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, and the phrase itself feels slightly self-conscious.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Redeem" structures the entire night: Mara is hired to "redeem her boy from whatever darkness had swallowed him," aims for "a smaller redemption" when resurrection is impossible, redeems the coin by mending its empty face, and at closure vows to "bring Orin home with his true name intact"—the redemption scaled to what alchemy allows. The action drives every major turn: the coin transformation, the confrontation with Ellis (who must "give back the name he spent"), and the final placement of the mended coin as a vow. Swapping "redeem" for "find" or "retrieve" would erase the moral and alchemical calculus that defines Mara's choices and costs. The word recurs with escalating specificity and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By exploring limits" is signaled early—Mara is "sworn to measure gain against loss," and her apprentice story about trying to "lighten my own name" and cracking Master Juno's scales establishes that alchemy has boundaries. She tests the zodiac coin's limits by dripping her name to see which sign the blank will hold, then pushes further by grinding her cup and surrendering all stolen names. The method shapes two beats but is more thematic posture than mechanical constraint; Mara does not fail or iterate on-page, and the limits she explores (cannot resurrect, must offer equal truth) are stated rather than discovered through trial. The phrase "exploring limits" itself does not appear; the concept is inferred from her discipline.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry supplies the quench pit (reflection shows ORIN), the gold-flecked clay, the anvil for tool-setting and final coin placement, and the atmospheric anchor (cold furnaces, old heat, luminous rivets). The setting is present in all four major locations (foundry search, Ellis's shack, culvert, return to foundry) and the rain threads through as continuous pressure. The foundry's emptiness (searchers gone, furnaces cold) intensifies Mara's solitary work. However, the setting does not block a choice or force a tactical shift—Mara could perform the same alchemy elsewhere. The anvil's return at closure charges the final image, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the search party disbands at dawn" establishes the timeframe, and Mara works through the night until "at dusk I return to the foundry" and vows "Tomorrow I will bring Orin home." The arc from dawn to dusk to tomorrow is clear and the night anchors Mara's solitary urgency. However, the clock does not visibly tighten decisions—Mara does not race daylight or face interruption, and elapsed time within beats (coin transformation, walk to Ellis, culvert retrieval) is vague. The timeframe is functional and present in setup/closure but does not constrain tactics. The "after" framing delays setup slightly, costing early-signal credit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to understand the weight of names"—is dramatized through her apprentice memory (trying to lighten her own name cracked the scales) and through every choice: she must offer an equal truth for each transformation, she grinds her kintsugi cup and surrenders stolen names to complete the inlay, and the resolution is that "the weight of names is not only what they can do, but what they demand." The motivation drives the middle beats and the final vow. Friction appears between her desire for resurrection and the craft's limits, forcing the smaller redemption. However, the phrase "understand the weight of names" is more thematic insight than goal; Mara already knows names have weight—she is learning to accept the cost of shortcuts. The motivation trends interpretive rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is established early ("shame that feels newly polished") and threads through: "grief itself were luminous," the coin's glow, and the closing line "luminous regret sharpen into responsibility." The tone is consistent—elegiac, precise, suffused with guilt and craft discipline—and modulates with pressure: reflective in the opening, focused during the coin work, taut at the Ellis confrontation, resolved at closure. The final image of the coin "glowing like a small sunrise" and Mara's name "lighter by one lie" charges the ending without tipping into sentimentality. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional register and thematic weight.</comment>
