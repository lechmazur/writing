<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lamplighter's pursuit of sound-as-color anchors a clear interior contradiction (honesty-as-screen versus private vow), and the underwater passage embodies concrete choices under pressure. However, the protagonist's central shift—speaking the vow and experiencing violet—feels more like a granted epiphany than an earned consequence of prior struggle; the "promising to hear without wanting" resolves tension cleanly without visible internal cost. The character remains consistent, but the final transformation arrives too easily, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lamplighter moves from pier to underwater wreck, each beat layering imagery and intensifying the central question about sound's color until the vow produces the violet bloom. Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist commits to "keep walking my pier at night, lighting lamps so other people could find their own colors," foreclosing the solitary search in favor of service—a reweighting with implicit cost. The two-location structure (pier surface, underwater library) and the temporal envelope (lantern release framing the descent and return) remain coherent. Minor weakness: the catch-release mechanism and glowing card feel slightly convenient rather than fully motivated by prior causality, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library constrains the protagonist's discovery—glass cases preserve the vellum cards, the registry slot accepts the key tag—and the shattered porthole delivers the sky-lantern counterpoint that charges the final violet bloom. Sensory detail (silt, waving curtains, muffled applause as silver rain) is vivid and selective, filtered through the lamplighter's synesthetic bias. The underwater setting's micro-elements (narrow brass slot, emergency lanterns, card pressed to chest) all participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to discover the color of sound—is signaled early and remains live throughout the descent. The key-tag find initiates the quest, the underwater passage tightens access and air constraints, and the vow's utterance produces the violet answer, narrowing the protagonist's future path to service rather than solitary pursuit. However, the escalation lacks a true reversal or forced trade-off; the luminous vow functions more as a reward than a costly choice, and no live option is visibly foreclosed until the final commitment, which arrives swiftly. One meaningful deepening occurs (the honesty-as-lens realization), but pressure feels more accreted than sharpened under crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—truth as lens rather than shield, perception without possession—emerges organically from the lamplighter's nightly ritual and underwater discovery. The vow's instruction ("to hear without wanting, to see without grasping") reweights the opening "honesty was a screen" without moralizing, and the final covenant to light lamps "so other people could find their own colors" offers a resonant answer grounded in particulars. However, the protagonist's realization that "my habit of hiding behind truth could be turned inside out" borders on explicit articulation of theme, slightly undercutting subtext. The synesthetic imagery (pale green bell notes, violet bloom) charges the ending without symbolic overreach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The first-person voice maintains a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature: "the waterline looked stitched with small moons," "each creak of the ship signified a new hue." POV remains stable throughout the two-location structure, and the narrator's synesthetic filter is character-specific and purposeful. However, some constructions lean toward elevated diction that occasionally strains naturalism—"by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify" and "opened like a throat" feel slightly performative rather than urgent. The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses during the porthole moment), but a few filter verbs ("seemed to," "realized then why") dull immediacy at high-tension beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is mostly concrete ("curtains that waved like tired flags," "silt," "split ring"). However, multiple passages exhibit mild overwriting and register drift: "by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify" is syntactically opaque, and the phrase "insisting that every sound has a color and every color can be kept if you bind it to truth" reads expository rather than enacted. A paraphrase loop appears in the vow passage: "promising to hear without wanting, to see without grasping, to let sound paint me and then pass" restates the same commitment three ways without adding pressure. The closure beat ("not as proof for anyone else, but as a covenant to keep walking my pier") remains clear, so deductions are capped at −0.4 under the non-closure adjustment, but density and propulsion slip in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—synesthesia as literal underwater discovery, service ritual inverted into private quest—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock lamplighter or shipwreck tropes. The vow mechanism (phosphor ink holding light) transforms the familiar sunken-treasure premise through the protagonist's perceptual peculiarity. However, the "luminous vows" and catch-release registry device carry a slight whiff of puzzle-box convenience, and the final covenant to light lamps for others is emotionally earnest but structurally predictable once the vow is spoken. The piece takes genuine risk with its accumulative, lyric structure and sustained synesthetic lens, earning modest elevation within band (+0.2), but does not achieve the inevitable-in-hindsight synthesis required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lamplighter's occupation frames the opening ritual, motivates the nightly timing, and supplies the final covenant to "keep walking my pier at night, lighting lamps so other people could find their own colors." The role participates in setup, middle (lighting the underwater path with the hooded lamp), and closure, where the service ethos reweights the solitary quest. The character's choices—descending with the key tag, setting lamp intervals, speaking the vow—create the story's key turns. Present early, drives two beats, and shapes the ending with visible cost (shift from private pursuit to public service).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag is found under Pier Nine, carried as talisman, fits the registry slot to release the vow drawer, and is pocketed at the end as covenant rather than proof. It appears in setup, enables the middle beat (catch mechanism), and returns in the closure paragraph with reweighted meaning (from artifact to covenant). The tag's stamped name "Meridian" links pier to shipwreck, and its brass specificity matters: the narrow slot requires this exact object. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present, placing it solidly in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous vows bundle appears at the structural midpoint, provides the instructions that reframe the protagonist's honesty-as-lens insight, and delivers the utterance that produces the violet bloom. The vow's phosphor-ink glow charges the library scene and the spoken promise alters the protagonist's future path. However, the vows arrive late (past the 40% mark) and function more as a revelation device than a constraint shaping earlier tactics. Present in middle and closure with moderate causal pressure, but late introduction and limited beat involvement prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is stated early ("my honesty was a screen") and returns at the realization beat ("my habit of hiding behind truth could be turned inside out, making honesty not a shield but a lens"). The trait motivates the protagonist's private vow and the final shift to service, but the cost—choosing to light lamps for others rather than pursue solitary discovery—is implied rather than dramatized with visible friction. The attribute shapes one key turn (the lens realization) and primes closure, meeting two gates, but the on-page tradeoff remains understated, capping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Signify" appears once explicitly ("by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify") and recurs implicitly when "each creak of the ship signified a new hue." The action names the protagonist's interpretive stance and connects the underwater exploration to the synesthetic discovery. However, the verb functions more as thematic labeling than as a distinct, irreplaceable action that redefines options; swapping "signify" for "indicate" or "reveal" would not break story logic. Present early and in closure with moderate thematic charge, but limited mechanical necessity keeps it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The phrase "by wandering purposefully" appears once in the descent paragraph, naming the protagonist's mode of exploration. The method is consistent with the lamplighter's nightly ritual (deliberate yet receptive) and the underwater aisle-walking, but it does not constrain tactics or generate friction. The manner of movement is coherent but could be described with any synonym (searching deliberately, exploring intentionally) without altering outcomes. One beat involvement, minimal causal pressure, and no closure participation place it just above functional swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken ship supplies the glass cases that preserve the vellum vows, the registry drawer with its brass slot, and the shattered porthole that frames the sky-lantern counterpoint at closure. The setting constrains the protagonist's discovery (air limit, muffled sound, silt-furred shelves) and charges the final image (violet bloom filling the library, corridor exit). Present early via Meridian wreck mention, drives two beats (entry and vow discovery), and directly shapes the ending. Environment as active participant in escalation and closure, meeting the 9+ gate for setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sky lantern release brackets the descent: "the first lanterns rose just as my last match died" at the start, peak applause as "silver rain" during the vow, and "the last lanterns were only sparks" at the protagonist's return. The timeframe creates urgency (air supply, festival window) and supplies the visual/auditory counterpoint that charges the synesthetic discovery. The clock is tracked and tightens the middle beat, but does not force a hard choice or create escalating pressure beyond atmospheric bracketing. Two-gate presence (setup and closure) with moderate tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the color of sound" is named early ("one private vow"), dramatized in the harbor-bell moment ("seemed to brush my eyes with pale green"), tested in the underwater passage (muffled shout as "dull gold," applause as "silver rain"), and satisfied at closure (violet bloom). The motivation drives the descent, the vow utterance, and the final covenant shift from solitary pursuit to service. Friction appears in the shift from seeking proof to offering light for others, a visible cost. Early signal, drives three beats, closure linkage, and cost connection all present, placing it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named in the opening paragraph ("Tonight the town was quiet in a meteor hush") and reprised at closure ("In that meteor hush under the sea"). The tone—suspended, expectant, luminous—remains coherent through the descent and modulates appropriately under pressure (short clauses during the porthole beat, expanded syntax during the vow). The final reprise charges the ending image, reweighting the town's waiting silence with the protagonist's underwater discovery. Early signal, coherent through turns, and closure charge meet the high-band gate for tone, though a few mid-story passages ("by wandering purposefully toward what the tag seemed to signify") drift toward exposition rather than sustaining the hushed cadence.</comment>
