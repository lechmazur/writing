<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's silent empathy is embodied through gesture and staging rather than label, with his spiraling calm enacted via the shutter-weaving. The girl's guilt is dramatized through the mirror descent and blood on her chin, earning the final confession. Interiority remains concrete: "unsaid words clung to her tongue like silt." Minor slip: the guardian's motivation ("teach darkness the value of stars") leans slightly abstract, though his actions ground it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the girl's confession to the patrol is earned by the mirror revelation and the guardian's woven light-net, crystallizing her moral reckoning with visible cost (blood, sob, naming complicity). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the shutter patterns and star-lattice deepen the stakes via charged imagery that reweights her silence into speech. Cost is legible: she moves from evasion to full disclosure under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, shutters, and canal are tactile constraints: the guardian's cord-weaving uses the boarded warehouses as an instrument, and the mirror descent into the water reveals the fisher's body. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: oil film, petals, bruised coin glisten, cold starlight skipping across wet boards. The dental mirror (micro-object-as-setting) charges the final image by constraining the girl's search and reflecting both star and eye. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—moral reckoning with complicity—signals early when the girl carries the mirror and half-spoken secret. Pressure tightens through the guardian's shutter lattice and the mirror descent, forcing her to witness the drowned fisher. The confession to the patrol is protagonist-driven agency with felt cost (blood, breaking voice). One meaningful deepening: the star-in-eye moment narrows her options from evasion to accountability. Under Accumulative lens, the star-net and mirror descent suffice for escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of accountability and witness emerges from particulars: the dental mirror becomes both literal search tool and symbol of seeing one's complicity, the star-net metaphor of making darkness legible without banishing it. The line "a star can fit inside an eye and demand to be accounted for" reweights the premise non-literally without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture: the guardian's finger to lips, the shutter code, the mirror as lantern. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited holds stable; perceptual signature is lyric and filtered through heightened metaphor ("ribs were a staircase winding down to the water"). Psychic distance remains consistent, with controlled elevation in diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension"). Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (star, mirror, lattice) are taught early and paid off at closure. Minor slip: "the habit of meeting confession with room instead of questions" leans slightly expository, though brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "bruised coin," "ribs were a staircase," "silt" on tongue, "star-net." However, some vehicles stretch plausibility: ribs as staircase winding *down to the water* is anatomically muddled, and "spiralingly calm" risks overwriting. Information density is strong; no loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the mirror descent. The final image lands cleanly without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent guardian, shutter-weaving as optical instrument, and dental mirror as search tool is specific and non-obvious. The star-lattice concept and the notion of "teaching darkness the value of stars" via reflected light offer fresh inflection. The piece takes structural risk with lyric compression and sustained metaphor that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Slight proximity concern: the mirror-as-moral-lens and light-in-darkness motifs are familiar, but execution through shutters and star-net particularizes them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian is present throughout, and his key decision to weave the shutters and guide the girl to lower the mirror drives the turning points. His choice to signal the watchman (shutter code) and step aside for her confession shapes the closure. Early signal, multiple beats (shutter-weaving, mirror guidance, code), closure participation, and causal pressure all present. Cost is tied to his method: silent empathy becomes active intervention.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in beat one (tin case opened), is reweighted when the guardian uses it to catch starlight, used again for the descent to find the fisher, and charged at closure as the vessel that holds both star and her eye. Three distinct beats, early signal, closure linkage, and specificity (dentist's tool for "looking behind what hurts") all elevate. Irreplaceable: the round reflective surface enables both the star-lattice and the underwater search.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silent empathy shapes on-page tactics: the guardian's refusal to ask questions, his gesture-based guidance, and his shutter-weaving to create light-net rather than confront verbally. The concept alters the girl's path from evasion to confession by providing "room instead of questions." Early signal ("his work was silent empathy"), middle development (shutter patterns), and closure linkage (he steps aside, letting her speak). Specificity: silence as active method, not passivity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is introduced early and enacted through the rib-staircase image and his unhurried shutter-weaving under pressure. It constrains one key choice: his refusal to interrogate or rush, instead working methodically to reveal rather than demand. The trait reappears when "his calm spiraled through her breathing," enabling her to speak without breaking. Two beats, causal pressure, and closure relevance present, but the metaphor itself is somewhat ornamental rather than producing visible cost or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in multiple forms: the guardian weaves cord through shutters, creating the star-lattice; later he "wove the shutters into a final pattern" (the help code); and "weeds braided around a boot" echoes the motif. The action drives the major turn: without the woven shutter-net, the starlight doesn't reach the canal and the girl cannot search. Early signal, causal centrality, and closure linkage all strong. Irreplaceable: the lattice-making is the mechanism of revelation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled early ("began to weave it through the slats"), its mechanics matter (adjusting by fractions, tying one to the next to create "a single instrument"), and it drives two key beats: the star-lattice that illuminates the canal and the final three-bar-and-gap help code. The method shapes the girl's ability to search and summons the patrol. Closure linkage, causal pressure, specificity, and irreplaceability all high. The shutter-weaving is the guardian's core tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain provides concrete constraint: wet boards reflect starlight, the canal film holds ash, the boarded warehouses supply the shutters. Setting alters tactics: without the shutters and their crooked hinges, the guardian cannot create the light-net. Early signal (opening sentence), middle pressure (shutter rows), and closure participation (the darkness beneath the dock, the waterline). Micro-setting (the dock's materials and weather state) charges the final image by enabling both reflection and descent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is poetic but vague as a timeframe. It signals the girl's withheld confession early, and time implicitly tightens as the guardian works and the patrol approaches, but the clock is not tracked on the page in a way that forces choices. The phrase recurs thematically (her secret "finally loosened") but does not create a visible countdown or urgency that narrows her window. Lyric reprise present, but tactical pressure from elapsed time is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is abstract but enacted: the guardian uses starlight reflected into the canal's blackest corner to reveal the hidden body, dramatizing the motivation. The desire shapes his choice to weave the shutters and adjust the lattice until "darkness there began to shimmer." Friction with cost: he must guide the girl to witness rather than telling her, and his method depends on her willingness to lower the mirror. Two beats, causal pressure, closure relevance all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stillwater tension is established early ("unsaid words clung to her tongue like silt, making the air heavy with stillwater tension") and modulates throughout: the guardian's spiraling calm holds it, the mirror descent tightens it, and the girl's sob releases it briefly before the watchman's cautious blink re-introduces it. Tone charges the final image: her confession emerges from sustained, liquid pressure rather than explosive confrontation. Coherent through turns, distinct from generic suspense, and purposefully matched to the canal setting.</comment>
