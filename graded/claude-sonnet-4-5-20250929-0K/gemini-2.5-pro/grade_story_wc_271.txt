<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Anya's interiority is concrete and embodied: the ice spreading through veins, jaw clenching, fingers locked. The photograph functions as a physical anchor rather than exposition, and the panic attack sequence tracks contradictory impulses (the need to freeze versus the need to ground). The final choice—watering the pine—emerges from prior causality with visible cost (the acknowledgment that "the sky would always hold a potential for menace"). Minor slip: "quietly talented" remains a label without on-page demonstration of what that talent costs or enables in this specific moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with legible cost: Anya returns to her work knowing the sky remains menacing, foreclosing any fantasy of recovery. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—somatic panic accumulates until the grounding technique reweights her stance. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3), and the single meaningful deepening (shadow → panic spiral → grounding → return to work) tightens options without requiring multiple reversals. Cost is visible in "It meant nothing. It meant everything" and the final acknowledgment that hope must be "anchored to the solid ground of reality."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum constrains choice: its glass walls mute the surf, creating acoustic conditions where the drone's thrumming becomes inescapable. The Wollemi pine returns at closure charged with new weight (a species that "survived ice ages and cataclysms" mirrors Anya's endurance). Soil under thumbnail and pine resin are grounding anchors during the panic sequence. Minor limit: the automated lighthouse and "after the last lighthouse keeper" frame remains atmospheric rather than pressuring a tactical choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Anya's effort to anchor optimism against the reality of trauma. The drone's arrival tightens pressure through embodied escalation (paralysis, ice in veins, spasming fingers). Agency appears as endurance—she searches for "a single, solid thing in the chaos"—and the cost is felt: she acknowledges the sky's permanent menace yet returns to care. The piece earns its quiet resolution through accumulative pressure rather than confrontation, and the final image ("just enough" water) reweights prior material with visible restraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the arboretum on a cliff edge, the photograph as texture rather than image, the Wollemi pine's survival across epochs. "Anchor optimism in realism" is enacted rather than stated—the final beat delivers it through the ground "holding firm" and Anya's deliberate watering. The pearl of stillness functions as method and motif without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer (endurance in the face of recurring menace) without thesis. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and controlled; diction reflects Anya's professional and traumatic filters ("somatic markers," "geology, not technology"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices growth patterns, soil, resin. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during panic, pulling back slightly at the end. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("She could not look") are voice-motivated and serve the panic sequence. The compression "It meant nothing. It meant everything" is purposeful and earns its contradiction through prior embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates cleanly through the panic beat; sentence length varies with pressure. Information density is high: "the crumpled photograph stored there" conveys years of handling without separate exposition. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop: "She fought the paralysis not by fighting the memory, but by sinking into the present" followed immediately by "She forced her awareness into the grit of soil" restates the same tactic. Otherwise no scaffold, no template cadence, and figurative language (ice spreading, pearl of stillness) remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD grounding technique with arboretum work and living-fossil plants feels specific and earned. The automated lighthouse detail ("after the last lighthouse keeper") adds a fresh angle on solitude and obsolescence. The premise—trauma survivor finding refuge in cultivating ancient plants—is not wholly novel, but the execution through somatic specificity and the Wollemi pine's resonance lifts it above template. The piece commits fully to its accumulative logic and resists false complexity. Proximity check clear; no echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Anya's survivor status drives the panic sequence and shapes the final choice to continue her work despite the sky's menace. The wedding photograph and "blue tent overhead just before it all turned to fire" ground the backstory. Her return to watering the pine is a decision that alters tactics (acknowledging permanent threat rather than seeking resolution). Present in setup, drives the middle panic beat, and shapes the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears twice with reweighted meaning: first as texture during panic ("soft as cloth from years of being clenched"), then as silent acknowledgment at the end ("Her hand rested over the photograph in her pocket"). Its worn edges function as grounding anchor mid-crisis and closure reminder. The object constrains by providing tactile reassurance and charges the final image by making the cost of endurance legible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is both method and stake: Anya searches for it during the panic spiral, and the technique shapes her return to equilibrium. It appears early ("this search for a pearl of stillness"), drives the middle grounding sequence ("a single, small point of calm"), and implicitly charges the closure (the deliberate watering as stillness enacted). The concept alters tactics under pressure rather than remaining thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is mentioned once in the opening ("People said she was quietly talented") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains a label without demonstration of what specific skill it represents or how it trades off against other needs. Functional setup but replaceable and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The freeze is the pivot: "She tried to pull her hand back... but her arm would not obey. She had to freeze." This action defines the panic beat, necessitates the grounding technique, and makes the final return to deliberate movement (picking up the watering can) a felt victory. Removing "freeze" would collapse the story's tension and make the ending's restraint unearned. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Somatic markers frame the panic sequence early ("her body knew first, her mind catching up") and the method is demonstrated: ice in veins, jaw clenching, fingers locked. The grounding technique reverses the soma ("the ice in her veins receded," "rigid clamp on her spine eased"). The mechanics shape multiple beats and the closure's return to embodied control. Signaled, enacted, and integral to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass walls create acoustic conditions that amplify the drone's thrumming, pressuring the panic response. The cliff location recurs at closure ("the ground, for now, was holding firm") as both literal anchor and metaphor for precariousness. The setting enables Anya's work and provides grounding resources (soil, pine, surf sounds). Functional across beats and present at the ending, though the cliff's danger remains more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" frames solitude and automation thematically and recurs via the automated beam's "cold and regular pulse." The timeframe colors tone (post-human obsolescence) and situates Anya's work as preservationist, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Purposeful setup with lyric reprise at the ending, but causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized in the opening ("anchor her optimism in realism; she knew a single unexpected frost... could undo years") and tested by the panic attack. The friction between hope and menace drives the ending choice: she waters the pine knowing "the sky would always hold a potential for menace" yet continues. Visible cost in the acknowledgment that optimism must be "anchored to the solid ground," which is only holding "for now." Present, conflicted, and resolved with felt trade-off.</comment>
