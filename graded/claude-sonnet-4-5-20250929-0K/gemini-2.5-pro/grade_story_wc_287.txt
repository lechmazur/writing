<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions—lowering the gauge tooth, maintaining the rhythm. Her interiority shows purposeful restraint and inherited values without therapy-speak. The final micro-shift (Mr. Henderson's blinds widening) feels earned by her sustained effort, though the choice to continue rather than stop lands quietly. Internal contradiction is present but mild: she respects his solitude yet intrudes nightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through nightly repetition and sensory density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the blinds widen—a visible response that reweights her solitary ritual with shared cadence. Cost is felt in her sustained effort and the hour-long vigil. Orientation anchors (fire escape, Mr. Henderson's window below, harbor) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when observation becomes reciprocal connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fire escape, harbor, and the specific sliver of glass between blinds and sill create a coherent micro-setting. The lockmaster's tooth becomes tool-as-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's gardener's attention. The piece does not require broader occupational systems at this length; the father's locksmith trade functions as motivational backstory without exposition drag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to instill light/connection into Mr. Henderson's darkness. One meaningful tightening occurs when she commits to nightly repetition after the rosebush fails. The blinds widening is a reversal that narrows her solitude and validates her method. Pressure accumulates through ritual and the "quivering hush" of waiting. Cost is visible in her sustained physical effort and the hour-long rhythm; she forgoes rest and comfort to persist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the father's locksmith creed transformed into floral then mechanical light-giving. The gauge tooth shifts from keepsake to beacon without overt symbolism. The final image—two solitary souls sharing a heartbeat cadence—offers a resonant answer to isolation without moralizing. "Light was finding its way" risks slight abstraction but is earned by prior particulars. Subtext operates in the blinds' fractional widening and her quiet smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Elara's perceptual signature: gardener's patience, inherited pragmatism, sensory attention to salt air and city hum. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("wistfully pragmatic sigh," "metal bloom"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider city-breath. Purposeful compression in the nightly ritual ("Night after night") serves accumulative pressure without losing clarity. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high in peak beats. Minor template cadence in the reflection paragraph ("Her father had been... and she, his daughter, had become") and slight overwriting in "quivering hush of the late hour." The closure image is clean. One paraphrase loop: "offering a piece of her world" echoes "reflect light into dark corners" without added pressure. Figurative language ("tiny star," "metallic bloom") remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The locksmith's daughter/gardener synthesis and the bitting gauge tooth as light beacon offer fresh inflection on isolation narratives. The oar-rhythm method is specific and non-obvious. Risk: the nightly ritual without dialogue or confrontation. The piece avoids middle-ground hedging and commits to quiet accumulation. Slight proximity to "light in darkness" tropes, but the mechanical precision and inherited-tool angle transform the familiar frame.</comment>
