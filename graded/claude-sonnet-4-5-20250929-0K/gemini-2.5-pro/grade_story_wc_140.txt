<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete, sensory particulars: collecting fragments, layering emotions, building a "patchwork soul." The poison label anchors a visible micro-choice in the final third—the narrator layers grief and wonder over it, transforms its meaning, then places it back in the tin. Internal contradiction emerges (craving memories while existing as "erasure"), but the single-beat embodied cost and absence of a second live choice during peak pressure hold the score below the 8.0 threshold. No diagnostic label-speak appears, though some diction ("aching violet," "warm gold") skirts abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by paragraph two (death certificate, port city, container). The accumulative lens is taught early—layering overheard fragments—and held to closure, where the ship's horn shatters the composite memory and returns the narrator to solitude. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) is legible: the narrator accepts the cycle ("I will wait for the next tide…a kind of living"), foreclosing direct recovery of the past with a felt cost (isolation, perpetual repetition). One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's grief and the longshoreman's wonder coalesce around the label, briefly giving it "phantom history." Cost is visible in the return to "silence and the quiet slap of water." Minor ambiguity in how the "layering" mechanically works prevents higher scores, but the closure effect and lens adherence are sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The port setting is established with concrete sensory detail (rust-holes, brine, diesel, green-bearded pylons) and filtered through the narrator's acoustic sensitivity ("sounds bend, carrying…the weight of their origins"). The container functions as micro-setting, its walls becoming "translucent membranes" at peak pressure. The tide rhythm structures the piece and constrains the narrator's cycle. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves (quay below, container interior, pylons). The setting subtly guides the narrator's method: the acoustics "sharp and clear" at low tide enable collection. Strong anchoring and purposeful sensory selection charge the final image but do not directly force the closure choice, capping the score just shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of memories"—is signaled in paragraph two and pursued through the accumulative method. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's grief arrives and the narrator layers it with prior fragments, briefly achieving a "breathless moment" of possession before the ship's horn shatters it. The escalation is driven by the narrator's agency (choosing which fragments to layer, pressing them together) and the tidal rhythm tightens the window. Visible cost: the composite dissolves, leaving "silence" and the tin box. The single tightening and modest price (temporary illusion) fit the accumulative lens but lack a second reversal or a trade-off that narrows options beyond the narrator's acceptance of the cycle, preventing entry to the 8.0+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—the construction of identity from erasure and fragments—emerges through concrete images (the label, the tin box, the layering ritual) without overt statement. The poison label shifts meaning across beats: sterile fact → desperate choice → phantom history. The woman's line "You can't just erase it…It was real" ironically mirrors the narrator's predicament without becoming a thesis statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the narrator accepts perpetual incompletion ("a kind of living") as the cost of existence in the gaps. Subtext operates in the synesthetic color coding (violet grief, warm gold) and the tide's inhale/exhale rhythm. Minor reliance on color metaphors and the phrase "a kind of living" (which edges toward summary) keep the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: acoustic filtering, synesthetic color assignments, and a preference for tactile metaphors ("grain of a past," "gauze of fresh grief"). Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("caesura," "phantom history," "the event"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: reflective at opening, immersive during the layering beat, then withdrawn at closure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applied. The piece uses free indirect thought cleanly ("Was it mine? A mistake?"). One minor slip: "the woman's sorrow, the man's wonder" lists emotions without embodying them in that sentence, though prior beats dramatize both. The perceptual specificity and rhythmic control under pressure meet the 9+ quick test, but that single list and the reliance on color labels cap the score at 8.3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives in paragraph one, longer accumulative structures during the layering beat). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense ("iron labyrinth," "ghost haunting the caesura," "throbbing with the lives I've curated") but mostly coherent. One mixed metaphor: "caesura" (a metrical pause) applied to tide rhythm reads strained. The color metaphors ("vibrant…violet," "warm gold") risk cliché but remain voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor overwriting in the peak beat ("The violet of grief and the warm gold of that remembered touch") where two abstractions stack without embodied action. The prose is polished and propulsive but the density of elevated diction in a high-pressure moment and one metaphor strain prevent 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—a legally erased person curating overheard fragments to construct a memory—offers a fresh angle on identity and erasure. The synesthetic layering method and the tidal structure provide specificity. The poison label as the sole artifact of the narrator's past is a strong particular. The narrative commits fully to its accumulative logic without retreat. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this narrator's voice and method. One proximity concern: the "ghost in the machine/city" framing and the idea of constructing selfhood from fragments echo contemporary literary trends, though the port setting and acoustic filter add distinction. The story takes modest structural risk (accumulative rather than causal) and follows its implications cleanly, but the core emotional territory (longing for a lost past) is familiar, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor is the POV character, present throughout. Setup: established in the opening line. Development: the narrator's choices drive the layering action in the middle third. Payoff: the narrator's decision to place the label back in the tin and "wait for the next tide" closes the piece. The character's decisions (selecting fragments, layering them, accepting the cycle) create the story's key turns. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (chooses which fragments to layer, when to stop) +0.9, closure linkage (the decision to continue) +1.0. Minor swappability friction: another marginalized figure could perform similar emotional archaeology. Base 3.0 + 3.9 positive − 0.5 swappability = 6.4, round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The poison label appears in paragraph four, is examined and questioned ("Was it mine?"), then layered with new fragments in paragraph five, and finally placed back in the tin in the closing paragraph. Setup: present by 50% mark (late but functional). Development: the narrator layers grief and wonder over it, transforming its meaning from "sterile fact" to "desperate choice." Payoff: the label is handled physically in the final paragraph, its changed weight acknowledged. Beat involvement (three touches across paragraphs 4, 5, 7) +1.4, causal pressure (the layering act centers on it) +0.9, closure linkage (placed back in the tin with acceptance) +0.9, specificity (the chemical name, skull and crossbones) +0.5. Late signal (past 40%) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.7 − 0.3 = 6.4, round to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Erased histories is the story's conceptual spine: the narrator's own erasure (death certificate in error) and the method (collecting fragments of others' histories). Setup: announced in the opening line ("declared me gone"). Development: the narrator's entire method—layering overheard stories—enacts the concept. Payoff: the final image reweights erasure as "a kind of living" in the gaps. The concept shapes stakes (the desire to "own" a past) and tactics (listening, layering) throughout. Early signal +0.8, three beats (opening, method exposition, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (the erasure enables the method and defines the stakes) +1.6, closure linkage (the acceptance of "conscious erasure") +1.5, irreplaceability +0.8. Base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, round to 8.2 (capped by the fact that the concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint that narrows a choice under pressure).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Filters reality differently is embodied in the narrator's acoustic sensitivity ("sounds bend, carrying…the weight of their origins") and synesthetic perception (violet grief, gold touch). Setup: paragraph two describes the perceptual mode. Development: the filtered perception enables the collection and layering method. Payoff: the container walls "seem to thin, becoming translucent membranes" at peak pressure, a direct result of the altered filtering. The trait constrains the narrator to this method (listening rather than direct interaction) and enables the composite memory moment. Early signal +0.6, two beats (method exposition, peak layering) +0.9, causal pressure (the filtering is the method) +1.1, closure linkage (the dissolving illusion is a perceptual event) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, round to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Layering is the story's central action, named in paragraph two ("My method is to listen…I layer") and enacted in paragraphs three and five. Setup: explicitly named by 25%. Development: the narrator layers the cook's frustration over the sailor's bravado (paragraph three), then the woman's grief over the poison label and the longshoreman's memory (paragraph five). Payoff: the layering produces the "breathless moment" of possession before the horn shatters it, and the narrator commits to continuing the practice. Major turns trace to this action: the composite memory is the story's peak, and the decision to "continue to layer" closes the piece. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the layering is the protagonist's agency) +1.6, closure linkage (the decision to continue) +1.5, irreplaceability (no other action could substitute) +0.8. Base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, round to 8.4 (minor swappability: "weave" or "fuse" could replace "layer" with edits, −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is introduced in paragraph two and demonstrated across three beats: the cook and sailor (paragraph three), the woman's grief (paragraph five), the longshoreman's memory (paragraph five). Setup: named by 25%. Development: the collection method enables each layering attempt. Payoff: the narrator's commitment to "wait for the next…story" in the final paragraph. The method shapes every attempt and is signaled clearly throughout. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the method is the protagonist's tactic) +1.3, closure linkage (the decision to continue collecting) +1.0. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, round to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The port setting—"iron labyrinth," "stacked containers," "quay," "pylons"—is established in paragraph one and sustained throughout. Setup: present by paragraph two. Development: the container's acoustics ("sharp and clear" at low tide) enable the narrator's collection, and the forgotten Evergreen container serves as the ritual space. Payoff: the container walls "seem to thin" at peak pressure, and the setting frames the narrator's acceptance of living "in this towering, transient world." The setting supplies the acoustic constraint and the liminal space necessary for the narrator's method. Early signal +0.7, two beats (acoustic enabling, peak transformation) +0.9, causal pressure (the acoustics shape when and how collection occurs) +0.9, closure linkage (the "towering, transient world" closes the piece) +0.8. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, round to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal rhythm is introduced in paragraph one ("tide breathes in…tide breathes out") and structures the narrator's cycle. Setup: present by paragraph one. Development: low tide provides "sharp and clear" acoustics for collection; high tide ("peak of high tide") triggers the ship's horn that shatters the illusion. Payoff: the closing line promises the narrator will "wait for the next tide." The timeframe tightens the window (the narrator can only layer during certain tidal phases) and provides the rhythm for the ending. Early signal +0.8, two beats (acoustic window, horn interruption) +0.9, causal pressure (the tide rhythm constrains when collection and layering occur) +0.8, closure linkage (the cycle promise) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, round to 6.9 (the tide is more atmospheric frame than live clock that forces a choice in the middle; the horn arrives as coincidence, not protagonist-driven escalation).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover the texture of memories—is stated in paragraph two and dramatized through the layering attempts. Setup: named by 25%. Development: the narrator's choices (which fragments to collect, how to layer them) enact the desire throughout. Payoff: the "breathless moment" of possession and the acceptance that the narrator has "touched the shape of a memory" close the arc. The motivation drives every beat and is tested by the dissolution. Early signal +0.7, three beats (method exposition, peak layering, acceptance) +1.4, causal pressure (the desire structures all tactics) +1.3, closure linkage (the acceptance acknowledges partial success) +1.0, cost connection (the perpetual incompletion is the price) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, round to 7.8 (the motivation is more told than shown in conflict with a competing want, −0.1).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Nameless identity is established in the opening line ("I do not have a name the government would recognize") and sustained through the narrator's self-description as "a ghost," "a conscious erasure," existing in "the spaces between other people's lives." Setup: present in the opening. Development: the namelessness licenses the narrator's method (no official identity allows collection without social friction). Payoff: the closing image reaffirms the narrator as "a conscious erasure in a city of ghosts and goods." The tone is melancholic but not static; it modulates from reflective (opening) to immersive (layering) to resigned acceptance (closure). Early signal +0.8, two beats (opening frame, closure reaffirmation) +0.9, closure linkage (the final self-description) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, round to 6.7 (the tone charges the final image but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost beyond the emotional state already present; coherence is high but functional impact is limited, capping below 7.0).</comment>
