<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief and private ritual are embodied consistently through gesture and micro-choices (tracing the shell, studying the map, kneeling at the water). The motivation to keep a hidden promise is clear and sustains pressure, though the final act—opening his fingers—lacks visible internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate it into the 8+ band. The reflection on the mirror-crack and "forever shell" is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the present stance. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("intimately aloof," "cathedral of stone and light") fits the painter's sensibility but occasionally reads writerly rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (cave entrance, wrong turn, oasis) and the seashell's recurrence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page: "the weight in his soul felt, for the first time, like his own again" articulates a visible shift with felt cost (the shell is relinquished, the memory placed). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs (wrong turn → hidden oasis → release), sufficient for this length. The cost is legible in the image of the shell drifting down and in the protagonist's altered weight, meeting the Cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network and hidden oasis constrain the journey and charge the final image: the "perfect circle of daylight," "impossibly clear water," and "pale stones" are selective and purposeful, grounding the closure act. The painted seashell functions as micro-setting, its colors igniting "one last time" in the light before sinking. Spatial choreography is coherent (tunnel descent, cavern opening, pool edge). The setting is filtered through Elias's painter's eye ("grey moods of the sea," "impossible green"), meeting the perceptual-priority test and directly enabling the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to keep a hidden promise by finding a place worthy of the memory. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the wrong turn and discovery of the oasis, which reweights the plan. One meaningful tightening occurs when the deviation feels inevitable rather than panic-inducing, narrowing options to this exact place. The act of dropping the shell forecloses the path of carrying it, with visible cost (the shell is gone, "its story complete"). The escalation is driven by Elias's agency (he chooses to release it), but the final moment reads more as acceptance than a trade-off with competing live options, capping the score below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief, permanence, and private ritual—emerges from the painted shell, the cracked mirror, and the oasis without overt statement. The final image (shell drifting down, weight returned to Elias) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: he places the memory rather than letting it go, a subtle distinction earned by prior particulars. "Temporary eternity" recurs with purpose, reweighted at closure when the oasis itself embodies the paradox. Minor slip: "temporary eternity" and "forever shell" are named rather than fully dramatized through contradictory action, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the weight in his soul felt...like his own again") without crossing into moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters the world through Elias's painter's sensibility ("grey moods of the sea," "colors he had mixed so carefully"). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful compression ("a man holding a memory so close it walled him off"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices light, color, and spatial composition. Minor register drift into elevated writerly diction ("intimately aloof," "cathedral of stone and light," "a study in being") reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure, preventing entry into the 8.5+ band. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Clarity and propulsion are strong through most beats. Overwriting cluster in opening: "intimately aloof," "a study in being," "a lifetime," "sharp-edged truths," "weary of speaking" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.4 for density. Mixed metaphor: "the weight in his soul felt...like his own again" conflates emotional and physical registers awkwardly. Template cadence in final paragraph: "He had fulfilled...," "He watched...," "...its story complete" recycles stems. Total deduction ~−0.6 in Q7. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—painter keeping a hidden promise by releasing a painted shell in a hidden oasis—synthesizes familiar grief-ritual material through specific detail (quay painter, lacquered shell, wrong turn, circular skylight). The wrong-turn-to-oasis frame offers a fresh angle on grief journeys, avoiding the safety middle. Emotional truth is particular: not letting go but "placing the memory...in a setting worthy of its weight." Minor derivative echo: the cracked-mirror image as relationship-break symbol is widely used and not fully transformed here, applying −0.3 within Q8. The oasis discovery and shell-drop feel earned in hindsight, meeting the turn test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias, the quay painter, drives all key beats: he chooses to enter the cave, accepts the wrong turn without panic, kneels, holds the shell in the light, and releases it with "deliberate and steady hand." His painter's eye filters the world and his grief motivates the journey. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (navigation, discovery), and closure (release act). The choice to open his fingers is the story's decisive action, creating visible cost (shell relinquished, memory placed). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in setup (first paragraph: "fingers traced the familiar ridges"), middle (remembered painting it, her "forever shell" name), and closure (held in light, colors ignite, dropped into pool). Three distinct beats with escalating charge. The shell's painted quay-under-blue-sky is irreplaceable specificity tying to Elias's profession. Dropping it is the story's climactic act with visible cost. Its settling on the pool bottom is the final image. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named twice: once as label for the oasis moment ("time itself seemed to pool and settle, offering a glimpse of a temporary eternity") and once as thematic echo ("their 'forever shell'"). It shapes the dominant stake (finding a place worthy of permanence) and charges the final image (shell settling "there to remain until the sea decides"). Present in middle and closure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but the concept is told more than dramatized through contradictory action. Two gates (middle, closure) with thematic resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is introduced as label in the opening sentence ("His posture was a study in being intimately aloof") and echoed in the final paragraph's isolation ("the sanctuary his wrong turn had found"). It explains his grief-walled state but does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost. The attribute is functional setup for his solitary journey but swappable with "distant," "withdrawn," or similar traits. Present in setup and closure mention, but no middle development where the trait enables or costs him something specific. Mid-band for setup + closure reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Reveal" structures the entire narrative: the promise is "to reveal it, not to another person, but to the quiet memory itself." The act of holding the shell in light ("watching the colors...ignite one last time") and then releasing it is the story's climax and closure. This action is irreplaceable—swapping "reveal" for "release" or "place" would alter the story's emotional logic. Present in setup (hidden promise framed), middle (approaching the moment), and closure (the reveal-and-drop). High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wrong turn is signaled in the second paragraph ("A fissure he mistook for a landmark led him down a narrow, descending tunnel he did not recognize") and leads directly to the oasis discovery. The method's mechanics matter: his deviation from the map creates the "strange sense of inevitability" that charges the closure. Present in setup (map study), middle (wrong turn, oasis found), and closure (the place is described as "the one his promise had been searching for"). The method enables the peak choice but could be replaced with "followed intuition" or "trusted instinct" without major structural loss, capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The coastal cave network pressures Elias's journey: entrance described as "mouth weary of speaking," darkness mocks his preparations, descending tunnel creates "still and heavy" air. The hidden oasis—circular skylight, clear pool, pale stones—provides the exact resources (light, water, setting) needed for the closure act. The pool's surface and bottom are handled across beats: approached, shell held above it, surface broken, shell drifts to bottom. Setting constrains (he must find the right place) and enables (oasis supplies worthiness). Three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the mirror cracks" anchors the timeframe in setup ("It had been a year, or perhaps a lifetime, since the mirror cracked") and motivates the present journey. The anniversary pressure is implicit but not tightened into a live deadline. The time "after" shapes Elias's state (grief, promise-keeping) but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat. Present in setup and thematically in closure (weight finally his own), but no middle development where time actively narrows options. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) with thematic coherence but limited tactical pressure, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hidden promise ("to keep a hidden promise to himself that he would find a place beautiful enough to hold their forever") is the story's dominant stake, signaled in setup and motivating every beat. Elias's choices—studying the map, accepting the wrong turn, kneeling at the pool, releasing the shell—all serve this motivation. The promise is dramatized through action rather than told-only. Friction between the promise and the cost (relinquishing the shell, altering his grief's weight) is visible. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>
