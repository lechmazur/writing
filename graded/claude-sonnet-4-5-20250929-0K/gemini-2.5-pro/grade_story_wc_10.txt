<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and filtered through her thermal-vision frame; the violet–orange–indigo sequence embodies contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final decision to weave fear into sunrise rather than erase it demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (exhaustion → peace). Minor slip: "all-consuming" motivation label early borders on generic, but the heat-mapping particulars recover specificity. The capsize intrusion and its transformation are dramatized rather than summarized, supporting the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara transforms her trauma into form, forecloses the need to silence it, and closes the tuning fork case—visible cost is exhaustion and the relinquishment of the audible-age tool. Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who/where/when), and the accumulative lens holds: each thermal layer deepens the flower's bloom and Elara's internal reckoning. One escalation beat (violet deepens → trauma erupts → weave completes) tightens options under pressure. The choice to "hold onto the flower's violet thread" is motivated by prior particulars. No causality breaks; time and spatial anchors are stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains Elara's world (bubble against stillness) and the frosted panes serve as her projection screen, charging the final image with layered light. Micro-setting elements (flagstones, velvet-lined case, cereus bud) are handled concretely and shape her thermal work. Spatial choreography is clean; the conservatory's humid air and glass walls recur with purpose. The night-blooming cereus's opening at closure ties environment to character arc. Sensory detail is purposeful (cool blues, gentle green warmth, incandescent violet) without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music, specifically joy—is signaled early and tightens when the capsize trauma erupts, forcing Elara to integrate rather than suppress. The violet → orange/indigo → woven sunrise sequence is a clear escalation under the accumulative lens, narrowing her options to confrontation or collapse. Agency is decision: she "held onto the flower's violet thread" and "wove the two together" with visible cost (exhaustion). The cereus's bloom at closure demonstrates earned consequence. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Elara's will and prior practice drive the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty and music emerging from silence, trauma as material rather than obstacle—arises organically from the thermal projection and the cereus bloom. The tuning fork case's closure at the end offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the audible age is relinquished, the new language begins. No moralizing; the final white light and "space where a new kind of music could begin" reweights prior terror without stating a thesis. The violet/orange/indigo color transformation is a conceptual repricing of survival, earning high thematic charge without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elara; distance modulates purposefully (close during thermal work, brief pull-back for conservatory description). Perceptual signature is distinct: thermal colors, silence as texture, "phantom roar." Diction stays within her contemplative register; elevated phrases ("unshaken marvels," "silent symphony") read voice-motivated rather than imposed. No head-hopping. Brief filter verbs ("her gaze fell," "she believed") are acceptable and infrequent. Rhythm tightens during the projection sequence, then releases at closure. One minor slip: "her every gesture a carefully measured note" borders on tell, but context supports it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance image, stake, or internal pressure. Rhythm varies naturally; the projection sequence accelerates ("The violet deepened, swirling…") then resolves quietly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. One clarity slip: "heat-mapping emotions" as method is asserted but not explained—does the circlet read the flower's heat or Elara's projection? The circlet's "faint internal light" and "central node" read slightly gadget-catalog. "Silently expressive" and "all-consuming" are abstract high-level descriptors that could sharpen. Otherwise, prose is clean, figurative language (thermal colors) is coherent, and the final image lands without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silent-world frame is fresh; thermal emotion-mapping as music-translation offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The tuning fork case and winterglass are particular rather than generic. Risk: using synesthesia/thermal vision to resolve trauma could feel convenient, but the piece earns it through specificity (violet/orange/indigo hues, the cereus as anchor). The capsize backstory and flower-bloom premise are more familiar than the thermal method. Transformation of trauma via color rather than sound avoids the obvious path. No close echoes of famous lines; voice feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Capsize survivor identity is established early (paragraph one) and drives the climactic choice: the capsize memory intrudes as "jagged, searing orange" and "suffocating indigo," forcing Elara to weave it rather than suppress it. The survivor frame shapes her motivation (translate silence after the storm) and anchors the thermal projection's emotional charge. Present in setup, middle conflict, and closure. The decision to transform rather than erase the trauma is causally tied to her survivor experience. Cost: exhaustion, peace. Slightly swappable (any trauma survivor might attempt similar), preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in two beats: paragraph two (opened daily, "promise of pattern") and final paragraph (closed gently, "space where a new kind of music could begin"). The reprise reweights the relic from loss to permission, supporting closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable tactics; it is thematic accent rather than causal lever. The case is never used as a tool, only opened and closed. Purposeful bookend, but its physical properties do not matter—any audible-age object could serve. Functional lyric resonance, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named once (paragraph two: "Elara believed unshaken marvels still existed") and implicitly demonstrated by the cereus bloom, which persists despite silence. The phrase does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics; it is thematic coloring. The flower's "pure potential" and final bloom illustrate the concept, but removing the exact phrase would not break story logic. Present in setup and implied at closure, but does not drive beats. Functional theme claim, replaceable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is stated (paragraph three: "her every gesture a carefully measured note") and dramatized through Elara's thermal projection work, where gesture and focus drive the violet bloom. The trait enables her method but does not create visible tradeoff or cost distinct from her general process. The silence frame constrains all action, but "silently expressive" as attribute is more label than lever. Present in setup and visible in the projection beats, supporting the ending. Functional but borders on ornamental without unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rectify" (paragraph three: "attempt to rectify the world's most jarring silence, the one left by the absence of joy") directly shapes the central action: Elara projects the cereus's bloom to create joy-as-light, then must rectify her own trauma's intrusion by weaving it into the final image. The action is irreplaceable—changing "rectify" to another verb would alter the moral calculus (repair vs. transform vs. impose). Present in setup, drives the middle escalation (trauma erupts, must be integrated), and defines closure (trauma rectified as sunrise/dusk, not erased). Visible cost: exhaustion, peace. Causal backbone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions via the silver circlet is introduced early (paragraph three), detailed in paragraph four ("attuning the circlet to the flower's delicate life force"), and drives the middle escalation (thermal colors shift under pressure) and closure (layered projection completes). The method shapes all on-page attempts; without it, Elara has no means to translate silence. Mechanics are signaled (circlet node pulses, colors resolve), though exact operation is slightly fuzzy. Present in setup, enables beats two through five, and charges the final image. Specific and irreplaceable. Slight swappability (another synesthetic tool could substitute) prevents top score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is anchored early (paragraph one: "her sanctuary, a bubble… sealed against the stillness") and recurs as resource and canvas: the frosted panes serve as Elara's projection screen (paragraph five: "using the frosted panes… as her score"), and the conservatory's enclosure pressures her to confront trauma in isolation. The setting is irreplaceable—remove the glass walls and the light-projection finale collapses. Present in setup, middle (glass as score), and closure (conservatory fills with light, cereus opens). Specific physical properties (winterglass frost, humid air vs. external cold) shape the thermal work. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" (paragraph one: "a final, roaring storm before all noise became impossible") establishes the timeframe and motivates Elara's silence-to-music project. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock; it is static backstory. The perpetual frost and silent world are setting conditions, not escalating pressures. Present in setup, implied throughout, but does not constrain tactics or reappear with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional premise rather than dynamic element. Replaceable with minor edits (any post-catastrophe silence).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation—"to translate silence into music" (paragraph two)—is dramatized through every beat: Elara attunes to the cereus, projects thermal colors as "silent notes," and completes the translation by weaving trauma into the final "silent symphony." Friction arises when her own terror intrudes, forcing her to choose integration over suppression. The motivation shapes setup (tuning fork case, heat-mapping tool), drives escalation (violet deepens, trauma erupts), and defines closure (silence as "space where a new kind of music could begin"). Visible cost: exhaustion, relinquishment of the audible-age relic. Irreplaceable and causal throughout.</comment>
