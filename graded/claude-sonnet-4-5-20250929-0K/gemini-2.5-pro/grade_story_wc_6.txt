<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her father's legacy shapes her motivations, and the pouch of black sand functions as a tactile anchor rather than a label. The graft scene demonstrates her skill and compassion through specific surgical choices, and the coin's sacrifice carries visible cost. Minor slip: the "unyielding compassion" frame occasionally tilts toward assertion rather than contradiction—her internal conflict could deepen if the father's destructive legacy created more active tension in her choices during the fire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from lagoon → fire → graft → return through density increase and charged callbacks. Orientation anchors cleanly (firefighter, lagoon, radio call). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of black sand "not just a symbol of fire's end, but a promise" reweights the opening motif with conceptual cost (the coin is gone, the symbolic inheritance severed). One meaningful deepening occurs when she snaps the coin thread, foreclosing her past. Cost is legible in the coin's burial and the thread's repurposing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon anchors the frame with vivid specificity ("ghost ship on a glassy sea"). The conservatory's banyan tree and the graft tools (knife, bark strip, red thread) constrain her actions and charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory selection reflects her professional filter (soot, charred bark, scorched limb). The lagoon returns at the end to charge the final image, shifting from "church" to active promise. No occupation-level depth issues; the firefighting and grafting details read plausible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving scars can heal, rewriting her father's legacy. The radio call narrows her options (conservatory = the line her father wouldn't cross), and the graft deepens the pressure by requiring her to sacrifice the coin talisman—a visible cost that forecloses her past. The banyan's survival is uncertain, but her act of binding the graft with the red thread is a decisive choice under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: she chooses to sever the coin rather than keep it. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she needs thread and uses the talisman's. Cost is on the page and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the graft and the coin: inheritance as choice, fire as both destruction and catalyst for healing. The black sand motif shifts from "prayer that all fire finds peace" to "promise of what could be built from the ashes," a clean reprise. The banyan's scar as "cradle for new growth" avoids overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Her father had taught her how things break. She had spent her life learning how they heal..."), which undercuts the image's resonance slightly. The scars-can-sing conviction is told more than it's earned through friction on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, psychic distance controlled. Diction is purposeful and voice-specific: "kelp-drift peace," "ghost ship on a glassy sea," "the whisper of wind across the dunes." Elara's perceptual signature is professional and poetic. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she saw not just its destruction, but...") fit the meditative tone. The prose modulates under pressure (short beats during the fire, longer reflection at the lagoon). Minor register drift: "unyielding compassion, a rebellion against the blood in her veins" slightly elevates above her lived idiom in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor well. The graft sequence is concrete and propulsive. Minor issues: "This was not just a job; it was an inheritance she was determined to rewrite" is expository; "the thing that quieted the ghosts" tells rather than shows. The phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. "Kelp-drift peace" appears twice in identical form without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "This was her true work, the thing that quieted the ghosts" shortly after "This was not just a job." Deduction: −0.6 for scaffold and label recurrence in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The firefighter-as-healer synthesis is fresh, and the coin sacrifice is a strong choice. The graft as literal and metaphorical healing avoids cliché. However, the arsonist's-daughter frame is familiar, and the piece leans on the symbolic weight of the banyan and the sand without fully transforming those tropes. The "proving scars can sing" premise is emotionally authentic but structurally close to redemption-arc templates. The piece commits fully to its premise and the lagoon-fire-lagoon structure is purposeful, but the emotional arc (guilt → action → peace) follows a recognizable path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, frames the story, and her choices drive all major beats: responding to the call, focusing on the banyan, grafting, sacrificing the coin. Her identity as arsonist's daughter shapes her motivation and the conservatory's symbolic weight. Setup: paragraph one. Development: fire scene, graft decision. Closure: the final sand image reweights her inheritance. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The black sand appears in the opening ("thimbleful of black sand from a volcanic beach, a tactile prayer") and returns in the final paragraph, where it is poured into her palm and reweighted: "not just a symbol of fire's end, but a promise of what could be built from the ashes." Setup and closure gates met. However, no middle-beat development—it is carried but not handled or used during the fire or graft. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting it into the 6-range. Two touches (open/close), closure linkage, but no causal pressure in between. Swappable with another talisman without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named explicitly ("Her unyielding compassion, a rebellion against the blood in her veins, surged forward") and shapes her choice to save the banyan rather than battle the perimeter. Setup: fire scene. Development: graft decision. Closure: implicit in the final image's promise. The concept constrains her choice (she must graft, not just mourn), but it is also labeled rather than purely dramatized. Present in two beats with some causal pressure, but the phrase itself is told. Mid-band: shapes stakes, not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is introduced early ("Her posture was gracefully alert, a habit learned in burning buildings that now served her in stillness") but remains largely descriptive. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Setup met, but no clear middle or closure beat where the trait alters tactics or forecloses an option. Label-only mention. Functional but replaceable; another trait (focused, steady, practiced) could substitute without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The graft is the story's climactic action: Elara "began to graft the strip of healthy bark onto the wounded trunk" and works "for an hour" to bind it. Setup: the wounded banyan is identified. Development: the graft is prepared and executed, requiring the coin thread. Closure: the graft's uncertain future charges the final image ("a cradle for new growth"). Three beats, causal pressure (she must find a binding material), closure linkage (the scar's song), and irreplaceability (the entire thematic resolution hinges on this act). Removing the graft collapses the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coin appears early ("a foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread, a confusing relic from her father") and is sacrificed at the peak: "she snapped the weathered thread" to lash the graft. Setup: paragraph one, worn around her neck. Development: she realizes she needs strong binding material. Closure: the coin falls "into the blackened soil," severing the past. Three beats, high causal pressure (the thread is the solution), closure participation (the act redefines her inheritance), and specificity (only the father's gift could carry this cost). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon frames the story (opening and closing) and provides a tonal anchor. Setup: paragraph one. Closure: final paragraph. No middle development—it does not constrain choices during the fire or graft. The lagoon is setting-as-mood rather than setting-as-pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the frame ("kelp-drift peace" returns), but it remains postcard description without tactical impact. Two touches (open/close), closure linkage, but no causal work. Mid-band: shapes tone, not choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" appears in the opening ("the slow, silent migration of clouds overhead") and closing ("the last of the migrating clouds had passed"). Setup and closure gates met. However, the clouds do not tighten decisions or alter tactics; they are atmospheric markers, not a live clock. No middle beat where time pressure affects her choices. Ornamental use. The graft's "hour" is a better time marker, but that is not the required element. Present but replaceable; removing the clouds would not change the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that scars can sing" is stated explicitly mid-story ("She was proving her own deepest conviction: that scars could sing") and shapes her decision to graft rather than mourn. Setup: implicit in her compassion and profession. Development: the graft choice. Closure: the banyan's future scar as "testament" and the sand's promise. Present in two beats with causal pressure, but the phrase is told rather than fully dramatized through conflicting wants. Friction between want (to heal) and cost (the coin) is present but could deepen. Mid-to-high band: shapes stakes, closure linkage, but the conviction is asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named explicitly at the lagoon (opening: "This place was her only church"; closing: "The kelp-drift peace of the place settled over her") and modulates through the fire's "thick and acrid" smoke and the graft's intensity. Setup and closure gates met. The tone shifts purposefully under pressure (stillness → urgency → meditative return), but "kelp-drift peace" itself is static—it does not evolve or reweight, it simply bookends. Coherent modulation across beats, closure participation, but the phrase is repeated identically without charging the final image with new meaning. Mid-band: tone supports the arc but does not transform it.</comment>
