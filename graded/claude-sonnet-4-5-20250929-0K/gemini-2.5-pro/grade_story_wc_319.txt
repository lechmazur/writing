<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyel's motivation is embodied through contradictory impulses—dimensional homesickness coexisting with feral guardianship—and the pendant functions as a concrete crucible forcing a choice between longing and duty. His final decision to smother the portal by pouring his own waiting into the pendant demonstrates agency with visible cost: he forecloses the path home and accepts continued exile. Interior texture is character-particular ("interiorizing exteriors," "feral thing of sharp senses") and the renunciation earns Earned Stasis. Minor slip: the phrase "make friends with uncertainty" reads slightly diagnostic in tone but is integrated quickly into action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Lyel refuses the portal, sacrificing his chance at home to protect the library, then reframes his waiting from longing-for-home to open expectation. Cost is visible: "The ache in his chest remained" and the portal "sealed itself shut." Orientation anchors early (guardian, frozen garden, library). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the pendant's cold weight, the mist's recurrence, and the final sigh layer to reweight his stance. One meaningful deepening when the portal tears open, narrowing his choice to leap or stay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden with skeletal roses, perpetual mist, and weeping statues constrains Lyel's choices throughout: it mirrors his fog-bound memory and becomes the site where the portal tears open. The pendant's cold weight against his chest and the violent shrieking edges of the rift are sensory anchors that pressure the climax. Micro-setting (the nest of discarded book pages, frosted grass) grounds action. The mist and frost charge the final image when the rift dissolves "like a watercolor in rain" and silence returns. Environment is integral to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return home vs.守 duty) is signaled early and tightens when the pendant burns and the portal tears open, forcing a live choice. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Lyel grasps the pendant and actively smothers the cultists' signal with his own longing rather than leaping through. Visible cost: the vision of home dissolves, the pendant becomes "cold, dead metal," and he remains in exile but reframes his wait. One clear reversal (temptation → renunciation) with felt consequences that alter his final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—what we choose to guard versus what we long for—emerges through the pendant's shifting meaning, the interiorized exteriors, and the final act of pouring uncertainty into the tear. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Lyel is "no longer waiting for home; he was waiting to see what the morning would bring." Subtext operates in the silent charge, the garden's frozen breath, and the sorrowful sigh. No overt moral; the piece embraces complexity (home is lost but the vigil is reaffirmed). The recurring fog and mist reweight from obstacle to chosen condition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is single, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "feral thing of sharp senses," "boundaries of light were a frayed and uncertain suggestion." Diction modulates under pressure—short, clipped sentences when the portal opens—without losing coherence. Lyric compression ("dimensionally homesick," "interiorizing exteriors") is purposeful and legible. Minor slip: "make friends with uncertainty" in paragraph four slightly breaks register, reading more like prompt echo than Lyel's interior idiom; the phrase is conceptual rather than embodied in that moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Rhythm varies and figurative language ("the garden's frost was the ice in his own veins") is coherent. Clarity holds. Weaknesses: paragraph three uses "a corrupted echo of the pathways between worlds" and "desperate ambition" in close succession, slightly overwriting the pendant's introduction. Paragraph four recycles "the boundaries of light" and "fog of his existence" within two sentences, creating mild synonym drift. No major loops or template cadence, but these slips prevent entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—dimensional exile, feral guardian, cultist pendant—is familiar but given fresh inflection through "interiorizing exteriors" and the choice to smother the portal with his own longing rather than destroy the pendant or leap through. The final reconfiguration (waiting for morning, not home) feels earned in hindsight. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc and imagery are specific to this voice and setting. Risk is moderate; the lyric register and Earned Stasis ending elevate without obscuring stakes. No derivative template detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyel as feral library guardian drives every beat: he charges the intruder, investigates the pendant, resists temptation across "days," and ultimately chooses guardianship over escape. His dual nature (feral/soft, exile/protector) shapes the climax when he looks at "the quiet, sleeping stones of the library he protected" and refuses the portal. Setup early (paragraph one), development (pendant temptation), payoff (closure choice with visible cost: he remains guardian, home is lost). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high; story logic fails without this exact character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pendant appears in three distinct beats: discovery after the cultist flees, days of temptation in the nest, and the climax when it burns and Lyel uses it to smother the portal. It evolves from threatening key to dead metal. Setup immediate (paragraph two), development (paragraph four's "constant, humming temptation"), payoff (paragraph five: he pours his longing into it, transforming its function). High causal pressure, closure linkage undeniable, visible cost tied to its final state. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" is seeded early ("a place where the boundaries of light were a frayed and uncertain suggestion") and returns when the pendant promises "to sharpen the boundaries of light." The concept frames Lyel's perceptual fog and the portal's violent clarity. It constrains his epistemic state and charges the final image when mist returns. Setup present, middle echo, payoff implicit (he chooses fog over sharp light). Causal role is moderate; lyric reprise reweights the stake. Stronger than ornamental, but one more dramatized choice linked to this concept would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is named in paragraph one and drives every subsequent choice: the ache is "the only warmth he had left," the pendant's promise targets it, and at closure he pours "his profound homesickness" into the tear to smother it. Setup immediate, development (temptation across days), payoff (active sacrifice of the longing). The trait enables the climax tactic (using his own displacement energy) and costs him the vision of home. Visible tradeoff, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Wait" structures the entire arc: Lyel's existence is "a long, slow act" of waiting; the pendant poisons "his long wait" with "terrible, specific hope"; at closure he is "still waiting" but reframes what he waits for (morning, not home). Setup paragraph one, development (waiting becomes temptation), payoff (he chooses to keep waiting in a new key). The action redefines options at the end with visible cost (home lost, vigil continues). Indispensable; the story's logic hinges on this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is defined in paragraph one ("the garden's frost was the ice in his own veins") and returns implicitly when Lyel "pushed the feeling of uncertainty, of mist and fog, into the tear"—reversing the process by exteriorizing his interior to close the portal. Setup early, mechanics matter at closure (he weaponizes his internalized fog). The method shapes his final tactic but is not invoked by name in the climax, slightly reducing irreplaceability. Two beats, closure linkage clear, causal role solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is Lyel's den (paragraph one), the site of the intruder's approach (paragraph two), and the location where the portal tears open (paragraph five). It supplies the recurring fog he uses to smother the portal and the frosted grass where the pendant falls. Setup immediate, development (mist as temptation's opposite), payoff (the garden "held its frozen breath" and returns to silence). The setting constrains and enables the climax tactic. High integration, indispensable to closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" frames both the intruder's arrival ("The transition always came through the veil of sleep") and the portal's opening ("The change came, as it had before, through the veil of sleep"). The timeframe establishes a pattern and tightens the climax by jolting Lyel awake with "violent clarity." Setup early (paragraph two), development (the veiled cycle), payoff (disruption signals crisis). It shapes two key turns and charges the final waking moment. Not a live countdown, but the liminal frame matters.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is stated in paragraph four ("He had to make friends with uncertainty, but this object promised a terrible, absolute certainty") and dramatized at closure when he pours "the feeling of uncertainty, of mist and fog, into the tear" to reject the portal's certainty. Setup mid-story, payoff strong (he chooses fog over clarity with visible cost). The phrasing reads slightly diagnostic when first introduced but is redeemed by the active reversal at the end. Two beats, closure linkage clear, friction between want (home) and cost (betrayal of stillness).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" coheres throughout: the prose balances lyric abstraction ("dimensionally homesick," "interiorizing exteriors") with concrete sensory anchors (frosted grass, skeletal roses, the pendant's cold weight). Tone modulates at the climax—short syntax when the portal tears open—then returns to sorrowful calm in the final lines. The ending image ("the air crisp and clean," "gently swirling mist") charges prior fog with acceptance. Coherent pressure, cadence shift supports closure, tone integral to theme.</comment>
