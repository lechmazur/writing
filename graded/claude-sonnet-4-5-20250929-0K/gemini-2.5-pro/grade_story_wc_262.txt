<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "find where unused love is stored" is poetic but remains abstract throughout; her psychometric process involves no difficult choices or visible internal conflict. The vision of Arthur is richly embodied with his pen's weight and frantic rhythm, yet Elara herself never wrestles with contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from question to answer. The final realization feels like a delivered epiphany rather than one earned through struggle with visible cost. Interiority is vivid but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Elara, projection booth, film strip). The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through Arthur's memory, the vision deepens Elara's question, and the final image reweights "unused love" from abstract search to ambient presence in the theater itself. Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing with felt resonance—"It simply becomes the soul of a place"—but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on Elara's part. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds, but the protagonist's agency at closure is observational rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projection booth's dust, grimy glass, and ancient ventilation hum are specific and purposeful. The booth functions as both literal perch and metaphorical vessel for Arthur's archived longing. Sensory selection is tight: "taste of rust and regret," "celluloid cool and sharp," velvet cushion under klieg light. The setting charges the final image—love absorbed into "plush red velvet of the seats, gilded proscenium arch, dust motes"—making the space itself the answer to Elara's question. The recurring film strip and theater architecture constrain the vision's unfolding and supply the resolution's texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the psychometric vision: scent, texture, Arthur's frantic heart, the projection ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara "followed the energy's path not from the man, but from the film itself," shifting the inquiry and leading to the answer. However, no reversal or tactical cost appears; Elara's agency is purely receptive. The resolution is atmospheric insight rather than a choice that forecloses options, keeping this in the solid middle band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: unused love sinking into theater architecture rather than vanishing. The question "Where did it all go?" drives inquiry without overt moralizing, and the answer—"It simply becomes the soul of a place"—is delivered through sensory particulars (velvet, dust, light) rather than abstraction. The final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("waiting for someone to listen"), yet the film-canister image and solemn reverence keep it grounded. No heavy-handed thesis, and the recurring motifs (film, projection beam, silence as "hushed thunder") work in service of the concept without late symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: "fractured time," "frequency of absence," "phantom elbows." Diction is elevated and controlled, matching the lyric-accumulative mode. Free indirect style is clean during Arthur's embedded vision. Some filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear under stress but remain voice-motivated. Occasional reach toward poetic register—"silence was a specific frequency of absence," "hushed thunder promising revelation or collapse"—borders on overwriting but stays coherent. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the prose texture reflects Elara's contemplative stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory density is high without opacity. Minor redundancies: "silent farewell" and "one-way adoration" cover similar ground within two beats. "Phantom elbows" and "reconstructed past" show strong specificity. The metaphor "forgotten lyrics searching desperately for their tune" recurs effectively as structural motif. Figurative language is dense—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor—but remains legible and tonally consistent with the lyric mode. A few filter verbs cluster in the vision sequence without slowing the beat. No template cadence or synonym loops; information density is solid. Slight overwriting keeps this out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry on filmed love letters in an old theater—offers a fresh synthesis of archival longing and spatial memory. The inflection that love "seeped into the plush red velvet" rather than vanishing transforms a familiar theme (unrequited devotion) through concrete venue detail. Arthur's ritual of filming letters onto reels is inventive and specific. Elara's method is less developed; her "spatially imaginative mind" remains label-only. The emotional truth of archived longing feels earned, but the transformation test shows the arc could migrate to another relic-reader with minor edits. No close echoes of famous work; solid originality without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the search, executes the psychometry, and reaches the realization. She appears in the opening, throughout the vision-building middle, and in the final winding of the canister. However, her choices are observational rather than decisive: she touches the film, incubates the memory, "followed the energy's path," and accepts the answer. No on-page dilemma or trade-off alters her tactics. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak because the vision unfolds without resistance or cost to her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The film strip is handled in the opening touch, unspooled for the vision, and wound back into the canister at closure with "solemn reverence." It appears in three beats and carries the emotional residue that powers the psychometry. The final winding reweights it from inert relic to answered question. However, the strip itself does not constrain Elara's choices or impose cost; it is a vessel rather than an active agent. Solid presence and lyric reprise, but swappable with another archival medium without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arthur's goodbye letters drive the entire vision: one for every film run, never sent, filmed onto reels under klieg light. They shape the emotional core and supply the "unused love" that Elara seeks. The concept is signaled early ("For Iris"), developed through Arthur's ritual in the middle, and resolved when the projected words are absorbed into the theater. The letters are indispensable to the plot logic and the thematic answer. Strong setup, middle elaboration, and closure linkage; cost is conceptual (the letters' fate) rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative mind" is mentioned once as a label explaining Elara's method: "her spatially imaginative mind required her to build the world from the inside out." The trait enables the vision-building process—scent, texture, reconstructed booth—but no on-page action demonstrates a trade-off or cost tied to this specific cognitive mode. It is told rather than shown through choice. Late middle mention, no closure participation, label-only with no visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Incubate the faint emotional residue" is named in the second paragraph and enacted through the sensory reconstruction: scent, texture, desk, Arthur's perspective. The action frames the middle psychometric sequence and leads to the absorption insight at closure. It shapes the story's mechanism and could not be easily swapped. However, incubation itself is a passive, receptive process; no turn hinges on a difficult choice to incubate or a cost paid for doing so. Setup, middle use, and closure relevance are all present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled in the opening ("the first step of the psychometry reading, the initial touch") and drives the entire middle vision. The method's mechanics—touch, incubation, reconstructed memory—are shown on the page. Elara's ability is the story's core mechanism and could not be removed without collapse. Setup is early, middle development is sustained, and closure depends on the reading's success. However, the method imposes no visible cost or constraint on Elara; it works smoothly without friction or failure risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projection booth anchors every beat: rickety stool, grimy pane, cavernous theater below, ancient ventilation hum. It supplies the atmospheric "hushed thunder" and serves as both literal workspace and metaphorical archive. The booth's dust and silence charge the opening and closing images. In the vision, the booth dissolves and reforms as Arthur's perch, then the projected love is absorbed into the theater's seats, arch, and dust. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and emotional closure; removing it would break the premise and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics searching desperately for their tune" appears as metaphor in the opening ("silence here was a specific frequency of absence, a feeling of forgotten lyrics") and returns at closure ("melancholic melody drifted through her mind, the forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune"). The timeframe is poetic rather than literal; no clock or urgency tightens Elara's choices. Setup and closure reprise are present, reweighting the metaphor from absence to resolution, but the tune metaphor does not constrain tactics or impose time pressure in the middle. Lyric resonance without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find where unused love is stored"—is named in the opening as "strange and aching" and frames every subsequent beat. The psychometry, the vision of Arthur, and the final realization all serve this search. The question "Where did it all go?" drives the middle deepening. Closure delivers the answer: love becomes "the soul of a place." The motivation is dramatized through action (handling the film, building the vision) rather than merely told, and the ending provides fulfillment with conceptual cost (the search ends, but the answer is atmospheric rather than retrievable). Setup, middle pressure, and closure payoff are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is named twice: the ventilation hum in the opening ("felt like a distant, gathering storm, a hushed thunder promising revelation or collapse") and at closure when Elara recognizes the resonant silence as "the very thing that made the quiet feel like hushed thunder." The tone is somber, contemplative, and charged with latent intensity throughout—silence as pressure, dust as regret, love as absorbed light. Tone is coherent across all beats and modulates from anticipation to vision to solemn reverence. The final image charges the phrase with thematic meaning, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
