<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is concrete—patching the hole in Elara's soul—and his actions (pressing the stone, offering the memory) are embodied and driven by internal contradiction (guilt vs. hope). The "fiercely gentle" attribute constrains his method throughout. Minor weakness: Elara remains off-page, so the relational crucible is felt only through Aris's interiority. The final gesture (burying the tarot card) earns the renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Aris reweights the burned tarot card from penance to guard stone, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (his lost academy future offered to the shadow). Orientation anchors quickly (catacomb orchard, Aris, present action). Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative hybrid—each memory offered narrows options and the final burial transforms prior material. One meaningful tightening (shadow encroachment → memory sacrifice → root breakthrough) with cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: phosphorescent moss, silver-barked saplings, bone-rich soil. The environment constrains Aris's method (he must fill the void, not fight it) and supplies the femur that the root finally touches—charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing Elara's void—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow threatens the sapling. Aris's agency (offering his memory) forecloses the path of violent resistance and narrows his store of lost futures. The root-touching-bone breakthrough provides visible consequence. One clean reversal (threat → sacrifice → sated shadow) with cost unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—bartered destinies and the cost of redemptive work—emerges through concrete action (the burned tarot card, the memory offered, the stone imbued with laughter) rather than statement. The final image (card as guard stone) reweights the entire premise: penance becomes promise. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether reckless hope can fill emptiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aris; perceptual signature is distinct ("phantom joy that now belonged to no one"). Diction stays character-bound (soil and sorrow, dusky resolve). The one dialogue line ("Take this...") is goal-driven and carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to observed action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: "the phosphorescent moss...casting long, skeletal shadows" layers mood and image efficiently. Sentence rhythm varies without template cadence. Minor slack: "a desperate faith in inlaying meaning everywhere" edges toward summary rather than showing through action in that line. One paraphrase near "animate emptiness that sought to trammel" briefly restates the threat. Overall clarity and momentum are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where tree roots feed on bone is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The method—offering positive memory to sate void—transforms the reckless-idealist trope through embodied cost. The burned tarot card as both penance and eventual guard stone feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (memory as balm rather than weapon) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris (reckless idealist) drives the key turn: offering his memory to the shadow rather than fighting it. His reckless bargain created the problem; his idealist solution (filling the void with warmth) creates the breakthrough. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in three beats: as penance mid-story, as memory anchor during the shadow encounter, and as transformed guard stone at closure. Its charred state and warped image matter causally (the void he invited). Reweighted meaning charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frame the stakes: Aris traded his future for Elara's life, creating the void. The concept shapes his tactics (he cannot fight a hole, only fill it) and the closure (transforming penance into promise). Central to motivation and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" constrains Aris's method throughout: he presses stones with "fiercely gentle focus," offers memory without violence, and buries the card gently at the end. The trait enables the breakthrough (gentleness sates the shadow) and carries cost (his lost future).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Trammel" names the shadow's action (wrapping the root to starve it) and triggers Aris's counter-move. The term is specific and apt for the catacomb logic. It defines the threat that his memory-offering resolves, though the story would function with a near-synonym.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is named early and shown through pressing the stone and offering the memory. The method shapes his attempts and the closure gesture (burying the card with new meaning). Slightly more mid-scene mechanics would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where roots snake between bones supplies the femur that the root finally touches—the visible breakthrough. The environment shapes Aris's method (soil rich with concluded stories) and charges the closure image. Phosphorescent moss and silver bark anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" sets immediate atmosphere and brackets the single-scene window. The half-light modulates tension but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Present in setup and sustained through closure without escalating time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"To patch holes in the soul" is the dominant stake, dramatized through every choice: pressing the stone, offering the memory, burying the card. Friction between wanting to heal Elara and the cost (sacrificing his own lost futures) drives the escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" modulates coherently: cold panic rises but he "swallows it down with a dusky resolve." Tone darkens with the shadow's approach, then steadies as he offers the memory. The final stillness ("carefully took the burned tarot card") charges the closure image without false uplift.</comment>
