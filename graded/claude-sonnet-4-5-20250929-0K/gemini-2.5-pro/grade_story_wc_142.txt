<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is concrete and his internal conflict between anarchic soul and orderly mind drives key choices. The character carries contradictory impulses that act simultaneously—loving chaos while imposing structure—though the execution skews toward strategic competence with less vulnerability under pressure. His micro-choices (approaching Zola, embedding messages, watching the inspector) advance goals with embodied tension. The foundation stone chip serves as a tactile anchor for his dual allegiance, though the final moment with it reads more meditative than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Kael, Revel, pre-Consortium window). The causal lens holds: Kael's orderly intuition → graffiti-as-ledger plan → Zola's agreement → reorganization → inspector's confusion → story changed. One meaningful tightening (inspector's arrival weeks early) narrows the window and the closure lands with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: "he had changed the story they would be told...a desperate hope painted bright against the coming tide." The cost is oblique—survival purchased by accepting change "on its own terms"—but the reconfiguration of the Revel's legibility is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival is vividly realized through sensory layering (calliope, fry-oil, water lapping, bunting-draped alleyways) and spatial detail (high-wire platform, main granary, fisher-folk pier). The setting actively constrains the Revel's options—they "couldn't fight" or they'd be "towed away and dismantled"—and supplies the graffiti substrate that enables Kael's method. The foundation stone chip and the floating infrastructure charge the final image, tying physical precariousness to cultural survival. Micro-setting (each mural location) guides reorganization tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Revel's freedom/identity against gentrification) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the inspector arrives weeks ahead of schedule, forcing the plan to face its test prematurely. Kael's agency drives escalation (conceiving the plan, enlisting Zola, embedding messages, watching the outcome) with a visible trade-off—accepting transformation to avoid obliteration. The cost is legible but quieter than ideal for high-band entry: "he hadn't saved the Revel from changing" acknowledges loss, yet the final beat leans more toward hopeful poise than felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (how identity survives structural violence, legibility as a survival tactic, order hidden within chaos) emerges organically from the graffiti-as-ledger conceit and Kael's dual nature. The final image—foundation stone chip, "desperate hope painted bright against the coming tide"—offers a non-literal answer to whether the Revel can endure: it can if it learns to encode its soul in a language power cannot erase. Subtext operates in the inspector's "flicker of confusion" and the contradiction-filled data-slate. The story resists moralizing and embraces ambiguity (survival ≠ victory), though the closing line risks slight abstraction ("changed the story they would be told").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady with controlled psychic distance and a distinct narrative texture ("anarchic soul," "torment of a dual allegiance"). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kael's pitch to Zola is goal-driven and carries subtext ("They see us as chaos...a structure they can't see"). Perceptual signature reflects Kael's orderly mind (charting paths, intuitive mapping). Register occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("phantasmagoric beasts," "sanitize their home into oblivion") but remains within an educated focalizer's lexicon. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language ("tidal wave of corporate order," "vibrant, chaotic skin") is vivid but occasionally stacks without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the second paragraph ("He felt...A part of him...But the orderly part") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("he hadn't saved...but he had given") slightly flatten momentum. No major loops or scaffolding; the opening and closing lines anchor well. Syntax and clarity remain strong throughout, though one or two transitions lean expository.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—embedding order within graffiti to outwit gentrification—offers a fresh angle on cultural survival and synthesizes theme with method in a specific, non-obvious way. The raft-city carnival and the graffiti-as-code conceit feel particular to this voice and world. Execution is confident but not risk-taking; the story commits fully to its premise without retreat, yet the inspector's confusion and Kael's final reflection trend toward the expected beats of a "clever plan succeeds" arc. The foundation stone chip and dual allegiance add texture but do not transform familiar resistance-narrative architecture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's role as culture shock absorber is signaled early ("earned him the title"), shapes his motivation (help navigate gentrification), and drives the plan's conception and execution. His orderly intuition enables the graffiti-ledger method and his observation of the inspector closes the arc. Present in setup, middle (Zola conversation, plan deployment), and ending (watching inspector, final reflection). The trait constrains his approach—he cannot lead open rebellion—and his final stance crystallizes around encoding rather than confronting. Causal across beats; choices alter tactics and the inspector's perception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in the opening paragraph (setup) and returns in the final paragraph (closure reprise) with reweighted meaning: initially a comfort/anchor, finally a talisman for survival under changed terms. It is handled twice (tracing edges in pocket, taking it out at the end) and charged with the dual allegiance theme. Not involved in middle beats; no causal pressure. The lyric resonance early→late reweights the dominant stake, but the object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Strong setup and closure linkage lift it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (anarchic soul vs. orderly mind) is stated early and drives Kael's tactics on the page: he cannot rage (cost: destruction) so he reorganizes secretly (cost: accepting change). The concept shapes his pitch to Zola, the graffiti-ledger method, and his final stance. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending reflection. The torment is embodied ("pulling him apart") and the resolution acknowledges the trade-off ("hadn't saved...but gave it the language"). Causal and thematic across beats; the story's stakes and closure turn on this internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is established early (charts paths, "strange and useful talent") and enables the graffiti-ledger plan—intuition sees the pattern, orderliness imposes the system. The trait constrains his approach (cannot lead chaos-based resistance) and is causally active in the middle (explaining the method to Zola). Present in setup, middle, and implicitly at closure (watching the plan's effect). Label-mention in opening; the trait does more work in the middle choice than at the ending. Cost is oblique—his dual nature forces him into a subtle revolution—but visible in the plan's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reorganize is the story's engine: Kael's goal, the graffiti-ledger method, and the outcome (fisher-folk relocate, grain pricing unifies) all turn on secret restructuring. The action is signaled early ("They had to reorganize"), executed in the middle (Zola's murals encode new structures), and tested at closure (inspector sees "strange efficiency"). Swapping "reorganize" for another verb would require rewriting the entire causal chain. Present across setup, development, and payoff; drives at least two beats and the ending's charge. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method (graffiti-as-code) is signaled early ("Graffiti was the language of the Revel"), explained to Zola in the middle ("embed messages within their art"), and tested at closure (inspector sees patterns, Kael reflects on "the language to survive"). The mechanics matter: comet-count = grain price, serpent scales = map. The method constrains tactics (must be subtle, legible to insiders, opaque to outsiders) and enables the plan's success. Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives the middle choice and shapes the ending. High specificity and causal pressure; indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The raft city is vividly established in the opening and supplies the precarious constraint that rules out direct confrontation ("towed away and dismantled"). The carnival's graffiti-covered surfaces enable the encoding method; the planks, barges, high-wire platform, and edge-of-city location provide spatial choreography. The setting shapes tactics (must reorganize subtly to avoid being dismantled) and charges the final image (dark water, floating world). Present in setup, constrains middle choices, and anchors the ending. Strong causal and atmospheric pressure; environment meaningfully alters options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe (before privatization, pre-contract signing) is established early and frames urgency: "the last gasp...freedom" and "the coming gentrification." The inspector's early arrival ("weeks ahead of schedule") tightens the clock and forces the plan to face its test prematurely. Time shapes Kael's motivation (act now or lose agency) and the ending's poise (Consortium still coming, but story changed). Present in setup and middle escalation; implicit at closure. The live clock alters tactics and sharpens stakes, though it is not granularly tracked beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Navigate gentrification is Kael's explicit motivation ("he had to help his people navigate the coming gentrification") and drives his choice to reorganize rather than resist. The desire is dramatized in his internal conflict (rage vs. orderly acceptance), his pitch to Zola, and his final reflection on survival "on its own terms." Present in setup, middle choice, and ending. The friction between wanting to preserve the Revel and accepting transformation is embodied across beats. Causal and thematic; the motivation shapes the plan and the closure's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent throughout: "agonizing" motivation, "torment of dual allegiance," "hopeful desperation" (stated), inspector scene tension ("heart a frantic drum"), and final "desperate hope painted bright." The tone modulates with pressure (calm→torment→hope) and charges the final image without tipping into sentimentality or false uplift. The ending acknowledges limits ("still coming...hadn't saved") while asserting agency ("changed the story"). Tone is stable across turns and integral to the closure's emotional register, though the explicit phrase "hopeful desperation" trends slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
