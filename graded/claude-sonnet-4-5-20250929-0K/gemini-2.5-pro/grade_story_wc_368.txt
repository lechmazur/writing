<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and his observational stance is consistent, but his agency remains largely passive until the final approach. The donor heart backstory is efficient (~10% of text) and anchors the present perceptual shift, yet interior contradiction is limited—he observes and concludes without meaningful internal resistance. The woman remains a cipher by design, which serves the theme but offers no relational pressure or status friction. The final encounter delivers recognition but no visible cost that forecloses a path; it feels like mutual acknowledgment rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The story accumulates observational density (sun trails, morpho wing, patron reactions) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Kaelen's realization that "some people don't magnetize stories; they are the prisms" reweights his opening question with conceptual cost (the donor's legacy now understood as perceptual gift, not merely extended time). One causal seam: the woman's final line ("The man this heart belonged to...he saw the world that way too") feels like convenient confirmation rather than earned dramatization, narrowly meeting the RR threshold but lacking a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on Kaelen's part.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, valley cliffs, and chalk-marked sun trails supply vivid spatial grounding and constrain Kaelen's method of inquiry. Sensory hierarchy reflects his dye-master training (microscopic ridges, refraction vs. pigment). The morpho wing functions as micro-setting object, charged at closure when it returns on his palm to articulate the prism metaphor. Minor slip: the mist and prayer-flag simile risk postcard lyricism, but the chalk trails on floorboards and the eastern window anchor choice and observation concretely enough to earn the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaelen shifts from pigment study to tracking light behavior, narrowing his method. The final approach with the wing constitutes agency, but no live option is foreclosed; the woman departs freely and Kaelen is left with understanding, not a trade-off or visible price. Escalation reads as density increase (weeks turning into a season, repeated observations) rather than a tightening that forces a difficult choice, meeting the Accumulative lens minimum but not the 8.0+ gate requiring a felt cost that charges tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—refraction vs. magnetism, perception as legacy—emerges from the morpho wing's structural color and the sun-trail methodology without overt thesis. The final image (prism metaphor) reweights Kaelen's opening curiosity and the donor-heart premise with conceptual clarity. Minor deduction: "Stories don't stick to you; they refract through you" hovers near explicit statement, though it arises in dialogue and is anchored by the wing and chalk lines. The story resists moralizing but the ending articulation feels slightly pedagogical, narrowly missing the non-literal resonance gate for 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV first person is stable; perceptual signature (dye-master's attention to hue, structure, refraction) is consistent and character-specific. The dialogue exchange feels purpose-driven and advances the thematic question. Two slips lower the score: "valley-mist wonder I felt in my soul" drifts into abstract poeticism, and the woman's confirming line about the donor reads as helpful exposition rather than dramatized subtext. Syntax and rhythm remain controlled, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear, keeping the piece in the solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail (microscopic ridges, chalk dust, curling steam) is concrete. Two text-artifact issues prevent higher scoring: "quietly explosive" appears as a label without embodied proof in peak beats, and the phrase "valley-mist wonder" recurs decoratively. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph four ("hesitate, to bend and pool...uncertain arcs") restates light behavior across adjacent clauses. No egregious scaffold, but these slips total −0.3 to −0.4, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The donor-heart premise is familiar, but the synthesis with dye-mastery, structural color (morpho wing), and sun-trail tracking offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The final prism metaphor feels earned in hindsight by prior particulars (refraction vs. pigment, chalk arcs). Risk-taking is moderate—Kaelen's passivity and the woman's cipher status are intentional but safe choices. The story avoids generic templates yet does not transform the heart-transplant trope into territory that feels bold or inevitable at the 8+ level. The closing recognition is fresh but not surprising enough to reach the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen the watchful dye master frames the opening motivation and his perceptual shift; his observation drives the sun-trail method and the final approach. Two beats: the decision to track sun trails (mid-story) and the choice to approach with the wing (closure). However, his watchfulness remains largely passive—observation without difficult trade-offs. The character is present at closure and his training (pigment vs. refraction) charges the final metaphor, meeting the two-gate threshold and causal involvement but not the irreplaceability or cost gate for 7+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in three beats: left behind, studied under loupe, returned on Kaelen's palm at closure. It seeds the refraction theme early, enables the pigment-vs.-structure insight, and charges the final prism metaphor. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor friction: the wing is handled twice (left, returned) but not actively manipulated in the middle beat—study is described rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. Specificity (microscopic ridges, iridescent caution) and thematic irreplaceability push the score into the 7+ band, narrowly missing 8+ due to mid-story passivity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is named explicitly ("a lesson in iridescent caution") and thematically echoed in the fragility/refraction metaphor. It shapes Kaelen's interpretive stance (caution about vibrant, misunderstood things) but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure. The concept charges the closure image indirectly (prism/refraction) but remains more thematic resonance than causal force. Two gates met (early signal, closure linkage via metaphor transformation), but missing middle development where caution would narrow options. Lyric reprise lifts the score into low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is named once ("this new existence felt quietly explosive, a silent detonation of perception") but never dramatized through embodied action or visible trade-off. The trait labels Kaelen's internal state without constraining a choice or enabling a tactic. It reappears obliquely in the final paragraph ("the quiet, explosive knowledge") as thematic echo but not as a causal force. Setup present, closure cameo present, but middle development and cost connection absent. Swappable with "transformative" or "intense" without structural loss, capping the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Illuminate anchors Kaelen's stated goal ("I decided the answer was...to illuminate the mystery") and organizes his method (sun trails). The action shapes one major beat (the decision to track light) and is present conceptually at closure ("I wanted to illuminate her nature"). However, the mechanics of illumination remain metaphorical—Kaelen observes rather than enacts a difficult choice under this rubric. Two gates (setup, closure participation via stated intent) and one beat involvement, but lacking the specificity and tactical cost for 7.5+. The action could be replaced with "understand" or "decode" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is signaled explicitly ("I started by tracking sun trails"), detailed with chalk dust and floorboard arcs, and supplies the observational data (shimmering arcs on her days vs. straight lines for others) that enables the closure metaphor. The method shapes two beats: the decision to track and the gesture toward chalk lines during the final exchange. Causal pressure is moderate—the trails are evidence, not a tool that alters tactics under difficulty. Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure participation, but the method reads as investigative process rather than a constrained choice with felt cost, capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house provides vivid spatial grounding (tethered by chains, eastern window, floorboards for chalk trails) and enables Kaelen's observational method. It functions as the single continuous setting and supplies the surface for sun-trail tracking. Closure participation is indirect—the chalk lines on the floor are gestured to, but the setting itself does not pressure the final choice. Two gates (setup, middle utility) and solid micro-setting contribution, but the tea house could be replaced with any stationary observation post without altering the prism metaphor. Spatial specificity and early anchor prevent a lower score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The donor-heart timeframe is foregrounded in the opening line and motivates Kaelen's perceptual shift; the woman's final revelation ("The man this heart belonged to...") confirms the donor's legacy as the story's hinge. Time as duration ("weeks turned into a season") tracks progression but does not tighten decisions—no live clock pressures the final approach. Three gates met (setup, implicit middle influence via the heart's "cadence that felt like anticipation," closure revelation), yet the timeframe functions more as premise than tactical constraint. The heart's presence is indispensable conceptually but does not narrow Kaelen's options with felt cost, placing the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to learn why some people magnetize stories—is stated early, dramatized through sun-trail tracking, and directly answered at closure (prism metaphor). It drives Kaelen's choices across two beats (tracking, approaching) and receives thematic payoff. Friction: the desire is not conflicted or tested by competing wants; Kaelen pursues it steadily without visible cost or sacrifice. The motivation shapes the plot but lacks the internal resistance or trade-off that would elevate it above 7.0. Three gates met with solid causal involvement, but no felt cost tied to the pursuit itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is named explicitly and sustained through sensory details (morning fog, prayer-flag whisper, mist at closure). The tone modulates subtly—reverent silence around the woman, Kaelen's softening voice—and charges the final image (the woman drifting back into the mist, Kaelen left with "quiet, explosive knowledge"). Coherent through turns and consistent with the accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the phrase "valley-mist wonder" appears twice as descriptor, risking label-only use, but the sensory anchors (fog, curling steam, mist) embody the tone concretely enough to reach mid-7s. Strong closure participation elevates the score.</comment>
