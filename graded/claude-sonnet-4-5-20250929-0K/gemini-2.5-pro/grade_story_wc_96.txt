<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's monthly personality shift (the Architect vs. the Reckoner) is established early and constrains his present perception—he sees "potential" where last month he would catalog failures. The moment he offers the poem to the newcomer embodies a hierarchy of values (connection over safety) with visible cost: he steps forward, exposing himself. Internal contradiction is present but underdeveloped; his peace feels unearned given the prison backstory's weight. Elara remains functional but secondary, her interiority inaccessible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly (moon, library ruins, Silas). Pressure accumulates through the arrival of the books, the coffee-tin reveal, and finally the two strangers—each beat reweights the stakes from solitary penance to nascent community. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "four people began the impossible, beautiful work" crystallizes the shift from isolation to collective action, and the cost (vulnerability, exposure to strangers) is felt in Silas's held breath and step forward. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library dome, jagged skyline, and shattered glass are filtered through Silas's "cathedral of decay" lens and recur purposefully. The gaping entrance frames the strangers' arrival, altering Silas's choice to step forward. The coffee tin's false bottom and the teetering book stack both constrain action and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the grimy marble floor, the dented tin) functions as pressure; the lunar glow pours silver at closure, elevating the ending without excess decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: rebuild beauty from rot. One meaningful tightening occurs when the strangers appear—Silas must choose exposure over retreat. His step forward and handing over the poem foreclose solitary safety with visible cost (his caught breath, the "first brick laid"). The Architect persona enables the choice; last month's Reckoner would have cataloged threat. No forced reversals; the accumulative lens supports the single deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the coffee tin's false bottom (arsenal = verses), the library skeleton, the recurring moon motif that shifts from "sliver of bone" to silver illumination. The handed poem—"the stars see more than just our scars"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image (four sorting books under moonlight) reweights prior material, transforming penance into community. Blooming resistance as concept is enacted, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: "cathedral of decay," "vagrant penny poet," "sacred duty"—idiom fits Silas's learned, damaged lens. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: Elara's "Time to plant the garden" and the stranger's "Can… can we help?" both advance plot and carry subtext (complicity, hope). The final poem-reading modulates voice under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression ("their hands moving in a familiar rhythm") accelerates; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse ("The moon," "Silas felt," "He knelt"). Information density is high: the coffee tin compresses backstory (prison library) and present arsenal (folded poems) in one object. Minor overwriting: "luminous fracture against the darkness" in the final beat leans ornamental, and "hushed reverence of the prison library where their friendship first sparked" stacks modifiers. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains intact at closure. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt") appear but fit voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—vagrant poets rebuilding a library under stars with contraband verse—synthesizes post-collapse trope and literary activism through specific particulars (the false-bottom tin, monthly personality molt). The Architect/Reckoner duality and the coffee-tin arsenal feel fresh. Risk: introducing the strangers late could flatten, but their arrival grows organically from "the impossible rumor" and crystallizes the shift from solitary to collective. The poem as "first brick" is a purposeful, non-obvious image that reweights the rebuild metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas (vagrant penny poet) is present throughout; his choices drive key turns: organizing books, revealing the coffee tin, stepping forward to offer the poem. His agency at closure—handing the verse, speaking "There is shelter here"—alters tactics from solitary to communal. The label "penny poet" is ornamental (never tested by scarcity or exchange), capping higher scores. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in two distinct beats: Elara slides it across (mid-scene action) and Silas opens the false bottom to reveal poems. Its mechanics (false bottom, hidden verses) shape the arsenal conceit and charge the final distribution. The tin is signaled early enough (~halfway) and its specificity (dented, familiar weight) matters. Not indispensable—another container could serve—but the false-bottom detail constrains the "garden" metaphor and ties to their prison past.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blooming resistance is stated ("a blooming resistance against the rot") and enacted through the verse distribution and library rebuild. It shapes the dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy) and the final choice (Silas hands a poem, invites help). Present in closure ("four people began the impossible, beautiful work"), though the phrase itself is metaphoric rather than causal. One key turn (offering the poem) hinges on this motivation. Swappable with "quiet rebellion" or similar; cost is implied but not uniquely tied to "blooming."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Monthly personality molt (Architect vs. Reckoner) is introduced in the opening beat and constrains Silas's present perception: he sees potential, not failures. It enables his final choice—last month's Reckoner would catalog threat, but the Architect sees "foundation stones." The trait is labeled more than dramatized; we never witness a molt or the Reckoner's contrary action on the page. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle involves organizing but not a visible cost tied to the shift itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rebuild anchors the entire premise: Silas's "sacred duty," the sorting of books, Elara's "foundlings," the invitation to the strangers, and the final image ("four people began the impossible, beautiful work of sorting books"). Two major beats trace to this action (organizing, inviting help). The closure image is inextricable from rebuild. Cost is visible: vulnerability to strangers, exposure. Slightly generic—"restore" or "reclaim" could substitute with minor edits—but the specificity of "sorting books" and "first brick laid" sharpens it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prison library friendship is backstory, signaled mid-scene ("the hushed reverence of the prison library where their friendship first sparked"). It primes Elara's trust and their "familiar rhythm" but does not constrain a present choice. The method (sorting books) recurs in both past and present, creating a purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the closure. Two gates borderline: setup (mentioned ~mid-story), payoff (closure echoes the method). No middle development; the friendship enables but does not complicate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is introduced in the opening and recurs throughout: "skeleton of the old public library," "grimy marble floor," "gaping entrance," "rusted-out dome" through which moonlight pours at closure. Setting supplies resources (books, shelter) and pressures the choice to invite strangers (the entrance frames their arrival). The final image—four people sorting under lunar silver—is inextricable from this exact setting. All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate but present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored early ("The moon, a sliver of bone, began to clear") and returns at closure ("The moon was high now, pouring silver"). It tracks the Architect's emergence ("as the last of the month's persona…slough away") and Elara's acknowledgment ("The moon is new"). The passage of ~an hour is noted, tightening the single-scene window. The moon's rise does not constrain choices directly but modulates tone and charges the final image. Lyric reprise; two gates (setup, payoff).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—forge beauty from anarchy—is stated early ("Their shared motivation was a quiet, desperate fire") and dramatized through three choices: organizing books, revealing poems, inviting strangers. It drives the final act: Silas hands the poem and speaks "There is shelter here," risking exposure. Friction is present (caught breath, caution) but cost is implied rather than visceral. All three gates met; causal pressure is strong but the phrasing is slightly abstract ("beauty from anarchy" could be "order from chaos").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luminous fracture as tone is enacted through contradictions: "sliver of bone" vs. "silver," "cathedral of decay" vs. "sacred duty," "vagrant" vs. "Architect." The poem-reading moment literalizes it ("the words a luminous fracture against the darkness"). Tone modulates from solitary penance to tentative hope without breaking coherence. The final image—moonlight through rust, four sorting books—charges the ending with beauty-amid-ruin. All three gates met; specificity is high and the tone is indispensable to closure.</comment>
