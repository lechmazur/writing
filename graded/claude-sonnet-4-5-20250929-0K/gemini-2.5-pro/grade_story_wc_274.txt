<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is established early and drives the climactic choice, with bodily response ("wave of vertigo," "trembled") grounding the emotional stakes. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("schism running through the core," "professional vows and personal conscience") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation carries weight, but the turn from decades of loyalty to immediate sedition feels compressed; the intermediate micro-choices that would earn such a leap are summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (archivist, Grand Archive, blizzard isolation) land cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Causal: discovery → moral conflict → encryption → dispersal. Closure delivers a Charged Poise—Elara waits for consequences with the weight of what was to come—reconfiguring her sanctuary into a site of sedition with felt cost ("profound betrayal"). The cost is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (finding the letter narrows options to preserve or release) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frost-rimmed vaults, ventilation whisper, and blizzard insulation create a tactile, oppressive atmosphere. The archaic terminal and pneumatic tubes ground the climactic choice in a concrete location that enables the act. The "library under snow" and "dizzying quiet" recur with shifted valence at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (descent into substructures, return to observatory window) remains clear and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve institutional myth or release truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the letter. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation: she chooses encryption over deletion, dormant networks over main stacks, immediate action over deferral. The cost is visible: "profound betrayal to the silent, sleeping figures" and the forfeiture of sanctuary. The purity purge provides external urgency, and the final act forecloses her safe archival life with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between sanctioned history and buried truth, the living versus the dead. The letter's revelation reframes "incorruptible leadership" as mythology, and Elara's final image—"blank page unaware of the story about to be written violently upon it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without moralizing. "The living deserved the truth more than the dead deserved their secrets" risks directness but remains grounded in her present dilemma. The purity purge adds moral calculus without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable throughout with consistent third-limited distance. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("data-fane," "cryo-pumps," "automaton's purpose") that fits a scholarly archivist's perception. Elara's perceptual signature—noticing "frost-rimmed data-vaults," "ghost in the machine"—is selective and coherent. However, phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "schism running through the core" tilt toward abstract psychology rather than voice-specific idiom. The narrative occasionally tells what has been shown ("Her motivation was not destruction..."), slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, and the prose carries strong images ("echoing library under snow," "ether"). However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "dizzying quiet" appears three times with minor variation, and "profound betrayal" is stated then paraphrased. Template cadence in the middle section ("She bypassed... descended... sat...") and some stock metaphor phrasing ("within the blink that follows surprise") reduce density. The closure image is vivid and propulsive, but earlier beats could tighten to eliminate redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cryogenic archive setting and the dormant-networks method offer fresh specificity. However, the core premise—lone archivist discovers inconvenient truth and leaks it to provoke change—follows a recognizable template without substantial transformation. The liaison letter as contraband and the purity purge as catalyst are logically consistent but do not surprise. The story commits fully to its premise and executes competently, yet lacks a non-obvious synthesis or a turn that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>
