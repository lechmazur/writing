<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's affliction—involuntary truthfulness—is embodied through concrete consequences (trading his entire season's truffles, bracing for painful disclosure) and drives his isolation with visible cost. The final choice shows contradictory impulses acting in scene: he braces for the litany, feels the familiar pressure, then experiences the severance and offers a partial truth with relief. Internal states are rendered through physical sensation ("strange, quiet click," "pressure behind his teeth") rather than diagnostic labels. Minor slip: Lena's memory is told rather than shown in a charged micro-choice, slightly weakening the embodied texture of his protection motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (truffle forager, hanging orchard, post-virus world). The story follows a causal lens: desperate search → acquisition → attunement ritual during storm → successful occlusion → neighbor's test of the relic's effect. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Elias gains partial silence but only after trading three kilos of truffles and enduring the storm's turmoil; the glass eye now guards "the first cornerstone of his new, quiet world," signaling a path foreclosed (total honesty) and one opened (curated truth). The because/therefore linkage holds cleanly, and the final beat demonstrates the relic's function with felt relief and constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and ravine setting constrain Elias's choices throughout: isolation provides psychological safety, the storm supplies the required "profound environmental turmoil" for attunement, and the damaged-but-holding orchard mirrors his fractured endurance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind screamed," "sheets of rain hammered," "cerulean iris," "cool and heavy"). The neighbor's voice "echoing in the clean air" after the storm provides spatial choreography and tests the relic's effect. The glass eye on the mantelpiece charges the final image, transforming from desperate purchase to "silent, cerulean guardian."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety by protecting memory from compulsive disclosure—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: affliction worsens → search through discredited texts → costly trade → attunement ritual → test with neighbor. The storm provides environmental pressure that converges with emotional turmoil at the ritual beat. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to attune the relic during peak vulnerability forecloses total honesty and opens curated silence, with visible cost (truffles, storm endurance, the severance "click"). The neighbor's question functions as a concrete test that narrows options and demonstrates the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—privacy as a constructed refuge, the cost of absolute truth, fractured survival—emerges through concrete particulars: the hanging orchard's precarious beauty, the glass eye as both relic and guardian, the shift from exhaustive honesty to protective silence. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "It is peaceful here" is true but not the whole truth, and the eye watches over "the first cornerstone of his new, quiet world." The virus backstory and fringe science anchor the premise in specificity. Subtext operates in the neighbor's casual question and Elias's relief at withholding; the orchard's survival parallels his own endurance with visible damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close; perceptual signature is character-specific (truffle forager's eye for "symbiotic relationship," "powdered silicates," "non-conductive mineral"). Diction stays within Elias's rational, precise register even under pressure ("psycho-sympathetic resonance," "focal point," "occlude"). The dialogue exchange with the neighbor is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext: her question probes vulnerability; his answer withholds with purpose. Minor slip: "a bastion against the chaos" and "a place of precarious beauty" occasionally drift toward elevated summary rather than felt perception, slightly loosening immediacy in the opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; high-pressure beats compress ("He closed his hand... He focused all his will...") while calmer moments expand detail. Information density is strong: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causality without padding. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "the wind stealing the words from his lips" is a stock metaphor; "soul-deep need for solitude" uses an elevated modifier where embodied perception would sharpen immediacy; "a nightmare of truthful bartering" tells rather than showing one concrete beat of that transaction. These artifacts appear in setup rather than closure, keeping closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—truffle forager with truth affliction seeks psychic dampening relic—feels specific and non-obvious, grounded in post-virus fringe science rather than generic fantasy. The glass eye as "Silent Witness" and the attunement-through-turmoil mechanism transform familiar "cursed honesty" tropes through concrete world logic and occupational detail. Emotional specificity (trading a season's work, the "gentle severance") avoids generic templates. Slight friction: the empathy-virus premise and truth-curse combination trend toward speculative-fiction templates; the transformation is solid but not radically fresh, landing in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's identity as rational truffle forager shapes early stakes (traded three kilos, "entire season's work") and his methodical search through discredited textbooks. His rationality contrasts with desperate hope, driving the attunement choice. The occupation appears in setup, closure (neighbor from "settlement across the ravine"), and the mantelpiece image, but middle development is thinner—no on-page foraging choice that alters tactics under pressure. Two gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass eye is handled across three distinct beats: acquisition (velvet-lined box, costly trade), attunement ritual (pressed against temple, "cool and heavy," "cerulean iris," "strange, quiet click"), and closure (mantelpiece guardian, charges the final image). It constrains the attunement choice (must occlude "most painful truth during profound turmoil") and enables the successful partial silence. Specificity high: "powdered silicates," "non-conductive mineral from a meteorite," hand-painted radial lines. Removing it breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept frames the search ("nightmare of truthful bartering" in "underground markets") and shapes the attunement method (Isolationist sect design, absorption of "unwanted psychic leakage"). It provides the mechanism for Elias's solution and charges the glass eye with forbidden, specialized function. Present in setup, middle (textbook reference), and implicit at closure (relic works as designed). Drives two beats but is somewhat swappable with "rare artifact" or "forbidden device" without full structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness creates the dominant stake: affliction makes society impossible, ready to spill memory "for any stranger who might ask," forces him into underground markets as "pitiable but trustworthy negotiator." It constrains the pre-closure state (braces for "litany," feels "familiar, painful pressure behind his teeth") and the test proves occlusion (words stop, partial truth replaces exhaustive honesty). Visible cost throughout; trait drives setup, escalation, and closure demonstration. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Occlude" anchors the textbook theory ("occlude a single, targeted stream of consciousness"), drives the attunement action ("pressing the cold glass against his temple," willing to "protect" rather than erase memory), and delivers closure (words form, then stop; partial truth emerges). The action is specific and irreplaceable—"erase," "hide," or "block" would shift meaning and method. Present across setup, ritual beat, and test. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; narrowly swappable only with conceptual synonyms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method—search through "rumored cures in discredited textbooks"—is signaled in setup and shapes Elias's path ("fringe science of a world before the virus," "psycho-sympathetic resonance and neurological dampening," "Silent Witness" theory). It provides the mechanics that justify the glass eye's function and the attunement ritual. Present in two beats but not revisited at closure; the textbook itself vanishes after setup. Functional causal role but middle participation is summary-only rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the storm-battered ravine supplies isolation motive (psychological safety), environmental turmoil for attunement (wind, rain, "greatest storm of the year"), physical constraint (home clings "like a stubborn limpet," orchard damaged but held), and thematic resonance ("fractured grace," "precarious beauty"). It shapes tactics (neighbor must hike down, Elias's solitude tested) and charges closure ("battered but beautiful canopy," "quiet strength of the ravine"). Present across all three gates with visible pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-empathy-virus timeframe establishes backstory (virus "had passed," left Elias rewired) and enables the fringe-science premise (underground markets persist, discredited textbooks from "before the virus"). It contextualizes the affliction and isolation but does not tighten on-page decisions—no live clock or deadline pressure during the attunement ritual or neighbor encounter. Present in setup and implicit at closure; one purposeful reprise ("world before the virus") but minimal middle constraint. Functional context, not driving stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to cultivate psychological safety is dramatized through every major choice: isolating in the dangerous orchard, searching for the relic, trading the season's truffles, enduring the storm to attune, and withholding from the neighbor. Desire is conflicted (rationality versus desperate hope, protection versus erasure). It drives setup, middle search, and closure test. Friction between want (total privacy) and cost (season's work, storm turmoil, partial truth only) is visible on the page. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone of fractured grace coheres through imagery: "precarious beauty constantly battered by storms," "battered but beautiful canopy," orchard's survival as "testament to fractured grace," glass eye's "unnerving placidity" becoming "silent, cerulean guardian." Tone modulates with pressure—calm rationality in setup, compressed intensity during storm ritual, quiet relief at closure—without breaking voice. The final image ("first cornerstone of his new, quiet world") charges the tone with earned cost and fragile hope. Rhythm and diction sustain the effect across all beats.</comment>
