<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover collective grief's shape is clear and his obsession intensifies through repeated greenhouse visits. The grandmother's spectral presence guides his hands with "sudden certainty," but this moment lacks embodied contradiction—his epiphany arrives smoothly without visible internal resistance or cost. The final understanding feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle: "he understood" followed by abstract explanation. Micro-choices are present (tracing lines, picking up chisel) but the peak realization bypasses conflicted action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through nightly repetition and migration imagery building toward a pattern-break realization. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, butterfly season). Closure arrives on-page as Conceptual Repricing: collective grief reweighted from monument to network, crystallized in the abstract web carving. Cost is conceptual and felt (eased pressure, quieted thundering) but the final act—leaving the slate and returning with "new understanding"—reads as resolution without visible forfeiture or path foreclosed with weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse functions as micro-setting throughout: vines like skeletal fingers, damp earth scent, storm rattling panes at climax. The slate and ribbon roll are handled across multiple beats, each texture traced deliberately. The storm's physical manifestation ("rattled the greenhouse's fragile panes") directly charges the peak moment when his focus narrows. Environment constrains and amplifies: the sanctuary's quiet enables meditation, the storm externalizes internal thundering, and living things surround the final carved web.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering collective grief's shape—is signaled early and drives repeated greenhouse returns. One meaningful deepening occurs: storm arrives at migration peak, focus narrows to convergence point, understanding breaks through. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but arrives via external catalyst (storm) rather than protagonist constraint. The final peace and "new understanding" ease pressure without visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost, only understanding gained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected grief emerges through particulars: ghost orchid veins, ribbon threads, butterfly flight paths converge in the carved web. The grandmother's favorite poem line ("The journey is the only home") seeds and returns with purpose. The ending image—abstract web among living things—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph explains the theme overtly ("Collective grief was not a monument...It was a network") where image alone could resonate, approaching thematic echo territory without fully crossing into prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with consistent third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "weight of each new name not as stone, but as silence," "thundering calm," texture-focused attention. Diction stays controlled and purpose-driven, modulating appropriately under emotional pressure. Free indirect style is clean. One minor register drift: "spectral mentorship" and "fiercely meditative state" edge toward elevated vocabulary that slightly exceeds the established texture, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and sentence openings show variety. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The thought was so vivid...This was her spectral mentorship" restates guidance across adjacent lines without added pressure; "He was mapping not the stone, but the very emotion...learning her hand, her intent" cycles through similar restatements. The storm paragraph achieves strong propulsion ("His focus narrowed...his chisel followed a path") but the abstract explanation that follows ("It was a network...") slows momentum when image could carry meaning. Minor filter stacking in early paragraphs ("He began," "He closed," "He picked up") without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gravestone-carver premise is specific and the butterfly migration timeframe offers fresh structural scaffolding. Combining spectral mentorship via poem-trading custom with tactile retracing of unfinished work transforms familiar grief-discovery arc into something particular. The network-as-grief insight, while earned through image accumulation, edges toward abstraction in its articulation. Risk is present in the quiet, meditative pacing and lyric structure, though the resolution's emotional arc (obsession → understanding → peace) follows a recognizable template without bold subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias drives all major beats: carries slate to greenhouse (setup), retraces grandmother's lines night after night (development), follows convergent path during storm to final understanding (payoff). His choices create the key turn at climax. Cost is present but conceptual (eased pressure, quieted thundering) rather than a visible forfeiture. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ribbon roll appears in setup (beside slate, paragraph two) and is handled once in development ("His fingers found...tracing the texture of each fabric"). It seeds the network metaphor ("interconnected threads in the woven ribbon roll") at closure but does not return as object—only as abstracted image. Two touches across beats; lyric reprise with thematic weight but no middle causal pressure. Setup + payoff gates met; development gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is dramatized: grandmother's presence felt through poem memory, "sudden certainty of his hands," and guidance during retracing. It shapes his nightly returns and peak focus. Stakes center on understanding her intent through her unfinished work. Cost is conceptual (peace from her presence). All three gates met with moderate causal pressure; the concept enables rather than constrains, and the mechanics (felt guidance vs. spoken instruction) remain consistent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears as label in paragraph two ("his fiercely meditative state") and is implied through repeated focused sessions. No on-page choice shows visible cost from this trait—it enables sanctuary access but does not constrain an option or force a trade-off. Functional descriptor without causal friction; present in setup, absent from development and payoff as distinct attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" structures the entire middle: "began to retrace the faint lines," "retraced every curve, every aborted line," learning grandmother's hand through repeated action. This action is the method of discovery—night after night engagement that culminates in storm-peak following of convergent path. Major turn (understanding) traces directly to sustained retracing. All gates; strong causal pressure; irreplaceable (no other verb could anchor the tactile-temporal method); closure-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Family custom of trading poems seeds the piece: establishes relationship texture and delivers key line ("The journey is the only home") that surfaces during meditation. The method (poem-trading) is signaled and one product (grandmother's favorite) unlocks realization. However, the custom itself does not shape a middle choice or constrain tactics—only its artifact (the poem line) does work. Setup strong, development indirect, payoff via residue rather than active use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ancient greenhouse is setup location, chosen explicitly as sanctuary "quiet enough for his fiercely meditative state." It supplies resources (crumbling bench, fragile panes that rattle) and the storm interaction at climax directly pressures the peak beat. Environment enables nightly returns and charges final image (web left "among the living, growing things"). All gates met; strong causal and atmospheric pressure; spatial coherence maintained; closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Butterfly migration timeframe brackets the arc: "first monarch butterflies" at opening, migration "swelled to a silent, flowing river" during nights of work, "peak of the migration arrived with a storm," "last of the butterflies began their journey south" at closure. Time is tracked and pressures pacing (nightly returns accumulate as migration swells). One meaningful tightening (peak/storm convergence). Setup, development, and payoff gates met; live clock present but gentle rather than urgent; tightens tactics moderately.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover the shape of collective grief" is declared in paragraph one and drives all action: carrying slate to greenhouse, retracing lines, nightly returns, storm-peak focus. Dramatized through repeated choices and sustained effort. Understanding arrives as payoff with felt cost (eased pressure, peace). Friction between obsession and calm is present ("thundering calm"); want shapes all beats. All gates; strong causal role; closure delivers on motivation with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is named in paragraph two and enacted throughout: quiet sanctuary with "thundering" interiority, storm as "physical manifestation of the thundering in his soul," resolution when "the thundering quieted." Tone modulates coherently—meditative action punctuated by internal intensity, storm externalizes peak pressure, final peace resolves the thunder. Oxymoron is sustained and charges closure image. Setup, development, payoff met; coherent modulation under pressure; the phrase risks being slightly on-the-nose but execution integrates it.</comment>
