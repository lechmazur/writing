<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and his motivations clear: the shift from archiving emotion to needing to starve it creates genuine internal conflict. The museum memory anchors his method with specific sensory detail (cold iron tongue, phantom resonance). His final realization—that his sworn purpose has doomed the city—drives a credible pivot with visible cost. Minor slip: the leap from hearing the prophecy to understanding the full implication ("turned his city into a brightly lit banquet") compresses insight slightly, but the contradiction between oath and survival lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with situational pressure: the foghorn's silence → dread → wax recording → prophecy → realization forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors (Elian, rooftop garden, post-silence) arrive early. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes Elian's impossible choice (archive vs. survival) with undeniable conceptual cost—his life's work is the lure. The story teaches its stakes by midpoint and the ending reconfigures all prior material without stating a resolution. One meaningful tightening (the prophecy narrows options decisively) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard garden atop the Spire grounds the opening; sensory details (caramel-colored blank, diamond stylus, apple blossoms turning cloying) are purposeful and filtered through Elian's role. The foghorn's absence functions as negative space that charges the atmosphere. The museum memory supplies concrete setting (cavernous hall, polished brass, salt and dust) that enables the immersion method. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor gap: the garden itself does not constrain a choice at closure, capping the score below 8.5, but the contrast between beauty and threat sharpens the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the city's survival vs. Elian's purpose) is signaled early and escalates through the prophecy. The story delivers one decisive tightening: the voice reveals the foghorn was a sonic bulwark, reframing all prior archiving as the lure. Agency is renunciation—Elian must choose between his oath and the people—with visible cost (his life's work becomes the weapon). Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the final dilemma forecloses both paths with felt weight. No multiple reversals needed; the single turn narrows options sufficiently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: preservation vs. consumption, the archive as beacon and trap. The wax shaving and foghorn shift meaning across beats without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Elian must make the city forget to save it—that reweights the premise with undeniable irony. The prophecy functions as Conceptual Repricing: the city's "loud hearts" and careful emotional record become the lure for a predator that feeds on feeling. No thematic echo or moralizing; the final image (silent city, unaware stalker, archive as doom) carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV throughout; psychic distance is stable and close. Elian's perceptual signature (the scribe's focus on emotional tides, the memory as "mental frequency") is specific and consistent. Diction remains controlled: "velvet disquiet," "desiccated leaves," "cloying and funereal" all fit the scholarly yet sensory register. The dead-tongue dialect is motivated by his specialized vocation. Minor slip: "accidental prophecy born from the stylus's path" edges toward meta-commentary, but the phrase stays within Elian's interpretive frame. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences advance character, world, and pressure without padding. Rhythm varies naturally (short sentences at the prophecy, longer syntactic builds in the opening). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The foghorn opening and apple-blossom close bookend effectively. Minor artifact: "the curious third-grade field trip memory" uses "curious" as a hedge, and "a chilling fluke of his specialized vocation" stacks modifiers that could tighten. These slips do not touch closure, so the cap remains above 8.0. Propulsion is clean through the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—emotional archiving as inadvertent lure for a sonic predator—is fresh and specific. The wax-cylinder method and dead-tongue prophecy combine familiar elements (archival SF, Lovecraftian threat) into a non-obvious synthesis. The foghorn-as-bulwark twist reframes the entire city's history without late rule changes. Risk-taking (the museum memory as psychic key, the need to erase feeling to survive) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's irony (the scribe must destroy what he preserves) feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap names and the premise collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian (venerable oath scribe) drives two key beats: placing the wax to capture dread, then immersing to decode it. His final realization (archive as lure) pivots the story and his choice (starve the silence) shapes the ending. Early signal (first line), middle involvement (recording and immersion), closure linkage (his duty shifts from preservation to erasure). Causal pressure is high; his role is indispensable. Cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wax shaving appears in three beats: cutting from the cylinder, testing the fragment, and hearing the prophecy encoded within. It enables the central discovery and its fragility ("paper-thin") mirrors the city's vulnerability. Early signal, middle use (immersion method), and closure linkage (the shaving reveals the threat). Specificity is high; no generic recorder could deliver a dead-tongue prophecy. Visible cost: the archive itself becomes the danger.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy shapes stakes: the voice is "an intelligence that had imprinted itself upon the city's fear," not a memory but an emergent message from the stylus's path. It reframes the foghorn's purpose and turns Elian's archive into a lure. Middle introduction (slightly late, ~50% mark) but it transforms all prior material and drives the ending choice. Cost is conceptual (the archive dooms the city). Causal pressure is strong, though earlier setup would lift it further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's ability to understand the dead tongue ("Old Coast dialect") is established as "a chilling fluke of his specialized vocation" and enables the prophecy's decoding. It appears once, at the prophecy beat, and is essential there—without it, the warning remains unintelligible. Early setup is implicit (his role as scribe of emotional patterns), middle payoff is decisive. Missing: a second beat or constraint tied to the trait. Functional but single-use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Immerse his consciousness into the recording" is the core action: it enables the prophecy discovery and reframes Elian's entire practice. Setup (method described), middle beat (immersion itself), and closure linkage (the realization forces his final choice). The method is specific and irreplaceable; no passive listening could deliver the voice. Causal pressure is high; the action narrows options decisively. Cost is implied: immersion exposes the archive's danger.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-grade museum memory (iron tongue of the foghorn, phantom resonance) is Elian's "mental frequency" that unlocks the wax. Setup is early (~30% mark), middle use (immersion beat), and the memory's content (foghorn relic) charges the ending irony when the real foghorn's purpose is revealed. Specificity is high; the childhood thrill contrasts with adult dread. The memory constrains method and enriches closure. Minor: its mechanics are told, not dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orchard garden atop the Spire anchors the opening and closing (apple blossoms "cloying and funereal"). It grounds Elian spatially and the rooftop isolation mirrors his role. Setup and closure reprise are present, but the garden does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource. Its contribution is atmospheric and symbolic (beauty vs. threat) rather than tactical. Functional lyric use lifts it above ornamental, but it remains swappable with any high, isolated workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The foghorn's silence is the inciting absence; it frames the entire story and the prophecy reveals its former protective role. Setup (opening line), middle reframe (prophecy explains "the Horn kept us in the deep"), and closure linkage (the silence is why "the way is clear"). Time pressure is implicit (the threat is coming) but not tracked beat-by-beat. The timeframe shapes stakes more than tactics. Solid causal role but no live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian's motivation (to archive emotional patterns) is his life's work and drives the recording beat. The prophecy creates friction: his purpose has "turned his city into a brightly lit banquet." The ending pivots his duty from preservation to erasure with visible cost (his oath vs. the people). Setup (first paragraph), middle conflict (archive as lure), closure choice (starve the silence). Desire is dramatized through action and the final trade-off is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Velvet disquiet" is named early and sustained through texture: silence as presence, "thin and brittle as desiccated leaves," "cloying and funereal." Tone modulates from unease to dread to cold realization, supporting escalation. The final image (silent city, stalking stillness) crystallizes the disquiet with undeniable pressure. Coherent across turns, emotionally precise, and the adjective "velvet" (soft yet oppressive) charges the atmospheric threat throughout.</comment>
