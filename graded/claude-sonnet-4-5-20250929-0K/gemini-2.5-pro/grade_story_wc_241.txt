<question>1</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Aris is rendered with sufficient interiority and a coherent through-line from probability-driven rigidity to intuitive acceptance. Her micro-choices—lighting the candle, following each scrawl—feel motivated by the tension between her intellectual rebellion and the raw search her father modeled. The final shift toward understanding him reads earned rather than announced, though the epiphany edges toward tidy articulation. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally relies on abstraction ("clover melancholy") rather than visceral physical anchors.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the library frame establishes Aris sorting inheritance after her father's death. The structure is a mosaic of compressed beats (library discovery, weeks of traversal, final balcony revelation) with one substantial ellipsis signaled by "For weeks." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (lighting the lantern charges the father's paradox with acceptance; the cost is her detachment from zero-risk certainty). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered scrawls and the final image reweights the stake. One deduction: the traversal montage compresses causality into summary rather than dramatizing a second distinct turning choice, reducing middle pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed library, subway cars, and rail-yard balcony are anchored with selective sensory detail (tarnished frame, smoky shields, humid summer air). The mica pane and lantern function as micro-setting objects that constrain her journey and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across train cars and the maintenance stairwell remains legible. One miss: the subway system's texture could have filtered more through Aris's probability-trained perception to sharpen POV specificity and raise setting above functional backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Aris seeks to decode her father's cipher and, implicitly, reconcile her certainty-driven life with his reckless beauty. The traversal tightens options as each scrawl narrows her path, and the final balcony message forces a stance crystallization. Agency is present in her choice to light the candle, an act of acceptance that forecloses the option of pure intellectual distance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the montage and the ending reweights the cost (her detachment). One friction: the weeks-long montage summarizes rather than showing a second on-page choice that visibly raises stakes or trades off a resource, slightly limiting escalation proof.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the mica cipher, the scrawls, the lantern's light. "The only sure thing is a beautiful risk" is a lucid contradiction that feels earned by prior causality rather than imposed. The ending image—flame through etched mica—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Aris's arc integrates with the thematic question: certainty versus risk, logic's limits, and intuitive grace. Minor deduction: "clover melancholy" as a recurring phrase edges toward label rather than embodied sensory charge, and the phrase "another kind of sense to begin" in the penultimate paragraph leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; narrative distance is controlled and Aris's perceptual signature (probability lexicon, analytical framing) is present. Diction is mostly apt, though phrases like "stultifying certainty of zero" and "raw, untethered beauty" drift slightly elevated for peak emotional beats. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during cipher work, slightly pulled back during the traversal montage). One friction: the final paragraph's syntax ("It was a perfect, lucid contradiction") uses "It was" constructions that dull immediacy when tighter image-driven prose would sharpen voice control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently; the final image recycles the lantern with reweighted meaning. Minor loop detected: "lucid contradiction" appears verbatim twice (once in the setup paragraph, once in the climax), and "clover melancholy" bookends without evolving function. Template cadence in the traversal section ("Each scrawl was… It was a world of…") creates a brief rhythmic sag. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops touch the closure beat, so penalties remain mid-range. Grammar and tense are consistent; no major opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The core synthesis—probability professor decoding graffiti to understand a gambler father—is specific and non-obvious. The cipher-via-vandalism conceit feels fresh. Execution avoids template plot beats, and the emotional calculus (certainty vs. risk) reads authentic rather than generic. One friction: the "lucid contradictions" concept is articulated rather than fully embodied in scene choices; the traversal montage compresses what could have been a riskier structural gamble into summary. The ending lands with thematic coherence but stops short of a bold, irreversible leap that would elevate originality into the high 7s or 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Aris's identity as probability professor shapes her rebellion (intellectual, not reckless) and her method (analytical decoding). Her father's gambling is the inciting premise but he is absent on the page. She makes one key choice: to light the lantern and accept his worldview. The trait is integral to the thematic friction but her on-page decisions could be more causally pressured by the probability/gambler duality. Present in setup, middle method, and ending; causal role in one major beat (lighting the lantern). Eligible for mid-band; not indispensable because a similar arc could work with adjacent intellectual/reckless pairings.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The mica pane appears in three beats: discovery in the library (setup), use as cipher key during traversal (middle), and lighting the lantern at the balcony (closure). It constrains her method (she cannot decode without it) and charges the final image (flame through etched key). Early signal, beat involvement across three distinct moments, closure linkage strong. One friction: the middle use is compressed into summary ("Cross-referencing… with the mica's legend") rather than shown in a second dramatized scene, reducing causal pressure slightly. Strong integration but not fully indispensable; a similar key object could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named twice and demonstrated thematically (random marks form deliberate path, recklessness as search for beauty, zero-risk gamble). It frames the father's final message and Aris's realization. Present in setup via father's note, echoed in the traversal paragraph, and crystallized at closure ("perfect, lucid contradiction"). The concept shapes her acceptance but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Early signal, thematic payoff, closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate. Eligible for mid-6s; removing the exact phrase would not break plot logic but would dilute thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is described in the opening: she rebelled intellectually via tenure, not through actual risk. The trait enables her traversal (she can abandon academic certainty for her father's method) but does not visibly constrain a later choice with on-page cost. Label-only in setup; no middle beat where the theory/practice gap forces a tradeoff. Present at closure implicitly (she moves from theoretical to enacted understanding) but the cost is thematic rather than dramatized. Setup + closure reprise without middle development; cap 3.4 per missing middle gate. Bump to 5.1 for strong thematic linkage and closure resonance, but swappable trait (e.g., "cautiously unconventional") would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The traverse is signaled in the father's note, enacted across weeks, and culminates at the balcony. It drives her method (following scrawls) and delivers her to the final revelation. Early signal, beat involvement across at least two moments (starting the traverse, arriving at the balcony), closure linkage strong. One friction: the weeks-long journey is summarized rather than showing two distinct turning choices during the traverse, reducing middle causal pressure. Removing "traverse" would require major structural rewrite, but the montage compression limits irreplaceability proof. Strong integration, eligible for upper-6s; not indispensable because a static location puzzle could deliver similar thematic payoff with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls is the method signaled in paragraph 3 ("her Rosetta Stone") and enacted across the traversal montage. She uses the mica key to decode symbols, and the final scrawl delivers the thematic statement. Early signal, middle use (one compressed beat), closure participation (final scrawl message). One friction: the mechanics are told in summary ("Cross-referencing the number… she found her next destination") rather than shown in a second dramatized decoding scene, reducing causal specificity. Setup, development, and payoff all present; eligible above 6.0. Causal role in one major beat plus closure linkage; not indispensable because a similar cipher method (photos, letters) could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed library appears in the opening paragraph and anchors the discovery of the lantern. "Midsummer" sets time but does not return or constrain later choices. The library does not reappear after the opening beat; the subway and balcony dominate the traversal and closure. Setup only; no middle or closure participation. Present and functional as inciting location but easily swappable with another private space (office, apartment). No causal pressure beyond housing the initial discovery. Cap 4.6 per missing setup return + middle/closure absence; bump slightly to 4.8 for vivid anchor ("rainwashed," "watery light") that primes the water/light motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>The father's death (myocardial infarction) is the inciting event in the opening line. "After" is present throughout but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The traversal spans "weeks" without urgency; no countdown or deadline forces tactics. Setup present, no middle clock constraint, no closure time pressure. Functional as backstory anchor but swappable with any posthumous trigger (will reading, anniversary). No causal cost tied to elapsed time. Present but ornamental; cap per missing development and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The father's note explicitly asks Aris "to widen perspectives responsibly." This motivates her traversal and her final act of lighting the lantern (moving from pure logic toward intuitive acceptance). The word "responsibly" is not tested on the page with a visible tradeoff; her widening is intellectual acceptance rather than a reckless gamble. Early signal (father's note), middle enactment (traversal), closure payoff (lighting the lantern as acceptance). Desire is dramatized through her journey but the "responsibly" qualifier does not constrain a choice with friction. Setup, development, and payoff present; eligible for mid-6s. Causal role in two beats plus closure linkage; not indispensable because a similar growth arc ("to understand him," "to see beauty") could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>"Clover melancholy" is named twice: once in the opening when she brushes pollen, once in the penultimate paragraph ("remained"). The tone modulates from grief (opening) to "quiet peace" (ending), tracking her emotional arc. Coherent through turns; the melancholy charges the final image (lantern glow as resolved grief). Early signal, implicit middle presence, closure reprise. One friction: "clover" is descriptive (pollen on lantern) but the metaphorical linkage between clover and melancholy is not causally earned; it reads as aesthetic label. Lyric early–final reprise that reweights the stake; eligible for ~6.0 per the allowance. Not indispensable; a similar mood descriptor could work with minor tonal adjustment.</comment>
