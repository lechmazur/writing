<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific—tracking the "deadness" of houses through small interventions—and her interior monologue carries a distinct perceptual signature (the orris root shard, her grandmother's teachings). The pivot from "waking the spirit" to "create a tiny, unexpected fissure" is signaled but feels slightly over-articulated for the character's natural realization. Minor embodiment gaps appear: the "frantic, muffled rhythm" of her heart is told rather than shown through breath or movement. The final choice to observe rather than act forecloses further sanctification with visible cost, though the renunciation could be more physically dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly: Elara, bay, dawn/twilight. The piece follows a two-shard structure (night placement, next evening observation) within a continuous timeframe, resolving to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): her realization reweights her prior actions from animist ritual to social catalyst. The causal chain is clean: her displaced objects → occupants pause → behavioral change, with visible cost (she stops sanctifying, accepts her role as "purveyor of tiny questions"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal backbone; the ending crystallizes the pattern with cost (she loses her original mystical frame but gains agency as catalyst). One meaningful tightening is present and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting details are selective and purposeful: the "salt-heavy air," "manicured rock garden," "polished concrete stoop" all contrast organic chaos against sterile geometry. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and constraining her choice to place it. Spatial choreography is clean across both evenings. The white cube house serves as both setting and antagonist, shaping her most desperate attempt. Minor penalty: the bay itself remains somewhat generic beyond "quiet" and "spring"; a single sensory anchor unique to this bay would elevate specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: reversing the encroaching sterility. Pressure tightens meaningfully when she escalates to the white cube house ("most desperate attempt"), and the evening-after observation shows causal consequence of her acts. The realization mid-placement narrows her understanding and forecloses the mystical frame with felt cost. Agency is present: her choice to observe rather than intervene again demonstrates renunciation. The man's contemplation of the flamingo and the woman's riot of flowers provide on-page verification that her interventions altered tactics. One credible tightening under an Accumulative lens with visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the tension between homogenization and individuality, enacted through displaced objects that invite noticing. The orris root's "violets and damp earth" versus the "stark white cube" embodies the thematic question without stating it. Her insight—"not a priestess of inanimate objects, but a purveyor of tiny, startling questions"—reframes prior material without moralizing; the final image (flamingo, crimson flowers) offers a resonant answer. The concept of "waking the spirit" shifts to "waking people," a non-literal reconfiguration. Minor slip: "inadvertently profound" in paragraph four edges toward meta-commentary, though it recovers quickly by dramatizing the thought's content.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "bruised lavender," "fashionable contagion," "hushed blaze" all feel voice-motivated. Diction remains within Elara's introspective register throughout. One tension: "inadvertently profound" briefly breaks the fourth wall by labeling the character's own thought as profound, a narratorial intrusion. Filter verbs ("she believed," "a thought bloomed") are present but generally voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional beats. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied sentence structure and strong imagery ("bleeding into the bruised lavender," "sliver of organic chaos"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "quiet" recurs across paragraphs without reweighting ("quiet bay," "quiet work," "bay was still quiet"). Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "He was holding... turning it over... He hadn't bought it yet, but the thought was there, a crack..." reads as stacked participles without propulsion. One metaphor strain: "hushed blaze" pairs contradictory sensory modes (auditory hush, visual blaze) without resolution. These non-closure artifacts accumulate to −0.7 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—guerrilla interventions to disrupt sterile conformity—feels familiar but is executed with specificity: the orris root shard, the gargoyle facing the sea, the swapped mats all carry particular logic. The pivot from animist ritual to social catalyst offers a fresh angle on the "waking the world" trope. Elara's perceptual frame (student of creeping normality, silent archivist) and her grandmother's teaching ground the concept in lived detail. Minor deduction: the pink flamingo as emblem of defiance trends toward stock suburban rebellion imagery without transformation. The ending's quiet restraint (observation rather than grand gesture) elevates risk-taking within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as "student of creeping normality" is signaled early, drives the middle action (swapping mats, placing the root), and her observation in the final beat confirms the causal outcome. Her realization mid-placement creates a key turn. The noticing trait enables all beats and shapes the closure image. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure across multiple beats; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in paragraph two (setup: "familiar comfort," "scent of stubborn, untidy life"), is actively placed in paragraph four ("sliver of organic chaos"), and the "cool, violet-tinged scent" triggers her realization. It recurs with reweighted meaning: initially a talisman, finally a catalyst for human noticing. Present in three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; specific properties (scent, texture, grandmother's gift) matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is introduced in paragraph three as descriptor for her acts ("a shard of hush inserted into the monotonous hum") and reprised in the final paragraph ("each displaced thing was a shard of hush"). It frames the stakes conceptually but does not constrain a specific on-page choice; it labels rather than enables. Lyric reprise reweights the premise with thematic cost. Present in setup and payoff; development participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in paragraph five, labeling the realization's quality. It describes rather than enables; the insight itself changes her stance, but the attribute "inadvertently profound" is ornamental meta-commentary. No cost tied to the trait; label-only mention. Late first appearance (second half), no development, no closure participation beyond the moment it labels.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is named in paragraph two ("waking the spirit, a way to sanctify"), enacted across paragraph three (mat swap, gargoyle turn), intensified in paragraph four ("most desperate attempt to sanctify"), and renounced implicitly in the final realization ("wasn't waking the houses at all"). The action structures all beats and the closure hinges on redefining what sanctification meant. Early signal, middle pressure, closure participation, and visible cost (she stops sanctifying structures, accepts catalyzing people).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is signaled in paragraph three (welcome mats, gargoyle) and paragraph four (orris root placement), and the method's mechanics drive the ending observation (flamingo consideration, riot of flowers). The means is taught early, enacted at every beat, and validated at closure. Early signal, middle use, closure payoff; causal pressure and specificity strong (each object's displacement matters).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is anchored early with sensory detail ("salt-heavy air smelled of mud and nascent blossoms"), provides the spatial frame for her route, and the "bay was still quiet" bookends the ending. The setting supplies emotional tone (quiet, emerging life) but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise reweights mood. Setup and payoff present; development participation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydreamed" opens and closes the piece as a time marker (dawn/twilight transition), but does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions. The timeframe is poetic mood rather than pressure device. Present in setup and payoff; no middle development or cost tied to elapsed time. Lyric bookend without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand why some houses feel alive" is stated in paragraph one and dramatized through her interventions (swapping, placing, observing). The motivation is conflicted: her grandmother's mystical frame versus her emerging social insight. Friction appears when the realization redefines the goal (not waking houses, waking people). Early signal, middle action, closure reweighting with visible cost (loss of mystical frame). Desire drives all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named twice: paragraph three ("hushed blaze of conviction") and final paragraph ("hushed blaze passing from one awakened soul to the next"). The tone is coherent through quiet intensity, modulating from solitary conviction to shared awakening. It charges the final image by recurrence with reweighted meaning (private → communal). Lyric reprise without modulation under peak pressure; static mood elevated by payoff callback.</comment>
