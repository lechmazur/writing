<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is dramatized through his method of investigation and his final speech, with internal clarity about his role. The visions show character-particular details (Jorn reinforcing the line, Mara's grief), but the interiority remains somewhat abstract—"map empathy onto action" reads more as prompt language than embodied thought. Mara and Jorn react credibly but remain largely instrumental to Kael's arc. The final shift in Mara is told ("the rigid anger draining away") rather than shown through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (lighthouse orchard, community accusation) by the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Kael's investigation yields visions that reframe the accusation, leading to a resolved standoff with visible cost (Mara's fear acknowledged, Jorn's secret effort revealed). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community exhales together, the first step toward repair—with felt relational cost. One deduction: the visions arrive conveniently complete without dramatized friction or failed attempts, slightly weakening earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, frost-rimmed apples, and grinding ice floes anchor the setting vividly and pressure the fragile community. The cheval mirror is purpose-driven, enabling Kael's method. Spatial choreography is clear (orchard tableau, lighthouse interior, return to orchard). The setting charges the final image—the sigh pluming in frigid air underscores their shared vulnerability. Minor issue: the vintage store detail feels ornamental; the mirror's age matters less than its function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—community cohesion versus fracture—is signaled immediately and tightens through Kael's investigation to the revelatory speech that reweights the accusation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the visions expose dual fears (Jorn's secrecy, Mara's trauma), narrowing options to truth-telling. The cost is legible: Mara's anger converts to "weary understanding," and the breach begins to heal with a "shuddering sigh." Agency rests with Kael's choice to intervene and speak, though Mara and Jorn remain more reactive than active.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from action: the fragility of trust, the need for hidden truths to surface, and the resonance of past trauma. The broken crystal fragment and fraying rope both recur with shifted meaning—imperfection as a tool, attrition versus malice. The final image (the weighted breath released as a sigh) offers a non-literal answer to the opening question without moralizing. One hairline slip: "map empathy onto action" in the opening paragraph reads slightly thesis-like, though it's absorbed into Kael's dramatized method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Kael is stable and clean. His perceptual signature—calmly intuitive, attuned to objects and emotional undercurrents—is consistent. The dialogue (Kael's revelations, Mara's accusation) is purposeful and advances plot. Minor weaknesses: some phrasing is elevated beyond the immediate stakes ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "the weighted breath still had not been fully expelled"), and Kael's interior occasionally drifts into prompt-echo ("courageous anomaly"). The prose modulates appropriately from tense accusation to quiet resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally strong, but several artifacts cluster: "the weighted breath" appears four times with minor variation, becoming a loop; "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "courageous anomaly" read as inserted labels rather than earned descriptors; "a thing of sharp edges and bitter weight" in the opening is stock elevated diction. Filter verbs ("felt the familiar pull," "felt cool and smooth") slightly dull immediacy in key beats. The visions are told cleanly, and the final image lands with clarity, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard setting above ice floes offers fresh imagery, and the scrying-via-mirror method is a purposeful twist on investigator tropes. The emotional turn—revealing dual misunderstandings rooted in shared vulnerability—avoids cliché. However, the peacekeeper-solves-accusation frame is familiar, and the resolution feels somewhat tidy: Kael's visions arrive complete and uncontested, and both parties accept his account without friction. The story commits to its premise but doesn't fully transform the template through risk or complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael ("shadow-laced peacekeeper") drives the investigation and delivers the revelatory speech that reframes the accusation, creating the story's key turn. His choices—entering the lighthouse, using the fragment, speaking truth—are causally active across three beats. The final image (standing between them, releasing the weighted breath) directly depends on his agency. Strong integration; only a hairline below indispensable because the "shadow-laced" modifier reads ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in three beats: drawn from the pouch, held against the mirror to enable visions, and implicitly present during the closing speech. Its imperfection ("an imperfect key for an imperfect world") charges the thematic resonance. Removing it would require a different scrying mechanism and lose the motif of brokenness-as-function. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; scores just below indispensable because the object could theoretically be swapped for another fractured tool with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is told once in narration ("He was a courageous anomaly, the only one who could walk these shadowed paths") but not dramatized as a unique constraint or tradeoff. Kael's role as the sole truth-finder shapes the plot, but the phrasing itself reads as a prompt label rather than an earned descriptor tied to visible cost. The concept's thematic presence is clear; its causal pressure on tactics is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" governs Kael's method: he trusts his sense to select the right mirror and allows his consciousness to drift without command. This trait enables the central investigation and constrains his approach—he must be receptive, not forceful. The tradeoff (vulnerability, dependence on the visions' clarity) is implied but not dramatized on the page as a visible cost. Strong development across two beats (mirror selection, scrying), moderate closure linkage (the intuition delivers the answer), but cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" defines the visions: Kael does not predict the future but reconstructs the fractured past (Jorn reinforcing the line, the rope snapping, Mara's grief). This action drives the plot's major turn and provides the evidence for his closing speech. Removing or replacing it would break the story's logic. The method is foregrounded and specific; cost is implicit (the visions could fail, but they don't). Near-indispensable due to strong causal necessity and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (glimpses via vintage store mirrors) is signaled early, shapes Kael's investigation in the lighthouse, and delivers the visions that reframe the conflict. The cheval mirror's clouded glass and carved frame are functional, not decorative. The mechanics matter: Kael holds the fragment against the mirror and drifts to receive images. Removing this exact method would require a different scrying apparatus and lose the thematic link to salvaged, imperfect objects. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes anchors the setting and underscores the community's fragility. The location matters: the orchard is the site of accusation and resolution, the lighthouse interior houses the mirror. The ice below supplies atmospheric pressure but does not constrain tactics on the page. The final sigh "plumed in the frigid air" reprises the cold, charging the image. Solid thematic and atmospheric integration; moderate causal pressure (the setting enables but does not force choices).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" frames the entire story's temporal window and tightens urgency: the community is poised on the edge of fracture. Time is tracked explicitly ("two nights prior," "last winter") within the visions and implicitly in the orchard standoff. The timeframe shapes Kael's decision to intervene immediately and structures the final exhale as the moment of release. Strong setup and payoff; the breath is mentioned four times, building to the closing sigh.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to map empathy onto action") drives every beat: he cannot declare a verdict but must find a shared truth. This desire is dramatized through his investigation and speech, with visible cost (he must shoulder the community's pain and risk being wrong). The phrasing in the opening paragraph reads slightly prompt-like, but the motivation is embodied in his choices and the story's resolution depends on it. Strong causal integration and closure participation.</comment>
