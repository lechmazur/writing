<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to become visible to those who need you") is legible and embodied in his methodical work and the final placement of the tape. His particular sensitivity creates a concrete capability. However, Anya remains more sketch than person—her grief is told ("mask of grief and academic ruin") rather than shown through micro-choices, and Elias's interior relies on somewhat generic phrasing ("quiet click of satisfaction"). The change at closure (he has "been found") reads more as theme fulfillment than costly alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (library, dawn, power outage, Elias). The causal chain is legible: outage wipes archives → Elias finds fragment → he places it for Anya → she discovers it with hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias achieves his purpose of being "found," not seen), and the cost is present but muted—he retreats into shadow, his work complete. The ending crystallizes his liminal existence with visible satisfaction, meeting the RR bar under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library's architecture (pipe chases, ventilation shafts, oak table) directly enables Elias's agency and the discovery beat. Sensory detail ("sapphire hush," "strobing movements," "colossal shelves") is vivid and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is clean: grate behind Modern History stacks, service panel beneath the table, high ventilation grate for observation. The setting meaningfully constrains choices (where he can move unseen) and charges the final image (Anya in the "empty, silent room").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake: restore a lost family history. The outage creates urgency, and Elias's decision to place the tape on Anya's laptop is a tightening that narrows options (visibility risk vs. inaction). The fragment's charged energy differentiates it from prior finds, raising stakes. Anya's hope at the end reweights the opening defeat. However, Elias himself faces minimal cost—his work succeeds without complication, and no antagonist or credible obstacle tests his commitment; the turn is one-directional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation of memory, invisibility as service) emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The tape as last surviving record and Elias's retreat after the gift avoid overt moralizing. The final image ("he had not been seen, but he had been found") offers a non-literal answer to the visibility question. Slight penalty: "sapphire hush" recurs as a motif without evolving, and the closing gratitude beat ("profound and bewildered gratitude") edges toward tidy emotional resolution rather than lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (he "feels" information echoes, navigates by "innate knowledge"). Prose modulates effectively from methodical opening to charged discovery to quiet satisfaction. Diction ("liminal," "archaeology," "phantom hand") fits his contemplative interiority. No dialogue present to test, and no head-hopping. Slight filter-verb density in peak beats ("he felt the ghost," "he saw her eyes widen") dulls immediacy but does not obscure; elision (skipping Elias's full retrieval process) is purposeful and efficient.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm are strong ("This was his time, the liminal space..."). Information density is high (outage context, Elias's ability, fragment backstory folded efficiently). Minor issues: "quiet click of satisfaction" and "sapphire hush" recur without reweighting; "a patient archaeology of the building's hidden skeleton" is slightly elevated for the beat. One paraphrase loop: "nestled in a bed of desiccated silverfish and grit" and "tiny piece of obsolete technology" restate the fragment's fragility. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination of crawl-space dweller + sense memory + tape fragment is fresh and purposefully integrated. Elias as invisible mender offers a non-obvious angle on library/archive stories. Slight derivative note: the "hidden helper restores lost treasure" frame is familiar, and the ending's tidy emotional payoff (Anya's hope, Elias's satisfaction) does not fully transform it. The specificity of ferromagnetic tape and oral-history context lifts the piece above template, but the arc follows predictable helper-rewarded logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is on-page throughout and makes the key choice to place the tape, altering Anya's options. His dwelling in crawl spaces enables discovery and delivery, shaping two beats (retrieval, placement). Not higher: his decision faces no friction or cost; competence is uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tape fragment appears in discovery beat (nestled in grate), is handled and examined (Elias feels its "frantic energy"), and is placed with label visible, driving Anya's recognition. It returns with reweighted meaning (from hidden relic to restored lineage). Present in closure image. The label "NANA, 1988" is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sense memory is signaled early ("acute sense memory") and differentiates this fragment from prior finds, shaping Elias's choice to act. It enables the inciting pressure (feeling the young woman's voice). Not higher: the mechanism itself doesn't constrain later tactics or reappear at closure; it functions primarily as setup.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is shown in the opening (gloved fingers, patient work) and in the careful placement of the tape (label facing up). It characterizes his approach but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—methodical competence succeeds without trade-off. Moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cache" is mentioned as Elias's usual practice (lead-lined box in sub-basement) to contextualize why this fragment is different. It does not drive a turn or choice on the page; the key action is placement, not caching. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled in the opening (rusted grate, ventilation shaft) and enables the discovery beat. The method (navigating labyrinthine passages, emerging from service panel) shapes two beats and feeds into his invisibility at closure. Specificity (pipe chases, grates) matters. Not indispensable: a different hidden route would work structurally.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The library at dawn provides the temporal window (between watchman and librarian), the flickering lights strobe Elias's movements at the climax, and the setting's architecture (table, grate, arched windows) directly enables and choreographs action. The "empty, silent room" charges Anya's gratitude at closure. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The outage wipes the archives (inciting pressure) and the flickering lights heighten the placement beat ("lights flickered violently, strobing his movements"). Time pressure is implied (dawn arrival) but not actively tracked or tightened. Functional causal role, moderate closure link (dawn's light as Anya arrives).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" is dramatized in Elias's choice to place the tape and his observation of Anya's reaction. It drives the key turn and is reweighted at closure ("he had not been seen, but he had been found"). Slight friction: the motivation is stated explicitly mid-story, lowering subtext; the cost is minimal (retreat), not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in the opening and closing, framing the tone and modulating with the flickering lights. It supports the liminal, quiet atmosphere and charges the final image as "his only witness." Not higher: the tone is static (serene throughout) rather than shifting under pressure, and the phrase recurs without evolving meaning.</comment>
