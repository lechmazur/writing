<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is consistently embodied through the "wild animal clawing at her ribs" motif and her relationship with impatience. Her contradiction—yearning to smash instruments while forcing herself to watch—operates simultaneously in scene. The final moment where "the frantic clawing in her chest finally still" earns the transformation through months of charted waiting. Minor weakness: the vigilant horizon mapper role feels more decorative than constraining until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Kaelen at window, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct visible. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through celestial tracking and holds through the density increase at closure when the viaduct's hum vanishes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to victory): the patient revolution succeeds, impatience sculpted into "serene and terrible shape of victory," with the conceptual cost of generations of waiting made undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scrying bowl trembles and the resonant frequency creates the vulnerability window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, wet viaduct surface, and basalt sanctuary are anchored early and integrated. The viaduct's post-rain surface is critical to the plan's mechanics: "magnetic viaduct after rain was a different beast, its surface mirroring the sky with unnerving fidelity." The scrying bowl's obsidian and deep-aquifer water constrain the method. The setting charges the final image when the viaduct's lights die and "profound quiet of the frozen lake" replaces the oppressive hum. Micro-setting (bowl, window scratch, brass scope) functions as toolkit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: sever the Authority's control at the moment of gravitational weakness. One meaningful tightening when the scrying bowl trembles and Kaelen sends the coded pulse—protagonist agency drives the turn. The cost is legible: generations of patient waiting and the risk of acting on a single calculated moment. The wild impatience versus disciplined observation creates internal pressure throughout. Minor limit: the resistance cell's success happens off-page, diluting the immediate price Kaelen pays beyond the emotional closure of her internal struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the frozen lake as stasis, moon paths as meticulous rebellion, scrying bowl as patient observation. "To sculpt patience from impatience itself" is dramatized through the clawing animal metaphor and Kaelen's restraint at instruments. The ending offers resonant answer without moralizing: patience defeats technological arrogance through celestial mechanics the Authority never accounted for. The "serene and terrible shape of victory" reweights the opening's "wild animal" image without explicit thesis statement. The piece commits fully to its premise of generational rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV stays stable throughout with distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen's technical precision ("hairline scratch on her windowpane," "chronometer ticked softly") layered with poetic restraint ("silver thread of the primary moon"). Register occasionally elevates beyond focalization—"a yoke on the city," "clockwork engine of liberation"—but remains mostly character-apt for someone trained in celestial observation. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close bodily sensation ("wild animal clawing at her ribs") to wider tactical awareness. The final "frantic drum against her ribs" echoes opening imagery with earned closure modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines with good propulsion. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "Her impatience was a wild animal clawing at her ribs, an old fury she was learning to tame" immediately followed by clarification of "her true motivation"; "The wildness inside her yearned to smash the instruments" restates the earlier wild animal concept; "This feeling was the true enemy" over-explains. The phrase "the entire tone of their uprising" breaks fourth wall with meta-commentary. Filter-verb reliance in places ("she saw," "she watched") when immediacy would serve better. Metaphor density high but mostly coherent; "a spine of black iron" for viaduct works visually.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of patient rebellion through celestial mechanics offers a fresh angle on resistance narratives, avoiding both hot warfare and pure passivity. The specific detail of post-rain viaduct surface creating resonant frequency is inventive and grounded. The scrying bowl as ancient technology paired with modern magnetic infrastructure feels earned rather than ornamental. Risk: the multi-generational patience framework and ending victory could feel tidy, but the "serene and terrible shape" language acknowledges complexity. Transformation test passes—moon-path vulnerability is specific to this world's rules.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kaelen as "vigilant horizon mapper" frames the opening and her observational role. She makes the key decision to send the coded pulse at the convergence moment, driving the climax. The title feels somewhat decorative—"mapper" work shown mainly as moon-tracking—but her choice to act (versus continuing to wait) creates the turn. Present in setup, middle calculation work, and closure action. Causal but could be replaced with "astronomer" or "watcher" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in setup as oppressive infrastructure, returns in middle as calculation target whose post-rain surface is mechanically critical ("mirroring the sky with unnerving fidelity"), and provides the closure beat when its lights flicker and die. Its specific state (wet after rain) enables the resonant frequency that creates vulnerability. The "guiding lights flickered once, twice, and then died" moment is the visible victory marker. Removing this exact object would break the plot's mechanism and the symbolic yoke-release.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" shapes every tactic on the page: Kaelen's restraint against smashing instruments, the months-long moon charting, the generational planning via stolen schematics, the "slow, meticulous rebellion planned across generations." It contrasts directly with "earlier, hotter rebellions" that failed. The method (waiting for gravitational convergence) embodies patience as strategy rather than theme statement. The stakes are defined by this concept—no clarion calls, only precise severing. Causal and present throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears once in "Her movements were softly purposeful as she adjusted the polished obsidian scrying bowl." The attribute describes her physical approach but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost or return meaningfully. It's descriptive label rather than driver. Present in one beat, no development, minimal closure connection beyond general tone. Functional but swappable with "deliberate" or "careful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is the mission's literal and symbolic action, present from the viaduct description as "yoke on the city" through to the signal: "The action was simple: unyoke." It defines what the resistance cell must do at the vulnerability moment. The final image—viaduct lights dying, oppressive hum vanishing—dramatizes successful unyoking. Removing this specific action language would require fundamental rewrite of stakes and closure vocabulary. Essential to premise and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moon-path tracking is established in setup ("For months, since the first frost spiderwebbed across the water, she had charted the celestial dance"), drives the middle beats (cross-referencing Lyra's position with tidal lock schematics), and provides the exact mechanism at closure when "moon's light, focused by atmospheric moisture and reflected by the viaduct's wet surface, created a resonant frequency." The method's mechanics—gravitational pull, atmospheric conditions, reflection—matter causally. The Authority's failure to account for celestial mechanics is the exploited weakness. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary provides the observation post anchored early with window view of viaduct and lake. The cold air ("her breath a plume of white") and the final moment when she "leaned her forehead against the cold basalt" bookend the scene. The frozen lake signals the necessary stillness for alignment and returns as "profound quiet" at closure when the hum dies. The setting supplies the vantage and tools (window scratch as celestial marker) that enable the method. Removing it would require spatial restructure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake freezes over" is signaled as "the final sign, the world locking into the necessary stillness for the alignment." It creates the condition for tonight's convergence. However, once established, time doesn't tighten decisions beat-by-beat—the chronometer ticks but doesn't narrow a closing window on the page. The months of prior tracking are summarized. Present in setup and closure logic but doesn't actively pressure choices within the dramatized scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's desire "to sculpt patience from impatience itself" is established early and dramatized through contradictory impulses: "The wildness inside her yearned to smash the instruments" versus "She steadied her hand." The impatience is embodied as "wild animal clawing at her ribs" and creates internal friction throughout. At closure, "the frantic clawing in her chest finally still, her impatience at last sculpted into the serene and terrible shape of victory" shows the transformation with cost (generations of restraint). Friction between want (immediate action) and method (patient waiting) drives her struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is consistently "restrained wildness": the wild animal metaphor controlled by discipline, "coiled spring of immense power held in check by decades of waiting," urgency constrained by meticulous calculation. It modulates at closure when "the wild animal finally tasting the air" and "serene and terrible shape of victory" fuse restraint with release. The atmospheric descriptions (cold air, profound quiet, wet sheen, dark mirror) support the tone. Occasional register elevation ("achingly simple," "unnerving fidelity") pushes slightly purple but mostly coheres. The tone charges the final stillness after the hum vanishes.</comment>
