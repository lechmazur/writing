<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction—performing lightness while carrying guilt over Mara's fate—is embodied through the theatrical narration and private whittling. The motivation is concrete: survival through curated absurdity, with moral ambiguity anchored in his passivity during Mara's arrest. The final act of nesting the bird in the bouquet feels earned, closing a circuit between performance and genuine grief. Minor: the "morally ambiguous" framing is slightly over-articulated in the direct authorial aside, but the choice itself carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias carves a space for feeling through methodical ritual, and the final image—bird nestled in dried flowers—reweights the opening performance with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (the remade hush, a pocket of forbidden sorrow). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered actions (tea, narration, whittling) that converge in the charged final tableau. The single-scene design with clear who/where/when anchoring and one meaningful deepening (from performance to private act to integration) fits scope. Cost is legible: he has cultivated lightness, but it is "not happiness," and the price is isolation within a state that forbids his grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The farmhouse kitchen, turbine thrum, and dried bouquet function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the noise is a "monstrous, uncaring heart," the table a stage for private rebellion. The wood shavings and ceramic mug are handled in ways that reveal character priorities (performance vs. privacy). The turbines' indifference charges the final image. Slightly short of 8.5+ because the setting's role is atmospheric and symbolic more than it directly alters a tactical choice, but it does supply the spatial and sensory frame for the entire arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in forbidden grief—is signaled early and tightened once: the shift from theatrical narration (public mask) to silent whittling (private rebellion) narrows options and deepens interiority. The final act of placing the bird reweights the performance, closing the loop with visible cost (a shrine to silence, not joy). Agency is renunciation and endurance; no antagonist on the page, but the happiness mandate and Mara's memory supply coherent pressure. One beat short of 8.5+ because the escalation is more a deepening than a reversal that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as contraband, the remade hush as survival—emerges from the tea ritual, whittling, and final tableau without direct statement. The wooden bird's placement in the bouquet offers a resonant, non-literal answer: lightness cultivated from sorrow, "enough" but not happiness. Subtext operates in gesture (the bird's cocked head, "listening for a song that was no longer there") and the contrast between public performance and private carving. The moral ambiguity (tending his sorrow while Mara faced consequences) adds genuine complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Elias; perceptual signature is character-specific (turbines as heartbeat, dust motes as audience). The theatrical narration is distinct from the silent whittling, and the final line's flat delivery ("The songbird has found its silent grove") shifts tone to mark closure. No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from performed grandiosity to stripped sincerity. Minor: "worthy of the coming ritual" and "sacred sachet" edge toward self-conscious diction, but the effect is voice-motivated and legible as Elias's deliberate performance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: each line advances either the ritual, the internal state, or the thematic charge. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during whittling, longer cadences for narration). One minor loop: "hot and cleansing" and "awakening the sleeping spirit" slightly over-embellish the tea moment with adjacent figurative language, though the pattern is taught as Elias's performance mode. The final paragraph is clean and propulsive. No scaffold or template cadence; prose is controlled and specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia risks familiarity, but the piece transforms it through specificity: the theatrical narration of mundane tasks as survival strategy, the turbines as soundscape, and the wooden bird as closure image. The moral ambiguity (survivor guilt over Mara) adds a non-obvious angle. The whittling-as-rebellion and the final nesting action feel earned rather than convenient. Slightly derivative premise tempered by committed execution and fresh synthesis of performance, grief, and small-scale resistance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias ("blank-faced performer") is present throughout; his choices—performing the tea ritual, shifting to silent whittling, nesting the bird—create the story's key turns and drive closure. Early signal (opening paragraph), middle development (whittling as private act), and payoff (placing the bird) all present. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Swappability is low: the performance mask is specific to the happiness mandate and his survival strategy.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears in beat one (on the table, described as Mara's), recurs implicitly during whittling (the "skeletal forest" image), and is the final closure image (bird nested within). Three beats, early signal, closure linkage, and charged reprise that reweights the opening description. High irreplaceability: removing it would break the Mara connection and the final shrine image. Visible cost tied to the element (grief made tangible).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is signaled early ("to cultivate lightness in grief, to find a pocket of air") and shapes stakes: the silence he builds is "not of emptiness, but of deliberate peace." It constrains tactics (performance vs. private carving) and charges the final image ("a shrine to a remade hush"). Present in all three gates. Slightly abstract as a concept, but the closing line grounds it in the tableau. Mid-high band because it is more thematic frame than a concrete constraint, though it does alter his approach to grief.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Morally ambiguous" is present: Elias tends his own sorrow while Mara faced consequences; he watched with a frozen mask. The trait is dramatized in the middle paragraph ("Was this lightness for him, or a penance for her?") and enables his survival at visible cost (guilt, isolation). Setup and development present; payoff is implicit in the final acceptance ("enough"). One key beat and cost connection, but the attribute is slightly told rather than enacted in a high-pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Whittle" is the story's central action: introduced early (whittling block and knife), drives the middle turn (shift from performance to private rebellion), and produces the closure object (the bird). Three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (removing whittling removes the bird and the private/public divide). Visible cost: "carving away the noise, the guilt." Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is signaled immediately (opening line: "our hero procures the vessel"), used across three beats (mug, tea bag, water), and its cessation marks the middle turn ("He didn't narrate this part. This action was too private for the stage"). The method shapes attempts (performance as shield) and its abandonment deepens the arc. Final line's flat delivery ("The songbird has found its silent grove") completes the shift from theatricality to sincerity. High causal pressure, closure participation, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines are present throughout; turbines supply atmospheric pressure ("monstrous, uncaring heart") and frame the final image ("the turbines turned, indifferent and eternal, but here..."). Setup and payoff present; middle development is weaker (turbines are backdrop more than constraint). The setting charges the closure but does not alter a tactical choice. Lyric reprise elevates it into mid-band, but swappability is moderate (another oppressive soundscape could function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the happiness mandate" is signaled early (paragraph one: "in the time after the happiness mandate") and shapes stakes throughout: grief is contraband, his blank face is survival, Mara was taken for weeping. Present in setup and development; payoff is implicit in the final acceptance of a grief-shrine. The timeframe enables his moral ambiguity and constrains his public behavior. Two beats, early signal, and causal pressure. Cost is visible (isolation, guilt). Slightly abstract as a time-frame but integrated into the world logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is the story's explicit motivation (stated in paragraph one), dramatized through the tea ritual and whittling, and resolved in the final image ("a sliver of lightness had finally been cultivated"). Three beats, early signal, and closure linkage. The friction between performance and private sorrow creates cost. High causal pressure and specificity. The motivation is slightly over-articulated in the opening, but it drives all choices and the ending reweights it ("not happiness, but...enough").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Emotional void" (tone) is coherent throughout: Elias's "careful, curated blank" face, the "suffocating silence," the flat final line. Tone modulates with pressure (grandiose narration → silent whittling → stripped declaration) and charges the final image. Present in all three gates. The void is maintained even in the ending's small victory, avoiding sentimental uplift. High coherence and closure participation. Slightly less indispensable than other elements because the tone is a product of character and situation rather than a constraint in itself.</comment>
