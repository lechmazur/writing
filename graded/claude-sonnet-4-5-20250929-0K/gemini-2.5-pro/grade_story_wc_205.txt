<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior life is vivid and contradictory—"defunct revolutionary" fighting "hushed archives and dusty debating halls" with embodied sorrow ("burnished") anchors characterization. The micro-choice to expose only the shard during the storm reflects his hierarchy of values, and the final smile ("sad, determined") lands contradictory impulses without resolution. Motivation escalates cleanly from academic dispute to existential restitution, earning the shift from defeated to rekindled. Minor: the woman's hands and old man's weeping in the shard feel slightly distant from Kaelen's present agency; the vision informs but does not force a renunciation or visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Kaelen, Asteroid Adagio, post-Unraveling). Causal lens dominates: the temporal squall triggers the covering ritual, which isolates the shard, whose glow delivers the vision that reweights Kaelen's thesis and rekindles his resolve. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the shard becomes "the cornerstone of a lost people's dignity," reconfiguring the academic war into an existential resurrection with felt cost ("the old fire, banked but not extinguished"). Cost is conceptual and relational—Valerius will resist, the fight continues—but undeniable in the final image. One minor gap: the mechanics of how the shard "absorbs" visible time rather than reflects it are asserted without prior anchoring in world rules, creating a brief causality hiccup that does not break closure but slightly loosens the causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid—"chiseled spires," "gilded filigree," "obsidian tabletop"—saturates every beat and directly enables the climax: reflective surfaces everywhere necessitate the covering ritual, isolating the shard for the reveal. Temporal squall mechanics (visible time lapping at the present) anchor the speculative premise and constrain Kaelen's action. The shard itself functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when it glows and delivers the vision. Sensory detail is POV-filtered ("frozen light," "edges sharp enough to draw blood or a memory") and the baroque excess thematically mirrors the First Ones' "frantic, beautiful attempt to build a dam of art." Gate test satisfied: environment shapes the peak choice and the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rehabilitating the First Ones from "decadent tyrants" to "poets"—is signaled early and tightens when the storm arrives, forcing Kaelen to rely on the shard alone. The vision narrows his rhetorical options (no more abstraction; he must "translate the shard's silent poetry into the cold language of academic proof") and charges his resolve with visible cost: "Valerius would call it fantasy," and "the fight was far from over." Agency is clear in the decision to cover mirrors and expose the shard, then to commit to a new thesis despite inevitable resistance. One deduction: the escalation is more deepening than reversing—no live setback tests commitment mid-scene—and the storm's arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than driven by Kaelen's prior choice, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—art as defiance against oblivion, the soul rescued through reinterpretation—emerges organically from the shard's vision (hands arranging petals, weeping at beauty) without thesis statement. The baroque excess motif recurs with escalating meaning: decorative at opening, then dangerous (mirrors must be covered), finally redemptive ("a dam of art against the coming tide"). Kaelen's shift from "failed idealist" to renewed warrior enacts the theme without moralizing: "a revolution did not always require a gun; sometimes, it only required a story potent enough to supplant an old one." Final image—holding "the cornerstone of a lost people's dignity"—reweights the academic dispute as existential restoration, resonant and non-literal. No Thematic Echo penalty; the climax dramatizes rather than declares.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "burnished sorrow," "caesura in a line of forgotten verse," "the past grew loud." Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen filters everything through his poetic/revolutionary lens. One minor slip: "his breath fogging the air" reads slightly generic for the heightened register established elsewhere, and "frozen light" in the shard description borders on stock metaphor. No dialogue on the page; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short beats during the storm, longer reflection after). Reaches high band but a few decorative phrases ("museum of a world," "chorus of ghosts") lean toward stock lyricism without fresh turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled: "sliver of frozen light," "dam of art," "chorus of ghosts." Minor overwriting in the opening third: "a city carved from a dream of baroque excess" and "death rattle of a society choking on its own vanity" stack metaphors without tight integration. "Burnished sorrow" (a sound descriptor applied to an emotion) and "pearlescent light" (stock modifier) trend decorative. Storm climax is propulsive and clear. Final paragraph delivers high density without opacity. Elevated diction fits POV throughout. Small deduction for figurative density in non-peak beats; −0.3 applied within band per the Overwriting Check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—archaeological dispute resolved via temporal-storm artifact—synthesizes speculative setting with intimate academic stakes in a non-obvious way. The twist that baroque excess signals desperation rather than decadence offers a fresh moral calculus. Kaelen as "defunct revolutionary" turned archivist personalizes the trope. Minor: the temporal squall and visible-time mechanic, while vivid, echo established SFF conceits (the Strugatskys, Miéville) without radical transformation. The shard-as-revelation beat is earned but not structurally surprising. Risk-taking is moderate: the quiet, introspective frame and the choice to foreground interpretive conflict over action elevate the material. No derivative-premise penalty; transformation through specificity (the vase shard, the mirror-covering ritual, the weeping old man) anchors freshness. +0.2 within band for tonal commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's identity as defunct revolutionary frames his motivation ("his war for a republic of reason lost decades ago") and his shift from "failed idealist" to renewed warrior drives the ending. The shard-vision choice is his; the final commitment to "resurrect an old one from its undeserved grave" closes the arc. Early signal (paragraph one), middle beat (covering mirrors as tactical choice under old discipline), closure participation (rekindled fire). Cost: accepting prolonged conflict with Valerius, risking ridicule. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in beat one (on desk), beat two (left exposed during storm), beat three (glows and delivers vision), and beat four (held as "cornerstone"). Its unique property—absorbing rather than reflecting visible time—is load-bearing for the climax and cannot be swapped. Shapes Kaelen's micro-choice (expose it alone) and charges the final image. Early signal, middle mechanics, closure linkage, high specificity, visible cost (it is his only proof). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (Valerius's "sterile data" vs. Kaelen's "poets" thesis) is the dominant stake, signaled early and reweighted at closure when the shard delivers evidence. It narrows Kaelen's rhetorical options ("translate the shard's silent poetry into the cold language of academic proof") and drives his final commitment. Not merely thematic—it creates the tactical problem (needing proof) the storm and shard solve. Early, middle (Valerius is named obstacle), closure (new thesis formed). Causal pressure and cost clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is demonstrated on the page: Kaelen sees "caesura in a line of forgotten verse" where Valerius sees "geometric deviance," and he seeks to "grant them the grace in death." This perceptual bias enables his interpretation of the shard's vision (hands arranging flowers, weeping at beauty) and constrains his next move (must "translate...silent poetry into...academic proof"). Early signal, middle shaping (his lens interprets the vision), closure payoff (thesis of art vs. oblivion). Tradeoff: his poetic reading will be dismissed as "fantasy" by Valerius. Causal and felt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly in the climax: "He would have to devise a way to present this, to translate the shard's silent poetry into the cold language of academic proof." It defines his next move and the story's conceptual turn (interpretation as revolution), but occurs late (final third) and is framed as future intention rather than on-page execution. It redefines options (from despair to strategy) and charges the ending, but the mechanics are not dramatized. Late arrival (−0.5), closure participation (+1.2), causal linkage (+0.8), but summary-only (−0.4). Functional but not fully weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Covering mirrors is signaled early ("the local method"), executed in beat two (draping velvet over mirrors, samovar, desk), and its mechanics matter: isolating the shard by removing competing reflective surfaces enables the vision. The ritual demonstrates Kaelen's discipline and prior learning ("the hard way"). Early signal, middle execution, closure enabling (shard alone glows). Specificity moderate (the method is cultural but not unique to Kaelen). Cost indirect (the labor and prior failure implied). Functional across beats but not irreplaceable—alternate isolation could work with edits. Two beats, causal role, but mid-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid—gilded filigree, obsidian surfaces, chiseled spires—is present in every beat and causally essential: reflective surfaces everywhere force the covering ritual, the temporal squall is system-specific ("unique to the system since the Great Unraveling"), and the shard's baroque cut (vs. "geometric deviance") encodes the First Ones' aesthetic. The setting is both macro (city) and micro (desk, window, mirrors). Early signal, middle constraint (mirrors must be covered), closure charge (baroque excess reinterpreted as art-dam). High specificity and irreplaceability. Cost: the environment's beauty is also its danger.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after time becomes visible"—is signaled early, anchors the world rules (temporal squalls, visible currents), and enables the climax: the storm makes the past "grow loud," and the shard absorbs time to deliver the vision. The mechanics are specific (time as "pearlescent light," past moments flickering), and the phenomenon is load-bearing for Kaelen's proof. Early signal, middle event (storm breaks), closure participation (past revealed). High causal pressure and specificity. Not a ticking clock but a recurring condition that shapes this tactical window. Cost: storms threaten sanity (mirrors reflect alternate selves).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation—"to reimagine an entire civilization, to grant them the grace in death"—is stated early, dramatized in his micro-choice (expose the shard), tested by the vision (hands arranging flowers, weeping at beauty), and crystallized at closure: "resurrect an old one from its undeserved grave." The desire conflicts with likely cost (Valerius's ridicule, prolonged fight) and drives all beats. Early signal, middle choice (ritual prioritizes this goal), closure crystallization. Friction between want (restitution) and cost (endless war) is felt. High causal role and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone—"burnished sorrow"—saturates the piece: "a sound of burnished sorrow" (explicit), "the silence feeling heavier," "sad, determined smile," "the old fire, banked but not extinguished." It modulates under pressure (heavier during storm, rekindled at closure) without breaking into triumph or despair. The tone charges the final image (sorrow + determination = "the fight was far from over") and coheres with Kaelen's identity (defeated but unbroken). Early signal, middle consistency, closure charge. Specificity high ("burnished" as both metal and emotional texture). Not static; it deepens rather than oscillates.</comment>
