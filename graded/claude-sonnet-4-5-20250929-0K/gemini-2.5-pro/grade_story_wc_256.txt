<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and his patience is demonstrated through specific action—building the apparatus, questioning assumptions. However, the character remains somewhat abstract; his emotions are labeled ("overwhelmed with discovery") rather than fully embodied, and we lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to tune the bell "not to a frequency of hertz, but to a pattern of photons" feels intellectually motivated but emotionally underdeveloped. His predecessor exists only as exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elian's pilgrimage through archived data builds pressure through discovery rather than external opposition. Orientation is solid (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The closure—the bell glowing rather than ringing—functions as Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: Elian's entire methodology had to shift from auditory to visual, and the "artificial pilgrimage" reaches its end. The lens holds, and the cost is legible in his renunciation of sound-based restoration. One minor slip: the phrase "artificial pilgrimage at its end" tells rather than shows the closure's weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly rendered ("scent of ozone and dust," "shafts of light"), and the carillon's semi-circle of crystal bells provides spatial grounding. The miner's lens constrains the climactic choice—without its specific refractive properties, the solution fails. However, the setting doesn't evolve; the "golden shadows" remain static decoration until the final glow. The "unstable times" and "power grid stabilization" are gestured at but never pressure the present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the final bell's frequency of connection—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elian's weeks of failure force him to question his assumptions, leading to the apparatus-building turn. The climax lands with visible cost: he abandons sound for light, a methodological renunciation that redefines his work. However, there's no antagonist or meaningful external opposition; the conflict is entirely internal and intellectual, which limits urgency. The "smooth, unbreachable wall" metaphor tells rather than dramatizes the impasse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the premise: connection as a visual, tangible pattern rather than sound. The miner's lens—a tool from "deep, dark places"—gains thematic weight through its transformation from relic to key. The final image ("not a sound, but a light") reweights the entire endeavor without moralizing. The phrase "texture of connection was a real, physical thing" nudges into thematic statement but is mostly earned by the hologram's specificity. The recurring "golden shadows" motif shifts from loss to "rediscovered truth," charging the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Elian's perspective controlled throughout. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("reverence usually reserved for tombs," "silent canyons of archived data") that fits the quasi-mystical premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("deep need to discover the texture of connection") without grounding in Elian's specific lexicon. The phrase "powerfully gentle strength" is told rather than enacted until the apparatus work. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong verbs ("coax," "transmuted," "blossomed"), but several lines suffer from abstraction: "artificial pilgrimage" repeats without adding pressure, "golden shadows" becomes a refrain rather than evolving image, and "texture of connection" is asserted three times. The phrase "propel this wave, to give it purpose beyond simple vibration" stacks near-synonyms. Template cadence appears in the apparatus sequence: "He mounted... He wasn't trying... He felt..." Information density is high in the climax but thins during the opening reflection. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but figurative language ("cascades of faint, colored light") clusters without clear payoff until the end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—restoring lost frequencies through visual means—offers a fresh angle on "lost knowledge" tropes. The miner's lens as the pivot object is specific and non-obvious; the clue "To see the echo" earns its revelation. However, the "last practitioner" frame and "laboratory of lost sounds" lean on familiar post-collapse beats. The transformation from sound to light is conceptually elegant but lacks embodied struggle; Elian's realization arrives smoothly rather than through visible failure and friction. The emotional arc feels more intellectual than human.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his decision to question assumptions drives the key turn. He builds the apparatus, runs sequences, and makes the final tuning adjustment. However, much of his "work" is summarized ("For weeks, Elian had treated the lens as a mere artifact") rather than dramatized. His choices at closure—tuning the bell to photons—feel more conceptual than viscerally enacted. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes two beats (questioning assumptions, building apparatus); causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong; but lacks a visible cost tied specifically to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears early with the cryptic clue, is physically handled when Elian mounts it in the apparatus, and becomes the pivot that transmutes sound to light at closure. It's irreplaceable—no generic lens would carry the etched history or the thematic weight of "deep, dark places." The lens enables the solution and charges the ending image. Present in setup (yellowed tag), middle (mounting), and ending (hologram creation); drives two beats; high causal pressure; strong closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability (any refractive object might work, but the miner's lens adds thematic resonance); no visible cost tied to the lens itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named early and frames Elian's journey through archived data. It shapes his patient, methodical approach and recurs at closure ("his artificial pilgrimage at its end"). However, the concept functions more as theme than stake-driver; it doesn't constrain his choices or create friction. The "pilgrimage" could be replaced with "quest" or "search" without structural loss. Present in setup and ending; lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly; but lacks middle development and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is named once ("His was a powerfully gentle strength") and illustrated when Elian makes a "final, minute adjustment" with a "powerfully gentle touch." However, this trait doesn't constrain an earlier choice or create visible trade-off; the adjustment itself is described, not dramatized with cost. The attribute appears too late (final third) to shape tactics. Present in ending only; missing setup and middle; no causal pressure or cost; decorative mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Propel" appears explicitly when Elian sends the sine wave "towards the lens. He needed to propel this wave, to give it purpose beyond simple vibration." This action triggers the hologram and the final bell's glow—the story's climax. The verb is specific to the sonic emitter's function and irreplaceable in the physics of the solution. Present in middle and ending; drives the key turn; high causal pressure; strong closure linkage; high irreplaceability; visible cost (methodological shift from hearing to seeing).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is signaled early ("his pilgrimage had stalled," "He had to change his approach") and dramatized: "He began by questioning assumptions that had guided his entire life's work. What if a sound wasn't just something to be heard?" This method enables the apparatus design and the shift from auditory to visual. Present in setup (stalled pilgrimage), middle (the questioning beat), and ending (new methodology); drives two beats; moderate causal pressure; strong closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability (other methods could unlock insight, but this one fits the clue).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is established early with sensory detail (ozone, dust, light) and spatial anchoring (carillon in the center). It provides the apparatus and the controlled environment for the climax. However, the setting doesn't evolve or constrain choices; Elian has unrestricted access and no environmental obstacles. The "laboratory of lost sounds" functions more as atmospheric frame than active pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending; enables the action but doesn't constrain; moderate closure linkage (the golden light fills the lab); low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilized" is mentioned once in the opening as context for the lab's establishment. The timeframe doesn't create urgency, shape tactics, or constrain Elian's work. "For weeks" gestures at duration but remains vague. No live clock, no deadline, no temporal pressure. Present in setup only; missing middle and ending; no causal pressure; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is named as Elian's drive and recurs when he realizes "The texture of connection was a real, physical thing." The motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, but it does shape his persistence through weeks of failure. Present in setup, implied in middle (building apparatus), and endpoint; lyric reprise reweights meaning; moderate causal pressure (sustains effort); strong closure linkage; but lacks friction or visible cost tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening ("tones of golden shadows"), recurs as static descriptor, and transforms at closure into "steady, golden light of rediscovered truth." The tone is coherent—reverent, meditative, slightly archaic—and modulates subtly from loss to fulfillment. The final image charges the motif with meaning. Present in setup, middle (maintained), and ending (reweighted); strong closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability (the specific hue and recurrence matter); no cost but clear tonal shift that supports the ending.</comment>
