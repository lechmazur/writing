<comment>Elias's interior is consistent—his obsession with decoding intentions drives each move—but his emotional arc feels too smooth. The progression from "thrilling proximity" to "birdsong after a storm" clarity lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle; he never doubts his method or wrestles with the cost of his nightly ritual. The final "peace" reads as declared rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His renunciation of going home and his solitary path are mentioned but never tested by conflicting wants.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the tapestry-decoding ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sovereign case shifts from desperate echo to peaceful marker). Orientation anchors promptly (cemetery gardener, silo, twilight). The closure—reuniting case and map on the shelf—lands with conceptual cost (a future never arrived), though the cost is more told than felt in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frayed silver thread snaps the pattern into focus, reweighting the entire mystery.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" and "curved metal skin" create vivid micro-setting that constrains Elias's work (the lantern-lit workspace, felt-lined tray, wooden frame). Spatial choreography is coherent: tools, charts, tapestry, and sovereign case remain tracked across beats. The silo's cool stillness and the final shelf-building act charge the closure image by providing a physical anchor for the reunited intention and path. The setting does more than describe; it shapes the ritual's intimacy and the final gesture's weight.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early and pursued through decoding. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frayed silver thread completes the pattern, narrowing uncertainty to a specific celestial route. The sovereign case's pulse and subsequent stillness provide a felt shift, though the cost (a future that never arrived) is conceptual rather than a visible price Elias pays. No antagonist or major reversal; pressure accumulates through the ritual itself. The resolution feels inevitable but lacks a live trade-off or forfeited path for Elias himself.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—intentions and hope outlasting their bearers—emerges through the tapestry's frayed border and the sovereign case's "anticipation." The final shelf-building image answers the central question (what do echoes hold?) without moralizing, reuniting intention with path in a resonant, non-literal gesture. The weaver's hidden map and the empty vessel charge the closure with quiet specificity. Minor slip: "roots simply needed to be untangled to find their sun" edges toward abstraction, though it's anchored in Elias's role as gardener of memory.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices "velveteen gloom," "lonely gleam," "frayed threads"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("birdsong after a storm," "cherished blanket") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's tenderness ("cobalt dome…held the stars…with tenderness") reads slightly detached from Elias's prior workman focus. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "believed") are voice-motivated and legible. Diction is largely consistent but occasionally tilts poetic without clear urgency shift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid heavy template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance decoding or atmosphere. Minor overwriting in metaphor clusters: "birdsong after a storm," "cherished blanket," "tenderness" in close succession create a slight figurative thicket near closure. One paraphrase loop: "uncharted echoes" recurs in identical phrasing without added pressure. No egregious scaffold or loops elsewhere. The line "a silence that always felt like the chess clock runs down" has a tense hiccup ("runs" should be "running" or "ran"). Propulsion is steady; no momentum stalls.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—decoding a tapestry's frayed border as a cipher of intentions—offers a fresh angle on ghost-story material, transforming the trope through Elias's methodical, non-supernatural approach. The sovereign case as "marker" rather than relic is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The combination of cemetery gardener, celestial map, and intentional decay feels organic and memorable. Minor derivative echo: "gardener of memory" skirts metaphorical convenience, though the shelf-building act grounds it. Risk-taking is moderate; the quiet, accumulative design avoids bold structural moves but commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elias, the "blithe cemetery gardener," appears in setup (locks gates, follows path), middle (decodes tapestry with "surgeon's focus"), and closure (builds shelf, reunites case and map). His choices—concentrating on frayed threads, cross-referencing star charts, separating the silver thread—create the key turn when the pattern snaps into focus. The "blithe" attribute is mentioned once but not tested or constrained by a visible cost. He is essential to the story's logic but his blitheness does not drive a decision with trade-off. Present across beats and causally active, but one trait remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The antique sovereign case appears in setup (on felt-lined tray, "sad, lonely gleam"), middle (its presence fuels obsession, "hum with a presence"), and closure (gives "pulse of warmth," then placed on shelf with honor). It is handled twice: examined initially and physically moved at the end. Its meaning reweights from "hollow promise" to "marker…waiting to be filled," directly shaping the final image. The case drives at least two beats and participates in closure, but its mechanics remain abstract—how it "hummed" or "pulsed" is asserted rather than grounded in causal detail. Strong integration with minor specificity gap.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears in setup ("source of the uncharted echoes that filled the silo") and middle ("the echoes in the air coalesced"), but its mechanics remain vague. The concept does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elias never adjusts his method based on echo behavior. At closure, the echoes are not directly invoked; the case "was still" rather than echoing. The concept frames atmosphere but does not shape stakes or appear in the ending's charge. Present and thematically consistent, but functionally replaceable with "mystery" or "presence" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Tenderly organized" appears in setup ("workspace that was tenderly organized") and is demonstrated through "each tool and chart in its designated place." It enables the decoding ritual by providing order, but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Elias never sacrifices organization or struggles with disorder. The trait reappears implicitly when he "built a small, new shelf," extending his organizing impulse to the closure. Present in setup and implicit in closure, shaping one middle beat (the meticulous cross-referencing), but no trade-off or price tied to this trait specifically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Untangle" appears in setup ("worked to untangle the mystery"), middle (tracing "a sequence of deliberate damage," separating "a frayed silver thread…from a knotted clump"), and closure ("some roots simply needed to be untangled to find their sun"). The action drives the major turn: the silver thread separation snaps the hidden pattern into focus, redefining options from mystery to map. The final metaphor reweights the action thematically. The verb is specific to weaving and essential to the tapestry's logic; swapping it would require structural rewrites. Indispensable across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—appears in setup ("His specific method was to concentrate on decoding frayed threads…where the pattern broke down"), middle (tracing "pulled crimson strand," "trio of broken gold threads," "frayed silver thread"), and closure (the map is in the tapestry's border, now deciphered). The method's mechanics matter: each thread type contributes to the cipher, and the final silver thread completes it. The method shapes attempts (cross-referencing star charts) and defines success. Present early, drives two beats, causally active at closure. Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The "cobalt silo under stars" appears in setup ("stark shape of the cobalt silo under the first stars"), throughout middle (workspace inside, "silo seemed to hold its breath"), and closure ("cobalt dome of the sky"). The silo provides the isolated workspace that enables Elias's ritual and houses the final shelf. The setting constrains by offering privacy and a curved wall for mounting. At closure, the silo's "curved wall" supplies the physical anchor for reuniting case and map. The outdoor stars frame but do not pressure choices. Present across beats, shapes closure image, but substitutable with another isolated structure without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"After the chess clock runs down" appears once in setup as a metaphor for post-closing quiet. The timeframe establishes night but does not tighten decisions—Elias works at his own pace with no urgency or deadline. The phrase is evocative but functionally ornamental; replacing it with "evening" would not alter tactics or stakes. Not present in middle or closure beats. No causal role in escalation or ending. Mentioned but not developed or tracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The motivation—"to discover the shape of intentions left behind"—appears in setup ("His goal was not to speak with a ghost, but something far more delicate"), middle (felt as "frantic hope, the ache of a long-held promise"), and closure (understood as "anticipation…a treasure chest for a future that never arrived"). The desire drives the decoding ritual and the final shelf-building act. Friction exists between the obsession's pull and the solitary cost (he "did not go home"). The motivation is dramatized through choices (concentrating, cross-referencing, separating threads) and charges the ending. Present across beats with visible cost (isolation, nightly labor).</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears in setup ("thick with a velveteen gloom"), middle (implicitly sustained as "cool and still"), and closure ("did not vanish, but…felt less like a shroud and more like a cherished blanket"). The tone is coherent and modulates: oppressive mystery shifts to comforting resolution. The final reweighting charges the image by transforming the same atmosphere. However, the gloom itself does not constrain a choice; it remains descriptive. The tone supports pressure but does not alter tactics. Purposeful reprise with clear shift, but no direct causal role in decisions.</comment>
