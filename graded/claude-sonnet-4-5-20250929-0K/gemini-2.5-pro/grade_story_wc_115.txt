<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's recklessness, sleep-deprived state, and emotional paralysis around "I did nothing" create a coherent interior landscape. The silent kinship with the radio caller and the physical act of turning the valve earn the final realization that he can carry his weight. Minor slip: the "religiously skeptical" trait is asserted but never tested on-page with visible cost. Embodied emotion is strong throughout—rust smell, frigid metal, ragged breathing—anchoring abstract guilt in sensory pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: abandoned tunnel, late-night radio, confession spoken. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): turning the valve quiets the ghosts and lets the protagonist measure his own burden with visible cost (bone-deep exhaustion, the weight still present but now bearable). Causal lens dominates: confession → tunnel exploration → radio parallels → spectral accusation → valve intervention → peace and self-knowledge. One meaningful tightening when the factory shift "focuses directly on me" narrows options and raises the stakes decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel's damp dark, rust smell, oily water, and looming machinery create vivid spatial pressure. The beaded valve wheel—condensation drops, frigid metal, resisting vibration—is the micro-setting anchor that constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: tunnel → cavernous room → submerged floor → central pipe. The setting is not ornamental; the valve's physical resistance mirrors the protagonist's internal battle, and the environment's weight literalizes his search for a "place heavy enough."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the weight of that swallowed truth." One strong tightening when the invisible presence shifts from ambient to accusatory, forcing the protagonist to act. The valve-turn is protagonist-driven agency under causal pressure, and the cost is legible: he pours his own failure's weight into the wheel, exhaustion replaces drowsy alertness, and he learns he can carry the burden. The psychic accusation ("what I did to cause") narrows options sharply. No coincidental resolution; the protagonist's physical and emotional effort earns the quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: complicity, inaction, and the weight of unspoken guilt. The factory ghosts reliving a crisis they couldn't stop mirrors the protagonist's "I did nothing" confession. The valve-turning is not symbolic convenience—it's seeded early, and its closure use reweights the opening question without moralizing. The radio calls function as thematic counterpoint, not thesis statements. The final image offers a resonant answer: lending strength to quiet others' ghosts lets him measure his own capacity without erasing the weight. Subtle parallel between the phantom failure and his own unresolved confession avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with strong perceptual signature: "devouring dark," "porous and strange," "sleeping iron beasts." Distance modulates purposefully—close during confession and valve scene, slightly pulled back during radio exposition. The protagonist's diction ("religiously skeptical," "bizarre interpretive lens") fits an educated, introspective voice under stress. No head-hopping. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("I heard it," "I thought of") could be tighter, but they don't dull immediacy at closure. The psychic's "soothing baritone" and the woman's "tinny and frantic" voice provide auditory texture without dialogue, maintaining voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythm control: "rotted tie," "oily water," "weeping walls," "bone-deep, earned exhaustion." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the middle: "The air grew thick… and the clang was joined by…" followed by "I kept the radio on… I used the calls as…" creates slight repetition of structure. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("devouring dark," "sleeping iron beasts"). The final beat—"deep, peaceful emptiness" contrasted with "charged, accusatory silence"—lands cleanly with no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—abandoned-place exploration meets radio-psychic framing device meets literal ghost-worker crisis—feels fresh and specific. The protagonist's method of using talk-radio calls as an "interpretive lens" is an original structural choice that avoids cliché haunting tropes. The valve as both literal artifact and thematic hinge is well-executed. Risk: the drowsy, reflective voice during high-pressure exploration could flatten urgency, but the embodied details (rust, cold, water) maintain momentum. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating into irony or explaining away the supernatural, which strengthens conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reckless explorer is present from the opening ("crawling into the guts of every forgotten mill") and drives both the tunnel entry and the climactic valve turn. His recklessness is motivated (trading gnawing anxiety for sharper fear) and tested on-page with visible cost (exhaustion, confronting spectral accusation). The choice to grab the valve is protagonist-driven and alters the outcome decisively. Present in setup, middle (walking toward the sound), and closure (forcing the wheel closed).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears twice with escalating function: first as a visual detail ("beaded valve wheel, each bead a perfect, glistening drop"), then as the crisis mechanism turning "an eighth of a turn at a time," and finally as the object the protagonist must force closed. Its physical properties (frigid, vibrating, resisting) constrain the climactic action. Removing it would collapse the closure; no other object could serve. The specificity (cast-iron, condensation beads, clockwise turn) charges the final image and ties the protagonist's effort to the ghosts' release.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Factory ghost shift is introduced via the radio caller, then dramatized on-page as "spectral sounds of a full production line" and an "invisible presence" that shifts focus to the protagonist. It's not merely thematic; the concept creates the accusatory pressure ("they thought I was part of the catastrophe") that forces the valve action. The ghost shift reframes the valve as a frozen crisis the workers are endlessly repeating, making the protagonist's intervention causally necessary. Present in setup (radio), escalation (the shift "focuses directly on me"), and closure (quieting the shift).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Religiously skeptical is stated ("a firm and religiously skeptical man") and demonstrated once (scoffing at the psychic's explanation), but it doesn't constrain a later choice with visible cost. The protagonist's willingness to grab the valve and accept the supernatural encounter doesn't hinge on this trait being overcome or tested. It's present in setup but doesn't shape escalation or closure meaningfully. Functional but somewhat replaceable; "skeptical" alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Appraise appears three times: as the protagonist's motivation ("appraise the unfolding strangeness"), his method ("to appraise the scene not as a haunting, but as a problem"), and implicitly in his decision to act on the valve. The action reframes the haunting as solvable, enabling the turn from passive witness to active intervention. The second use ("appraise the scene… as a problem to be solved") directly triggers the valve choice. Present across beats and essential to the protagonist's stance shift, though the mechanics of "appraisal" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interpreting frantic calls is signaled early ("I used the calls as a bizarre interpretive lens"), sustained through two on-page examples (factory ghost shift, attic ghost asking "what I did"), and causally active at the crisis beat: the man's radio confession ("what I did to cause the fire") triggers the protagonist's kinship realization and shifts the ghost presence from ambient to accusatory. The method shapes both his appraisal approach and the emotional turn that motivates the valve action. Removing this mechanic would weaken the causality of his self-recognition. Present in setup, escalation, and closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel provides the spatial container, the breach into Blackwood Mill's sub-basement, and the confined, pressurized atmosphere that amplifies the haunting. The setting supplies the valve (the problem's heart) and the oily water the protagonist must wade through, constraining movement and heightening discomfort. The tunnel's "absolute black" and "weeping walls" contribute to tone and escalation. Removing this exact setting would require a different access point and spatial logic; the tunnel-to-mill transition is causally motivated. Present in setup, escalation (opening into the cavernous room), and closure (the dripping water aftermath).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" is present in the opening beat and frames the protagonist's emotional state, but it doesn't tighten on-page decisions with a live clock. The hush recurs at closure ("not the charged, accusatory silence from before, but a deep, peaceful emptiness"), creating a lyric bracket. The thirty-six hours without sleep adds urgency to his "drowsy alertness," but elapsed time within the tunnel scene isn't tracked or used to pressure choices. Functional reprise that reweights the stake, but the timeframe itself doesn't alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Finding the weight of a swallowed truth is the protagonist's stated motivation, tested on-page when the ghosts' accusation forces him to confront his own "I did nothing." The motivation drives his choice to enter dangerous spaces and ultimately to turn the valve, pouring "all of its crushing weight into the wheel." The final realization—"I now knew I could carry it"—directly answers the opening desire with visible cost (exhaustion, persistent weight). Present in setup, escalation (kinship with the radio caller), and closure. The motivation shapes the entire arc and the ending image, making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Drowsy alertness is embodied throughout: "thirty-six hours without sleep," "the world feel porous and strange," "my drowsy alertness finally dissolving into a bone-deep, earned exhaustion." The tone modulates with pressure—calm reflection during the radio section, heightened perception during the tunnel approach, focused intensity at the valve, then release into exhaustion. The tone charges the final image by contrasting pre-closure alertness with post-closure collapse. It's coherent across turns and essential to the protagonist's perceptual filter and the story's atmospheric texture.</comment>
