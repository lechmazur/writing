<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent trait-driven action (persistent curiosity, technical competence), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle under pressure. Leo's emotional arc from defeat to peace is told more than dramatized; the crumpling face and slow breaths are gestures, not layered contradictions. The final "shepherd toward calm" phrasing edges into abstraction rather than grounding the cost of this work in Elias's body or psyche. Motivation is clear but not tested by genuine friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo's panic softens to peace; Elias completes the circuit and departs). The causal lens holds: hearing-aid signal → locate Leo → deliver reassurance → signal fades. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frantic pulse becomes a lullaby. Cost is present but muted—Leo's worry eases, yet no path is visibly foreclosed; Elias walks away unchanged. The closure image reweights prior material without deep sacrifice, qualifying as RR but not at the highest tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and atmospherically specific (glass/steel cathedral, weeping figs, central fountain, marble floor). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could have found Leo anywhere. The setting charges the mood but remains postcard-level; it does not pressure the closure beat, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: close the circuit between Elara's spirit and Leo. One tightening occurs when the frantic pulse softens, signaling mission success. However, Elias faces no obstacle, reversal, or trade-off—he walks, scans, finds Leo, speaks, succeeds. Leo's internal struggle is summarized ("I feel like I'm failing") rather than tested on the page. Agency is present but unchallenged; no credible loss or tactical shift is visible, limiting escalation under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of interiority across the void and "incidental heroism" emerges from event and image, not assertion. The hearing-aid pulse as emotional translation is a fresh particular. However, the final beat edges toward thematic statement ("shepherd toward calm," "incidental heroism") rather than letting the image speak. The "slow down your heart" instruction is resonant but borders on prescribed wisdom. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution; the piece resolves cleanly into comfort without lingering friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Elias. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("cartography of loss," "technician of sorrow," "reeling hush"), establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Leo's line feels natural. However, some phrasing ("eighty-seven years before she was gone entirely," "shepherd toward calm") tilts into elevated abstraction that stands slightly outside Elias's lived technical role. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening and setup. However, several lines loop conceptually: "contact tracer for hearts" / "specialist in the cartography of loss" / "technician of sorrow" restate the same idea without added pressure. "Reeling hush" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "eighty-seven years before she was gone entirely" is opaque on first read. No major template cadence or filter stacks; clarity is generally strong. Modest paraphrase drift and one stock phrase ("moth fluttering against a windowpane") lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts via hearing-aid pulses" premise is fresh and specific, avoiding template plots. The emotional cartography metaphor and the twist that the dead speak in heartbeat rhythms are non-obvious. However, the arc follows a straightforward locate-and-reassure structure with no moral calculus or earned risk. The final "incidental heroism" frame edges toward prompt language rather than lived transformation. Specificity and synthesis are strong; boldness and complication are modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias ("contact tracer for hearts") is present throughout and his role frames the premise. He makes one causal choice: to approach Leo and translate the pulse. However, his decision is unopposed and the outcome is assured; no turn hinges on a difficult choice he makes under pressure. The role shapes setup and method but does not constrain or enable a costly reversal. Present in closure (he completes the circuit and departs), but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The photograph appears in two beats: Elias examines it from the file, then Leo holds the framed copy. It identifies Leo and creates emotional symmetry (boy-now-man). However, it does not enable or constrain a choice; it functions as recognition cue rather than active tool. No reweighted meaning at closure—it sits in Leo's hands unchanged. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure action. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is declared in the opening ("protect vulnerable voices") and closing ("incidental heroism") but not tested on the page. Elias's work is presented as routine; he encounters no friction, cost, or moral choice. The concept is thematic label rather than lived pressure. It frames tone but does not shape stakes or tactics in a way that alters outcome. Present as idea; absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is asserted ("a trait that made him invaluable") but not demonstrated through costly action. Elias follows the signal methodically; no scene shows him choosing curiosity over efficiency or safety. The trait is label-only and does not constrain a choice or enable a turn. Mentioned in setup; invisible in middle and closure. Functional descriptor without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Assure" drives the climactic beat: Elias tells Leo "She's not disappointed" and "She wants you to match her beat." This action resolves Leo's panic and completes the mission. The pulse fades immediately after, linking assurance to closure. However, the reassurance is unopposed and the content ("slow down") is wisdom-delivery rather than hard-won insight. Present and essential to closure, but not layered with friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early, tuned to Elara's frequency, and its pulse guides Elias to Leo. It appears in three beats: activation, intensification near fountain, and final fade. The device enables the search and signals closure (pulse vanishes). However, its mechanics are asserted rather than constrained—no interference, failure, or interpretation difficulty complicates the method. Shapes setup and closure; modest causal pressure in middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The atrium is vivid and anchors all action (glass/steel, fog, fountain, benches, marble). Tone is coherent. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's search or supply a resource—he could have located Leo anywhere. The fountain and fog are atmospheric but do not alter tactics or outcome. Present throughout; pressure is atmospheric rather than causal. Postcard-level integration; does not charge the closure beat with spatial necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the dead call" opens the story and "tonight's case" marks the temporal frame, but no clock tightens decisions. The search unfolds without urgency or deadline; Elias walks, scans, finds Leo in linear sequence. Time does not escalate pressure or force trade-offs. Present as frame; absent as tactical constraint. Functional setup; minimal closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated explicitly and drives Elias's presence in the atrium. It motivates his approach to Leo and underlies the reassurance. However, it is not tested by competing desire or cost—Elias never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices. The motivation is single-track and uncomplicated. Present in setup and closure; dramatized through action but not through friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears twice and shapes the story's auditory texture: silence amplifies breath, footsteps, and the faint pulse. Tone is sustained through the cathedral imagery, fog, and quiet fountain. At closure, the hush frames Leo's slow breaths and the signal's fade, charging the final beat with stillness. Coherent modulation from setup through climax; tone tightens around the ending image without rupture. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
