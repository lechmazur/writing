<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's scholarly passion transforms into urgent mission after Kael's arrival, but the interiority remains largely abstract—"quiet pursuit," "urgent rescue," "weight of futures"—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choices (matching catalog gaps, facing Curators) are present but feel more puzzle-solving than deeply conflicted agency. The final confrontation with the Curators shows some internal tension ("frantic beat of her own heart") yet the stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. No clear internal flaw drives inevitable mistakes or complicates the path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain: Kael's warning → need for Library → research gaps → botanical diary → map → wall → Curators → access granted. Orientation anchors who/where by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara stands at the precipice with access granted, options crystallized, cost implied in "weight of all possible futures" and the long negotiation risked. The cost is felt rather than decisively paid on the page, which fits RR but limits the charge. One meaningful tightening (catalog research → confrontation) is present under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Scriptorium as living mountain bookstore is vividly rendered through sensory particulars: "rustle of vellum," "scent of decaying paper," "air growing still and heavy," "wall of seamless, living rock." The botanical diary functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains Elara's method and charges the final image (she clutches it at closure). Spatial choreography through tunnels and alcoves is coherent. The "Whispering Moss" and "Lector's Vine" ground the magic in tactile, lived-in detail that shapes her path and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the Library to save the future—is signaled early and tightens through the research sequence. One meaningful escalation: Elara must renegotiate with the Curators, requiring leverage she doesn't possess, which she earns through gap-research. The confrontation with the Curators narrows options ("Your purpose is to preserve knowledge... the future burns for want of them") and the Curators' acceptance opens the staircase. Cost is implied in the risk of facing "beings woven from ink and memory" and the "weight of all possible futures," but the physical or relational price remains abstract rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge hoarded versus knowledge consulted, seeds that never sprout, patterns in silence. Elara's argument to the Curators—"knowledge unconsulted is a seed that never sprouts"—risks overt statement but is dramatized through her research method and the diary's floral cryptology. The botanical diary as Rosetta Stone and the "unheard symphony" rising to "grand, hopeful crescendo" offer resonant, non-literal answers. The final image of woven roots and glowing pages reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "rescued past" in the final line edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Elara perceives the Scriptorium as "living composition," "unheard symphony," "negative space" detective work. Diction is elevated and consistent ("temporal paradoxes," "floral cryptology," "seamless, living rock"). The Curators' dialogue moment ("Your purpose...") advances the argument but reads slightly expository. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during research, slightly pulled back for the Curators' acceptance). Minor register drift: "renegotiate her terms" and "equation of risk" edge toward corporate diction in a fantasy frame, though not severely.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "stitched together from temporal paradoxes," "beings woven from ink and memory," "ghosts from the catalog," "staircase of woven roots and softly glowing pages." While vivid, the metaphoric saturation in nearly every sentence risks overwriting without always propelling. Some paraphrase loops: "rustle of vellum and scent of decaying paper" / "air growing still and heavy" echo texture without advancing. "Her purpose here had always been academic" / "Her true goal" within two paragraphs. Rhythm varies but several beats lean on "she [verb]" stems. No severe artifacts touch closure, but density and template cadence patterns lower momentum mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—arcane linguist researching catalog gaps via botanical clues to unlock forbidden library—offers a fresh synthesis of detective mystery and fantasy scholarship. The "researching gaps" method and botanical diary as cipher are specific and non-obvious. However, the broader frame (time traveler warns of doomed future, protagonist must find lost knowledge) follows a recognizable template. Transformation is present in the floral cryptology and the Curators as living entities, but emotional and moral calculus remain somewhat abstract. The piece commits fully to its logic and the ending feels earned, yet the stakes and final image don't surprise or reweight prior material in an unexpected way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—begin gap research, match diary to catalog, trace the path, confront Curators—drive all major turns. Her profession as arcane linguist enables the floral decoding ("not written in any language of man or elf") and shapes her argument. She appears in setup, middle, and closure with agency. Irreplaceability: strong; the story's logic hinges on her skill set.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (alcove discovery), is handled and decoded across multiple beats (matching catalog gaps, tracing paths), and is physically present at closure ("clutched in her hand"). It functions as Rosetta Stone, leverage, and symbolic anchor. Reweighted meaning: first a mystery, then a map, finally proof of method. High causal pressure and specificity; removal would break the research sequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rescue mission concept frames Elara's transformation from scholar to urgent actor and motivates her confrontation with the Curators ("to save tomorrow by excavating the mistakes of yesterday"). It appears in setup and colors the stakes but does not mechanically alter tactics beat-to-beat; her method remains research-driven regardless. Closure linkage is thematic rather than action-forcing. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "prevent catastrophe" or similar high-stakes frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is demonstrated on-page: she begins by "researching gaps...not for what was present, but for what was absent," cross-references catalogs, matches flora to omissions. The trait shapes her method and enables progress. Appears in setup beat and implicitly governs the middle research sequence. Cost: the weeks spent and risk faced. No single high-pressure tradeoff where resourcefulness visibly constrains another value, which limits score. Visible but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The renegotiation is signaled early as "terrifying prospect" requiring leverage, drives the middle research (gaining the diary as key), and forms the climax beat where Elara presents her "equation of risk" argument. The Curators' acceptance is the decisive turn that opens the Library. Removal would eliminate the central conflict structure. High causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability. Specific cost: facing beings "woven from ink and memory" with only argument and evidence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—researching gaps, "hunting a ghost through the negative space"—is signaled early, demonstrated across multiple beats (catalog cross-reference, matching diary flora to omissions, tracing the path), and provides the leverage for the final negotiation. Mechanics matter: the gaps "formed a map," not random. Method shapes every middle beat and enables closure. Specificity: detective work through absence rather than presence. High integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Scriptorium is introduced immediately, provides spatial structure (rotunda, alcove, tunnels, wall), and supplies resources (catalogs, diary, living rock). The mountain's "silent Curators" are gatekeepers whose nature shapes Elara's tactics. Environment constrains: access requires negotiation, depth requires leverage. The "wall of seamless, living rock" and final "staircase of woven roots" charge closure. Spatial choreography is clear. Strong integration across setup, middle, and ending with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor—"after the time traveler arrives"—motivates Elara's shift from scholar to urgent actor and frames the stakes (future crumbling). Kael's arrival is setup, the urgency colors middle beats ("weeks" of research), and "all possible futures" appear at closure. However, time does not tighten scene tactics beat-to-beat; no live clock pressures decisions within the research or confrontation. Thematic presence is strong, mechanical pressure is moderate. Functional but not indispensable to scene-level choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Finding the Library is the explicit goal, stated early and pursued across all major beats: research, discovery, path-tracing, negotiation. Desire is dramatized through weeks of work, risk of facing Curators, and the argument she constructs. The motivation collides with obstacle (lack of access/leverage) and drives the renegotiation. Closure delivers the goal with cost (weight of futures, first step into unknown). High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and cost connection. Friction: mostly want-driven, less friction between competing desires.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" tone is established in the opening line ("notes the rustle of vellum") and modulates with pressure: "silent melody," "absolute silence" at the wall, "frantic beat of her own heart" during confrontation, then "no longer silent but rising to a grand, hopeful crescendo" at closure. Coherent and purposeful; the tonal arc mirrors Elara's journey from quiet scholarship to hope. The metaphor threads through and charges the final image. Minor strain: the metaphor risks decoration in middle beats where it appears without mechanical pressure. Still, strong lyric reprise.</comment>
