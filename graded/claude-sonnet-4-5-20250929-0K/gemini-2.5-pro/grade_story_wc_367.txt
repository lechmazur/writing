<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is stated early ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract; the manic laughter is performed rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final realization—"the dawn was beginning to shape him too"—arrives as an epiphany without prior micro-choices that would earn it. Internal experience stays one-note (elation/wonder) without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm ritual intensifies through description and gesture, building to a final cadence shift ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too"). However, no on-page choice or renunciation creates a legible before/after with felt cost; the ending reweights thematically but lacks a decisive change or visible forfeiture that would qualify as Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse, crystalline apparatus, and glass wick are vividly rendered and anchor the scene throughout. The wick's facets constrain Kaelan's method (total internal reflection), and the storm's passage produces a tangible environmental shift ("light seemed sharper, air cleaner"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the focalizer's priorities, meeting the micro-setting test by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—steering the cosmic storm—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation reads as intensification of the ritual (adjusting levers, wick glowing white-hot, tower shuddering) rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off that alters tactics. The storm passes without Kaelan making a consequential choice; the "unfamiliar quality" in the dawn is noticed, not earned through agency, leaving cost implied rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (creation from destruction, unintended consequence) emerges through particulars—the glyphs as "celestial graffiti," seers' prophecies, the dawn's "unfamiliar quality"—without overt statement. The final image ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too") offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. However, the thematic turn is somewhat convenient; the prophecies are introduced late and not dramatized as a cost that alters Kaelan's stance, keeping the piece in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (technical apparatus, cosmic scale, manic joy). Diction ("bruise of violet," "furious contained nova," "shadowed wonder") is character-particular and rhythmically controlled. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; distance modulates purposefully from external action to internal tremor at closure, meeting the 9+ quick test for voice control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Figurative language is dense ("spear of green," "contained nova," "tapestry of light and shade") and occasionally overwrought in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching; the metaphor "cathedral of light and shadow" sits beside "symphony of chaos" in adjacent lines, risking decorative stacking (−0.3). Paraphrase loops are minimal; no scaffold or template cadence. Information density is solid but the overwriting in the storm sequence nudges the score down from 7+ territory.</comment>

However, the thematic turn is somewhat convenient; the prophecies are introduced late and not dramatized as a cost that alters Kaelan's stance, keeping the piece in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic lighthouse keeper sculpting reality through light—is fresh in detail (glass wick, total internal reflection) and the "Laughing Storm Herald" carries voice. However, the arc (lone figure performs ritual, realizes unintended consequence) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity in apparatus and setting elevates execution, but the emotional trajectory and thematic turn lack the boldness or synthesis that would reach high originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaelan's title "Laughing Storm Herald" frames expectation early (+0.3 setup). His laughter recurs across beats (engaging energizer, adjusting controls, storm passage) and modulates at closure (manic → quiet chuckle) (+0.9 beats, +0.4 lyric reprise). However, his choices are procedural (operating apparatus) rather than forking decisions that narrow options or create visible cost; the role is observational/operational. Late realization does not stem from prior agency. Swappable with "lone operator" (−0.5 swappability). Scores in functional but not essential band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Glass lantern wick is introduced early as "the very key to his art" (+0.8 setup). Handled in at least three beats: nested in cradle, adjusted via levers/dials (controls its facets), glows white-hot under strain (+1.4 beats). Its unique property—total internal reflection through million facets—enables the method and charges the apparatus description (+0.8 specificity, +0.5 causal pressure). Appears in closure vicinity ("glass lantern wick glowed white-hot") but does not decisively shape the final image or realization; the ending focuses on Kaelan's trembling and the dawn's unfamiliar quality (−0.7 closure linkage partial). Strong integration across setup and middle; lighter at closure keeps it from ≥8.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named in paragraph one ("An otherworldly routine had claimed his life") and frames the ritual structure (+0.5 setup). The nightly practice (adjusting apparatus, steering storm energy) recurs as dramatized action across two beats (+0.9 beats). However, the concept does not constrain a forking choice or impose visible cost; it describes the setting's strangeness rather than altering tactics. The final line ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too") echoes the concept thematically but does not link it to a decision or forfeiture on the page (closure linkage weak, +0.3). Functional across beats; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is introduced mid-story (paragraph five, ~55% mark): "unaware that on the dark continents below, seers and mystics traced these same patterns" (−0.4 late). The attribute is told, not dramatized; Kaelan's unawareness means it does not constrain his on-page action (−0.8 ornamental). It resurfaces obliquely at closure ("a consequence of prophecies he never knew he was writing") but remains summary-only (−0.4). Swappable with "unintended influence" (−0.5). No visible cost or choice tied to this trait. Caps at functional-low per late + ornamental + swappable limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Steer" appears early as stated goal ("to steer the very fabric of the incoming tempest") and anchors the middle ritual: adjusting controls, painting glyphs, weaving the torrent (+0.8 setup, +0.9 beats). The action enables the plot's central sequence and differentiates this piece (not just "observe storm" but actively "steer" it) (+0.5 causal pressure, +0.4 specificity). However, the ending turn ("the dawn was beginning to shape him too") does not hinge on a steering choice made under pressure; the storm simply passes and he notices an unfamiliar quality. Major turns trace to the action's unfolding but not to a forking decision within it (closure linkage partial, +0.5). Strong setup and beat involvement; lighter closure agency keeps it mid-7s rather than ≥8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" is named mid-story (paragraph four, ~45%): "He would achieve this through total internal reflection" (−0.2 late signal). Mechanics are explained (beam trapped in glass facets, ricocheting, sculpting patterns) and used in one extended beat (lever adjustments) (+0.4 one beat, +0.3 specificity). Does not recur at closure or constrain a later choice; the method is procedural backdrop rather than a tactical constraint under pressure (−0.6 ornamental in closure). Swappable with "prismatic refraction" or similar optical term without breaking story logic (−0.5 swappability). Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emerald Lighthouse is anchored in the opening line ("apex of the Emerald Lighthouse, a lone green spire piercing a cosmos of stark, silent stars") and sustained throughout: crystalline apparatus at its heart, tower shuddering from resonance, vantage over sea and sky (+0.8 setup, +0.9 beats). The lighthouse's height and apparatus constrain Kaelan's method (projecting onto storm clouds) and supply the tool (wick/energizer) that enables the ritual (+1.0 causal pressure). The setting charges the final image: "stared out at the new day he had helped to mold" (+0.9 closure linkage). Micro-setting test satisfied; environment shapes tactics and ending. Strong across all three gates; hairline slip in specificity (could be "tower" generically) keeps it shy of ≥8.5 indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is mentioned once in paragraph one ("far older than the forgotten tongues of the last print newspaper") as atmospheric color (−0.8 ornamental). No middle development: the timeframe does not tighten a decision or alter tactics; the ritual proceeds without reference to this era marker (missing middle gate, cap 3.4). Does not appear at closure. Swappable with any post-industrial decline phrase (−0.6 swappability). Present as world-building flavor but inert to plot and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early (paragraph two: "His motivation was simple and grand") and named again at closure ("the new day he had helped to mold") (+0.8 setup, +0.5 lyric reprise). The motivation drives the ritual action across two beats (energizing beam, steering storm) (+0.9 beats). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Kaelan pursues it without friction until the final realization arrives as epiphany rather than earned choice (−0.7 low friction). Closure linkage is thematic but not causal (partial, +0.4). Strong setup and reprise; lack of dramatized conflict or tradeoff keeps it mid-6s per the lyric-resonance allowance ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" coheres as tone from opening ("manic grin," "low chuckle," "laughter growing louder," "sound of pure, shadowed elation") through climax ("laughter became a gale") to closure modulation ("final, quiet chuckle… filled with a profound and shadowed wonder") (+0.8 setup, +0.9 beats, +0.7 closure linkage). The tone is consistent and modulates with pressure (manic → spent → quiet wonder), charging the final image without static repetition (+0.6 specificity). Hairline: "shadowed" recurs as label rather than always emerging from embodied perception (−0.2 slight reliance on tag). Strong integration across all gates; minor voice convergence on the descriptor keeps it from ≥8.5 indispensability.</comment>
