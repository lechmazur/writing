<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory particulars (bronze grotto, starlight, kerosene burner) and his motivation to collect burdens is concrete. The fractal weaver's stasis is earned by the prison constraint, and the farmer's grief—felt as "a shard of glass in the psychic current"—grounds abstract sorrow in embodied perception. Internal contradiction is present (boundary-lessly trapped yet conscious across the world) and drives the solitary ritual. Minor slip: the emotional arc remains static; Kaelen performs his task without meaningful internal shift or micro-choice that alters his stance, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (fractal weaver, bronze grotto, after first snowmelt) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the burden arrives, is transformed via starlight focus, and joins the mosaic—a clear RR (Earned Stasis) with conceptual cost (the shingled hush deepens, Kaelen remains kneeling). The cost is legible in the final image ("lonely warden…listening…waiting"), though the reconfiguration is subtle. Single continuous scene with clean causality under the inferred lens. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity. The closure qualifies but lacks a sharper pivot or felt loss that would elevate into high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight through the ceiling, kerosene burner, and mosaic floor are vivid, selective, and purposeful. The burner constrains the ritual (holds the wisp, aligns with Alphena's light), and the mosaic charges the final image (Kaelen sets the new stone "into the pattern"). Sensory detail is filtered through Kaelen's non-human perception ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush"). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. Micro-setting (burner, grotto, starlight) all constrain choices and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate test, but one hairline slip: "thawing world" above remains abstract rather than shown through concrete detail at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (collect burdens, give them final home) and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the farmer's grief arrives, Kaelen performs the ritual, and the mosaic deepens. The single meaningful tightening is the alignment and calcification process, which narrows options (the wisp must be oriented properly or remain chaotic). Cost is conceptual (shingled hush grows heavier, Kaelen remains kneeling, waiting for the next weight) but visible on the page. No protagonist decision alters tactics mid-scene; the ritual unfolds without complication or reversal, capping scores below 8.0. Agency is endurance (Earned Stasis) with cost, but escalation remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—solitary caretaking, the weight of witnessing, transformation of suffering into stillness—emerges organically from the ritual and mosaic without assertion. The kerosene burner, starlight, and mosaic all carry thematic weight and shift meaning at the end (the new stone completes the pattern, deepening the hush). The final image (Kaelen kneeling, listening, waiting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of burden collection without moralizing. Minor slip: "whalebone reverie" appears twice as a tonal cue but is not dramatically embodied or tested under pressure, reading slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; the focalizer's perceptual signature is distinct ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," psychic current as sensory medium). Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("boundary-lessly trapped," "frantic, chaotic thing"). No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Kaelen's knowledge. Free indirect style is clean and tense/stance remain stable. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (opening backstory, then real-time ritual, then reflection at closure). Hairline slip: "immense care" and "immense use" recur within close proximity, a minor vocabulary echo that does not harm clarity but reduces rhythmic variety slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and concrete with strong information density ("kerosene lamp burner, its brass body tarnished with age and immense use, its glassless gallery like a waiting crown"). Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports beats. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence. Minor issues: "immense care" / "immense use" near each other; "misery, a frantic, chaotic thing" stacks two near-synonyms; "The world above wept its winter coat" is slightly strained metaphorically (coat-weeping mix). One figurative muddle: "whalebone reverie" is evocative but its vehicle (whalebone) does not map clearly to the tenor (meditative state), reading slightly ornamental. These are hairline slips that do not obscure causality or closure but prevent entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—fractally aware psychic worker who calcifies others' sorrows into stones via starlight—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock templates. The ritual (burner, starlight, alignment) is fresh and purposeful, grounded in physical particulars. The final mosaic image and kneeling wait are memorable and earned. Risk-taking in voice ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") and concept (boundary-lessly trapped) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the emotional arc is static (Kaelen performs his role without complication or internal shift), and the single-beat ritual lacks a second turn or complication that would deepen originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout, performs the central ritual (draws burden, aligns burner, calcifies grief, places stone), and his action drives the closure (kneeling, waiting). He shapes the dominant stake (collect burdens) and the ending image. Setup early, development mid-beat (aligning/calcifying), payoff at closure (stone placed, mosaic complete). However, Kaelen makes no decision that alters tactics or faces a reversal; he executes a practiced routine without internal conflict or complication, limiting the score. The fractal weaver role is essential but largely observational/procedural rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (holds wisp, aligned with starlight, tipped to release stone), and its mechanics matter (gallery teeth, wick-raiser knob as tactile anchor). The burner enables the ritual and is irreplaceable (its "old magic" contains the wisp; its gallery focuses the light). It appears in the closure beat (lowered, tipped, stone released) and its use is causal and specific. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible procedural cost (requires precise alignment). Only hairline slip: the burner is not reweighted at the end; it functions identically throughout, capping entry to 9+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shingled hush" is named in the opening line and reprised at closure ("The shingled hush absorbed this new silence, becoming infinitesimally heavier, deeper, and more complete"), reweighting the grotto's atmosphere with the new stone. It shapes tone and stakes (quiet as layered presences) and the concept of accumulation. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The reprise at closure is purposeful and charges the final image, qualifying for lyric resonance, but mid-scene use is absent. Two of three gates (setup, payoff) met; development missing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced early and constrains Kaelen's entire existence: his consciousness reaches everywhere but his body cannot leave the grotto. This paradox drives the method (psychic collection from afar, physical ritual in one place) and is visible in the closure (he remains kneeling, waiting, unable to step beyond). The trait is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the story's premise and stakes. It appears in setup, shapes middle action (drawing burden remotely), and is present at closure (remains rooted). Cost is conceptual but legible (eternal warden role). Strong integration; only limitation is that the trait is not tested or complicated mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Calcify" is the story's central transformation: the farmer's grief is "forced into a crystalline lattice," edges "thickened, turned opaque, and hardened," energy "condensed from a cloud of pain into a single, solid object." The action is signaled early (Kaelen's method), dramatized at length in the middle beat with specific mechanics (alignment, lattice formation), and produces the stone that completes the mosaic at closure. The verb is irreplaceable (no synonym captures the physical/emotional transformation) and the process redefines options (grief becomes inert matter). Causal, specific, and indispensable. Only hairline limitation: the calcification succeeds without complication or cost to Kaelen, preventing a perfect 10.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled early ("by orienting properly, he could bring peace"), its mechanics are shown on the page (align wisp, gallery teeth, Alphena's light into "a single, perfect axis"), and it shapes the ritual's success. The method is specific and irreplaceable (misalignment would leave the wisp chaotic). It drives the middle beat and is causally tied to the closure (stone created, placed in mosaic). Setup, development, payoff all present with visible procedural cost (requires focus, ancient joints creak). Only limitation: the method succeeds on first attempt without error or adjustment, reducing felt difficulty slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is anchored early (walls, floor mosaic, rock ceiling with pinprick starlight) and recurs across beats: it houses the burner, supplies the starlight for alignment, and holds the mosaic that receives the new stone. The setting constrains action (Kaelen cannot leave; starlight is his only tool) and charges the closure image (kneeling in the grotto, mosaic complete). Spatial choreography is clear (center of grotto, starlight through ceiling). The grotto is indispensable and specific. Hairline slip: the setting does not evolve or supply a complication; it functions as stable backdrop rather than dynamic pressure, capping entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" is mentioned in the opening ("time after the first snowmelt, a season of sharp, painful awakenings") and frames the arrival of fresh burdens ("with the meltwater came a fresh tide of burdens"). It provides seasonal context but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Kaelen's ritual unfolds without temporal pressure; the timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Setup present, but development and payoff missing; the season does not constrain tactics or shape the ending. Functional but replaceable; any season of transition would serve equally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation "to collect the weights of different burdens, to know their heft and texture, and to give them a final, quiet home" is stated early and drives every beat: he feels the farmer's grief, draws it into the grotto, transforms it via ritual, and places it in the mosaic. The desire is dramatized through action (drawing, aligning, placing) and shapes the closure (he waits for the next weight). Cost is present (solitary endurance, eternal task, "lonely warden"). Setup, development, payoff all present. Limitation: the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicting wants; Kaelen never hesitates, doubts, or chooses between competing goods, reducing felt friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears twice (middle and near-end: "The whalebone reverie of Kaelen's existence deepened as the process completed") and establishes a meditative, bone-deep stillness that modulates with the ritual's intensity. Tone is coherent through turns (quiet opening, focused middle, deepened closure) and charges the final image (kneeling, listening, waiting). However, the phrase is slightly ornamental (whalebone as vehicle does not map clearly to the tenor) and the tone remains largely static rather than shifting under pressure. Two of three gates met (setup via related diction, payoff at closure); middle modulation is subtle. Lyric reprise qualifies but causal pressure is low.</comment>
