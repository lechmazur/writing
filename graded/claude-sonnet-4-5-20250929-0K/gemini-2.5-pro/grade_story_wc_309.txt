<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior is consistently realized through concrete failures and the "knot of inadequacy," with his motivation—finding the sacred in the simple—embodied through rejection of diagnostics. The final choice to remove the pack and touch the keystone feels earned by prior causality. However, the epiphany moment leans toward abstraction ("a way of seeing") and some interiority edges into therapy-speak ("simple, profound confidence"). The agency and transformation are present but the closure beat's language slightly dulls embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: who (Kael), where (icebound spire), when (automated-magic age) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Causal: mist-walking arrival → diagnostic failures → despair → unstrapping → resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the keystone awakens internal resonance, foreclosing reliance on automated methods with visible cost: abandoning the pack and tools). The because/therefore chain holds and the cost is legible on the page. Minor: the final paragraph's abstraction ("a way of seeing") slightly softens the concrete image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, thin air, skeletal garden, and the arch with keystone are vividly rendered with purposeful selection. The keystone's "moon-like stone" and "internal glow" constrain Kael's diagnostic attempts (they fail against it) and charge the final touch. Micro-setting (the pack, its weight, the snow) alters tactics when he unstraps it. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency: cold, thin air, and "brilliant dimness" filter through Kael's frustrated, then revelatory state. The environment directly shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Kael seeks the source of lingering luminance to validate his misaligned talent. Escalation is causal: diagnostic tools fail → despair tightens → realization prompts unstrapping → keystone touch reweights options. One meaningful turn (removing the pack) narrows his approach and forecloses reliance on automated craft with felt cost. The price—abandoning his Academy tools and worldview—is visible on the page. Agency is clear, though the final beat's abstraction ("the most powerful magic of all") slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—sacred as a way of seeing, not a formula—emerges from concrete failures (diagnostic arrays die, smoke) and the unstrapping action, not meta-statement until the very end. The keystone's useless beauty and "lingering luminance" resist quantification, embodying the thematic question. The final image ("quiet, unshakeable light") offers a resonant answer: valuing creation without utility. However, the last two sentences ("that was the most powerful magic of all") edge into overt thesis, slightly lowering the score from the 8-band. The core insight is earned, the landing just a touch too articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Voice is consistent: "poet forced to write legal code," "baggage he carried," "unenthusiastic motions" all carry his weary, misaligned stance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax (bare palm, flare, resonance). Diction stays character-appropriate until the final paragraph, where "the most powerful magic of all" shifts into a slightly elevated, tell-oriented register that weakens the established texture. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present but the ending's phrasing feels slightly external.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (mist-walking, diagnostic failure, unstrapping all advance character and stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong until the final paragraph, where stacked abstractions ("sacred," "resonance," "unshakeable light," "way of seeing") and the summary-like closure line dilute propulsion. The phrase "the most powerful magic of all" reads as scaffold—tell where image would suffice. Sentence variety is solid, but the ending's conceptual cluster slightly flattens momentum and lowers density when it should peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—underachieving mage rejecting automation for simple magic—has fresh angles (mist-walking as obsolete skill, diagnostics that fail, garden folly as sacred site). The unstrapping literalizes burden-shedding without cliché. However, the "creativity automated" frame and "find the sacred" arc echo common writing-prompt templates (artist vs. sterile system). Transformation is present but not fully irreplaceable: swap "magic" for "art" or "code" and the emotional arc holds unchanged. The ending's overt moralizing ("the most powerful magic of all") retreats from bold synthesis into safe summary, lowering originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael (underachieving mage) is signaled early and his choices—attempting diagnostics, despairing, unstrapping the pack, touching the keystone—create every major turn. His underachievement frames motivation and the final resonance reweights his stance. Causal pressure and closure participation are both strong. The exact underachiever trait matters: his misalignment enables mist-walking and the receptivity needed at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The keystone appears early (end of second paragraph), shapes the middle (diagnostics fail against it), and is the physical locus of closure (Kael's bare palm touch). It is handled twice (diagnostics, then touch) and its properties (lingering luminance, refusal to register) are irreplaceable. Removing it breaks the story's logic. Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is introduced early ("magic so old it had forgotten its own name"), constrains the diagnostic arrays (they cannot measure it), and is the mechanism of Kael's transformation ("flared...with the gentle, pervasive warmth of a memory"). The concept shapes stakes (Kael seeks its source) and the final resonance. It is indispensable: the plot hinges on magic that defies quantification. Setup, development, and closure payoff all present with causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is named in the penultimate paragraph and retrospectively frames the spire's atmosphere ("magic without formula," "purpose found in useless beauty"). It does not constrain an earlier on-page action; it is a thematic label applied at the end. Late first appearance and ornamental use lower the score. It enriches interpretation but is not causally active in prior beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unstrapping the pack is the story's hinge: it literalizes rejection of automated craft, enables the bare-handed touch, and is the on-page action that triggers closure. It appears in the climax paragraph and cannot be swapped without breaking the arc. The action is prepared (the "heavy pack" and "baggage" are mentioned earlier) and its cost (abandoning Academy tools) is visible. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with strong causal necessity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mist-walking is introduced in the second paragraph as Kael's arrival method. Its mechanics ("dissolving...into vapor," "imprecise, instinctual, obsolete") characterize him and set up his misalignment. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or reappear at closure. Functional but swappable: any archaic, solo travel method would serve the same purpose. Setup is present, development and payoff are absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire is signaled early, provides the isolated setting that removes external help, and its "brilliant dimness" and skeletal garden frame Kael's quest. The thin air and cold pressure his body ("clumsy with cold"). The spire's atmosphere ("accommodates impossibilities") charges the final image. It constrains tactics (no outside aid) and is inseparable from the closure effect. Setup, development, and payoff all present with purposeful sensory detail and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("age where magic was just another algorithm and creativity was automated") is established in the opening line and motivates Kael's search for the sacred. It frames the conflict (automated vs. simple magic) and his underachievement. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. It is thematic context more than tactical constraint. Setup and thematic development are present; payoff at closure is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find the sacred in the simple") is introduced in the first paragraph, drives his journey to the spire, and is dramatized through his rejection of diagnostics and unstrapping. It is tested and fulfilled in the closure (touching the keystone, awakening internal resonance). The final realization ("the sacred was not a thing to be found, but a way of seeing") directly answers the stated want. Setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (abandoning tools) and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is introduced in the second paragraph ("atmosphere was one of brilliant dimness, where the low light seemed to carry more weight"), recurs in the climax ("The brilliant dimness of the garden seemed to focus within him"), and charges the final image ("quiet, unshakeable light"). Tone is coherent: awe mixed with inadequacy, then revelation. The oxymoron shapes perception throughout and modulates with pressure. Setup, reprise, and closure linkage all present. The exact phrase matters and is irreplaceable.</comment>
