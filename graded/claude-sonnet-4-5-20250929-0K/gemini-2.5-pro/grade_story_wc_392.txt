<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior is specific and embodied—"quiet, steady burn in his gut," the jolt from the lantern—and his professional calm creates productive tension with the disorienting sensations. His choice at the end to defy Fletcher by including the journal context is motivated by the investigation and carries visible cost (career defiance). The interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic clarity ("oppressive weight…begin to lift") that feels slightly over-articulated for a man mid-crisis, and Finch remains a construct known only through notebook and sensation rather than a pressure-bearing presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The causal lens is inferred and held: Elias discovers evidence (scuff marks, notebook) that reframes Finch's death from accident to obsession-driven misstep, leading to his decision to write a complete report. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias refuses Fletcher's directive, documenting full context with visible professional cost, and the final image of him walking toward the surface with "fortified quiet" crystallizes his autonomy. The cost is felt but slightly oblique—we sense career risk without seeing Fletcher's reaction on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel is vivid and purposeful: "wet earth and cold iron," "brick-lined passage," high-water mark, and the rumbling train all ground the action and create atmosphere. The lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's interpretation and charging the final image when he sees it as both promise and cage. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional lens (boot prints in silt, scuff marks). The setting does not force a tactical choice mid-scene but does shape the emotional arc and final stance, placing it in the strong 7s rather than the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to assert professional autonomy against Fletcher's dismissive control—is signaled early and tightens when he finds the notebook, reframing the death and forcing a choice. The final decision to include full context is agency with visible cost (professional defiance). The escalation is meaningful but singular: one discovery → one decision. Finch's obsession provides thematic weight but is not a live antagonist; the conflict remains internal and procedural, which fits the lens but limits higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lantern's dual nature (freedom/cage) and the entangled-memories motif, which parallels both Finch's possession by history and Elias's struggle against Fletcher's control. The final image—"more his own than it had been that morning"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the autonomy question without moralizing. The "controlling influence from a century and a half ago" language in the penultimate section edges toward thesis statement, slightly reducing subtlety, but the particulars (lantern, notebook, tunnel) carry the weight and the ending reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature is consistent (empirical, measured, resisting the irrational). Diction is controlled and professional without stiffness. The sensory intrusions ("frantic hope," "consuming need") are clearly marked as not-his-own, maintaining clean focalization. Minor slips: "preventable death investigator" reads slightly expository in the opening, and "fortified quiet" in the final line, while thematically apt, tips toward authorial poetry rather than Elias's internal idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear, rhythmic, and purposeful with strong imagery ("sun never touches," "fortress around a core of sudden, jarring vulnerability"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character or plot. Two minor issues: "a quiet, steady burn in his gut" and "oppressive weight…begin to lift" are near-cliché constructions, and the phrase "a story that demanded a conclusion" in paragraph five edges toward meta-commentary. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. The closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—investigator experiences phantom memories from a historical artifact—is not wholly fresh, but the synthesis is specific: the procedural frame, the Underground Railroad lantern, and the parallel between Finch's obsession and Elias's fight for autonomy create a non-obvious moral calculus. The "controlling influence" as both historical possession and boss pressure is a strong thematic weave. The piece commits fully to its concept and avoids hedging, earning mid-7s; it does not quite reach the bold structural or perspectival risk that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his professional role shapes his lens (empirical observation, refusal to flatten truth). His decision at the end—to document full context despite Fletcher's order—alters tactics and carries cost. Setup early, drives the closure choice. The role itself is somewhat functional; a generic investigator could serve similarly, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern appears in three beats: initial tactile encounter (jolt, frantic hope), the train-rumble vision (Finch climbing, guided by phantom light), and the final image ("promised freedom but had…become a cage"). It is handled, triggers sensation, and is reweighted at closure with clear thematic charge. Early signal, causal pressure (reframes the death), closure linkage. Specific enough that a generic artifact would not work as well.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Entangled memories appear twice: the lantern jolt (paragraph three) and the train-rumble vision (paragraph five). The concept shapes Elias's understanding of Finch's obsession and is named in the notebook ("not my memory, but it's my mission"). It influences the final choice indirectly—recognizing possession helps Elias frame the report—but does not constrain tactics or alter scene options on the page. Present in closure image obliquely (autonomy regained), but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is named early and embodied in Elias's "precision" and his treatment of the disorienting sensations as fatigue. It enables his methodical discovery of the notebook and constrains his reaction (he does not flee or panic). The trait is visible in action but does not face a direct on-page test where calmness costs him something or where breaking it would change the outcome. Mid-6s for consistent embodiment without a sharp tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reverberate" is the mechanism for the second, stronger wave of entangled memory triggered by the train rumble. It shifts Elias's understanding from accident to obsession-driven misstep, which drives his final choice. Setup (train rumble), causal role in one major beat. Swappability: another sensory trigger could serve similarly (e.g., "echo," "vibrate"), capping the score in mid-6s. The word does not recur or charge the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Empirical observation is signaled early ("every death had a logic…through empirical observation") and shapes Elias's method: he notes scuff marks, water marks, the angle of fall. The notebook discovery and final report decision grow from this method. It is present at closure (documenting facts + context). The method is somewhat replaceable—any investigator would gather evidence—and does not face a constraint or tension (empirical vs. intuitive). Mid-6s for consistent presence without unique pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel is present throughout, grounding every beat: sensory detail (wet earth, cold iron, silt), the high-water mark that explains the body's discovery, the rumbling train that triggers the second memory wave, and the spatial metaphor of "walking back toward the surface" at closure. It constrains Elias's investigation (low oxygen, isolation) and charges the final image (oppressive weight lifting). Early setup, multiple beats, closure linkage. The tunnel is essential; the story would not work in an office or open field.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The drought ending two weeks ago explains why Finch's body surfaced now and anchors the investigation's timing. It is mentioned once (paragraph one) and does not recur or create urgency. The timeframe is functional backstory but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No closure participation. Mid-5s for setup and logical consistency without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's desire to break free from Fletcher is named early ("quiet, steady burn") and dramatized in the final choice to defy the sign-off order. The motivation is consistent and conflicted (professional duty vs. boss's convenience). It drives the closure action with visible cost (career risk). Early signal, causal role, closure participation. The motivation is somewhat stock (subordinate vs. controlling boss), and the friction is more told than tested mid-scene, capping the score in low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fortified vulnerability is embodied throughout: Elias's "watchfully calm precision" paired with "jarring vulnerability" when the lantern jolts him, and the final line's "fortified quiet" after the "oppressive weight" lifts. The tone modulates with pressure (calm → disoriented → resolute) and charges the closure image. The exact phrase "fortified vulnerability" does not appear, but the tonal synthesis is present and coherent. Tone is consistent, purposeful, and closure-linked, earning low 7s.</comment>
