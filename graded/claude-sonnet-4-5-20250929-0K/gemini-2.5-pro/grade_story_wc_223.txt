<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's arc from crisis actor to witness-historian shows purposeful interiority with contradictory impulses: her "feigned sorrows tasted like ash" versus her final raw grief performance. Her micro-choices—pacing coded letters, stopping before the chessboard—escalate under pressure and culminate in the tears that crack the Regent's composure. The Regent's "benevolently ruthless" trait is embodied through surgical amputation metaphors and the tremor of doubt at the knight's flank, though her turn at the end feels slightly telescoped. Elara's final embodied grief forecloses her safe observer role with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Great Dome, Elara, post-Collapse interregnum) and follows a single continuous scene. Escalation proceeds causally: Elara's paced code prompts the prisoner's tapping, which forces her final grief performance, which cracks the Regent's mask and produces the key-turn. The closure—Regent releasing the prisoner—lands on the page as Decisive Change with visible cost (her composure cracking, the "immense being set free"), though the Regent's reversal from ruthless surgeon to yielding authority occurs in a single beat and could use one more micro-signal of doubt earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Great Dome's whispering gallery actively constrains action: the Regent's voice "sliding along curved marble," Elara's footsteps spelling letters on dusty floor, the tapping from the high barred window amplified by acoustics. The obsidian chessboard missing pawns anchors spatial choreography and symbolic weight, recurring as Elara stops "directly before" it at the climax. Micro-setting (gallery perimeter, barred window) channels choices and charges the final image of the unlocking door's groan echoing through the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the hidden prisoner—is signaled by midpoint ("another truth the Regent had surgically removed") and tightens through Elara's escalating risk: S-E-C-R-E-T, R-E-L-E-A-S-E, then the final raw grief that forces the Regent's hand. Escalation is protagonist-driven and narrows options (the Regent "narrowed her eyes, recognizing a performance but unable to discern its script"). Cost is legible: Elara forecloses her safe witness role, and the Regent's surgical control shatters. One more micro-reversal between the middle and final beat would sharpen the tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—the power of small gestures and witnessing to unbind frozen power—emerges through the chessboard's missing pawns, Elara's foot-coded testimony, and the tears that illuminate "the luminous absence of all she had lost." The final U-N-B-I-N-D operates as command, plea, and prophecy without stating a moral, reweighting the Regent's surgical calculus and the board's emptiness. Subtext operates in the Regent's thumb-tremor, the desperate tapping counterpoint, and Elara's mask falling away; no overt moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with clean focalization: "Elara felt the lie not in the words, but in the flicker"; perceptual signature filters setting through her historian's attention to "small gestures." Voice carries distinct diction ("nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence") that modulates under pressure without register drift. The Regent's single line of dialogue feels formal-declarative, appropriate to role. One brief moment—"She was benevolently ruthless"—reads more like authorial summary than Elara's perception, slightly loosening distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively; rhythm varies with sentence length and syntax. Information density is high: "her new, self-appointed role was to be the historian of small gestures" compresses backstory and present motive efficiently. However, the phrase "luminous absence" appears twice in close proximity (penultimate and final paragraphs) as thematic decoration rather than fresh pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("she knew then," "she was not") slightly dulls immediacy. Final image—lock turning "with a groan that echoed"—propels closure cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor backstory with foot-coded testimony and the pawnless chessboard offers a specific, non-obvious angle on witness and interregnum themes. The concept of walking as encrypted language transforms familiar messenger tropes through embodied performance. Risk-taking in the inverted power dynamic (survivor using theatrical skills to crack authoritarian composure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The post-apocalyptic tribunal setting and "nomadic penumbra" image feel slightly inherited from genre templates but are made particular through the gallery acoustics and historian lens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara as "crisis actor real crisis survivor" frames her opening reflection, drives her self-appointment as historian, enables her coded walking (theatrical skill), and produces the climactic grief performance that cracks the Regent. Present in setup, middle development (pacing code), and closure (tears/U-N-B-I-N-D). The duality is causally active across all three beats and the final choice hinges on her theatrical expertise weaponized as truth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in paragraph two (Regent moves knight), Elara stops "directly before" it at the climax, and the Regent stares "at the empty squares on the board where the common people should have been" before releasing the key. Present in setup and closure; the pawnless state charges the Regent's reversal. Middle development is thin—it's described but not handled between the knight move and final stare—so it falls short of multi-beat causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" opens the story as atmospheric descriptor ("perpetual twilight that wandered the ruins") and recurs metaphorically in "interregnum" framing, but it does not constrain tactics or alter on-page choices. The concept colors tone and setting without shaping what Elara or the Regent can do. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is attributed to the Regent in paragraph two, illustrated through the surgical amputation metaphor and the knight-move "click that echoed like a breaking bone," then dramatized in her declaration "stability requires sacrifice." The thumb-tremor and final composure-crack show the trait under stress. Present in setup and payoff, with visible cost (cracking mask). Middle beat is thin: the trait is asserted but does not enable a second distinct choice between setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Unbind" as word and concept structures the escalation: Elara's pacing spells R-E-L-E-A-S-E (paragraph five), then U-N-B-I-N-D (paragraph seven) becomes "command, plea, and prophecy" that redefines the prisoner's release, the Regent's heart, and the future. The final door-unlock is its direct consequence. Present across setup (thematic seed), middle (spelled message), and closure (articulated meaning + key-turn). Swapping it would break the coded-walking mechanic and thematic climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Walking-that-spells-words is signaled in paragraph four ("coded language of steps she'd learned in the theaters"), demonstrated immediately (S-E-C-R-E-T), escalated (R-E-L-E-A-S-E), and drives the final beat (U-N-B-I-N-D). The mechanics matter: the Regent "recognizing a performance but unable to discern its script" heightens tension. Present in all three gates with causal pressure. Slightly reducible because the prisoner's tapping response could function without the spelling, though the theatrical resonance would collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustics amplify the Regent's voice, magnify her thumb-tremor, carry the prisoner's tapping, and echo the final door-groan "through the gallery." The curved marble and perimeter shape Elara's pacing path. Present in setup (description), middle (acoustic surveillance), and closure (groan echo charges release). The gallery's properties constrain communication and spotlight micro-gestures, making it essential to the witness-historian premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interregnum is named in paragraph one and frames the power vacuum ("handful of powers left," "state that no longer existed"). It motivates the pawnless board and the Regent's precarious authority. Present in setup and thematically at closure ("allow the game to begin again"), but it does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat—Elara's timeline is "days" and "the next day" without urgent pressure. The timeframe enables stakes but does not actively narrow options within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to be "historian of small gestures" is stated in paragraph one, motivates her perimeter walk and attention to the Regent's thumb-tremor, and colors the closing line ("a silent historian, recording the small gesture"). Present in setup and closure. Middle friction is modest: the desire guides observation but does not conflict with survival instinct or force a visible trade-off until the final tears, which risk exposure. The motivation shapes lens more than it constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears as phrase in paragraph six ("the luminous absence of all she had lost filled the gallery, a light that illuminated the emptiness") and again in the final paragraph, charging Elara's grief performance and the pawnless board image. Tone coheres as elegiac, restrained, and metaphorically dense throughout. The penultimate recurrence reweights the opening "nomadic penumbra" and closes the tonal arc. Modulates with pressure: shifts from observational cool to raw emotion without tonal rupture.</comment>
