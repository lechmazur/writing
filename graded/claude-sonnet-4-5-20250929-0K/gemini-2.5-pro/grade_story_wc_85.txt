<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and professional curse are sharply established, his motive clear. The final choice—to restore memory rather than continue profiting from false ones—emerges naturally from his discovery. Internal contradiction is visible in his pride-turned-curse trait, and the embodied emotion in "acidic burn of tempered regret" grounds his state. Minor slip: Anya's family forgetting her entirely is told rather than dramatized through a present interaction that would test Elias's knowledge gap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat. The closure—Elias's shift from guilt to purposeful reconstruction—lands on the page with visible cost (he must now painstakingly rebuild what was erased, starting with her family). The causal lens holds: discovery of the structured absence drives his new mission. One meaningful tightening occurs when the driftwood reveals the void, narrowing his options to active resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood are vivid and purposeful; the shore's sensory detail ("sandpaper on bone") is well-filtered through Elias's grief. The watch hand and driftwood function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor gap: the terrace itself does not constrain a middle choice, serving more as frame than pressure point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens when the driftwood reveals the structured absence rather than simple death. The protagonist's agency drives the ending: his choice to weaponize his own attribute forecloses his prior lucrative path. The cost is legible: a painstaking, dangerous restoration project. One solid reversal (from passive mourning to active memory warfare) narrows options with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete events: silence as weapon, memory as resistance, complicity in erasure. The final image—watch hand and driftwood as twin artifacts—offers a resonant answer to the withheld-truth question without moralizing. Subtext operates in "sieved hush" and the family's amnesia. The story resists tidy resolution; Elias's regret persists alongside his new purpose. No overt thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature ("acidic burn," "sieved hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though "manufactures false memories" and "structured absence" edge toward clinical register for a grief-stricken genealogist. Psychic distance modulates effectively at the driftwood discovery. Elias's professional lexicon justifies the genealogical and memory-trade terminology. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high, each line advancing character or stakes. Minor scaffold detected: "His motivation was singular and sharp" states rather than shows, and "the weight of a withheld truth" recurs without added pressure. "Tempered regret" appears twice in identical phrasing. The figurative density ("bleeding," "sieved," "sandpaper on bone") is vivid but occasionally ornamental without altering tactics. Clarity and propulsion remain solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—memory erasure as totalizing weapon—offers a fresh angle on grief and complicity. Elias's shift from trafficker to restorer is earned. The driftwood-as-psychic-signature method is specific. However, the black-market-genealogist-with-memory-powers setup leans toward fantasy-template territory, and the "discover her family doesn't remember her" reveal is well-executed but not structurally surprising. The ending's turn to active resistance elevates originality within the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his guilt drives the shore search and his final choice to restore memories. His professional attribute (manufacturing false memories) enables the ending's tactical shift. Appears in opening, middle discovery, and closure decision—three distinct beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The watch hand is introduced early ("all that was left of Anya"), returns in the driftwood discovery section, and appears in the final image alongside the driftwood. It reweights meaning at closure as one of two artifacts. However, it is handled passively—description rather than use—and does not constrain a middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is introduced early, recurs in the driftwood revelation ("hollow, sieved hush"), and frames the ending's stakes (the silence he must undo). It shapes Elias's understanding of what was done to Anya and drives his final mission. The concept narrows options: he cannot bring her back, only restore memory. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced early as "damning talent," enables Elias's past offer to Anya (false memories as escape), and drives the closure: he will use the same power to restore true memories. The tradeoff is visible—his skill led to her death and now must undo the erasure. Appears in three beats with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Quell" appears twice: once as motive ("quell the ghost") and once as method ("quell the acidic burn"). At closure, the quelling shifts from forgetting to forcing remembrance—a charged reversal. The action defines the ending's stakes. Could theoretically swap for "silence" or "end," but the water-through-sieve connotation ties to "sieved hush," adding specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sifting driftwood is signaled early, occupies the middle search sequence with concrete sensory detail, and delivers the key revelation (the gouged oak). The method is specific and irreplaceable—only this tactile search yields the "structured absence." Mechanics matter: his thumb in the groove triggers the discovery. Present across setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, establishing dusk's liminal tone. It does not constrain a middle choice or supply resources that alter outcome. The shore (a distinct location) does the heavy lifting. The terrace functions as lyric bookend rather than pressure point, earning credit for charged reprise but not tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Five long years" and "unspoken words" frame the timeframe and appear in both the motive section and the revelation (family's amnesia, not reticence). The temporal weight shapes Elias's desperation. However, time does not tighten tactics on the page—no countdown or clock. The element reweights meaning at closure (unspoken becomes unmemory) with conceptual cost, qualifying as lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motive is dramatized early and drives every beat: the shore search, the driftwood discovery, the final choice to restore memory. Internal friction is present—his guilt complicates the quest. The discovery reweights the withheld truth (not hidden, but erased), and the ending forecloses his prior path with visible cost. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is named twice and permeates the narrative through embodied detail ("acidic burn"). Tone modulates from passive mourning to cold purpose at closure. The regret does not vanish but "shared space with a cold, clear purpose," charging the final image. Coherent through turns with purposeful evolution under pressure.</comment>
