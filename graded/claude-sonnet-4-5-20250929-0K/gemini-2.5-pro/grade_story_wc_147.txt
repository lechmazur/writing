<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and sustained—to capture the "gathered hush"—with embodied struggle when the psychic maelstrom nearly overwhelms him. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between instinctive flight and mission-driven will, culminating in a choice (isolating the priestess's peace) that forecloses survival with visible cost. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("primal scream," "profound peace") rather than consistently particular embodiment, and the final acceptance reads slightly neat given the extremity of the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (submersible, temple, mission) and the causal lens holds: distress signal enables descent → vial capture → psychic overwhelm → focused selection → sealed vial with power loss. The closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—he achieves the capture but dies, forecloses survival with visible cost (flatlined power, dying breath). One constraint (oxygen countdown) persistently shapes tactics. Minor slip: the mechanism by which he "pulls" a thread from the chaos leans slightly abstract at the peak beat, but the cost and closure image remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly anchored with phosphorescent algae, obsidian altar, and crushing silence; the environment constrains choice (oxygen timer, helmet light, suit chronometer). The vial as micro-setting object charges the final image. Deduction: spatial choreography is thin—kneeling at the altar is the only physical position detailed—and the submersible's interior/exterior relationship is vague, weakening the sense of tactical options within the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake (capture the hush before life support fails) is signaled early and tightens via oxygen alarm and psychic chaos. The protagonist's agency drives the turn: he overrides flight instinct, searches the torrent, isolates the priestess's peace, and seals the vial—each step narrows options with visible cost (nearly dropping the vial, power flatline, death). The tightening is causal and the price unmistakable. Minor gap: the middle escalation (phantom pain, borrowed sorrow) feels slightly iterative rather than a distinct pressure turn before the final focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the desire to hold the ephemeral versus mortality, the contrast between conquest and companionship. The priestess's serene acceptance reweights the protagonist's earlier framing ("not a trophy of conquest, but a companion") without overt moralizing. Deduction: the final paragraph's articulation ("It was a perfect memory, and now, it was mine") edges toward theme statement rather than pure image, and "lonesome splendor" as a phrase feels slightly ornamental rather than earned by prior texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent distance; perceptual signature (scientific terms like "capture matrix," "resonant frequencies") anchors voice. Diction control is strong under pressure, and the compression ("a wisp of silent light") fits the register. Minor deduction: no dialogue to test distinction, and some phrases ("maelstrom of sensation," "hurricane inside me") lean generic at peak stress rather than character-particular. The elision of submersible mechanics is purposeful and serves momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the opening/closing images are strong. Clarity is maintained through complex action. Deductions: minor template cadence in the middle ("I felt...tasted...heard") and one paraphrase loop ("ignore the phantom pain" / "ignored the...instinctual terror"). The phrase "lonesome splendor" in the final third reads slightly elevated/ornamental relative to the prior register. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits the penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater archaeology, psychic resonance capture, and dying-wish frame offers a fresh angle on both treasure-hunt and ephemeral-beauty tropes. The priestess's acceptance as the isolated thread is a non-obvious emotional choice. Deduction: the core setup (lone scientist in perilous environment racing the clock for unique discovery) is a familiar template, and the vial-as-capture-device leans slightly toward genre convenience rather than world-integrated inevitability. Transformation is present but partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is the signal sender; the choice to enable it before descent frames the mission, and the signal's death (power flatline) marks the final cost. Present in setup and closure, but the signal itself does not constrain middle choices—it functions as frame rather than recurring pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure participation via its loss), but causal pressure on tactics is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vial is handled at the altar (uncorked, held, sealed) and returns with reweighted meaning in the final image (held to chest, pearlescent glow, companion). Its engineered properties (capture matrix, resonant frequencies) enable the climax action. Three gates met; causal pressure is high (nearly dropped, seals the thread); closure linkage strong. Specificity (crystal, faceted, perfume-vial form) is load-bearing and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is defined early, drives the mission stake, and the concept's unique attribute (touches memories) generates the psychic chaos that must be overcome. It shapes tactics (searching for a single thread within the noise) and charges the final image (the captured echo). Three gates met; causal pressure clear; closure participation direct. Minor cap: the concept is articulated more than physically enacted—handling is abstract ("pulls free") rather than tool/gesture specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Touches memories" constrains the protagonist on the page: the maelstrom crashes against consciousness, seizes limbs, nearly makes him drop the vial, and forces the strategy shift to unsnarling rather than simple capture. The trait enables the priestess's memory as solution and generates visible cost (terror, trembling hand). Three gates met; beat involvement spans setup through climax; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is signaled ("I had to unsnarl this psychic tangle") and drives the major turn: instead of fighting or fleeing, the protagonist lets the torrent wash over him and searches for a single thread. The action is specific to the attribute (memory chaos) and enables the isolation of the priestess's peace. Three gates; causal pressure strong; swappability low. Minor deduction: the mechanic of unsnarling is stated more than shown in granular gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Override instinct" is signaled ("I had to succeed by overriding instinct itself") and its mechanics matter: squeezing eyes shut, ignoring phantom pain, refusing to abort. The method shapes the climax choice (focus on motivation, pull the thread) and differentiates success from failure. Three gates met; causal role clear. Deduction: the method overlaps heavily with general willpower—specificity of technique (why this override versus another mental strategy) is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The temple setting pressures choices via the altar (kneeling position, obsidian surface reflecting light), the crushing depth, and the phosphorescent algae as ambient anchor. The "forgotten" status primes the gathered-hush concept. Setup and closure participation present; middle constraint modest (altar as workspace). Deduction: the temple's architecture does not supply resources or tactical variation—columns and ceiling are described but inert—so it trends more atmospheric than mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The oxygen countdown is tracked (chronometer warning, red strobe alarm, ragged breath, flatlined reserves) and tightens decisions at every beat: the protagonist must work quickly, nearly aborts, and dies when power runs out. Three gates met; the live clock shapes attempts and ending with undeniable cost. High integration; the timeframe is indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Harness the ephemeral" is dramatized in the mission setup, conflicted when psychic chaos threatens to overwhelm, and resolved in the choice to isolate a single thread and seal it. The desire drives every on-page action and trades survival for capture. Three gates; friction between want (capture) and cost (death) is high and visible. Minor deduction: articulated slightly more than embodied—"the only thing that gave my life meaning" edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" modulates from the opening grandeur ("columns thick with phosphorescent algae," "liquid midnight") through the chaotic middle to the serene final image (pearlescent glow, quiet companionship). Tone is coherent and charges the ending. Deduction: the phrase "lonesome splendor" itself appears only once in the final third, reading slightly imposed rather than woven through the texture, and the "serene acceptance" closure moment risks static calm that undercuts the tonal complexity established earlier.</comment>
