<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "discover purpose in the pauses" is consistently embodied through her choice to abandon glass-making for observation, then decisively return to the kiln with transformed intent. Internal contradiction appears when she both fears fire and uses it to seal her final piece, with the shift earned by the frost-cipher discovery. The ledger's violence→frost's serenity arc constrains her final choice to create rather than report, forecloses revenge with visible cost. Minor: the "steadily adaptive" trait is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen chooses creation over exposure, sealing the ledger in glass with frost patterns etched around it—a decisive renunciation of vengeance that forecloses reporting the smugglers, with the conceptual cost made visible in "the silence that followed" becoming "a conversation she finally understood." Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the week-long frost-reading sequence accumulates density, then the kiln-lighting reweights prior fire-terror into creation-wisdom. Orientation anchors (glass artist, canyon, post-fire) arrive by line 3. One meaningful deepening: the ledger's discovery→frost-pattern recognition→cave location→final artwork progression tightens stakes from survival to purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The canyon micro-setting constrains choice: shaded sentinel rock and river reeds supply ephemeral frost landmarks that Kaelen must read at dawn, forcing her retracing path and timing. The cobalt shard on the windowsill charges the climactic recognition beat when ice-lace echoes the ledger glyphs. Setting details—petrified wood curtain, tributary canyon—are filtered through her artist's eye and directly enable plot progression. Spatial choreography (kiln→window→sentinel rock→tributary→cave→studio) tracks cleanly across the week-long search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering why smugglers attacked, signaled when she finds the ledger in paragraph 2. Escalation under Accumulative lens: initial hand-shaking at replacement kiln→deliberate watching→frost-pattern recognition→week of dawn alignments→cave discovery, each beat narrowing options and raising knowledge-cost. Agency-driven tightening: her choice to "hold it against the frost patterns" and retrace the path (not report immediately) forecloses safety, with visible cost in the walk-back realization "They had thought she'd seen their route." Final choice to seal the ledger rather than expose the smugglers trades justice for art, paying the price on-page by lighting the kiln "for the first time in months."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of violence into creation, terror into wisdom—emerges through the fire/ice dialectic without direct statement. The final artwork (charcoal symbols blurred, frost patterns etched) offers a non-literal answer: beauty survives by holding both destruction and serenity, neither erasing the other. Subtext in "the canyon was no less quiet, but now its silence was a conversation" reweights the opening's "indifferent" stars into meaningful dialogue. No thematic echo or moralizing; the ledger-in-glass image does the conceptual work. Earned insight arises from the week of dawn observation, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: an artist's eye that sees "crystalline geometry," "lacework of ice," "fractal beauty," filtering all observation through form and light. POV distance remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction ("luminous," "maw of blackened brick," "drifting resonance") suits an artist-narrator without register drift. Purposeful compression in the week-long search montage ("One symbol corresponded…Another matched…") accelerates without losing clarity. Minor: "steadily adaptive" and "drifting resonance" phrases feel slightly elevated for peak stress moments, though voice texture holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short crisis beats ("She didn't enter; she didn't need to") contrast with longer reflective passages. Information density is high—most lines advance both plot and theme. No loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in opening paragraph ("ghost-heat," "maw," "fragile, cooling vessel") clusters metaphors but remains coherent. Template risk: "She learned…She sought…" parallel stems in paragraph 3, though brief and voice-motivated. Closure sentence ("The canyon was no less quiet, but now its silence was a conversation she finally understood") avoids overwriting and lands the thematic turn cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frost-as-cipher concept is specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar artist-recovery arc through the ephemeral-map mechanic. Smuggler violence+glass artist+canyon frost feels like an earned synthesis, not a template. The final choice to seal rather than expose subverts expected justice-arc resolution. Risk: lyric pacing and reflection-heavy middle could stall, but the week-long search sequence maintains momentum. Minor derivation: artist-finding-purpose-after-trauma is a common frame, though the frost-ledger mechanism and renunciation-of-vengeance closure offer fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen drives every turn: abandons kiln (paragraph 2), begins watching (paragraph 3), recognizes frost pattern (paragraph 4), retraces path (paragraphs 5–6), chooses to seal ledger rather than report (paragraph 7). Her decision to create rather than expose forecloses justice with visible cost. Present in setup, development (frost recognition), and payoff (kiln-lighting choice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ledger strip appears in discovery (paragraph 2), week-long alignment attempts (paragraph 5), and final sealing (paragraph 7). Its symbols enable the retracing action and are transformed into "soft, gray ghosts" in the closure artwork. Returns with reweighted meaning: from violence-testament to creation-material. Causal pressure: without it, no search or final piece.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" appears explicitly as "a scorched testament to a violence" (paragraph 2) and again in the final artwork as "the scorched testament of the ledger strip" (paragraph 7). Shapes stakes by framing the violence-into-art transformation and charges the closure image. Could be swapped for "burned evidence" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is told in paragraph 3 ("she began to watch the world instead, becoming steadily adaptive") but demonstrated through the shift from kiln-work to observation and then week-long frost-reading. Enables the retracing tactic but lacks a visible on-page tradeoff or cost moment tied explicitly to adaptation. Present in setup (told), development (implied through watching), and payoff (return to kiln).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" is the core action of paragraphs 5–6: "she had to retrace their path," then "For a week, she rose before the sun…aligning the symbols." This action redefines options by leading to the cave and the realization that they attacked her, which directly enables her final choice to seal rather than report. Present in middle and payoff; without it, no closure choice exists.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" signaled in paragraph 4 ("patterns in the morning frost were not random chaos but a language"), mechanic explained in paragraph 5 ("One symbol corresponded to a branching pattern…Another matched the starbursts of ice"), and used across the week-long search. Shapes the retracing attempt and is etched into the final artwork. Irreplaceable: no other method would fit the canyon setting and artist's eye equally well.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Canyon setting supplies frost-forming conditions (cold air, moisture, topology directing wind), the sentinel rock and river reeds as ephemeral landmarks, and the tributary with petrified wood curtain hiding the cave. Constrains timing (dawn-only) and method (alignment). Present in setup ("quiet canyon under stars"), development (landmarks), and payoff (studio under canyon rim). Without it, the frost-cipher would not function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" is anchored in paragraph 1 ("months ago") and shapes the opening paralysis ("her hands would shake when the flames licked"). The week timeframe in paragraph 5 tightens the search tactic (daily dawn observations). Post-fire recovery pressures the return to the kiln as a stakes-raising choice. Present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is explicitly named in paragraph 1 and dramatized through her choice to sift the ruin "not for what could be saved, but to discover purpose," then through watching/observation replacing creation, culminating in the realization "The knowledge was enough" and the final artwork that holds "the purpose she had found." Friction: fear of fire (shaking hands) vs. need to create. Present in setup, development (watching choice), and payoff (kiln-lighting as purpose found).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" as tone appears explicitly in paragraph 4 ("A quiet understanding settled over her, a drifting resonance") and modulates from opening paralysis ("fragile, cooling vessel") through serene observation ("learned the way the wind sculpted") to charged closure ("silence was a conversation she finally understood"). Coherent through turns; the drift-to-clarity arc charges the final image. Tone reflects the Accumulative lens and supports the fire/ice thematic synthesis.</comment>
