<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his internal contradiction (resigned yet trying) is dramatized through the rosette and his shift in method. The choir members remain generic—no individual voices or embodied resistance beyond "tense silence" and "shuffling feet." The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned; we see no individual member's shift in stance, no particular face or voice that carries the weight of unlearning hatred. The collective "they" flattens what should be a crucible of distinct, conflicting people.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the choir achieves fragile unity, Elias moves from resigned to expectant, and the cost is visible—two years of struggle, tonight's failure, and the acknowledgment that the harmony is "imperfect, wavering." The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through the library reflection and the breath-to-hum progression. Orientation is swift (velvet library, autumn, Elias with rosette). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias shifts from forcing blend to subtracting noise, narrowing his method and enabling the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn frame the opening effectively, but the rehearsal hall lacks spatial anchors—no sense of room size, seating, or how the circle forms. The rosette appears in Elias's hand and is held up, but we never see it placed or its fretwork examined by the choir. Body/tool constraint is minimal; the rosette is more symbolic token than object that shapes a choice. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual and generic ("deep quiet," "dry leaves").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving choral harmony despite entrenched animosity—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when tonight's failure forces Elias to abandon his additive method; the shift to "subtracting noise" narrows his options and forecloses the prior approach with visible cost (two years of effort deemed "wrong"). The final hum is a crystallization of fragile unity, but the choir's agency is passive—they follow instructions rather than make a hard choice themselves. The cost (generations of hatred momentarily "carved away") is felt, though the rival townships' specifics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core theme—creation through subtraction, harmony via removal of noise—emerges clearly from the rosette image and the breath exercise, avoiding overt statement until Elias's necessary exposition to the choir. The final image of collective resonance answers the thematic question without moralizing. However, the metaphor is somewhat on-the-nose: the rosette's air/wood dichotomy maps too neatly onto resentment/harmony, and Elias articulates the parallel explicitly rather than letting it work through implication. The piece resists neat closure (the harmony is "imperfect, wavering") but the path from metaphor to application feels overly tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and clean; Elias's perceptual signature (woodworking terms, "vanishing arts," the rosette as "microcosm") is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with elevated register ("fretwork," "grudging handshakes") that fits an educated choir director. The brief dialogue—"This is a piece of a zither…"—reads naturally and advances the thematic turn without exposition dump. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the library reflection, slightly pulled back during the rehearsal to accommodate the collective "they." No head-hopping; interiority remains Elias's throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences do two jobs (e.g., "autumn was performing its slow, magnificent decay" grounds season and tone). Minor scaffold appears: "a familiar, expectantly resigned sigh" front-loads both the attribute and its label; "traveled stillness" in the library echoes the required tone term but feels imposed rather than emergent. One near-loop: "His method had been wrong; he had been trying to add more…" followed immediately by "True harmony…is achieved not by addition, but by subtracting noise" restates the same insight without added pressure. Figurative density is high in the opening paragraph ("performing its slow, magnificent decay," "microcosm," "forged from the bitter remnants") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core conceit—teaching harmony by silent breath and subtraction rather than more practice—offers a fresh angle on the fractured-community-choir premise. The rosette as teaching object (negative space enabling sound) is specific and non-obvious. However, the underlying arc (struggling choir achieves breakthrough via unconventional method) is template-familiar, and the resolution (they achieve unity by feeling "one pulse") leans toward inspirational-workshop cliché. The two-year struggle and tonight's failure add weight, but the final image of collective hum feels more like a beginning than a transformation with visible cost. The piece commits to its premise but does not fully escape the orbit of similar redemption-through-art narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout, makes the key decision (shift from addition to subtraction), conducts the final exercise, and moves from resigned to expectant. He is present in both library and rehearsal, drives the turn, and his choice enables the closure. His observation in the library precedes and shapes the action in rehearsal; the decision alters tactics and achieves the fragile unity. Cost is visible (two years deemed "wrong," tonight's failure). Role is causal across beats and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rosette is introduced early (library scene), handled physically ("turned...over in his palm"), held up to the choir, and used as the teaching metaphor that enables the method shift. It appears in three beats: opening reflection, the turn in the library, and the rehearsal explanation. Its specific property (fretwork as negative space) directly shapes Elias's realization and the new tactic. The rosette does not reappear in the final hum, limiting closure linkage, but its conceptual charge persists. Specificity is high; removing it would collapse the metaphor and the turn. Integration is strong but not indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is named in the opening ("his life's great struggle against the vanishing arts, not just of woodworking or music, but of community itself") and frames Elias's motivation. The concept shapes his stake (preserving collaborative beauty) but does not constrain or enable a specific middle-beat choice—he does not, for example, choose between modern shortcuts and traditional methods under pressure. It resonates thematically and colors his worldview, but on-page tactics (breathing, humming) are not differentiated by the "vanishing" quality. Present across the arc, developmentally thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is labeled early ("a familiar, expectantly resigned sigh") and dramatized: Elias tries despite feeling the work is "akin to turning a tide with a teacup." The trait constrains his opening stance (he dismisses the choir after failure, retreats to the library) and shifts at closure (he listens "no longer resigned, but purely expectant"). The shift is signaled rather than tested by a hard choice; we see the before-state and after-state but not a moment where resignation and expectation collide in a visible tradeoff. Present in framing and closure; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once in the final beat: "he used his hands to denote not volume or pitch, but a sense of shared space, of yielding." The action occurs at closure and differentiates this conducting moment from prior efforts, but it is not set up earlier or tested in a middle beat. The verb is specific yet near-swappable with "signal" or "shape" without breaking the logic. It contributes to the final image but is not causally active across beats. Late arrival and moderate specificity limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method "by subtracting noise" is discovered in the library ("True harmony...is achieved not by addition, but by subtracting noise"), explicitly named in the rehearsal ("We are going to learn how to carve it away"), and executed in the breath-and-hum exercise. It drives the turn, shapes all rehearsal tactics (release tension, stop words, yield), and enables the closure. Mechanics are visible: no words, shared breath, single note. The method is essential; reverting to prior tactics would undo the arc. Present across setup, development, and payoff with high specificity and causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "velvet library in autumn" anchors the opening scene and provides the reflective space for Elias's turn, but it does not constrain his choice—he could have had the realization anywhere quiet. Autumn is atmospheric ("gold and rust," "dry leaves") but does not alter tactics. The rehearsal hall (second setting) is unnamed and featureless, offering no spatial resource or obstacle. Setting functions as mood and frame, not as active pressure. Present early, functional for tone, but replaceable without structural cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is named ("a timeframe measured not in weeks or months, but in grudging handshakes") and dramatized via "two years" of prior struggle and tonight's failure. The long duration establishes the weight of the problem and makes tonight's turn significant, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the on-page action—Elias and the choir are not racing a deadline or choosing under time pressure. The span is context, not constraint. Present in framing and affects perceived cost; developmentally passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony" is Elias's named sole motivation, dramatized through two years of effort, tonight's failure, and the method shift. The desire is tested when he must abandon his prior approach (visible cost of admitting error) and gamble on an untried tactic. Internal friction appears: he feels resigned yet persists. The final hum realizes the goal imperfectly, and the text notes "for the first time, there was no dissonance," confirming causal payoff. The motivation drives setup, middle turn, and closure with felt cost and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is named in the library ("the library's traveled stillness") and returns implicitly in "fragile calm" and the choir's final collective breath. Tone is consistent—contemplative, measured, elegiac—and modulates subtly from resigned melancholy (opening) to tentative hope (close). The phrase "traveled" suggests accumulated passage, fitting the long struggle. However, tone does not shift sharply under the rehearsal's pressure; the prose remains steady and elevated throughout. Coherent and thematically apt, but it does not charge the final image with contrast or surprise. Present and purposeful; impact is moderate.</comment>
