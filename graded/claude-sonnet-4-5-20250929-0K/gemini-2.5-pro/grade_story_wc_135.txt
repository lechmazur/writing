<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (excavating, cataloging, listening). His "reactively visionary" trait provides internal texture and shapes his approach to fragments. The woman's response to the valve demonstrates earned emotional progression with embodied grief ("breath caught," "trembling finger"). Minor weakness: Kaelen's arc is more about purpose-reaffirmation than transformation, though the woman's shift provides the story's emotional change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (who, where, after-exile timeframe). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the valve arrival mid-story reweights the collection's meaning, and the woman's testimony at the end crystallizes the archive's social function. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the woman's shift from despair to resolve, with visible cost (the lost husband, the broken trumpet sequence). The "staggered intervals" structure teaches the pattern early and pays off when the valve connects to testimony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, rain-slick stones, and liminal shoreline constrain Kaelen's daily search pattern and supply the valve. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("mist...tasted of salt," "slick, pale stones"). The workshop's shelves function as micro-setting that charges the woman's recognition scene. The harbor after rain recurs at closure ("sound of the surf"), reweighting the opening image with the woman's new resolve. Environment pressures the woman's choice to stay rather than retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rebuilding shattered narrative through fragments. The valve's arrival mid-story provides meaningful tightening by raising the question of whether the archive can truly hearten survivors. The woman's testimony and her shift from despair to resolve deliver visible cost (accepting loss while choosing resilience) and narrow options (she commits to the city rather than retreat). One solid deepening under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more gradual accumulation than sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory, rebuilding identity from loss) emerges organically through the valve, the woman's testimony, and the archive's function. Kaelen's line "Nothing is ever completely lost" avoids didacticism by being earned through prior scene work and dramatized in the woman's physical response (shoulders straightening). The final image—Kaelen turning back to the sea—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the woman's silence before speech and in the gap between the broken trumpet and the preserved valve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV throughout with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Kaelen reads "patterns of barnacles" and "water-worn shoes" as archival data. Narrative diction matches his profession ("liminal space," "compile fragments into meaning") without becoming pompous. The woman's dialogue carries distinct voice ("north-gate horn") and subtext (the unfinished trumpet sequence). Minor slip: "ocean-spray archivist" in the opening reads slightly label-forward, though the specificity earns its place.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift ("Kaelen knelt," "She peered," "He was not just"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction for one mildly elevated phrase in peak moment: "another fragment delivered, connecting a piece of metal to a moment of failed heroism and final, desperate love" stacks modifiers where simpler syntax might sharpen. Otherwise clean propulsion and no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "reactively visionary archivist" premise offers a fresh angle on post-disaster recovery, blending tactile archive work with psychometry. The valve as both object and testimony-trigger is specific and non-obvious. The woman's testimony transforms the valve from artifact to relational anchor. Risk: the accumulative structure and quiet ending avoid conventional climax without gimmickry. Minor dock: the "exile ended" backstory and flotilla breach remain somewhat abstract, limiting the premise's full transformation into lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen appears throughout, but most actions are observational (scanning debris, excavating, listening). His decision to place the valve on display and his gesture to other shelves shape the woman's turn. Present in closure (watching, turning back to sea), though the woman's choice drives the final beat more than his.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The valve is excavated in beat one, cleaned and displayed mid-story, recognized by the woman in beat three, and its broken state (unfinished sequence) charges her testimony. Specific properties (three mother-of-pearl pistons, council sigil) matter to recognition. Swapping it for another instrument would collapse the woman's testimony and the story's central hinge. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is signaled early ("charting the ghosts of ships," "memories of families by...single...shoes") and shapes Kaelen's method throughout. The woman's testimony makes the concept concrete by filling one absence with narrative. The final image (Kaelen ready for "the next fragment") reprises the concept with reweighted meaning. It constrains his approach and participates in closure, though it operates more as thematic frame than direct tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is labeled and demonstrated once: Kaelen touches the valve and feels "phantom echo of brassy sound and panicked breath." This trait enables his archival insight but does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost. Present in setup and middle, but absent from closure. Functional but not indispensable; his listening to the woman would work without the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Hearten" is signaled as purpose early ("his work was to hearten the survivors") and dramatized in the climactic exchange: Kaelen's gesture to the shelves and his words cause the woman's shoulders to straighten and her resolve to return. The action drives the story's major turn and is irreplaceable—without it, the valve remains inert and the woman's shift unmotivated. Strong closure participation and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" is introduced early ("work progressed through staggered intervals, dictated by...tides") and its mechanics matter: "Weeks might pass...then a single object like the valve would arrive." This rhythm structures the narrative and explains why the valve's arrival mid-story is significant. Present in setup and middle, and the woman's ship arrival follows the pattern. Shapes the accumulative design but does not directly alter a closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor supplies the valve via tide, and the workshop overlooking the harbor houses the archive that draws the woman. "Slick stones" create minor physical choreography ("her grandchildren trailing"). The harbor's liminal space (land/sea boundary) mirrors Kaelen's conceptual work. Setting returns in closure ("sound of the surf") and constrains the search pattern. Solid integration across beats and ending, though not indispensable—the core action could occur elsewhere with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" anchors the timeframe and explains the "skeletal vessel carrying...families" and the woman's "generation spent in waiting." The post-exile context motivates Kaelen's work and the woman's weariness. Present in setup and closure framing, but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Functional context rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's desire "to compile fragments into meaning" is dramatized through excavation, cleaning, labeling, and his climactic explanation to the woman. The motivation drives all his choices and shapes the woman's response. Friction appears in the gap between his solitary method and the need for testimony to complete meaning. The final turn (woman's resolve) validates and reweights his purpose. Strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>
