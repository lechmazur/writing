<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior landscape combines precise technical detail with visceral physicality ("sweat-soaked and trembling"), and her method of attuning frequencies shows clear capability under stress. The "logically emotional" framework is embodied through "cold knot of dread...acknowledged, analyzed, and then filed away," demonstrating contradictory impulses in action. However, the motivation to protect the artifact remains abstract—told rather than dramatized through competing wants or moral friction—and no meaningful internal conflict complicates her choices. The final exhaustion registers physical cost but lacks a felt decision or renunciation that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements: the hostile frequency intrudes → Elara adapts through vibrational matching → the threat is neutralized. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse gallery, drift-ice marina, government-issue coat). The closure unit is a Decisive Change—silence replaces the invasive hum—with physical cost ("slumped," "trembling") legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frequencies lock "in a violent shriek that threatened to crack the very foundation," narrowing options to subsume-or-fail. The cost, while visible, leans heavily on embodied exhaustion rather than a consequential trade-off or foreclosed path, preventing entry into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina's "groaning, shifting floes" and the lighthouse's iron staircase and bedrock crypt anchor space and movement cleanly. Sensory hierarchy is strong: Elara notices sonic detail first ("discordant hum...grinding teeth"), filtering through her professional expertise. The crypt keeper's key and the Siren's Heart constrain her method—she must use the key to access the console, and the Heart's fragility forbids "blunt contest of power"—shaping tactical choices. The final image of "violet dusk" and the "steady, azure-coated engineer" charges closure by anchoring her endurance in place and role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the Siren's Heart from the invasive frequency—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One clear tightening: the frequencies lock in a "violent shriek" that forces Elara's final "willed push" to subsume the threat, narrowing options to succeed-or-catastrophic-failure. Agency is present but constrained: Elara enacts a plan with minimal improvisation, and no live alternative or competing good complicates her choice. The cost is physical exhaustion rather than a moral trade-off or foreclosed relationship, keeping the score below 7.5. Escalation is smooth but lacks a reversal or deepening that would raise the stakes further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of absolution through integration ("not a destruction...but its cleansing, its forgiveness") emerges from the vibrational-matching mechanics and is embodied in the final beat: "neutralized within the Heart's harmonic field." However, "sonic absolution" is named explicitly in narration rather than discovered through image or implication, weakening subtextual resonance. The ending offers a quiet answer—peace through subsumption—but the choice itself is not morally complex; Elara never weighs competing goods or accepts ambiguity. The recurring "azure coat" and "golden sunset → violet dusk" frame the piece but do not reweight meaning at closure, functioning more as atmospheric bookends than thematic levers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices sonic and mechanical detail first, filtered through her engineer's training. Vocabulary ("hydrographic chart," "star-forged iron," "vibrational matching") is profession-apt and consistent. The prose modulates under stress—short clauses during the shriek, longer reflection afterward—without head-hopping. Two minor register slips: "fleshly ethereal" and "parasitic soundwave" feel authorial rather than character-voiced, and "sonic absolution" announces theme rather than letting Elara's perception carry it. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during peak stress, and interiority remains embodied rather than diagnostic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in mechanical beats ("attuning the Heart's baseline resonance to the key's immutable pitch"). However, multiple sentences open with similar stems: "She began," "She reached," "She knew," "She felt," creating template cadence across the middle third. Two paraphrase loops: "economy born of endless repetition" echoes the earlier "lifetime learning to conduct," and the explanation of vibrational matching partially repeats itself across two paragraphs. "Fleshly ethereal" is a mixed metaphor—flesh connotes material weight while ethereal implies weightlessness—muddling the sensory target. The final image is clean and propulsive, keeping the score above 6.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—solo engineer defends a sonic artifact through frequency manipulation—is specific and committed, avoiding stock fantasy tropes. However, the emotional arc (engineer faces external threat → neutralizes it through technical skill → exhausted relief) follows a competence-showcase template without internal transformation or moral ambiguity. The "logically emotional" framework and "drift-ice marina" setting offer fresh detail, but the central conflict lacks a non-obvious angle: no competing value complicates the choice, and no cost beyond physical fatigue registers. The transformation test flags moderate swappability: substitute "cyber attack on a quantum server" or "mystical poison in a sacred well" and the beat structure holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present by end of first third (azure coat mentioned in opening paragraph). Development: Elara's choice to adapt rather than "fight the resonance" alters tactics mid-story. Closure: she is named "the steady, azure-coated engineer" in the final sentence, charging the image with her endurance and role. The character drives two beats and shapes the ending. Cost is physical exhaustion rather than a decisional trade-off, preventing a score above 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: retrieved from the recess and described ("heavy, pitted...star-forged iron") in the second movement. Development: inserted into the console to enable the vibrational matching. Closure: not mentioned in the final beat. Two functional uses but no reprise or reweighted meaning at the end. The key enables the method but could be replaced with a biometric lock or direct mental interface with minor edits, indicating moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: the concept is not named or signaled in the opening third. Development: enacted through vibrational matching—Elara absorbs the hostile frequency rather than destroying it. Closure: explicitly named in the penultimate paragraph ("sonic absolution: not a destruction...but its cleansing") and the resulting silence demonstrates the concept. Late first appearance (past midpoint) and explicit labeling lower integration; the concept shapes the method but is told rather than discovered through image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("logically emotional...to feel the terror but act on the calculus of survival"). Development: embodied once when Elara "acknowledged, analyzed, and then filed away" the dread, but the subsequent action is purely technical without a visible trade-off between logic and emotion. Closure: not present in the final image. The trait is described more than it constrains choice; removing the label would not break the plot, as her actions read as straightforward competence under stress.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled when Elara recognizes she "couldn't simply fight the resonance" and "would have to adapt." Development: the decision to mirror the hostile frequency rather than counter it is the story's central tactical turn, driving the entire climactic beat. Closure: the adapted frequency is "enveloped, integrated, and neutralized," completing the arc. The action defines the method and is irreplaceable—without adaptation, the plot fails. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: not named until the foundation chamber scene (past the 40% mark). Development: the method is enacted in detail—attuning baseline, altering frequency, mirroring the intruder—and drives the climax. Closure: the neutralization is the direct result of vibrational matching. Late introduction caps the score at 4.6 by the gate model, but strong causal pressure and closure participation lift it within that constraint. The mechanics matter and shape Elara's tactics, preventing swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: named and described in the opening sentence ("drift-ice marina...groaning, shifting floes"). Development: the ice's "deep, resonant song" establishes the sonic environment, but it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource she uses. Closure: mentioned in the final sentence as "quiet again," serving as atmospheric bookend rather than tactical pressure. The setting is vivid but largely postcard; removing the ice and placing the lighthouse on a rocky shore would not alter the plot. Two-gate presence (setup and closure) with no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "fleeting golden sunset" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs. Development: no time pressure tightens Elara's decisions; the hostile frequency intrudes and is resolved without a ticking clock altering tactics. Closure: "violet dusk" marks passage but does not charge the ending with urgency or cost. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than functional; replacing "sunset" with "midnight" or "noon" would not change the stakes or escalation. Lyric reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("her purpose...was to protect a sacred artifact"). Development: the motivation drives every beat—retrieving the key, descending to the crypt, adapting the frequency—and the artifact's fragility constrains her method ("too fragile for such a blunt contest"). Closure: the "protected Heart" is named in the final paragraph, anchoring her relief. The motivation is consistent and causally active, though it remains abstract (no competing loyalty or moral friction tests it). Present across all gates with strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: the phrase "fleshly ethereal" appears once in the vibrational-matching scene ("a bizarre synthesis of mechanical hums and...the singing of her own blood cells"). Development: the tone oscillates between technical precision ("mathematical purity of the waveforms") and visceral embodiment ("torn apart and remade at a molecular level"), creating coherent texture. Closure: the final image ("sweat-soaked and trembling...hollow relief") leans physical rather than ethereal, diluting the tonal synthesis. The mixed metaphor "fleshly ethereal" muddies clarity, and the tone does not charge the ending as specified. Single strong middle beat with weak closure participation.</comment>
