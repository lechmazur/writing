<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's interior voice is concrete and embodied—"familiar spike of acrophobia making my stomach lurch," "claustrophobia a hot pulse in my throat"—grounding fear in sensation. The motivation shift from survival to proving vulnerability as power is ambitious but becomes label-speak in the final beats: "trembling with a certainty that felt like an earthquake in my soul" reads declarative rather than earned through micro-choices. The adaptiveness trait is stated but never genuinely constrained; Leo solves every puzzle without visible struggle or tradeoff. Julian's entrance deflates immediately into a foil rather than a live threat, and the protagonist's perfect recall of constellation ciphers under peak stress strains credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when quickly (library shelf, acrophobia, three days post-betrayal) and the Drive Lens reads Causal with motivated moves: whispers lead to library, cast yields cipher, cipher yields code. Closure is a Decisive Change—Leo triggers the failsafe, reversing power—but the cost is unclear on the page; Julian's terror is visible, but Leo's own forfeitures or new constraints are absent. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) does not apply; anchors land early. The failsafe's late introduction ("a failsafe Julian himself had designed but forgotten") reads convenient; if this command existed, why wouldn't Julian have guarded or erased it?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful: "exposed girders," "mangled roof," "skeletal ruin" create tactile decay. The loose panel, maintenance phone, and constellation-visible dome all constrain and enable Leo's choices—he must climb despite acrophobia, use what's present, decode by starlight. Spatial choreography (shelf height, panel location, entrance sightlines) tracks cleanly. The seashell and cast are handled objects that charge the closure, satisfying the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival against erasure—is clear, and one meaningful tightening occurs when headlights cut across the entrance, forcing Leo to act. The cipher-solving deepens knowledge, and the failsafe call narrows Julian's options. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than embodied; Leo's agency at the peak (keying in the code) unfolds without visible friction, cost, or alternative considered on the page. The confrontation deflates: Julian "expected a fight" but receives none, and his defeat is passive observation of distant sirens rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path for Leo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—identity as construct, vulnerability as power—emerges through the cast and whispers but is over-articulated in the final beats: "to prove that this aching vulnerability...was my greatest source of power" and "the violent, powerful certainty of my own existence" state rather than embody the question. The child's cast as a cipher is a concrete particular that reweights Julian's control, and the seashell's silence at closure is a resonant image. The piece resists easy morals in the middle but summarizes theme at the end instead of letting the failsafe image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, and Leo's perceptual signature—fear-driven noticing, stunt-trained adaptiveness—colors the narration: "the cold metal...bit into my palms," "my claustrophobia a hot pulse." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the cipher work. Julian's single line of dialogue is appropriately smooth and pleasant, fitting his actor persona. Minor diction slips occur under peak stress: "burning focus," "violent, powerful certainty" feel slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but the core voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and most sentences advance character or plot without padding. Figurative density is high in the opening third—"ghost he had programmed," "phantom limb of a past," "earthquake in my soul"—but these images cohere and avoid mixed metaphors. A paraphrase loop appears: "I was not Leo, the stunt double; I was a ghost he had programmed" / "He expected the broken puppet" recycle the construct-identity idea without new pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions—"stark terror," "violent, powerful certainty"—that dilute the concrete image of the seashell and sirens. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks harm momentum; information density is solid overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stunt-double-as-programmed-identity premise is fresh, and the constellation cipher offers a specific, non-obvious mechanic. However, the core betrayal-and-reversal arc follows a familiar template: villain monologues, hero uses hidden knowledge to trigger pre-existing failsafe. The child's cast as vulnerability marker transforms the trope slightly, but the emotional arc—fear to certainty—resolves predictably. The rusted library and whispering seashell are particular to this voice, lifting specificity, yet the ending's tidy reversal (Julian's "airtight plan" pierced by a forgotten command) lacks the friction or ambiguity that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's phobia-ridden identity is present throughout—acrophobia on the shelf, claustrophobia reaching into the panel—and these fears frame the opening and middle. However, the phobias are described rather than constraining: Leo proceeds "despite" them without visible cost, adaptation, or tactical shift. At closure, fear is "forgotten, replaced by a singular, burning focus," which neutralizes rather than integrates the trait. The stunt-double role appears in backstory ("a dozen times for a film") but does not enable the cipher-solving or failsafe-triggering; those skills are unconnected to stunt work. Two beats (climbing, reaching) involve phobia, meeting the middle gate, but closure participation is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The seashell appears in three beats: pocket talisman with whispers (setup), guiding to the library (development), and "held...tightly" with "whispers now silent" at closure (payoff). Its whispers direct Leo's search and its final silence marks completion, reweighting it from guide to proof-of-journey. However, the shell's mechanics—why it whispers, whose voice, how it knew the library—remain unexplained, and Leo never questions or tests it mid-scene; it functions as a convenient plot device rather than an object with specific, irreplaceable properties. The closure reprise is purposeful but does not carry additional cost or reframe prior material beyond "job complete."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Julian's betrayal ("casual, cruel confession") is the inciting wound that shatters Leo's identity and drives the search for truth. The concept shapes the dominant stake—prove selfhood against erasure—and the climactic reversal, where Leo uses the forgotten failsafe to betray Julian in turn, mirrors the core concept. The transformative aspect is embodied: Leo moves from "broken puppet" to "architect of his downfall." However, the betrayal is recounted rather than dramatized on the page (three days prior), and the transformation's cost is asserted ("violent, powerful certainty") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is claimed as Leo's core trait—"the one trait they couldn't fake"—and appears twice: adapting when a wire snaps and when identity evaporates. Yet on the page, Leo encounters no snapped wires; every puzzle (panel, cipher, phone) is solved without misstep, detour, or cost. The trait is told rather than tested. At closure, Leo does adapt tactics (uses failsafe instead of fleeing), but the move is executed without friction or visible tradeoff, reading as competence rather than a constrained adaptation under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the climactic action: Leo decrypts the code and uses it not to flee but to trigger the containment protocol, outwitting Julian's expectation of "a fight, a chase scene." This choice drives the final reversal and is irreplaceable—removing the outwit would collapse the closure. The action is signaled (Leo "began to work," "began to decrypt") and executed on the page. However, the outwitting unfolds without visible friction; Leo recalls the failsafe command, keys it in, and Julian is defeated. No false starts, no cost paid, no alternative weighed—the outwit is decisive but frictionless, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The decryption of smudged notes on a child's cast is the method by which Leo gains the failsafe code, and it occupies a substantial middle beat. Setup: cast discovered in the panel. Development: Leo decodes using constellation key, interpreting smudges as hand-turns. Payoff: the revealed sequence triggers the containment command at closure. The method is specific and irreplaceable—swap the cast for a note, and the cipher and vulnerability theme collapse. However, the decryption succeeds on first attempt without error, and the constellation key is convenient (Orion's belt = 'A'); no cost or struggle is visible in the solving itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library supplies resources (panel, cast, maintenance phone) and constraints (acrophobia on the shelf, claustrophobia in the wall, exposed roof for starlight). Each element alters tactics: Leo must climb to see stars, reach into confined space, and use the phone Julian overlooked. The setting is present in setup (shelf, decay), development (panel, phone), and closure (headlights at entrance, distant pier visible). Removing the library would break the cipher (no stars) and the phone (no failsafe call). The micro-setting of body and tools charges the ending, and the "exposed girders and spray of distant stars" frame the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe—"three days since Julian's casual, cruel confession"—anchors the story post-discovery and frames Leo's search as reactive. The prompt's "after discovering you're not who you thought" is present but does not tighten decisions on the page; Leo has already processed the shock off-stage and arrives calm enough to solve ciphers. No live clock pressures the cipher work or failsafe call; Julian's arrival is coincidental rather than time-driven. The timeframe sets context but does not constrain choices or escalate pressure meaningfully within the single-scene window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Leo's motivation—"to prove that this aching vulnerability, this phantom limb of a past, was my greatest source of power"—is stated explicitly mid-story and again at closure ("the violent, powerful certainty of my own existence"). The desire is present and thematically coherent, but it is told rather than tested through on-page friction. Leo acts with consistent certainty; no moment forces him to choose between vulnerability and another want, and the "proof" is asserted in interiority rather than dramatized through a visible cost or trade-off. The motivation shapes the thematic claim but not the tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" appears throughout: "trembling with a certainty that felt like an earthquake," "my whole body trembled, not with fear, but with the violent, powerful certainty." The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—fear in the opening, focus during decryption, certainty at closure. The oxymoron (trembling + certainty) is embodied in the acrophobia/claustrophobia beats and the final stillness. However, the tone is over-articulated in the final paragraph, where "violent, powerful certainty" is declared twice, reducing the image's charge. The tone shapes the ending but does so through assertion rather than rhythm or restraint.</comment>
