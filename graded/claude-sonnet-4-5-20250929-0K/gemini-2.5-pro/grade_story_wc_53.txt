<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior life shows embodied contradictions: pride and regret act simultaneously through concrete objects (the camera wheel) and memory triggers rather than alternating summaries. The ghost functions as externalized internal conflict with distinct dialogue, though its final dissolution into "shared, profound sorrow" edges toward tidy resolution. Motivation is character-particular—ambition that "broke it"—and the renunciation forecloses his prior bargaining stance with visible cost: accepting authorship of failure. Minor slip: "frantic scramble of his pride" reads slightly abstract for a peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (integration, not exorcism) with felt cost: Kael shifts from bargaining to bearing witness, his "purpose had shifted." The causal lens holds: camera wheel → memory → confession → acceptance alters his stance on the page. Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph (Precipice Platform, kinetic lagoon, post-halt timeframe). One meaningful deepening tightens the dominant stake (negotiation with ghost becomes self-acceptance). Minor wobble: "chronological confusion...settled" tells the shift rather than showing perception change through a concrete sensory or action beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon recurs and charges the final image: "no longer a taunt but a simple fact" reweights prior material. Spatial anchors (Precipice Platform, gilded rail, sheer drop, pile of crystallized condensation) are concrete and guide scavenging action. The camera wheel's "tiny teeth" and click constrain the memory beat. Minor gap: the world-stopped-turning premise supplies atmosphere but doesn't shape a mid-scene choice; the lagoon functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure until the final reframe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiate with ghost via collected echoes) is signaled early and tightens when Kael finds "the right fragment, not an overheard story, but his own." The confession—"It was my fault"—narrows options from bargaining to acceptance with visible cost: he pockets the wheel as "accepted past," foreclosing the exculpatory loop. Agency is renunciation that forecloses a path. One small artifact: "the regret was not a weight anymore, but a release" tells the emotional shift rather than letting the pocket-gesture and stillness do the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a non-literal answer to the implicit question (can ambition be redeemed?) through the shift from "bargaining to bearing witness" and "curator of this magnificent failure"—acceptance without redemption. Theme emerges from particulars: the camera wheel's unrecorded instant, the groaning machine, the ghost's dissolved arrogance. No moralizing; the final stillness inverts the kinetic lagoon's earlier taunt. The phrase "monument to his own eroded ambitions" risks slight on-the-nose declaration but remains grounded in the scavenging role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with clear perceptual filters: "temporal anchor was loose," sound "congealed like amber." Diction is consistent (scavenger idiom, technical fragments like "harmonics report"). Ghost dialogue is distinct and accusatory. Two slips lower the score: "fractured stillness" and "eroded ambitions" recur as authorial motif rather than Kael's lived thought, and "the chronological confusion...sharpened into a sickeningly clear memory" wobbles between metaphor and literal perceptual claim without anchoring which.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at confession: "No." "It was my fault."). Three friction points: "chronological confusion that plagued him" and "temporal bleed" are synonym loops for the same state; "resolute in a world that had surrendered" is elevated diction that clashes with scavenger idiom; the phrase "constant, heavy weight of regret" in paragraph three is told summary of what the scavenging dramatizes. Minimal propulsion loss, but the loops and one filter-verb stack ("believed that if he could just assemble") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-as-externalized-regret, unrecorded-moment artifact, and post-apocalyptic carousel reads specific and non-obvious; the camera wheel's "tiny engine of a captured moment that was never developed" is a fresh metaphor. The piece transforms haunting tropes through occupational particularity (Chief Engineer, harmonics report, stress tolerances). Risk-taking in the non-linear memory collapse and ghost integration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight dock: the "kinetic lagoon" and cloud-platform setting supply atmosphere but remain somewhat ornamental to the core confession turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's scavenging frames the opening, his choice to raise the camera wheel and speak aloud ("No") drives the confession beat, and his final pocket-gesture with shifted purpose ("bearing witness") closes the arc. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in the discovery beat (touch one), triggers the memory sequence (touch two), is raised during confession (touch three), and is pocketed in the final paragraph (touch four). Its specific property—"tiny teeth...designed to catch film that was no longer there"—makes the unrecorded-instant metaphor irreplaceable and charges the closure. Strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs, shaping the dominant stake (ghost negotiation stems from past ambition). The confession beat—"My ambition broke it"—makes the concept causal. Moderate closure linkage via "monument to his own eroded ambitions." Present in all three gates but the exact phrase recurs as motif rather than evolving through distinct on-page costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is labeled early ("temporal anchor was loose") and dramatized when the memory "sharpened into a sickeningly clear" sequence, altering his stance. The final line notes confusion "settled...into a clearer sequence." Present in setup and payoff with one middle constraint (memory collapse), but the trait is more described than actively traded off in a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Regret is the "constant, heavy weight" that drives scavenging, the ghost's accusation hinges on it, the confession transforms it ("not a weight anymore, but a release"), and the final stance is acceptance of cost. Present across all gates with strong causal and closure work. The phrase "primary action...was the constant, heavy weight of regret" is slightly abstract but the pocket-gesture and stillness embody the shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The audio-sieve and "fragments of overheard stories" are named early, shaping his search method. The turn hinges on finding "the right fragment...his own" rather than an overheard one. Present in setup and payoff; the method constrains one choice (what kind of fragment matters). Missing middle development: no on-page scene where he collects or rejects other fragments to show the method's mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is anchored early ("roiling clouds," "energized mist") and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("no longer a taunt but a simple fact"). Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake. Missing middle constraint: it supplies atmosphere but does not alter a mid-scene tactic or choice. Present in setup and payoff with thematic charge but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" frames the entire story; the "stretched-out moment of fractured stillness" and "music died" anchor the temporal premise. The timeframe enables the scavenging role and ghost's persistence. Present in all gates and causally necessary, but no live countdown or mid-scene time pressure that alters a tactic. Strong setup and closure framing; moderate development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ghost-negotiation desire is named early ("negotiate with his own ghost"), drives the scavenging beats, is tested in the confession ("not negotiating for forgiveness"), and resolved in the integration image. Present in all gates with clear friction: the want (exculpation) conflicts with the discovered cost (authorship of failure). Strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is named in the opening timeframe sentence and recurs as "utterly and completely still" in the final line, charging the closure. Tone modulates: the kinetic lagoon shifts from "taunt" to "simple fact," and the ghost's arrogance dissolves. Coherent through turns with purposeful cadence shift at confession. Present in setup and payoff with moderate pressure modulation; the phrase itself is slightly on-the-nose but the tonal arc supports closure.</comment>
