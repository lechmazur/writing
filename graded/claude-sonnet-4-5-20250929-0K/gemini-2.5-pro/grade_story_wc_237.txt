<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interior is concrete and embodied: crystalline veins pulse with cold light, anxiety spreads like frost, the held breath burns. His motivation to transform scars into legible stories is clear and drives the final choice to abandon academic method. The turn from scholarly logic to folk naming is earned by weeks of failure and the grandmother memory, though the whispered acknowledgments ("Hesitation," "Pride," "loneliness") edge toward label-speak without full dramatization of those contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment. The final release is a credible endurance with visible cost—his scholarly framework collapses—but the ease of the shedding slightly undercuts struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Elian kneels on the floating platform, afflicted by crystalline scars, attempting a runic cure. Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: weeks of failed scholarly attempts motivate the pivot to folk method, and the shedding constitutes an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost (abandonment of academic keys). The closure is legible and the crystalline structures softening/shedding is shown on the page with visible result. One tightening—the pivot from ink to touch/naming—narrows options and the cost (his logic reaching its limit) is present, though the grandmother memory arrives slightly late as the causal key.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating platform "adrift in an ocean of silent, blue air" and "saturated hush" create a vivid, purposeful sensory frame. Spatial choreography is clear: low-slung cedar table, crow quill, granite disc, abyss below. The setting charges the final image: glittering dust dissolves into imperceptible currents from the abyss, and the breath "between storms" anchors the temporal pressure. Sensory detail—moss-slicked stone, cool air, the trimmed quill tip—is filtered through Elian's scholarly yet crisis-sharpened perception and constrains the ritual's intimacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: heal/understand the crystalline affliction. Pressure tightens when sacred inks fail, anxiety spreads new crystal, and the held breath becomes finite and heavy. The pivot to naming is a single meaningful turn driven by Elian's agency; it forecloses the scholarly path with visible cost and the shedding narrows to one solution. The coincidence of the grandmother memory arriving at the moment of desperation slightly softens agency, but the choice to "coax out" rather than "shout away" alters tactics under the inferred lens and the resolution earns its cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: logic/academic structure versus folk acknowledgment, the power of naming pain rather than abstracting it. The crow quill's "purpose newly understood" and the arm as "blank page ready for new stories" avoid overt moralizing while reweighting the scholarly versus superstitious binary. Subtext operates in the grandmother's whispered folk wisdom dismissed as "sentimental nonsense" that proves potent. The final breath and "most powerful runes...spoken from the heart" risks sentimentality but is earned by the concrete shedding and the prior weeks of failure, offering a resonant answer to the central question without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds consistently; psychic distance tightens under pressure (breath burning, focus fracturing). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "saturated hush," "latticework of old pains and future fears," "meticulously trimmed tip." The prose modulates from scholarly ("framework of logic and symbol") to intimate whisper ("Hesitation," "Pride") without head-hopping. Minor register drift: "saturated hush of the sky" and "profound stillness" occasionally elevate beyond immediate crisis perception. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is specific to a rune scholar under duress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings differ, and information density is high: most lines advance character state, affliction mechanics, or emotional progression. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity and momentum are strong; the sequence from held breath to memory to touch to shedding is propulsive. Minor density slip: "a crow quill with a meticulously trimmed tip, its blackness a stark contrast to the pale stone" front-loads description that could interleave with action. Zero filter-verb stacks or stock metaphors in peak beats; figurative language ("frost on a winter windowpane," "ocean of silent, blue air") is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of runic scholarship and folk naming is specific and non-obvious; the crystalline stress affliction and floating tea platform anchor the premise in fresh particulars. The pivot from ink to dry-point naming transforms a familiar "logic versus intuition" trope through embodied detail (glittering lattice, cold light, whispered acknowledgment). Proximity to writing-prompt templates (magical affliction, scholarly protagonist discovers folk wisdom) is mitigated by the sensory specificity and the earned turn, but the grandmother memory and the "most powerful runes...spoken from the heart" conclusion edge toward sentimental predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Budding rune scholar identity shapes all major choices: weeks applying runic inks, racing through formulae, then choosing to abandon academic keys for folk method. Present in setup (first paragraph), drives middle attempts (ink application), and the pivot at closure (setting aside ink pot, using quill as stylus). Two distinct beats and causal pressure; the scholar role constrains and then is transcended with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crow quill introduced early ("picked up the instrument"), used with runic inks mid-scene (inks bead and roll), then repurposed as dry stylus for tracing/naming at closure ("turned the crow quill over...no longer seeing it as a pen...but as a simple stylus"). Three beats, evolving use, and its "purpose newly understood" charges the final image. Removal would break the tactile mechanics of the cure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Breath between storms" frames the entire piece: thunderheads receding, promised gales of dusk, world existing "only within the confines of that held breath." The held breath becomes a live clock (burning in lungs, pressure growing, "finally released" at closure). Shapes tactics (urgency, finite time) and charges the final line ("perfect breath between them"). Indispensable to temporal pressure and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crystallizes-when-stressed is setup (veins pulse with cold light), complicates middle action (fresh anxiety traces new sharp line, pressure grows), and its shedding is the closure beat. Visible tradeoff: stress creates the affliction, naming dissolves it. Drives two beats and the ending's decisive change; the attribute's mechanics are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Shed" is the climactic action: "crystalline structures...began to shed. Fine, glittering dust lifted...dissolving into flakes of light." Setup primes it (inks fail to remove), middle desperation makes it necessary, and the shedding is the on-page Decisive Change. Swapping for "dissolve" or "melt" would alter the tactile image but the action itself—removal of the crystal—is the resolution's hinge. Closure participation with cost: the academic self is shed alongside the crystal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Method signaled mid-scene via grandmother memory ("coaxed out...given a new name and whispered into the wind"), dismissed as "youthful superstition," then enacted at closure (whispering names, tracing with dry quill). Shapes the pivot attempt and the final cure mechanics. Two beats; causal role in the ending. Late signal (past first third) and the memory's arrival slightly reduces integration, but the method is irreplaceable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Floating platform anchors the scene spatially (moss-slicked stone, cedar table, abyss below) and tonally ("ocean of silent, blue air," "imperceptible currents rising from the abyss"). The glittering dust dissolving into those currents charges the final image. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is implicit (isolation aids focus). The platform's constraint is more atmospheric than tactical—it does not alter Elian's choices—but its reprise at closure reweights the "adrift" metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Held breath is setup ("drew in a long, slow breath"), middle escalator (air "heavy, finite," "burning in his lungs," "last of his captured air"), and closure release ("finally, finally released his breath"). A live clock that tightens decisions and shapes the pivot to naming under time pressure. Three beats, indispensable temporal constraint, and the release punctuates the cure with audible cost ("long, quiet sigh").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("not merely to heal, but to understand, to transform these frozen scars into legible stories") and dramatized at closure (whispering names, outlining scars, transforming "abstract pains into named and witnessed things"). Friction between scholarly want (logic, academic keys) and the cost of renouncing that framework is visible. Two beats; the desire drives the pivot and the final act. Slightly told-heavy in setup but the closure enacts the transformation with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is established in opening ("crisp stillness," "profound stillness," "only ripple"), modulates under pressure (focus fractures, breath burns), and charges the final image ("long, quiet sigh, the only ripple in the profound stillness"). Coherent through turns; the tone intensifies without breaking. The hush both frames and amplifies the whispered naming, making the quiet ending resonate rather than deflate.</comment>
