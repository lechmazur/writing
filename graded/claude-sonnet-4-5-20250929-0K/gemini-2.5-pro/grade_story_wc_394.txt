<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation (to "ring a bell no one hears yet") is embodied through months of solitary work and the final test flight, with clear internal stakes. His "steadily curious nature" drives concrete micro-choices: building the wing, trusting the glyph's shape, pulling the actuator at the moment of free-fall. The laugh of "sacrilegious joy" at the end is embodied and particular, though the interiority leans slightly abstract in the workshop section ("dialogue conducted throughout the evolution of his own lonely thoughts"). The final choice—yelling "Grip!" and pulling the actuator—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of safety with visible cost (risking death over the acid sea).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Kaelen, gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, years of ritual). The story follows a causal lens: months of observation yield the "Grip" glyph, which motivates the wing redesign, which enables the climactic test. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the glider holds in mid-air, a new law proven, with the felt cost of isolation ("couldn't tell a soul") and the existential gamble visible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when he launches and falls, then pulls the actuator—options narrow, cost is legible. The inferred lens holds cleanly to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The acid sea and floating workshop constrain every choice: the launch platform is "corroded," the sea "churns like a monstrous stomach," and falling means death. The twin suns' dawn light signals time pressure. The wing's "copper tubing and whalebone struts" and the "non-Euclidean configuration" are specific to the world and the task. The kaleidoscope's arrowhead fragments ("dust-fine fragments of a hunter's arrow tip") supply the generative tool. The final image—hanging fifty feet above the fuming acid—is charged by the setting's lethality and the workshop as "testament to a life spent chasing an echo."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove the Yearning Algorithm's command and survive—is signaled early and escalates through the causal sequence: glyph recognition → wing redesign → launch → free-fall → actuator pull. The reversal at "He was falling" narrows options to death or the untested wing; pulling the actuator is protagonist agency under maximum pressure. The cost is visible: "He couldn't tell a soul, but the bell had been rung"—success is earned but lonely, and the gamble with death is on the page. The glider "stopped falling" is a decisive physical change with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—lonely innovation, the cost of discovery no one witnesses—emerges organically from Kaelen's years-long solitary ritual, the "bell no one hears yet," and the final line's "sacrilegious joy" that "echoed across the silent, toxic waters." The Yearning Algorithm is not stated as thesis but enacted: muck to microbes to dreaming of stars, transliterated into a wing that grips reality. The ending image (weightless suspension, booming laugh, unwitnessed triumph) reweights the entire arc without moralizing. The arrowhead from a "traveler who had already mastered the language" adds quiet irony and thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice-specific: "beautiful disaster," "no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray," "sacrilegious joy." Kaelen's perceptual signature is selective—he notices the glyph's "starburst of light" as a verb, not a word—and his diction mixes tinkerer pragmatism with quasi-mystical awe. The psychic distance tightens at the climax ("Grip!" yelled at the wing itself, not the controls). Dialogue to self ("Come on, you beautiful disaster") and inner monologue are distinct and idiomatic. No head-hopping; elision of the months of work is efficient and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally: short urgent beats during the fall ("The wind howled. The acid sea rushed up.") contrast with longer reflective passages in the workshop. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he felt more than saw," "he believed") slightly dulls immediacy in the workshop section but does not touch the closure. "Metallic sculpture of a paradox" and "fossilized command" are vivid and apt. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final image ("suspended fifty feet above the fuming acid") is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of solitary tinkerer, acid-sea setting, and "Yearning Algorithm" as cosmic open-source code is specific and non-obvious. The kaleidoscope with fossilized arrowhead fragments is a fresh generative tool. The "non-Euclidean configuration" wing that "grips a fold in the air" transforms familiar SF tropes (lost tech, lone inventor) through concrete causality and the grounded risk of the acid sea. The ending—holding weightless via a new physical law—feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprising. The tone ("irreverent awe," "sacrilegious joy") and the unwitnessed bell-ringing add bold emotional and thematic risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's choices create every key turn: recognizing the glyph, redesigning the wing, launching despite the risk, pulling the actuator at free-fall. His agency drives causality from setup through closure. Present in all three gates (setup: years of ritual; middle: wing construction; closure: the actuator pull). Indispensable—no other character or force resolves the problem.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hunter's arrow tip appears in two beats: as the kaleidoscope's core ("dust-fine fragments… made of a material that sang with faint energy") and implicitly as the source of the glyph Kaelen translates. It enables the discovery but does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Strong setup and middle development; weaker closure participation. Specific and irreplaceable as the generative artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Yearning Algorithm frames Kaelen's motivation and worldview (setup), shapes his months-long search for its "grammar" (middle), and the final triumph enacts its proof (closure: muck to microbes to a new law). It constrains his method—he must "transliterate" rather than invent arbitrarily. Present in all three gates and causally active, though the Algorithm itself remains abstract; the wing's success demonstrates it rather than the Algorithm directly altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is demonstrated on the page: months of nightly observation, the refusal to give up on the repeating glyph, and the willingness to risk death for the test. It enables the final choice (pulling the actuator requires faith born of curiosity). Setup and closure are strong; middle development is implicit in the workshop montage. The trait is shown rather than merely labeled, but its cost is more atmospheric (loneliness) than a distinct on-page tradeoff in a single beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Transliterate" is the core verb: Kaelen spends months transliterating the glyph's "crystalline grammar" into the wing's geometry. The climax—pulling the actuator—executes the transliterated command. The action is signaled early (setup), drives the middle redesign, and defines the closure. Removing "transliterate" would collapse the story's logic; the specificity of converting visual glyph to physical shape is indispensable. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope is the means of discovery: Kaelen presses his eye to it nightly (setup), its core (the arrowhead fragments) supplies the Algorithm's glyph (middle), and the glyph's shape determines the wing's "non-Euclidean configuration" that enables closure. The mechanics matter—"shimmering patterns bloomed and collapsed"—and the method shapes every attempt. Present in all three gates; the final success traces directly to what he saw through the kaleidoscope.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop and acid sea constrain every choice: the "corroded launch platform," the deadly sea that forces the high-stakes test, the "precarious metal bubble" as home and workspace. Setup is vivid; middle action (constructing the wing) occurs within it; closure (launching over the acid) is shaped by the lethality below. The setting supplies the existential pressure and the final image's danger. Strong across all three gates, though the workshop itself is more backdrop than active constraint during the redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" (of his thoughts, over years) frames the long view in setup. The "months" of glyph repetition tighten to "tonight" when understanding arrives, then "hours later" for construction, then dawn for the launch. Time pressure is implicit (the reader senses urgency) but not a live ticking clock that alters tactics on the page. Setup and closure are present; middle montage compresses time efficiently. The timeframe scaffolds causality but does not force a distinct tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to ring a bell no one hears yet"—is dramatized in the opening ritual, the years of solitary work, and the final image where "He couldn't tell a soul, but the bell had been rung." The desire drives every choice: nightly observation, wing redesign, the launch gamble. Friction between the want (proof, discovery) and the cost (isolation, death risk) is on the page. Present in all three gates; the ending's "booming laugh" and "sacrilegious joy" charge the payoff with the motivation's lonely triumph.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Irreverent awe" is coherent and modulates: Kaelen's muttered "beautiful disaster," the "laugh of irreverent awe" at recognizing the glyph, "no sense building a church if you're afraid to pray," and the final "wild, booming laugh… sacrilegious joy." The tone charges the final image—awe at the new law, irreverence toward cosmic indifference. It remains consistent under pressure (fall → suspension) and shapes the reader's experience of the ending. High integration across beats and closure.</comment>
