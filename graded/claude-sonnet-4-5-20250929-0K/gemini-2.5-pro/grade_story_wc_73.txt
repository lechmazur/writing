<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and character-specific—his motivation to "capture the texture of a missed opportunity" drives meaningful action through mathematical obsession. The climactic beat embodies contradiction: triumph layered with "fresh wound," avoiding therapy-speak through sensory specificity ("damp chill," "click of a lock"). Minor slip: the "grim smile" as "uniform of optimism" reads slightly label-heavy in the opening, and the final stance ("grimly, wonderfully optimistic") repeats the construction without deepening it. Cost is visible on the page when he touches the regret and chooses to continue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the staircase shifts from prison to canvas with felt cost ("fresh wound in his soul"). The rupture beat delivers visible cost through sensory particulars (rain, lock, unspoken words) and the sealing re-establishes boundlessness with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the proof completes and forces the paradox; the cost at closure is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains every choice: indistinguishable steps create the measurement problem, the gray stone accepts his proofs, and the "designated step" becomes the rupture site. Micro-setting (dice, flint shard) functions as toolset and charges the final image when the chipped die shifts from flaw to key. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elian's mathematical priority (formulas over scent/sound). The staircase's shimmer and groan provide tactile resistance at the closure beat, making the environment essential to the rupture's legibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the missed opportunity's texture) is signaled in paragraph two and tested at the rupture. One meaningful tightening: the completed proof narrows options to a single roll, and the paradox forces reality to yield. Agency is decision under pressure (the final toss), and the cost—re-immersion in "agonizingly perfect" regret—forecloses escape while opening iteration. The seven ruptures seamless forever as predicted, delivering visible consequence. No coincidence resolves; protagonist calculation drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (logic touching the illogical, confinement as canvas) emerges from Elian's proof and the dice's dual nature (chance/memory). The chipped die shifts from flaw to key without overt statement, and the final image (endless stairs now a canvas) reweights the prison conceit with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in "prodding a sleeping god with compass and ruler" and the paradox that solving the system risks unraveling the self. Minor slip: "balancedly daring endeavor" in paragraph three leans slightly abstract where embodied tension would sharpen the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance; Elian's perceptual signature filters setting through mathematical abstraction ("massive equation," "nexus point"). Diction choices ("esoteric," "theorems," "integers") stay in character; "not a clatter but a chime" modulates at peak pressure. Minor register drift: "balancedly daring" and "as-you-know" phrasing in "not instruments of chance but of memory" reads slightly expository mid-opening, though it recovers by grounding in the chipped die's concrete function. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Opening sentence ("indistinguishable from the one above or the billion below") establishes infinite sameness efficiently. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "to capture the texture" is restated as "the physical embodiment of the probability he had failed to calculate" without added pressure, costing ~−0.2. Figurative language ("monument to perpetual motion," "ghost") stays coherent. Rhythm varies; no template-cadence runs. The rupture beat's sensory stack (damp chill, rain, lock click, weight of words) packs four jobs into one moment without opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise (infinite staircase + mathematical proof to rupture sameness) is fresh and commits fully; the dice-as-memory device and chipped flaw as variable avoid stock puzzle-box mechanics. The rupture as "silent, geometric tearing" rather than explosion feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in structure (dense opening abstraction paid off by sensory climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot hinges on *this* staircase's logic and *this* protagonist's method. The final reframing (prison to canvas) grows inevitably from prior particulars. No famous-line echoes detected; "grim optimist" executes the assigned trait through action rather than decorating a template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grim optimist trait drives key turns: opening stance ("believed a flaw existed in every perfection"), the decision to complete the proof despite risk ("prodding a sleeping god"), and the final choice to iterate after touching failure's texture. Present in setup, enables the rupture choice, and charges closure ("grimly, wonderfully optimistic he could find another"). Cost is visible (fresh wound) and the trait is irreplaceable—remove optimism and the ending collapses into despair.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dice appear in three beats: introduction (paragraph two, chipped die as "corrupting element"), the proof's variables (paragraph three, "primary variables"), and the climactic roll (paragraphs four–five, catalyst for rupture). The chip shifts from flaw to key in the final beat, reweighting meaning. Removal breaks the proof's logic (no controlled randomness) and the closure image. Specificity (chip on the four) matters mechanically and thematically. High irreplaceability and closure linkage justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perpetual motion shapes stakes (the staircase's "unwavering rhythm" is the target of the proof) and constrains tactics (Elian must map "impossible physics" rather than physically escape). Present in setup metaphor ("monument to perpetual motion"), tested in the rupture (the seamless flow is temporarily broken), and implicit at closure (motion resumes, now reframed). Swappable with "infinite recursion" or similar without major surgery, limiting the score despite solid causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Balancedly daring appears as explicit label in paragraph three ("balancedly daring endeavor") tied to the risk of unraveling himself by solving the system. It enables the proof's completion and the rupture attempt with visible cost (the "sleeping god" metaphor and the protagonist's acceptance of danger). Present in middle beat, constrains the high-stakes roll. Loses points for being stated rather than fully embodied in contradictory on-page action; the daring is more asserted than shown through a visible tradeoff moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rupture is the story's fulcrum: the proof predicts it, the dice roll triggers it, and the closure hinges on its success and sealing. The action delivers the only access to the missed opportunity's texture (paragraphs five–six) and transforms the staircase from prison to canvas. Removal eliminates the climax and cost entirely. Early setup (paragraph three warns of paradox), middle escalation (completion of proof), and closure payoff (reality yields, then seals) all center on this action. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are signaled early (paragraph three, "painstaking logic," "intricate mathematical proofs"), shape middle beats (formulas map the staircase's physics, dice outcomes feed theorems), and generate the climax (the completed proof predicts the rupture nexus). Mechanics matter: the method produces a specific prediction (seven will rupture) that the story tests on the page. Removal leaves no mechanism for Elian to force the paradox. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage; slightly swappable with "symbolic logic" or similar formal system, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Infinite staircase is indispensable: the sameness creates the problem (no landmarks, no progress), provides the medium for proofs (gray stone risers/treads), supplies the rupture site (designated step), and frames the final reweighting (prison → canvas). Present in opening sentence, pressures every beat (measurement, inscription, the designated step's location), and charges closure ("boundless confinement stretching out as always" now transformed). Removal destroys story logic, stakes, and the core image. Extreme irreplaceability and full three-gate integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation to capture the missed opportunity's texture is stated in paragraph two, drives the proof's construction (paragraphs three–four), is tested at the rupture (paragraph five delivers the texture: "damp chill," "click of a lock," "weight of unspoken words"), and fuels the closure choice (he has "done it" and seeks another). Desire is dramatized through embodied cost ("fresh wound," "agonizingly perfect") rather than told only. Friction between the goal and its price (touching the regret hurts but validates the method) is visible. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Boundless confinement is established in the opening ("infinite staircase," "perpetual motion") and modulates through pressure: sameness oppresses, the rupture briefly opens texture, then confinement reseals—but the final image reweights it ("not just a prison; it was a canvas"). Tone coheres across beats (thin air, sterile, lonely / groan, shimmer / fresh wound, triumph) and charges the closure by transforming the valence of the constraint without dispelling it. The oxymoron is made concrete through plot (endless stairs now a site of iterative discovery). High coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
