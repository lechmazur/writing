<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation—to preserve abandoned dreams—is clear and drives her choices, but the interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphorical framing rather than embodied contradiction. The neural-lace procedure shows micro-choices under pressure (focusing on the composer's dream, enduring the torrent), and the ending renunciation (accepting a tear but smiling) suggests Earned Stasis. However, the emotional progression feels too smooth; the "quaking reverie" and "tremor in her soul" are asserted more than dramatized through specific bodily degradation or irrational fear that complicates her resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elara, canyon workshop, moonlit night of transformation) and follows a single continuous scene under a Causal lens: she initiates the sequence, dives into entangled memories, focuses on the composer's dream, modifies her cortex, and emerges with the dream intact. The closure—Elara integrating the composer's dream and smiling through a tear—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost: the tear, the "secret, silent librarian" solitude). One meaningful tightening occurs when she anchors the composer's dream and the system stabilizes. Cost is legible in the tear and the irreversible neural modification, though the felt weight could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The canyon workshop, periscope mirror, and neural-lace setup are vivid and purposeful, grounding the scene in tactile detail (conductive gel, ozone/lavender scent, wire filaments). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; the canyon and moonlight frame the scene lyrically but do not constrain a choice or shape tactics. The periscope mirror charges the final image (her reflection in the uncracked part), meeting the micro-setting gate and lifting the score into the 6+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving an abandoned dream by modifying her own mind—is signaled early and tightens once: she selects the composer's dream, endures the torrent, and stabilizes the feedback loop, narrowing options (success or self-dissolution). The "entangled memories fought back" moment raises cost, and the tear at the end makes the price visible. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under the Causal lens. Agency is clear (her decision to focus, her will to modify her cortex), and coincidence does not resolve the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of human aspiration against erasure, the cost of becoming a vessel for lost dreams—emerges organically from the plot without moralizing. The composer's deafened-prime backstory and the color-to-sound instrument are specific, non-generic particulars. The final image (the tear and smile, the internalized symphony of sunset notes) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation is possible but isolating and irreversible. The "secret, silent librarian" line borders on thematic echo but remains metaphorical enough to avoid a −0.4 penalty. No prompts or thesis statements in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct elevated/lyric register ("pages of stone," "silver ink," "helix-minded"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara's engineer's lens and recursive thinking filter all observations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("This period of profound transformation... was to her a Great Theft") that tells rather than shows, and the diction at peak stress ("chaotically precise rhythm, each pulse a hammer blow") leans on stock metaphor. No head-hopping, no dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt a profound shift") are acceptable within this voice-motivated style.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and sentence openings vary, but figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "canyon walls were pages," "moonlight was silver ink," "swimming through a storm of ghosts," "hammer blow forging new connections." Mixed vehicles (walls as pages, moonlight as ink, periscope as time-viewer) remain legible but crowd the frame. Template cadence appears in the setup paragraph: "Her motivation was... Her process was... The tone of the cavern was..." (three "X was Y" constructions). Paraphrase loop: "entangled memories" recurs three times in adjacent beats without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density + template stems; no artifacts touch closure directly, so mid-6 band remains accessible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The core premise—neural archaeology of collective memory via a repurposed periscope mirror—is fresh and commits fully to its implications. The "helix-minded" engineer framing and the synaptic-plasticity mechanism are specific rather than generic. However, the "Great Simplification" dystopia and lone-rebel-preservationist role follow a familiar template; the emotional arc (solitary defiance, bittersweet success) is well-executed but not startling. The composer's color-to-sound dream is vivid and particular, lifting the piece above mid-band. Risk-taking in voice and metaphor is present but does not fully transform the underlying archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's helix-minded thinking is seeded early ("saw the world... in spiraling connections"), enables the middle beat (riding "recursive currents" to avoid being torn apart), and is implicit in her selection of the composer's dream and stabilization of the feedback loop. Her choices create the key turn (anchoring the dream) and the ending (emerging with the integrated memory). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the trait is not merely labeled but demonstrated in action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears in the opening setup, is used in the middle beat (staring into it to access entangled memories), and returns in the final image (her reflection in the smooth, uncracked part). Three touches across beats. However, its function is static—a window into memory—without evolving use or reweighted meaning; the uncracked section at the end is a lyric reprise but does not alter tactics or stakes. Lyric-resonance allowance brings it into mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" shapes the central stake (preserving one from the collective past), appears in the middle beat (the torrent she navigates), and is resolved at closure (the composer's dream now lives in her). It changes options: she must select one dream and endure the others' resistance. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure participation, reaching low-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" is introduced early ("chaotically precise array," "process was her signature, a whirlwind of calculated steps") and reappears at the peak beat ("chaotically precise rhythm, each pulse a hammer blow"). However, it remains largely label-only; no on-page action dramatizes a tradeoff between chaos and precision—no visible cost where one quality enables success at the expense of the other. Two mentions, setup + peak, but ornamental rather than causally active. Mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Modify" is the engine of the plot: she modifies the structure of her mind (opening), initiates the sequence to coax neurons to remap (middle), weaves the composer's dream into her neural tapestry (peak), and emerges irreversibly changed (closure). The action is not swappable; "observe" or "record" would break the stakes. Drives at least three beats and charges the ending. Essential across beats, strong causal pressure, reaching high-8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through synaptic plasticity" is signaled early ("the machine began its work through synaptic plasticity, coaxing her own neurons to remap"), shapes the middle attempt (modifying auditory/visual cortex), and is implicit in the closure (the new chamber in her mind). The method constrains the process—she cannot simply download the memory; her brain must be rewired. Present in setup and peak, with causal linkage to closure. Mid-to-high-6 band for method that matters without being swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is vividly described in the opening and closing frames, providing atmospheric anchoring and a serene contrast to Elara's internal storm. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter tactics; the workshop hollow could be anywhere. The moonlight's return at the end ("serene") offers lyric closure but no reweighted stake. Lyric reprise without causal pressure: mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During a period of profound transformation" (the "Great Simplification") is mentioned in the opening as context for Elara's motivation but does not create a live clock or tighten her decisions on the page. The timeframe is vague ("tonight") and does not pressure tactics. Present in setup only, ornamental rather than causal. Below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated early, dramatized through her selection of the composer's dream (middle), and fulfilled at closure (she is now "its secret, silent librarian"). The motivation drives all key choices and the ending image reweights it with cost (isolation, the tear). Strong setup, development, and payoff with felt cost. Mid-to-high-7 band for motivation that drives beats and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named explicitly ("the tone of the cavern was a quaking reverie, the precipice of discovery trembling with the risk of self-dissolution") and modulates through the sequence: the tremor becomes "a tremor in her soul," then resolves to silence and calm ("the canyon was still, the moonlight serene"). Tone shifts coherently with pressure and charges the final image (the smile through the tear, the "wonderfully enriched" world). Present in setup, peak, and closure with clear cadence shift. Mid-6 band for tone that supports but does not drive the stakes.</comment>
