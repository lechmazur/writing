<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is embodied and particular—the brass listening device in her pocket, the need to capture "the sound of trust breaking" as currency. Her escalating attempts (crab pots, Boro, bribe, then the lie) show agency under pressure with visible micro-choices. The final pivot to breaking what Silas is selling rather than outbidding him demonstrates earned problem-solving, and the steadfastness attribute lands in action ("her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through" is told but immediately shown in her calm lie). Minor demerit: the attribute line is slightly over-articulated, and Silas's interiority ("his panic he couldn't contain") slightly breaches POV distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal, with Elara's three failed attempts creating because/therefore linkage that narrows options and forces the final lie. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the pirate-market setting, Silas/Eva negotiation, and Elara's goal are all clear early. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Eva throws the fob, Elara gains the recording, and the lie itself is a moral price (she breaks trust to save it). The escalation tightens cleanly through each failure, and the final beat reweights the opening stake (sound of trust breaking becomes sound of a lie under pressure). The piece remains single-POV, single scene, one dominant stake—all within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier setting (brine, mildew, phosphorescent kelp, splintered crates) is vivid and integrated into action—Elara moves through the throng, nudges crab pots, steps into kelp's glow. Spatial choreography is clean (stall, walkway, shadows). The brass listening device and the fob function as micro-setting objects that constrain and charge the final image. The timeframe (night to dawn, rising tide) subtly pressures Elara's urgency. Minor gap: the market's social rules (truce of hush, Boro's role) are sketched but don't materially alter Elara's tactics after the Boro beat; the setting supports rather than transforms choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop the fob sale to protect her family's ecosystem) is signaled early and sustained. Three escalating attempts (chaos, appeal to Boro, bribe) each narrow options with on-page failures, forcing the final lie—a choice that trades truth for survival and forecloses the path of honest persuasion. The lie's success depends on Elara's specific knowledge (grandfather's flaw detail) and Silas's panic, making it an earned reversal. Cost is visible: she breaks the very thing she came to record (trust) and weaponizes her family legacy. The tightening is decisive and shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—trust, secrets as currency, the price of lies—emerges through concrete beats: the listening device, the fob as loyalty token, the false-starts structure, and the final lie that breaks trust to preserve it. The ending reweights the opening ("the sound she had come for, the high-pitched strain of a lie tearing under pressure") without stating a moral. The serpent fob recurs with shifting meaning (debt → commodity → weapon). Minor limit: "comforting unease" and "the only real currency" lean slightly toward stated theme in the opening, though the closure image (warm recorder, grey dawn) rescues resonance through concrete detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-particular: "metallic tang of unspoken agreements," "ghost in homespun," "chips of obsidian." Elara's perceptual signature (sound-focused, market-literate) filters every detail. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext—Boro's dismissal, Silas's sneer, Elara's calm declaration to Eva. Free indirect style is clean. One wobble: "his panic he couldn't contain" slightly breaches strict focalization (Elara infers but the phrasing asserts interior certainty). Diction remains consistent under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening and closing images are strong. No paraphrase loops or major template cadence. Minor texture issues: "a ghost in homespun" and "chips of obsidian" are vivid but border on stock metaphor; "her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through" is scaffold-y exposition mid-beat. The phrase "the thing he was trying to sell" in the penultimate decision beat is slightly generic where precision would heighten the turn. Otherwise clean propulsion and no line-level drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise (capturing the sound of trust breaking in a pirate market under time pressure) is fresh and the false-starts structure organically shapes escalation. The lie-as-solution (breaking the thing you sell to kill the deal) is clever and earned by prior detail (grandfather blacksmith, fob flaw). The transformation of a listening device from passive recorder to weapon of psychological warfare feels specific. Minor derivative element: the ticking-clock pirate-market negotiation and the "one last trick" pivot are familiar beats, elevated here by the sound-collector detail and the moral inversion (lie to save truth). No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is present from the opening and drives all three attempts and the final lie; her choices create every key turn (nudge crab pots, approach Boro, bribe Silas, lie to Eva). Removal would collapse the entire plot. Setup early, involved in all beats, causal pressure high, closure linkage absolute (her lie and recording device define the ending). Specific cost: she weaponizes her family legacy and records her own breach of trust.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fob appears in paragraph two as the negotiation object, is refused in the bribe beat, becomes the target of Elara's lie (seventh scale detail), and is thrown down in the climax. Its symbolic weight (grandfather's loyalty token) charges every beat and the final image. Irreplaceable: the flaw detail and family backstory are unique. Cost-connected: its loss/retrieval defines the stakes. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; drives two major beats causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" is named in the opening beat, motivates Elara's appeal to Boro (who enforces it), and implicitly pressures Eva and Silas's whispered negotiation. It constrains Elara's tactics (can't openly accuse without proof) and is woven into the stakes (Eva's secrets will "burn their whole fragile ecosystem down"). Present in setup and middle beat; shapes one key choice (Boro's refusal). Not directly in the closure image but its breach (Silas selling secrets) is the inciting threat. Functional but could be swapped for a generic "market law" with minor rewording.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is labeled mid-story ("her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through") then immediately shown in Elara's calm, methodical lie to Eva under pressure. It enables the final beat by explaining her tonal control. Cost: steadfastness allows the lie but also locks her into the moral compromise. Setup is late (second half), but the trait is causally active in the closure beat and irreplaceable to the tone of that moment. Loses points for late/told introduction; gains for closure linkage and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Thwart" defines the entire plot: Elara's goal from paragraph two is to stop the fob sale, and all four attempts (chaos, law, bribe, lie) are thwart tactics. The final lie is the successful thwart that alters the outcome. Early signal, drives all beats, shapes closure decisively, and the method (break the thing being sold) is specific to this action. Irreplaceable; removal collapses the story. Cost: the thwart succeeds only through moral compromise (weaponized lie).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Through false starts" structures the entire escalation: crab-pot chaos fails, Boro appeal fails, bribe fails, lie succeeds. The method is signaled in the narrative's three-beat attempt sequence and shapes reader expectation. Each failure narrows options and raises cost, making the final success feel earned. The method is irreplaceable to the plot's rhythm and the theme (trust-breaking requires trial). Present in setup (first attempt by paragraph four), develops through middle beats, pays off in closure. Causal pressure high; cost visible (each failure wastes time and increases exposure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is established in the opening line and provides resources (crab pots, Boro, the crowd, kelp glow for staging) and constraints (truce rules, ticking night, confined space). The setting's secrecy and unease justify the stakes (fragile ecosystem) and pressure Elara's covert tactics. The phosphorescent kelp stages the final confrontation visually. Setup early, involved in two beats (crab-pot chaos, Boro's enforcement), charges the closure image (shadows, dawn through pier cracks). Could be replaced with another hidden-market locale but specific details (rotting, kelp, brine) are voice-integrated and irreplaceable to tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "until sunrise" is anchored in paragraph two ("before the first rays of sun crested the waves") and tracked through rising tide mentions and the final image ("first grey light of dawn began to bleed through"). It tightens Elara's urgency and justifies compressed escalation (three attempts in one night). Present in setup and closure; shapes one middle beat (rising tide mounts desperation). The clock is felt but not mechanical—no beat-by-beat countdown. Functional pressure; mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is dramatized in the opening (brass listening device, "the only real currency"), drives her presence at the negotiation, and is fulfilled ironically in the closure beat (she records her own lie, "the high-pitched strain of a lie tearing"). The friction between wanting to record trust-breaking and needing to break trust herself is the story's moral engine and visible cost. Setup early, involved in all beats, closure linkage absolute. Specific and irreplaceable; the sound-collector detail defines both goal and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named in the opening paragraph and sustained through selective sensory detail (brine, mildew, kelp glow, lapping tide) and Elara's insider familiarity with the market's danger. Tone modulates under pressure—calm opener, sharper tension during failures, eerie calm during the lie, quiet dawn at closure. The final image (warm recorder, grey light) recharges the opening's unease-as-comfort paradox. Present in setup and closure; shapes atmospheric beats but doesn't directly constrain a choice. Coherent and purposeful; mid-high integration.</comment>
