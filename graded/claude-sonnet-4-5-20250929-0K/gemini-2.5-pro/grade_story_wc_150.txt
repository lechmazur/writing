<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through her need to restore faith in lineage. The ship carving discovery triggers a genuine shift—from viewing her great-grandmother's death as interruption to recognizing perpetual courage—that feels earned by prior wandering and observation. Minor slip: the final paragraph's "peaceful acceptance of the questions" edges toward therapeutic phrasing, though it's anchored by the physical tomb-repair act. Embodied contradiction is present (hollowness versus cautious enchantment) but could deepen further under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a conceptual repricing at closure. The piece teaches its method early—purposeful wandering before excavation—and the sundial/ship discovery reweights the interrupted-journey premise with undeniable conceptual cost (her great-grandmother's journey was eternally beginning, not ended). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the carving flips her understanding, and the cost (accepting questions over answers) is legible on the page. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: roots snaking through bones, the fig tree gripping the sundial base, damp soil and faint blossoms create a lived-in texture that reflects life/decay duality. The setting constrains Elara's choice to free the stone "over several days" and charges the final image when sunlight strikes the repaired base. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (sundial base underside) delivers the climactic carving reveal, directly shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening: discovering the ship carving narrows Elara's interpretive options and reweights the interrupted-journey motif with felt cost (she must abandon her expectation of tragic narrative). Agency is embodied in her multi-day freeing of the stone and the choice to rebuild. Minor cap: the pressure accumulates more through reflection than through on-page obstacles or trade-offs that visibly foreclose alternatives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—resilient spirit over success, courage of departure over destination—emerges organically from the ship carving and the roots-as-continuity imagery. The final image (sundial glowing, hollow filling with acceptance) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the interrupted-journey question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and commits to its premise. Minor note: "peaceful acceptance of the questions" is one step from stating the theme aloud, though it remains rooted in the physical tomb-repair act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (warm curiosity, filtering decay through faith-restoration lens). Diction remains controlled and within Elara's plausible register. The prose modulates purposefully from meditative walks to the sharp understanding at discovery. Minor slip: "a profound hollowness where her faith in their stories should have been" and "cautious enchantment" edge toward diagnostic vocabulary, though they stay character-bound. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; no scaffold loops. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or thematic weight. Figurative language (silver vein, slow-motion embrace, roots as testament) is coherent and earned. Minor friction: "a mixture of life and decay that fostered a cautious enchantment within her" leans slightly expository when the sensory catalog has already shown it. Proofreading is clean; no pronoun ambiguity or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise and the ship-carved-pointing-toward-sunrise reversal are specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of interrupted journeys with perpetual departure feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its lyric-accumulative design and follows through on purposeful wandering. Minor deduction: the emotional arc (hollow → filling) follows a familiar template; the transformation is earned but not structurally bold. No echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's diaspora-returnee status shapes the dominant stake (restore lineage faith) from the opening and drives her choice to excavate via wandering rather than direct attack. Her discovery decision—interpreting the ship carving—alters her understanding and forecloses the tragic-interruption narrative. Present across setup, middle (wandering/freeing stone), and payoff (carved-ship realization). Causal pressure is strong; specificity high. Cost is felt in the acceptance shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial base appears early (embedded in fig roots), constrains Elara's middle action (multi-day freeing), and delivers the climactic ship carving on its underside at closure. The object's purpose-lost-to-time status resonates with interrupted journeys, and the final sunlight-striking moment charges the ending image. Three distinct beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceable (the carving would not work on another object). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys frame the entire story: Elara's task (excavate the tomb of a woman whose journey was "brutally interrupted"), the sundial "disconnected from its home," and the climactic repricing (the journey wasn't interrupted but eternally beginning). The concept shapes stakes and alters Elara's interpretive options at closure, reweighting prior material. Present across all three gates; causal and thematic pressure; cost legible. Could score higher if it generated a mid-scene tactical constraint beyond the reflective reframing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is signaled early ("her gaze warmly curious") and enables her method (observing sunlight, learning the land's language before disturbing it). It constrains her to wander rather than attack with tools, shaping the pacing. Present in setup and middle; the trait permits the discovery but does not visibly cost her or create friction at closure. Functional across two beats but replaceable with "patient" or "reverent" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rebuild is the task Elara sets herself, signaled early ("to rebuild the tomb") and enacted across the narrative: freeing the sundial base, clearing debris, hoisting the stone with the mason. The act of reconstruction counterpoints decay and delivers the ship-carving discovery that triggers the conceptual repricing. Three beats; causal driver; closure participation; irreplaceable (excavate or repair would not carry the same restoration-of-faith charge). High integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purposeful wandering is signaled early ("her method was one of purposeful wandering") and enacted across morning walks where she observes sunlight and learns the land's language. It shapes her discovery of the sundial base and reflects her belief that understanding must precede disturbance. Present in setup and middle; the method enables the find but does not constrain a choice under pressure or generate a visible trade-off at closure. Strong lyric coherence but mid-causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is anchored early (roots over bones, scent of soil/blossoms) and supplies the fig tree that grips the sundial base, constraining Elara's multi-day freeing effort. The setting's life/decay duality charges the final image (roots as continuity, not death). Present across all three gates; alters tactics; charges closure. Irreplaceable: a generic graveyard would not deliver the root-grip obstacle or the roots-as-testament thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Time is anchored ("over several days" for freeing the stone; "two generations prior" for diaspora context) and the excavation task frames the narrative window. The timeframe signals progression but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Setup and middle gates met; payoff present (tomb repair complete). Functional but does not constrain choices under a live clock; swappable with "across several visits" without major impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Restore lost faith is Elara's stated task, signaled in the opening ("a profound hollowness where her faith in their stories should have been") and tested across wandering and excavation. The ship carving delivers the realization that shifts what faith means (not in success tales but in courage to sail). Present across all gates; causal pressure; closure linkage. Cost is felt in the hollow-filling acceptance. Strong integration; minor dock for the therapeutic phrasing at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cautious enchantment is named early ("fostered a cautious enchantment within her") and sustained through meditative walks, damp-soil-and-blossoms imagery, and the "sudden, sharp understanding" that breaks caution. Tone modulates purposefully from wariness to the warmth blooming in her chest at closure. Coherent across turns; charges the final image (stone glowing with warmth mirroring her feeling). Strong coherence but slightly hampered by the label-like phrase in paragraph one.</comment>
