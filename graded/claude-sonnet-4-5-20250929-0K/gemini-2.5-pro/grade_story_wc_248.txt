<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior states are tracked through concrete markers—the tapestry worry-smoothed in his hand, the "quiet detonation in his chest"—and contradictory impulses coexist: volcanic rage versus the intuitive part that "stilled it." The shift from arson to brush-work is earned by the incremental discoveries, though the final resolve ("hands, which had once held a torch, now reached for a brush") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than lived embodiment. Backstory on Elara and the arson is economically seeded without hijacking present pressure, and the closure choice—complete rather than repair—forecasts cost with visible commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—who (Kaelen, arsonist), where (Xylos Archive), and when (five years post-arson)—land in the opening paragraph. The causal chain is motivated: tapestry fragment → petroglyph trail → sarcophagus mole → pressure-plate chamber → lens-key reveal; each link constrains the next move. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kaelen shifts from destruction to creation, the final image ("hands...reached for a brush") crystallizes intent with felt cost (he foreclosed violence, embraced labor), and the inferred lens—Causal with Accumulative texture—holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive is concretely rendered: "dust-choked silence," "scent of petrified paper and time," basalt walls, and a high window fissure that the tapestry-lens exploits. These details constrain Kaelen's detective moves—he must align fabric-weave with afternoon sun—and the micro-setting (easel, canvas, frame initials) supplies the closure pivot. Spatial choreography is clean across five years of solitude compressed into a single scene of discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescue Elara's truth from erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each discovery. The pressure-plate chamber gates the climax; once inside, Kaelen's agency ("he held it up, aligning it...") unlocks the hidden testament, a meaningful tightening that narrows options from rage-fueled destruction to painstaking completion. The cost is legible: he commits to labor over fire, foreclosing the cathartic repeat of arson, and the final image charges that choice with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—survival against erasure, creation as witness—emerges through the tapestry/lens key, the vandalized canvas reimagined as medium, and Kaelen's shift from torch to brush. No direct thesis statement mars the ending; instead "the bedrock of his art, a quiet, enduring fire in the dark" reweights the volcanic opening metaphor without moralizing. The black-slash incorporation ("she had anticipated the desecration and made it part of her masterpiece") offers a non-literal answer to the central question: how to preserve truth when the world erases it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable and filtered through Kaelen's analytical-intuitive lens ("his mind...saw what others would miss"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular, though occasional elevated registers ("a necropolis of forgotten knowledge," "a marriage of the analytically intuitive") edge past street-level idiom for a man five years off-grid. No dialogue appears; interiority carries the scene. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the lens-alignment beat, pulling back slightly for the final resolve paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflective close) and information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or reweight motive. Two minor artifacts surface: "volcanic" recurs three times (opening metaphor, "volcanic heat," implicit in "quiet...fire"), risking over-pattern, and the final paragraph stacks several metaphoric closures in quick succession ("a curator of a true one," "give a ghost her voice back," "quiet, enduring fire") that border on summary eloquence rather than lean image. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist turns curator, vandalized art incorporates its own violation—is a fresh synthesis, and the lens-key mechanic (tapestry filtering light to reveal hidden text) offers a non-obvious solve. However, the "artist's work stolen by a celebrated plagiarist" and "hidden message in layered paint" tropes are familiar; transformation lies in the integration (Elara anticipated desecration) rather than the beats themselves. The final image earns its inevitability through prior particulars, but the archetypal ghost-sister and redemptive-creation arc hold recognizable contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout; his past arson frames stakes (paragraph one), his choices drive each beat (align tapestry, decode slash), and the closure decision—complete the work with brush, not torch—is causally earned. Early setup, two-plus beats (trail-following, lens-use, final commitment), and closure linkage all register. Cost is visible: he forecloses the volcanic option and commits to patient labor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in paragraph one ("clutched in his hand, threads worn smooth"), reappears as key in paragraph two ("held up to the petroglyphs"), and again in paragraph six ("Unfolding the faded tapestry fragment...a lens key...he held it up"). Its weave filters light to reveal hidden text, a distinct causal function across three beats. The object is indispensable: without it, Kaelen cannot unlock Elara's testament. Specificity (star pattern, fabric weave) and closure linkage (enables the climactic reveal) elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is the story's hinge: introduced in paragraph five, it is the object Kaelen seeks and the medium Elara weaponized. The black slash is not mere vandalism but canvas for her hidden testament (paragraph six), and Kaelen's final choice—complete rather than repair—directly engages the desecration. Stakes, tactics, and closure all turn on this element; removing it collapses the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is named in paragraph two ("his mind, a strange marriage of the analytically intuitive, saw what others would miss") and enables Kaelen to decode the petroglyph shifts and anticipate the lens-key mechanic. It appears once more implicitly when he "stilled" rage with intuition (paragraph five). The trait shapes two on-page actions but remains partly label-driven; visible trade-offs (e.g., missing an obvious clue due to over-analysis) are absent, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Portray" seeds in paragraph one ("protect her work"), crystallizes in the penultimate paragraph ("his purpose was no longer just to find her truth, but to portray it"), and anchors the closure image ("reached for a brush"). The verb replaces "rescue" and "incinerate," redefining Kaelen's method. Two beats (initial promise, final commitment) and direct closure linkage; however, the shift from "portray" to "complete" and "curator" introduces slight synonym drift, preventing top-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The trail—star-nosed mole, added constellation, pressure-plate mosaic—is signaled in paragraph two ("a trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message, a scavenger hunt") and drives paragraphs three and four as Kaelen follows each marker. The method shapes his attempts and delivers him to the sealed chamber. Early setup, middle development (two discovery beats), and payoff (trail concludes at the canvas) satisfy all three gates, though the mechanics (how he knew to look for carvings) remain gestural rather than granular.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Xylos Archive is named and described (dust, basalt, petroglyphs, sarcophagus, high window) and supplies the climactic resource: the afternoon sun through a fissure enables the lens-key reveal. The setting is integral to closure—without the archive's light and Elara's hidden placement, the testament remains invisible. Setup (paragraph one), development (trail navigation), and payoff (light mechanic) all land, though the "necropolis of forgotten knowledge" risks decorative phrasing in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" appears in the subtitle and is briefly quantified ("five years") in paragraph one. The timeframe establishes Kaelen's isolation but does not tighten on-page decisions; no ticking clock or duration pressure alters his archive search. The element is present and consistent but replaceable—"recently" or "a decade" would leave the closure unchanged. Setup exists; development and payoff do not.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The promise—"to always protect her work," whispered over a shared canvas as children—is seeded in paragraph three and explicitly restated in paragraph seven ("fulfill the promise"). It drives Kaelen's entire quest and shifts at closure from protection-by-destruction to protection-by-completion. The motivation is dramatized through tactile discoveries ("quiet detonation in his chest," "tenderness so fierce it threatened to crack his ribs") and the final choice. Friction appears (rage versus creation), and cost is visible (labor replaces catharsis).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is named in paragraph one ("volcanic eruption that had left him scorched") and paragraph three ("tenderness so fierce"), modulates under pressure (paragraph five: "Rage, hot and familiar, coiled...but the intuitive part of him stilled it"), and charges the final image ("tenderness was no longer a weapon of destruction but the bedrock of his art, a quiet, enduring fire"). The tone coheres through turns—heat cools to diamond resolve—and the diction (scorch, coil, bedrock, fire) maintains the geological-emotional register. Slight over-articulation in the closing lines ("quiet, enduring fire in the dark") nudges into summary rather than pure image.</comment>
