<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal drive is clear and consistent, but her motivation remains abstract throughout. The revelation at the cathedral feels handed to her rather than earned through difficult choices—she observes and deduces without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The great-grandmother portrait provides emotional resonance, yet Elara's arc lacks the contradictory impulses or embodied struggle that would elevate characterization into the high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Causal lens with motivated progression from postcard clue to cathedral discovery to layered revelation. Orientation anchors early (amber pavilion, postcards, winter's end). The closure—understanding her inheritance and the flowers' night-blooming philosophy—lands on the page with conceptual cost (a lifetime question answered, lineage discovered). One persistent weakness: the protagonist's agency is observational rather than decisional; the window reveals itself through patient method rather than through choices that foreclose alternatives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting work is strong and purposeful: the amber pavilion frames the quest, the neglected cathedral quarter adds atmosphere, and the rose window itself becomes the puzzle that constrains Elara's method. The colored filters and angled light function as tools that enable discovery. The melting snow serves as temporal anchor and thematic echo. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory details—dust motes, weak light, violet-filtered glow—are filtered through Elara's artist's perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and drives the quest. Pressure accumulates through weeks of observation and culminates in the multi-layered revelation. However, escalation relies on puzzle-solving rather than choices that narrow options or exact visible cost. The final revelation reweights the question (inheritance, strength in darkness) but Elara's path to it encounters no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would push this into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the layered glass metaphor: night-blooming as strength nurtured by darkness rather than shyness, inheritance as shared passion across generations. The final image—cosmic roots and starlit blossoms—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. "Umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush" carry consistent thematic weight. One minor slip: "The truth of the bloom is not in the soil, but in the glass" edges toward riddle-speak, though it's motivated as the grandmother's note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent focalization through Elara's artist's perception. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"amber pavilion," "bruised sky," "umbral tenderness"—that suits the quest-narrative tone. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "understood") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate. One pressure point: the elevated diction ("liminal state," "choreography of light and shadow") occasionally drifts from visceral immediacy during discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. The multi-layered glass revelation sequence is clearly choreographed with strong visual specificity. Two friction points lower the score: minor paraphrase loops ("The dawning hush was no longer just a time of day but a state of being" recaps earlier material) and occasional figurative density in non-peak beats ("mosaic of faded ink," "timeframe became the melting," "bruised sky") that risks ornamentation. No major artifacts touch closure, but the accumulation prevents entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The layered-glass mystery and generational inheritance offer a fresh synthesis of artist-quest and botanical obsession. The mechanics of colored filters revealing hidden etchings show ingenuity. However, the core premise—artist discovers ancestor's secret encoded in art—follows a recognizable template. The night-blooming flowers as metaphor for "strength nurtured by quiet and starlight" feels earnest but edges toward thematic comfort. The specific execution through glass-work saves it from derivative territory, but transformation of the template remains partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's profession shapes her method (colored filters from her studio, artist's intuition) and appears in the opening, middle problem-solving, and ending vision of murals. However, her role as mural artist observes more than it constrains choices—she could be any careful observer with filters. The ending's mural vision provides closure participation but arrives as declaration rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Postcards appear in the opening beat (grandmother's collection) and provide the key clue (Lunaria Noctiflora with note, faded postmark leading to cathedral). They are handled on the page and enable the quest. However, they do not return with reweighted meaning at closure—their function exhausts at setup. Two beats (opening study, cathedral connection) with causal pressure but no closure reprise limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is introduced early as the liminal state when Elara notices the anomaly, reappears as her method's timing, and is internalized at closure ("no longer just a time of day but a state of being"). It shapes her observation tactics and charges the final image. However, it functions more as atmospheric timing than as a constraint that narrows options under pressure. Present across three beats with thematic payoff but limited causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attribute appears explicitly ("quietly driven by an internal search") in the opening and implicitly throughout (weeks of patient observation, determined return with lantern). It enables persistence but does not constrain or create visible trade-offs. The trait is shown through action (waiting, angling light) but no cost or opportunity is foreclosed by this quality specifically. Functional presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears explicitly ("she had to reckon with the window's silence") and structures the entire middle sequence: Elara must solve the puzzle through her "careful choreography of light and shadow" rather than passive waiting. The action drives the revelation and cannot be swapped—her active interrogation of the glass defines the turn. Present in setup (determination), middle (method), and payoff (understanding earned through this reckoning). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (rose window, unusual panel), dominates the middle revelation sequence (violet filter reveals roots, blue filter reveals constellations, white light reveals portrait), and produces the closure discovery. The mechanics matter on the page—each filter uncovers a specific layer, and the great-grandmother's portrait appears only "with a soft, white light held just so." Removing this exact method collapses the story's central mechanism. Three beats, high specificity, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion appears in the opening and closing images, framing the quest and providing visual/thematic bookend ("amber memory of the autumn pavilion now connected to the silvery revelation"). However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no choices occur there, and it does not pressure tactics. The cathedral does the real setting work. The pavilion's lyric reprise reweights the emotional arc but remains ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is introduced early ("winter began its slow surrender," "melting of winter's last snow") and tracked through "weeks passed" to the final paragraph ("last vestiges of snow were melting"). It provides atmospheric progression and thematic resonance (spring as revelation). However, the melting does not tighten Elara's decisions—she could have spent any duration. The clock is present and coherent but does not alter tactics or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is explicit from paragraph one ("why flowers bloom at night"), drives every beat (postcard study, cathedral search, window interrogation), and receives direct answer at closure ("not as an act of shyness, but as a declaration of a different kind of strength"). The desire is dramatized through persistent action and shapes the ending's thematic reweighting. One friction: the motivation remains cerebral rather than conflicted—no competing want or cost complicates the pursuit. Strong presence and closure participation, limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears explicitly in the revelation beat ("Elara felt a profound, umbral tenderness for the artist") and modulates throughout: the "amber" warmth of autumn, the "bruised sky," the "quiet, hopeful intake of breath" at closure. The tone remains coherent through lyric elevation without becoming saccharine, and it charges the final image of "cosmic roots and starlit blossoms." The tone serves the material and intensifies at the discovery moment, though it holds one register rather than shifting dynamically with pressure.</comment>
