<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior is concrete and specific—his calligrapher's precision and urbane manner contrast effectively with the industrial setting. The internal conflict between artistic purity and audience harm is embodied through his tracing of the story stick and the memory of the hollow-eyed man, creating genuine ambivalence. His decision to perform a response piece is earned by the tremor of doubt and Elara's accusation, though the final shift reads slightly too assured given the preceding uncertainty. The micro-choices (retrieving the stick, opening the trunk, deciding to complicate rather than retract) effectively reveal his hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Kaelen in the radar dome, post-argument, holding the story stick. The causal lens holds throughout—Elara's accusation triggers doubt, doubt prompts memory of the hollow-eyed man, memory crystallizes the decision to answer rather than abandon his method. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he commits to a new show that complicates rather than retracts, reweighting his artistic stance without abandoning his core belief. Cost is present but somewhat implied—the baton metaphor and "point toward the dawn" soften what could be a sharper sacrifice or foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome provides excellent atmospheric specificity (curved walls, polished concrete, perfect hush, viewport) and the "meteor hush" tone pervades effectively. The story stick as micro-setting object returns with shifted weight at closure. The trunk of marionettes anchors the final beat concretely. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting doesn't actively constrain a choice in the middle beats—it's more atmospheric container than tactical pressure—keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether Kaelen's subversive method harms or enlightens. The memory of the hollow-eyed man provides meaningful tightening by personalizing the abstract ethical question. The decision to perform a response show narrows options (he won't abandon his method but will answer it) with visible cost in effort and creative risk. One strong pressure point drives the turn. The escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the causal-reflective lens, and the final choice forecloses the simpler path of either retraction or continuation unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges through concrete particulars: the story stick's communal tradition versus Kaelen's subversive method, the puppet king's logically sound catastrophes, the vivisectionist accusation. The central question—artist or vivisectionist—is answered obliquely through action (performing a complication, not a retraction) without stated moral. The final image of stars as "pinpricks of light in the vast, waiting quiet" resonates thematically, pointing toward possibility without tidy resolution. The "half-lit epiphany...toward the dawn" risks slight over-articulation but remains within character-driven reflection rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct: "calligrapher's precision," "perfectly rendered ideogram," diction matching Kaelen's urbane artistic sensibility. Elara's shouted dialogue contrasts effectively with Kaelen's interior restraint. The phrase "detonated in the minds of his audience" and "vivisectionist of the soul" occasionally drift toward slightly elevated metaphorical register, but remain voice-plausible for an artist reflecting on craft. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately from heated argument memory to serene decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with purposeful detail throughout. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately, accelerating through the argument memory and slowing for the closure decision. Minor issues: "This was his work, his core obsession" is mildly expository; "the first true stars of the evening" contains a small redundancy with "evening" and "twilight" already established. The metaphor density in the final paragraph approaches but doesn't cross into overwriting. "Baton being passed back to himself" is conceptually clear but slightly strained. No loops or template cadence; clarity remains strong. One small proofreading note: "exquisitely jointed marionettes" and later "pale, limbless bodies" creates a minor tension in the trunk description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frame of post-argument reflection in an abandoned radar dome combined with subversive puppet theater offers fresh synthesis. The ethical question of narrative responsibility avoids false-balance hedging—Kaelen remains committed to ambiguity as method, not moral relativism. The choice to "complicate" rather than retract or continue unchanged is a non-obvious emotional turn. The story stick as ancestral tool misused for a tragedy of logical decisions provides specific cultural and thematic texture. Risk: the final paragraph's symbolic loading (stars, dawn, pinpricks of light) approaches but doesn't fully tip into safety-hedged abstraction because the choice remains concrete and costly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's identity as urbane calligrapher shapes multiple beats: his fluid grace retrieving the stick, fingers tracing notches "with a calligrapher's precision," carving marionettes with that same precision, and the "perfectly rendered ideogram" simile for his decision clarity. The trait enables his artistic method and appears in the closure beat when he opens the trunk. Present early, drives two distinct beats (retrieval/tracing, trunk/carving connection), and participates in closure through craft-specific perception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in beat one (lying on floor, retrieved), beat two (traced, notches representing story beats, symbol for king's abdication examined), and closure (feels different, "baton being passed back"). Its dual meaning—Elara's communal tradition versus Kaelen's subversive prop—creates the core ethical tension. Removing it would collapse the story's central conflict between ancestral clarity and artistic ambiguity. The object's cultural weight and Kaelen's misuse drive the argument, the doubt, and the resolution to answer rather than retract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Half-lit epiphanies shape the dominant stake: Kaelen's method offers "half-lit epiphanies" not clean morals, Elara accuses him of leaving audiences in the dark, and the resolution is to offer "another half-lit epiphany, but this one would point toward the dawn." The concept is named, dramatized through the hollow-eyed man's response, and reappears transformed at closure. It constrains Kaelen's choice—he won't offer a happy ending but will present possibility. The lyric reprise reweights meaning, though the final articulation ("half-lit epiphany...toward the dawn") borders on over-explicit statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is established early as Kaelen's default composure, functions as shield against Elara's echoes, and persists through his doubt. At closure it shifts to "intense focus, the calm of a craftsman with...absolute purpose"—the trait modulates under pressure while remaining consistent. It enables his reflective method rather than reactive anger. The attribute appears in three beats and shapes his response pattern, though the cost isn't directly tied to serenity itself—more to his artistic stance broadly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "reverse" crystallizes in the pivotal decision: "for the first time, reverse its trajectory." This choice redefines all subsequent action—he will answer rather than retract or continue unchanged. The reversal is prepared by the tremor of doubt and the hollow-eyed man's memory, executed through the decision paragraph, and shapes the closure image of opening the trunk with "sudden and absolute purpose." Removing this specific framing would flatten the turn into simple continuation or retreat. The mechanics of reversal (complication not retraction, after not undoing) are made concrete.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are signaled early (second paragraph), detailed through "exquisitely jointed marionettes" and The Leaky Fuse location, and drive the ethical conflict—his method uses puppets to enact tales without clean morals. The method shapes his past action (last night's show of the puppet king), the present conflict (hollow-eyed man's reaction), and the planned response (tonight's new show of the kingdom after). The trunk of marionettes appears at closure. Mechanics matter: the shows are where his exploration happens and where the cost (potential harm) manifests.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is named in the opening line, provides atmospheric specificity (curved walls, polished concrete, perfect hush, viewport with stars), and reinforces the "meteor hush" tone. It offers symbolic resonance (abandoned communication structure for a story about failed communication) but doesn't actively constrain Kaelen's choice or alter tactics—he could make the same decision in any isolated space. The setting is setup and closure-present (viewport, stars) but the middle choice (deciding to perform again) isn't shaped by the dome's specific properties. Strong atmospheric work; weaker causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the opening immediately—Elara is gone, evidence remains, the argument is fresh. The temporal framing creates urgency: tonight he will return to The Leaky Fuse. The hush quality pervades as "meteor hush" throughout, charging the reflective space. By closure, "the first true stars of the evening were piercing the twilight," marking time's passage and the approach of tonight's performance. The timeframe tightens the decision (he must act soon) and the hush both enables reflection and amplifies Elara's accusation as lingering pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to explore ethical storytelling is established in paragraph two as "his core obsession," dramatized through his subversive method, tested by Elara's accusation ("You give them shadows and call it truth"), and complicated by the hollow-eyed man's response. The question "was he an artist or merely a vivisectionist of the soul" embodies the friction between intent (explore ethics) and cost (potential harm). At closure, the motivation evolves but doesn't abandon: "that exploration demanded a new path." The desire drives every major beat and pays a price—he must risk a more vulnerable offering.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced as opening anchor ("a quality of quiet that Kaelen had come to associate with the aftermath of falling stars"), sustained through "the dome's perfect hush" and Elara's whisper, and charges the final image with "the vast, waiting quiet" and distant stars. Tone modulates appropriately: tense during argument memory, contemplative through doubt, focused at decision. The silence functions as both atmospheric container and thematic pressure—it amplifies Elara's accusation and allows space for Kaelen's shift. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the closure's resonance without becoming static.</comment>
