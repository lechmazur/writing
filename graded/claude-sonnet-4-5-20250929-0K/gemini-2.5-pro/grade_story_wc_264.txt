<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior is richly specific—"occasionally everywhere" materializes as embodied sensation ("a net cast across the glowing sand"), and contradictory impulses appear when the pine memory triggers both mission loyalty and a phantom-limb ache. The final stirring toward dream is earned by the synthesis act and closes a want the opening declared absent. Minor deduction: the archive's anthropomorphized "restlessness" occasionally edges into tell rather than showing Kaelen's perception of chaotic data. No second character pressures stakes, so relationship bullets are not scored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of interference and synthesis, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) in the crystalline tree—before/after legible, cost felt as renunciation of erasure and acceptance of hybridity. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by line three. One meaningful deepening: the memory's violent intrusion tightens the dilemma, and Kaelen's weaving choice forecloses erasure with visible cost ("You do not have to be what you were"). Closure coheres under the lens and makes cost undeniable in the tree's geometry and Kaelen's first dream-feeling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the dune's fragile peace and shimmering blooms react to the memory spike, making erasure versus synthesis legible. The crystalline tree charges the final image by merging sand-glow with pine geometry. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's professional priorities (ghost-pale flora, resinous scent). Minor gap: spatial choreography of the skiff cockpit versus the surrounding dune is loose; we do not see Kaelen exit or physically approach the tree, slightly weakening embodiment at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve archive fragility without betrayal—is signaled early and tested when the pine memory threatens to "shatter the fragile peace." The tightening is clear: Kaelen cannot erase (mission betrayal) or ignore (fabric tears). Agency is renunciation of the easy erasure plus active synthesis, with visible cost: the tree is "not truly" a tree, a compromise that forecloses restoration of the original. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, cost legible in the hybrid form and Kaelen's hand on the frozen clock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—acceptance of transformation over restoration, continuity through synthesis—emerges organically from the charming act and is never stated. The crystalline tree answers the thematic question non-literally: the past cannot return but may inform the present without shattering it. The chess clock (frozen endings) and first dream-feeling bookend the arc, reweighting stasis into generative possibility. Subtext operates in "You only have to be," avoiding overt moralizing. The final image offers resonance without a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, psychic reach controlled ("Kaelen's awareness spread thin" cued by the conduit method). Diction is voice-particular: "ghost of history," "fractured lullaby," "perilously, wonderfully" all cohere in a lyric-technical register. Purposeful compression in "occasionally everywhere" is taught through repeated embodiment and paid off at closure. No dialogue to judge. Minor tic: "the method was elegant in its complexity" tells rather than trusts the wave-function weaving to show elegance, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level is strong: "a net cast across the glowing sand" and "filament of captured light" are concrete and propulsive. Rhythm modulates well—short declaratives at the crisis ("The violent shuddering ceased"), longer syntactic weave during reflection. One artifact cluster lowers score: "ghost-pale flora" / "ghost-memory" / "quantum ghost" repeats "ghost" as a crutch modifier across three early paragraphs without functional variation, and "the feeling of being everywhere receding back into the solid, singular form" mildly paraphrases the established "occasionally everywhere" concept. Neither touches closure, so deduction is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory and landscape through wave-function persuasion is conceptually fresh, and the crystalline tree is a non-obvious resolution that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present: the lyric frame and "occasionally everywhere" conceit could obscure, yet clarity holds. Minor friction: the "divergent archive" and quantum mechanics tap familiar SFF furniture; transformation occurs via the specificity of Kaelen's charming choice and the tree's hybrid form rather than the archive concept itself. No close echoes of famous images detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's decision to weave rather than erase drives the key turn and shapes the ending's synthesis. Present throughout, the character's renunciation of the easy erasure path creates the crystalline tree. Cost is visible: compromise on restoration, the tree "not truly" a tree.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The chess clock appears in beat one (command console) and returns at closure ("Their hand rested on the cold glass...forever frozen at the end of the old game"). The reprise reweights it: stasis shifts from endpoint to precondition for new dreams. Missing middle development and no active handling lower the score; it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a tool that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The divergent archive shapes the inciting disturbance (memory spike) and defines Kaelen's mission ("to cultivate the sparks"). It pressures the central choice: betray the archive's purpose or let chaos run. Present in all three gates, it enables the synthesis tactic. Swappability moderate: another repository concept could function similarly with edits, so irreplaceability is mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" is signaled early, embodied mid-story ("a point of awareness in every grain...and simultaneously inside the ghost-memory"), and enables the wave-function overlap that resolves the crisis. The trait constrains method—Kaelen must spread thin to charm—and charges the ending when singularity returns with the first dream. Cost legible: the dispersal is effortful, and return feels like recovery. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Charm" is named early ("the only way to charm the chaos"), executed in the weaving sequence ("a delicate charm, a persuasion aimed at existence"), and produces the tree. The action is not merely combat or repair but persuasion, fitting the divergent-archive ethic. Swapping "charm" for "repair" or "coax" would lose tonal and thematic specificity. Drives the major turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" is signaled mid-story ("coaxing probabilities like a musician teases notes") and executed on-page ("let the wave functions...overlap, allowing them to interfere and resonate"). The method's mechanics—overlap and resonance—directly produce the hybrid tree. Missing early setup (first mention ~40% in) and one-beat use lower score, but causal necessity at closure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing dune supplies the ghost-pale flora whose light stutters under memory pressure, making the threat concrete. The sand's luminescence merges with pine geometry in the tree, charging the closure image. Setting constrains the choice: fragile peace must be preserved. Present in all three gates, with closure participation strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last forest burned to ash" frames backstory and explains why the pine memory is alien. It primes Kaelen's phantom-limb reaction and the ethical weight of choosing synthesis over restoration. Missing middle and closure beats: time does not tighten tactics on the page. Functional context but replaceable with other post-catastrophe markers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated early and dramatized in the choice to nurture rather than erase the memory. Friction appears when cultivation risks shattering peace. The tree is the literal spark cultivated. Cost legible: compromise on fidelity to the past. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit in the weaving act.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" is taught in the opening ("silent hum...the only lullaby") and modulated through the crisis ("a fractured lullaby whispered to a feverish child"). Tone charges the final image: the dream-feeling is the lullaby's first note after lifelong silence. Coherent through pressure, with cadence shift at closure that reweights the dreamless premise. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
