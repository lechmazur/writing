<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is grounded and his method is consistent with his established traits. The love that "outlived its object" produces embodied choices: he refuses to slash-and-burn corrupted files, opts for comparative method, and whispers reassurance at the climax. Internal contradiction is present—grief versus duty—but the character tilts toward contemplative rather than genuinely contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act earns the integration with visible cost (accepting the shadow as part of Elara), though the interiority occasionally uses elevated register ("abiding sorrow," "luminous regret") that sits at the edge of diagnostic label-speak without crossing into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates detail through comparison (old footage versus corrupted memory), deepens via the shadow's origin reveal, and lands closure when Kael reweaves the shadow into Elara's archive with visible cost (the light-vines revive to silvery blue, not their original green). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Kael's love holds a soul together by accepting darkness). One meaningful deepening occurs when he identifies the dream-fall as the shadow's origin, narrowing his approach. Cost is legible: the archive is "whole again, saved not by erasing the darkness but by accepting it as the price of her light." Minor penalty for one conceptual echo near the end ("the shape of hope was secure") that slightly restates rather than charges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Lumina-Arbor as blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful; the console, pearl, and river stone constrain Kael's ritual. The holographic panes and light-vines are integrated into action. Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's professional lens (spectral light-vines, wilted sections, twilight staining clouds). The micro-setting (console, stone) charges the final image when the stone hums with warmth. Penalize slightly for the phrase "memories cultivated like orchids" and "light-vines" which read as slightly ornamental rather than mechanically necessary, and the window view of the "cloud-sea" adds atmosphere without altering a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve Elara's archive without erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael identifies the shadow's origin (the shared dream-fall) and narrows his method to integration rather than deletion. The final act—initiating the integration sequence and "presenting the shadow with the memories it had tried to erase"—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the slash-and-burn path with visible cost (the new silvery-blue hue, the mask breaking into "fragile, real" sorrow). No explicit antagonist, but the shadow's autonomous consumption creates pressure. The cost is legible: Elara's memory is whole but changed, and Kael's regret remains "a permanent resident."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events and image: preservation requires accepting darkness, not erasing it. The river stone, light-vines, and the shadow's metamorphosis build the motif without overt statement. The final image—silvery-blue light-vines and the warm stone—offers a resonant answer: hope's shape includes sorrow's weight. Subtext operates in Kael's whispered reassurance and the phrase "I'm not letting you fall," which reweights the dream-fall origin. The piece resists tidy morals; the shadow is integrated, not vanquished. Minor penalty for "the shape of hope" appearing three times, with the final instance ("The shape of hope was secure") slightly restating rather than deepening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Kael; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature is consistent: "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" filters detail through archival and emotional lenses. Diction is elevated and purposeful, though phrases like "abiding sorrow" and "luminous regret" approach abstraction. The whispered dialogue ("It's alright, Elara. I'm not letting you fall.") is brief, goal-driven, and voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean. The narrative voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity (the urgency of "devouring the rest of her" versus the quiet of the final paragraph). Minor penalty for slightly abstract register in peak moments that edges toward committee voice rather than Kael's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied. Sentences advance character and atmosphere with high information density ("a sliver of forgotten trauma from a shared nightmare that had broken free from her core"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motifs. Minor penalty for two moments of elevated abstraction: "a testament to a love strong enough to hold a soul together" and "the shape of hope was secure" feel slightly declarative rather than embodied. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "a poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose" is a stock metaphor. No scaffold artifacts or pronoun confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—curator restoring a corrupted digital consciousness by comparing video across time—offers a fresh angle on archive/memory tropes. The method (silent video comparison revealing micro-gestures) is specific and non-obvious. The emotional core (love that outlives its object, preservation through acceptance of darkness) is grounded in character rather than gimmick. Transformation test passes: the plot hinges on Kael's particular method and Elara's specific corruption. Minor penalty for the shadow-as-autonomous-entity trope, which is familiar in SF/fantasy, and the "memories like orchids" simile, which reads as decorative. The resolution feels earned in hindsight, and the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael as "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is signaled early, drives the method (noticing the discordance in video footage), and shapes the climax (he "saw the exact moment it had started"). His observation enables the key decision to integrate rather than delete. The trait constrains his approach (he "wouldn't slash and burn") and charges the ending. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The river stone is introduced early as "the last physical gift she had ever given him," reappears when Kael places it on the console's central node as "a conduit for his intent," and returns at closure humming with warmth. Three beats, but the stone's function is symbolic rather than mechanically necessary; the integration sequence could proceed without it. The reprise reweights meaning but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadow unbound is the core problem: "a sliver of forgotten trauma...now it was devouring the rest of her." It shapes stakes (Elara's archive is being consumed) and tactics (Kael must integrate it, not delete it). The shadow's origin (the dream-fall) is identified at midpoint, and the climax is the integration sequence. Present in setup and closure, and it changes options. However, the shadow's autonomous agency feels slightly generic; the specific mechanics of how it "devoured" versus merely corrupted are not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is attributed to Kael's approach early ("His approach was softly deliberate, born of a love that outlived its object") and constrains his method: he refuses the quick fix of deletion and chooses the slower comparative method. The trait is visible in his hours of watching and his whispered reassurance. However, the phrase itself appears only once as a label; the trait is shown through pacing and choice rather than repeatedly tested. Present in setup and middle development, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears twice: the corruption is described as "a slow, insidious metamorphosis," and at closure "the right-hand hologram begin to metamorphose" as the shadow integrates. The action redefines the archive's state and drives the resolution. The final metamorphosis is the story's decisive change: the light-vines revive to silvery blue, the mask breaks, and sorrow becomes "fragile, real, and heartbreakingly beautiful." Indispensable to the closure image; removing it would collapse the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent video footage from decades apart—is signaled early and occupies the middle section. Kael "pulled two holographic panes into the air," watches "for hours," and identifies the discordance in gestures. The method enables the origin discovery and shapes his integration tactic. Present in setup, development, and indirectly at closure (the hologram metamorphoses). The specificity matters: silent footage forces attention to gesture, and the decades-apart comparison reveals the slow corruption. Strong integration, though the method could theoretically be replaced by another comparative technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is established in the opening sentence and provides atmospheric grounding. The console, light-vines, and window view are integrated into action. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter the outcome; Kael's work could occur in any archive with holographic tech. The setting charges the tone (ethereal, elevated) and the final image (twilight, cloud-sea), but it is not mechanically necessary. Present in setup and closure reprise, but swappable for another high-tech archive without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after dreams become shareable"—is mentioned in the opening and enables the premise (consciousness preservation). However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or temporal pressure is invoked. The era is worldbuilding context rather than a constraint that alters Kael's moves. The phrase "for weeks, a subtle blight had crept" suggests elapsed time, but no live deadline shapes the climax. Present in setup only; missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is named early as Kael's purpose and anchors his dominant stake. The phrase recurs: "That hope had a name: Elara," and at closure, "The shape of hope was secure." His choices—refusing deletion, comparing footage, integrating the shadow—are all motivated by this desire. Friction is present: preserving hope requires accepting darkness, and the cost is his enduring regret. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; the phrase appears as a thesis statement rather than a lived tension. Present in setup, development, and closure, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Luminous regret saturates the piece: "a love that outlived its object," "the regret was a permanent resident in his heart, but it was luminous," and the twilight imagery. Tone is coherent through turns and modulates with pressure (urgency during the diagnosis, quiet during the integration). The final image—warm stone, last sliver of sun, luminous regret—charges the closure. The tone is indispensable; removing it would flatten the emotional resonance. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, with the ending crystallizing the tone's contradictory beauty.</comment>
