<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's progression from "affectionate skeptic" to someone whose "skepticism wavered" feels earned through embodied experience—the cold dread blooming in his sternum, his protective wave of affection. Lena's fierce belief and the somatic specificity of her grief ("That cold... I've never been able to describe it") ground both characters in contradictory impulses. The final intertwining of fingers with pulse awareness embodies the closure choice. Minor slip: "willowglass hope" in the final paragraph edges toward label-speak, but the immediate grounding in the geode and pulse rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal-Hybrid trending Accumulative at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (studio, camera remote, Lena across the room). The core sequence—first image captures grief, second captures love, recognition creates their "perfect, irrefutable language"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) with felt cost: Elias's skepticism cracks, and they commit to a private system over external validation. One tightening deepens the dominant stake (connection post-pills). Cost is legible in "hairline crack in a solid wall" and the mutual vulnerability of reaching out despite doubt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as micro-setting that enables the experiment and charges the final images. The muscovite geode sliver constrains choice (it's a conduit or placebo) and appears at closure, catching light and anchoring their signal. Sensory detail is selective: the "small red light a lone star," the "cavernous dark," the hum of studio lights returning. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (remote, shutter, LED wand, camera screen). The studio's darkness and the geode's layered structure both pressure the proof Elias seeks and deliver the visual metaphor at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding a tangible language for their alleged connection. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias proposes "the real test"—the static shock memory—escalating from neutral grief to personal affection. The protagonist's agency (devising the somatic-marker system, choosing the second memory) drives both beats. Cost is visible: his skepticism cracks, foreclosing the option of dismissing her as deluded. The ending reconfigures their shared reality from "mass-induced delusion" to "their own perfect, irrefutable language," with the visible price of mutual vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the contrast between "sterile logic" and embodied connection, skepticism meeting belief halfway. The two light paintings ("two sides of a secret coin") offer a non-literal answer to the central question—can they bridge the gap the pills failed to deliver?—without moralizing. The geode's layers catching light and the pulse against pulse in the final lines resonate without stating thesis. "It didn't matter if it was a conduit or a placebo" explicitly names the thematic resolution but does so as a renunciation of the need for proof, which feels earned rather than preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: "affectionate skeptic," the framing of Lena's belief as both loved and doubted. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("Ready?" / "Always."). The phrase "willowglass hope" in the penultimate paragraph risks register drift—"willowglass" reads neologistic and slightly precious for Elias's established voice—but the surrounding concrete detail (geode, pulse) keeps the passage grounded. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the experiments and opening slightly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm and information density are strong. A few minor scaffolds appear: "He wanted to say, *Ready for what, another disappointment?* but he bit back the doubt" is a standard "wanted to / but" construction; "his voice full of a hope so fragile it felt like spun glass" stacks metaphor without adding pressure. The phrase "willowglass hope" in the final paragraph is a neologism without prior anchoring, risking opacity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language density is controlled except in two beats where metaphor leans decorative ("hairline crack in a solid wall" is serviceable but stock). Overall propulsion is clean with vivid, selective detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of light painting, somatic markers, and post-telepathy-pill disillusionment feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "affectionate skeptic meets believer" through embodied experiment rather than argument is fresh. The two light paintings as emotional portraits ("portrait of grief, the other a map of love") offer a concrete visual metaphor that grows organically from premise. Risk: the piece commits fully to its quasi-supernatural premise without hedging. Minor derivative note: the skeptic-believer romance and the "find our own language" resolution echo familiar templates, but the execution through light and body elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is seeded early as "affectionate skeptic" and his key choices—proposing the experiment, choosing the second memory, reaching out at closure—create both turns. His skepticism "wavering" is the story's hinge. Agency is clear and drives escalation. Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure at each beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears early (Lena cradles it), anchors backstory (gift "years ago"), and returns at closure ("layers catching the light"). Its function as potential conduit or placebo frames the experiment. However, it is handled passively—Lena holds it, Elias observes it—and does not constrain an on-page action. The closure line "It didn't matter if it was a conduit or a placebo" reweights it thematically. Two-gate participation (setup, closure reprise) with thematic charge but no middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall backstory is seeded early (pills stopped "months ago," trial dubbed "mass-induced delusion") and shapes the dominant stake: proving or accepting a residual connection. The experiment exists because the pills failed. The closure rejects external validation in favor of their private language, directly addressing the concept's promise and failure. Present in setup and shaping closure, with clear causal pressure on the protagonist's motivation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes the first light painting's structure on the camera screen. It appears at the key recognition beat—Lena identifies her grandfather's funeral—and the precision signals authenticity, cracking Elias's skepticism. The attribute constrains interpretation: the pattern's mathematical exactness makes coincidence less plausible. One beat use with visible cost to protagonist's worldview. No setup or reprise, but the middle use is decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Devise" is the story's engine: Elias proposes to "devise a system to translate her alleged mental broadcasts into something tangible." This decision launches the experiment, structures both attempts, and delivers closure when they "had devised their own perfect, irrefutable language." The action is specific (somatic markers → light painting), irreplaceable, and reappears at closure with reweighted meaning. Present in setup, drives both middle beats, and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Somatic markers are explained early ("through somatic markers... a tightness in my chest, a warmth in my hands"), tested twice (cold dread → blue slashes; protective warmth → white spiral), and succeed where telepathy pills failed. The mechanics matter: feeling before painting, body as translator. The method is irreplaceable—remove it and the experiment has no logic. Present in setup, drives both attempts, and validates the closure claim.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio enables the experiment through its "cavernous dark," shutter control, and LED wands. The darkness is necessary for light painting and for the somatic focus. The studio's tools (camera remote, wands, screen) are used actively. Setting shapes tactics (plunge into darkness, trace with light, review image) and charges the final images. Present in setup, structures both middle beats, and the final "light" detail appears at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the static shock" is seeded immediately ("a week after the static shock, a week since...") and the static-shock memory becomes the second, decisive test. The timeframe defines the story's scope (post-pill, post-shock, seeking proof) and the second experiment explicitly revisits that moment. Present in setup and drives the climactic beat. Does not tighten decisions during the experiment itself, but the backward look is essential to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to illuminate hidden pathways between them" is stated early and shapes both experiments. The friction between his skepticism and her belief creates pressure at each beat. The final line "They had devised their own perfect, irrefutable language" fulfills the motivation with visible cost (skepticism cracks, mutual vulnerability accepted). Dramatized through choices and embodied struggle, not merely told. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" appears only in the penultimate paragraph ("her eyes shining with a willowglass hope that he now felt reflected in his own chest"). The neologism is unexplained and slightly precious, but the context (fragile, translucent, shared) is inferrable. Tone modulates from doubt ("another disappointment?") to wavering skepticism to mutual hope. The final image (intertwined fingers, pulse) embodies the tone shift. Charges the final image but lacks setup, and the coinage risks opacity.</comment>
