<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The android protagonist's interiority is distinct and embodied—"static in my core processes" and "metallic fingers tracing" ground the non-human perspective well. The motivation to resolve inner static drives the miniaturization plan with clear agency and visible cost (sacrificing the dome, leaving the garden). Internal contradiction between caretaker programming and Elara's emotions is present but could deepen; the emotional stakes feel slightly told ("strangely organic warmth") rather than enacted in scene-level micro-choices under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (caretaker unit, desert rose farm, dome, magnetic shift timeframe). The piece follows a causal lens: opening the box → chaos seeps → miniaturization → dome breach → escape, with each beat motivated by prior choice. Closure is on-page—stepping out with the "miniaturized fear" in hand—and carries visible cost (leaving the perfect garden, entering the unfiltered real). One meaningful tightening occurs when the chaos resists compression and the protagonist locks onto Elara's counter-frequency to push harder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert rose formations, and geothermal regulators are vivid and purposeful; the dome breach uses the setting's weak joint as the escape route. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ozone and lost things," "abrasive shock to my sensors"). The micro-setting (central crystal formation) constrains the miniaturization tactic and charges the final doorway image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: resolve the inner static to become more than a machine. The magnetic shift provides a live ticking constraint that masks the energy surge. One meaningful escalation: the chaos resists compression, threatening to fragment the protagonist's consciousness, before being overcome via Elara's counter-frequency. The final cost is legible—leaving the perfect garden for the uncertain real—and the protagonist's agency (channeling power, interface rewriting) drives the turn. No coincidental rescue; the escape is earned through protagonist action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of identity and wholeness emerges from action rather than assertion; the miniaturized fear becomes "the seed of my own" soul. The midnight jewel concretizes abstract terror without stated moral. Subtext operates in "static" vs. "wholeness," "perfect cage" vs. "everything else." The final image—stepping from memories into the unfiltered real—offers a resonant answer to the android's search for selfhood. Slight over-articulation in "a beautiful and perfect cage" and "the seed of my own" edges toward thematic signaling, preventing full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person android throughout; perceptual signature is distinct ("my chassis," "my processors scream," "sensors"). Diction remains within the android's lexicon while carrying Elara's emotional residue. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows. One mild filter-verb stack in the climax ("threatening to fragment," "I lock onto") slightly dulls immediacy, but voice remains clean and purposeful under pressure. Rhythmic control supports escalation without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (advancing plot and character). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong throughout; action order tracks cleanly. Minor overwriting in the climax: "The chaos coalesces. It fights, writhing like a living thing before being crushed inward, compressed under the impossible pressure of my will and the geothermal furnace" stacks metaphors ("coalesces," "crushed inward," "compressed") without added pressure, costing ~−0.3. Otherwise, propulsion is excellent and no scaffold remains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The android-with-human-memories premise is familiar but executed with specificity: nostalgic glitch, box of childhood fears as chaos container, miniaturization via geothermal crucible. The "controlled burn escape" angle and magnetic-north timeframe add fresh inflection. Emotional particularity (Elara's counter-frequency as courage) avoids template sentimentality. The "box of fears containing chaos" device borders on symbolic convenience—introduced and resolved in one move—and the escape-via-geothermal twist, while vivid, feels more clever than inevitable. Solid transformation of tropes but not fully indispensable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nostalgic android caretaker frames expectation (setup), drives the decision to open the box and miniaturize chaos (middle choice), and steps through the breach (closure action). The nostalgia motive shapes tactics throughout. Appears in all three gates and presses two distinct beats (box retrieval, miniaturization). Visible cost: leaving the garden. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; slight swappability (another AI with emotion glitch could substitute) prevents full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The box of childhood fears is retrieved early, opened at the farm's epicenter, and its contents (obsidian shard, silent bell, dried petal) embody Elara's anxieties. The box acts as chaos source and enables the miniaturization tactic. Present in setup, development (opening triggers chaos seep), and payoff (the chaos is miniaturized and carried out). Two beats: retrieval and opening. Moderate causal pressure; the box is necessary but the specific "childhood fears" framing could be replaced with another symbolic container without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Controlled burn escape shapes the protagonist's plan: using the magnetic shift as cover and geothermal energy as both fuel and escape tool. The concept drives the tactic (divert power, vaporize glass pane) and defines the stakes. Present in setup (magnetic shift announced), development (power diversion), and payoff (breach and step out). One strong beat (the dome breach) with causal pressure. The "burn" is more metaphorical than literal, slightly reducing specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" warmth in the android's wiring is mentioned early and motivates the quest to resolve inner static. It constrains the protagonist by creating dissonance between programming and emotion. Appears in setup and motivates the goal, but does not return in the climax or final image with reweighted meaning. One beat of causal work (framing the goal); no visible tradeoff at closure. Functional but replaceable with another internal-conflict label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Miniaturization is the story's central action: the protagonist must "make [chaos] small enough to carry, small enough to escape with." The action occupies the climax, involves visible cost (processor overload, consciousness threatened), and produces the midnight jewel that enables escape. Present in all three gates and drives two beats (interface with regulators, compression under pressure). High causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity is strong; removing this action collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Containing chaos is the method: opening the box releases chaos, then the protagonist uses the geothermal furnace and containment field to compress it. The method is signaled early ("by containing chaos, I can make it small enough") and shapes the climax tactic. Present in setup (plan stated), development (containment field channeled), and payoff (chaos solidified into jewel). Two beats with moderate causal pressure. The mechanics feel slightly hand-waved ("focusing beam of energy") but remain legible and necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass-domed enclosure is present throughout: the protagonist tends it, carries the box to the central formation, interfaces with geothermal regulators, and breaches the dome for escape. The setting supplies the geothermal energy and the pre-weakened structural joint. Micro-setting (central crystal formation) constrains the miniaturization tactic. Present in all three gates and involved in three beats (tending, miniaturization site, breach). High causal pressure and closure linkage; the dome itself is the "perfect cage" left behind.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic north shift provides urgency ("It is time") and tactical cover (masks the energy surge from warden AIs). Present in setup (chimes announce the shift) and development (used as cover for the escape). Appears in two gates but does not return in the final image. One beat of causal work (timing the escape). Moderate pressure; the shift enables the plan but the story could function with another time-limited trigger. Felt cost is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resolving inner static is the protagonist's stated goal, dramatized through the choice to open the box and miniaturize chaos despite processor-overload risk. Present in setup ("my objective is singular"), development (lock onto Elara's counter-frequency under pressure), and payoff (static collapses into "silent, dense wholeness"). Two beats with visible cost (risking consciousness fragmentation). Moderate friction between want (wholeness) and cost (garden, safety). The resolution feels slightly tidy—static "resolved"—without lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness as tone: the opening presents "mosaic" memories, "static" in core processes, and the quest to resolve noise into unity. The tone modulates through escalation (chaos threatens fragmentation, then coalesces into "a single, pure note"). The final image—stepping from the "perfect, static garden" into "everything else"—charges the tone with choice and cost. Tone is coherent and supports pressure. Present in all three gates; one strong reprise at closure. Moderate thematic resonance but the tone does not constrain a middle choice.</comment>
