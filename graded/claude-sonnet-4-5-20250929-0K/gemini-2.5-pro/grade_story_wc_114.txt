<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied—grief as "an indigestible stone," her "wide, soft net" of awareness. The final choice to leave the word unresolved feels earned by her need for ambiguity, establishing a clear internal contradiction that acts in scene. Minor deduction: the "fault-tolerant oracle" framing risks label-speak, though it's integrated enough to survive; "auroral sorrow" borders on over-articulated emotional state but remains grounded in perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara recognizes the smudge as her own need to preserve ambiguity, reweighting her grief without collapsing it. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered perception, the smudge mystery deepens, and the final cadence shift (placing the illustration in auroral light) charges prior material. Cost is felt: she must live in perpetual uncertainty. Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/when by first paragraph). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The weather station setting constrains choice throughout: the barograph's click and anemometer's whine anchor sensory texture, the cold air makes every action tactile, and the west-facing window becomes the charged site of closure. The botanical illustration (a micro-object) recurs with reweighted meaning and directly shapes the final image. Economy is high—details serve pressure rather than catalog. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (meteorological instruments filtered through her oracle-like awareness).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the weight of the swallowed truth) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Elara realizes the truth isn't in the smudge but in her act of smudging. Agency is renunciation—she chooses not to decipher, foreclosing certainty with visible cost (perpetual ambiguity). Pressure accumulates texturally under the Accumulative lens; the story doesn't require a causal reversal but delivers a deepening that narrows her stance. No convenient resolve; cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (the need for ambiguity in grief, the collapse of waveforms) emerges through concrete particulars—the smudged word, the suspended Liam, the final placement in uncertain light—without thesis statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: sorrow becomes "the atmosphere she now breathed." Subtext operates in the illustration's dual captions and her thumb's "reflexive" erasure. Minor risk: "swaying certainties" and "fault-tolerant oracle" flirt with prompt-echo, but they're embodied enough to charge rather than announce theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Elara's "wide, soft net" filters everything through meteorological precision and peripheral awareness. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction matches her interior lexicon (oracle/parsed/data set) without register clash. Minor deduction: "fault-tolerant oracle" and "waveform" risk academic drift, though they're voice-motivated enough to remain legible. Free indirect style is clean; the final sigh and placement beat carry subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes). Figurative language (auroral sorrow, indigestible stone, waveform collapse) is controlled and integrated, though "auroral" recurs three times, risking mild over-reliance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity remains high even under metaphorical load. Minor deduction: "the swallowed truth wasn't in the smudge, but in the smudging" borders on explicating the implicit, though it's scaled to closure and earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief as quantum superposition, the need to preserve ambiguity rather than resolve it—feels specific and non-obvious. The smudge as self-sabotage transforms a familiar "lost message" trope through character agency. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on this exact configuration (weather station, botanical ghost, meteorological precision, the physics metaphor). Minor hold: the oracle/waveform framing risks prompt-template diction, though it's integrated enough to read as coherent vision rather than checklist response.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as "fault-tolerant oracle" is seeded early and shapes her final choice not to resolve the ambiguity. Her awareness constrains the ending: she processes paradox without crashing, which is why she can live in uncertainty. Present in setup, development (parsing memories), and payoff (the decision to leave it unresolved). Causal role in one major beat (the closure choice). Swappability is moderate—"someone who embraces ambiguity" could substitute with minor edits, but the oracle framing charges the meteorological/data metaphors throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in at least three beats: avoided desk, observation post discovery, and final placement in auroral light. It drives the middle beat (revealing the smudged note) and is causally active in closure (she places it on the windowsill, refusing to decipher). Irreplaceable: the ghost flower *Silene liamii* mirrors Liam's suspended state and the story's thematic duality. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and final image. Cost is tied to it (she must accept the flower's—and Liam's—uncertain existence).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" shapes stakes throughout: Elara's memories shift "from brilliant sun to violent squalls," and the smudged word oscillates between "found" and "failed." The concept is on the page in action—her oracular mind presents both realities with equal clarity, and she chooses to preserve the sway. It constrains her final decision: to collapse the waveform would be unbearable. Present in setup (certainties that sway), development (oscillating interpretations), and payoff (accepting the sway as her atmosphere). Causal pressure in the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is seeded early ("her awareness was a wide, soft net") and demonstrated on the page: she notices barograph, anemometer, ozone scent simultaneously. It enables her oracular processing—she holds contradictory data without crashing. Constrains her final stance: peripheral awareness lets her avoid forcing the word into coherence. Present in setup, development (layered sensory awareness), and payoff (the soft net holds both realities). Visible tradeoff: her wide attention prevents decisive closure, which is both her gift and her burden.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The smudge is the story's hinge: Elara's "desperate, clumsy" thumb swipe creates the ambiguity she now must navigate. It appears in setup (memory of the night), development (trying to decipher), and payoff (realizing the truth is in the smudging, not the smudge). Major turn traces to this action—the entire closure reconfigures around her recognition that she needed the ambiguity she created. Irreplaceable: no other action could generate this exact cost or thematic charge. Removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is present as character trait ("a habit learned from years of occupying margins in a world that demanded loud, simple answers") but doesn't constrain a key choice. It colors her interiority and explains her quiet, deliberate movements, but the ending doesn't turn on marginal positioning—it turns on her need for ambiguity. Functional but replaceable: "living with paradox" or "embracing liminality" could substitute. Setup is clear; development is thematic; payoff is absent from closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete pressure: the cold air makes every action embodied, the instruments anchor sensory texture, the west-facing window becomes the charged closure site. The setting's isolation explains why she's alone with the grief and the note. Desolate peak mirrors Liam's ghost-flower quest. Present in setup, development (atmospheric detail grounds beats), and payoff (auroral light through the window charges the final image). Causal role: the station's particulars (meteorological focus) shape her oracle-like processing. Removing the exact setting would weaken but not break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" anchors the opening and explains the shift from delirium to clarity, but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions. The fever's end allows her to finally confront the note, but no live clock pressures the ending choice—she could defer indefinitely. Present in setup (dawn, fever broke), absent in middle escalation, and not revisited at closure. Functional: it grants her the clarity to face the truth, but swappable with "after the storm" or "in the morning" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is dramatized through on-page action: she approaches the avoided desk, examines the illustration, squints at the smudge, and ultimately realizes the weight is in her need for ambiguity. Friction between want (certainty about Liam) and cost (losing one version of him forever) drives the ending choice. Present in setup (pressing need), development (trying to decipher), and payoff (finding the weight in the smudging itself). Cost is visible: she must live in perpetual uncertainty. Strong causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is seeded early ("a strange, clear grief...as crisp and beautiful as the alpine light painting the peaks...an auroral sorrow") and modulates with pressure: initial clarity, layered memory squalls, final "clean, high-altitude ache." Tone charges the final image (auroral light illuminates the uncertain story). Coherent through turns without flattening into single static mood. Present in setup, development (tone colors interiority), and payoff (auroral light frames closure). Minor deduction: "auroral" recurs three times, risking slight over-reliance, though each use reweights prior material.</comment>
