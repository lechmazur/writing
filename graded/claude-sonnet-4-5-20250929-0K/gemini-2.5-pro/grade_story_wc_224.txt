<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—"the thunder in her chest" recurs with earned physical weight, and her nightly phantom-world substitutions show internal conflict through enacted evasion rather than summary. The final choice to plant herbs and clear paths demonstrates embodied renunciation of escape with visible cost (forgoing the phantom worlds). Minor slip: the phrase "her buried talents unfurled not as a violent flood, but as the quiet opening of a flower in the dark" leans slightly toward stock metaphor at a key beat, though it recovers immediately with the mountain-as-breathing-entity specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara anchors herself to the present through the stone's tactile current, forecloses phantom escape with the visible cost of her nightly worlds, and plants herbs as an on-page act of committed inhabitation. The causal lens holds cleanly—each search beat narrows options (weeks of navigation, stone disappointment, feather memory trigger) until the final method constrains her choice. Orientation anchors (bookstore, mercury-glass seer) land early. Cost is legible: she loses the "kinder" phantom worlds and accepts the painful present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore supplies concrete micro-settings (cart of cartography, hollowed-out book chamber with grimy skylight, glass-domed aviary) that gate Elara's search and constrain her path. The stone and feather function as tactile anchors that enable the closure act—tracing texture becomes the method. The final image of herbs in teacups and cleared pathways charges the space with her new rootedness. Sensory hierarchy is controlled (scent of vellum vs. salt-sprayed docks) and filtered through her evasive attention until she chooses to "feel the mountain around her."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the shape of home as inhabitable concept—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: stone search, disappointment at inertness, feather-memory breakthrough, tactile method trial. The stone's failure deepens pressure ("disappointment felt like a physical weight"), forcing the feather discovery that narrows her options to a single vulnerable act. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses phantom escape and commits to soil-and-roots presence. One meaningful causal tightening (stone alone insufficient → feather texture unlocks method) suffices for this length under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—home as foundation rather than found place—emerges from particulars: the stone offers no decoded past but "anchored her to the present," and the final planting act answers the central question through image (herbs in teacups, cleared paths) without stating a moral. The thunder-to-rain motif charges the ending by reweighting prior pressure as release. Subtext operates in the feather's "whisper-light drag" cueing buried method, and the owl-aviary ascent functions as physical metaphor for reaching buried knowledge. No thematic echo; the protagonist never articulates the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature—she notices "mercury" fractures, phantom scents, and the mountain as breathing entity. Distance modulates purposefully: close during stone contact ("her hand trembled"), pulled back during the conceptual turn ("she understood now"). Diction remains character-bound (vellum, cartography, petrified wood) with one brief elevated phrase ("harrowing trick") that fits the seer archetype. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control tightens during the feather-trace beat, then opens for the rooting imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Density is high (stone search, feather memory, tactile method, planting act compressed efficiently), and the opening line anchors voice ("made a home of getting lost"). Sentence rhythm varies well across moves. Two small loop artifacts: "nightly" appears in close proximity (paragraph one and two) without reweighting, and "not as... but as" template recurs ("not a place... but a foundation," "not of words, but of connection"). These do not obscure causality but create mild template cadence. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tactile-feather method for reading a stone offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight (the "whisper-light drag" cue seeds it early). Transformation of the "lost object" trope: the stone's power is not decoded language but present-moment resonance, which subverts the expected revelation arc. The bookstore-as-mountain premise is developed through lived micro-settings (aviary, skylight chamber) rather than postcard description. Risk: quiet ending with planted herbs could feel small, but the cost (losing phantom worlds) and the thunder-to-rain closure image elevate it beyond safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices create all key turns: she pursues the stone for weeks (beats navigation), interprets disappointment and feather-memory (beats method discovery), and performs the tactile trace that anchors her (beats closure). Her final planting act is the on-page manifestation of her shift. Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stone appears in vision (paragraph three), discovery (paragraph four), disappointment test (paragraph five), and closure trace (paragraphs six–seven). Its inertness when first held deepens pressure, then its resonance via feather unlocks the method. Removing it collapses the search arc and the tactile-method closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are both strong; cost (her weeks of search, the vulnerability of the final act) ties to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Buried talents" is signaled early ("a talent she had long ago buried") and reappears at closure ("her buried talents unfurled"). The concept shapes her search motive and the feather-memory recovery enables the stone-reading method. However, the middle beats (stone search, aviary ascent) are less about talent constraint and more about object pursuit. It participates in closure but does not narrow tactical options during escalation as strongly as the stone or feather do.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is setup in paragraph one, mentioned as distraction during the search ("her nightly worlds grew more frantic"), and resolved at closure (she no longer travels to phantom ports; instead dreams of soil). The trait constrains her by offering escape that delays rootedness, and the visible cost at closure is forgoing those kinder worlds. Middle development is thinner—it's mentioned but does not actively gate a choice. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff) with cost ties it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Seed" drives the closure image: she plants herbs in teacups and clears pathways as the on-page act of laying foundation. The verb also operates metaphorically (she "began to seed this new reality") tied to the soil-and-roots dream. Removing "seed" would require replacing the entire ending gesture. Appears only at closure, but the specificity and causal necessity (it enacts her shift from searching to inhabiting) push it into the high 8s despite late first mention.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The feather is seeded via sensory memory ("whisper-light drag of a feather's edge," paragraph five), discovered in the aviary (paragraph five), and used as the tactile method to read the stone (paragraph six). Its texture enables the closure act—"she felt a current... through the feather's delicate structure, and into her soul." The mechanics matter: tracing via texture is the key she had buried. Two beats (discovery, use) plus closure linkage and irreplaceability (no other tool would provide that texture-based resonance).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bookstore supplies the search space (endless corridors, spiraling staircases, dead-end canyons), gates discovery (the stone is in a specific chamber), and provides the aviary resource. The mountain-as-breathing-entity insight at closure reweights the setting from maze to anchoring body. It pressures her weeks of navigation and the chamber's "high, grimy skylight" isolates the stone find. Setup, middle resource, and closure charge are all present; causal work is solid but the setting does not impose a single pivotal constraint during escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is stated in the opening and explains why she prefers phantom substitutions, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock pressure or deadline narrows her search. The phrase sets context (why she evades) but does not alter tactics during escalation. Setup is clear; middle and closure involvement are conceptual rather than mechanical. Lyric resonance (pain prompts evasion, closure accepts pain) lifts it into mid-5s, but no live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated early ("a quiet motivation," paragraph two) and dramatized through the stone search, feather method, and final planting. The desire conflicts with the comfort of phantom worlds (cost visible on the page: she loses them). Her nightly escapes and the thunder pressure embody the friction between want (rootedness) and fear (painful memory). The closure act (planting, clearing paths) fulfills the motive with visible renunciation. Setup, conflicted middle pressure, and closure fulfillment all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" is embodied as "a low, constant pressure in her chest" (paragraph two), "the thunder in her chest growing louder" (paragraph four), and "the thunder in her chest had finally broken, leaving behind the clean, hopeful scent of rain" (final paragraph). Tone modulates from suppressed pressure to release, charging the final image. The metaphor is consistent and accumulates across beats, then pays off by shifting to rain at closure. Coherent modulation and closure charge present; slightly conventional vehicle (storm-to-rain) keeps it mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>
