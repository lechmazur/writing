<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and abstract ("find the beginning in every ending"), embodied through her defiant choice to jury-rig the fragment despite prior failure. Internal contradiction is present—despair versus practical defiance—and the final choice feels earned by her mentor's lesson and on-page experimentation. However, interiority occasionally leans toward telling ("familiar despair began to settle") rather than full embodiment, and the mentor's wisdom arrives as a clean epiphany without messier friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara achieves the shard of hush, proving a new method works, with the cost visible in her risk and the tower "waiting" rather than abandoned. Causality is clean—each discarded assumption builds to the breakthrough. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening (the perigee zenith threatening system overload) narrows options and delivers the closure under a Causal lens with conceptual cost (she learned to "un-ask").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radio tower city over Black-Lip Gorge is vivid and specific, with "serenely electric" air and the Hollywood star fragment grounding micro-setting. The fragment's physical placement (cradle beside intake, not in-path) constrains her choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The tower "groaning" at perigee and the "crackling pressure" integrate environment into the climax without postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the shard of hush—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The perigee zenith creates one meaningful tightening: system overload threatens failure, forcing Elara's final dial adjustment under pressure. Agency is decision-driven (discarding assumptions, jury-rigging placement), and the cost is legible: risking her equipment and defying standard protocols with no fallback. No forced reversals; escalation is causal and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding beginnings in endings—emerges organically from Elara's quest and the fragment's dual nature (supernova death seeding new suns). The final image offers a non-literal answer: silence as "coiled spring of reality" reweights the abstract motivation with concrete sensory payoff. Minor slip: "deepest truths are often found…in the deliberate, resonant spaces in between" edges toward overt statement in the log entry, though it's framed as her reflection rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("serenely electric," "cosmic dust," "ghost-whispers"). Diction remains within Elara's technical-mystical lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decision beats, slightly wider for setting). Minor dip: "a constant, lonely note" and "swollen pearl" read slightly stock, and "un-ask the old question" as direct mentor echo feels convenient rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., fragment description conveys both physicality and thematic charge). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is strong through the technical sequence. Minor scaffold: "With a surge of defiant practicality, she decided on a new method" tells the shift rather than enacting it, and "The city of towers was silent around her, but for the first time, it didn't feel abandoned. It felt like it was waiting" pairs two telling beats that could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—signal interpreter seeking structured silence during lunar perigee—offers a fresh synthesis of technical and mystical. The solution (fragment as tuning fork, inverting gain to hunt null-points) is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in voice and concept elevates. Minor derivative note: "find the beginning in every ending" and the mentor's "un-ask the old question" echo familiar narrative templates without full transformation, and the "abandoned place that's really waiting" closure image is a known trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celestial signal interpreter drives all key turns: her despair-to-defiance pivot, the three discarded assumptions, and the final dial adjustment. Present from the opening, shapes middle experimentation, and closure hinges on her interpretive breakthrough. Specific decisions (jury-rigging, inverting gain) alter tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hollywood star fragment appears in setup (velvet case), middle (cradle placement beside intake, not in-path), and closure (its hum matched at zenith). Handles it physically twice, returns with reweighted meaning (from "too loud" to resonant key). Essential across beats; removing it breaks the solution's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shard of hush is the dominant stake from paragraph two, motivates all choices, and delivers closure when she achieves it. The concept's mechanics (structured silence, null-point) shape her tactics. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Slight friction: it's more quest-object than active constraint until the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" air anchors opening atmosphere and returns as "tangible, crackling pressure" at perigee zenith, charging the climax. Lyric reprise reweights the setting's charge. However, it doesn't constrain a choice—it colors perception without altering tactics. Present in first and final thirds but not middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tune" drives the climax: opening every channel, tuning to fragment's frequency, and the final dial adjustment to match its hum. Action is irreplaceable—the story's mechanics hinge on resonant tuning, not amplification. Present across setup (standard filtration fails), middle (jury-rig cradle), and closure (last dial).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is signaled early (mentor's lesson), structures all middle beats (three named assumptions: fragment as amplifier, filter in-path, silence as absence), and delivers closure when the method succeeds. Mechanics matter on the page; the method isn't swappable. Causal pressure and cost are tied to each discarded rule.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Abandoned radio tower city over Black-Lip Gorge is present from opening, supplies the fragment and console as resources, and "waiting" conclusion reweights the setting's meaning. The tower groans at perigee, adding environmental pressure. However, the gorge and suspension cables are description without choice-constraint; the tower's height enables isolation but doesn't alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is the live clock: signaled as "tonight," amplifies incoming noise to force the crisis, reaches zenith during the climax ("perigee reached its zenith"), and times the breakthrough. Tightens decisions—only this window offers the energy and urgency. Removal would eliminate the escalation trigger and closure timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated early, drives her choice to risk the fragment (supernova death → new suns logic), and the shard of hush delivers it (exhale/inhale gap). Motivation is abstract but dramatized through her defiant persistence and final realization. Friction: want versus cost isn't deeply conflicted—she pursues with determination, not torn tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" (my inference: mystical stakes met with technical problem-solving) is coherent throughout—cosmic quest solved by jury-rigging, inverting gain, and tuning. Tone modulates: serene opening, desperate middle, charged climax, resonant quiet close. The blend of "serenely electric" air and console mechanics charges the final image without tonal break.</comment>
