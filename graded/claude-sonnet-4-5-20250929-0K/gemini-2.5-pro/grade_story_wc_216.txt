<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is consistently textured through his obsession with the urn fragment and his tactile engagement with objects. The motivation is embodied in concrete actions—holding the fragment for hours, devising the garage sale—though the final "feeling" of the memory relies heavily on telling rather than micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (his borrowed time versus the fragment's timelessness) but the closure renunciation ("gnawing sense... had vanished") reads as too cleanly resolved without visible cost or a dramatized final choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through escalating loneliness, the garage sale experiment, and the arrival of the traveler's message. Orientation is anchored early (emerald silo, post-Collapse world, damaged time capsule). Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when Kael presses the fragment to the wall and receives the memory; the final image reconfigures his relationship to time from "borrowed" to "suddenly timeless." However, the cost is largely told ("gnawing sense... had vanished") rather than enacted through a visible forfeiture or renunciation that narrows future options, and the silo's resonator function arrives late without prior setup, creating a minor causality slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly specific and recurs across beats: it hums, glows, resonates, and ultimately functions as a memory storage device. The urn fragment is handled repeatedly and its willow branch detail charges the traveler's message and the final act. Sensory details are filtered through Kael's obsessive POV (the "metallic wound," the "translucent" panel). The silo constrains choice by containing the time capsule and enables the closure when the fragment activates the wall panel, meeting the 9+ gate for setting as constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and escalates through the garage sale experiment and the arrival of the cryptic message. One meaningful tightening occurs when the traveler's response ("ghost is the warmth of a willow tree") reweights the urn fragment's significance and drives Kael's final action. However, the choice to press the fragment to the wall is more discovery than decision under pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the urn fragment, the garage sale poetry, and the final memory resonance: time as texture, the past as anchor, and connection across collapse. The garage sale descriptions carry subtext ("heavy with the memory of forgotten feasts") and the final image—Kael standing with the fragment still warm, newly serene—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise (borrowed time → timeless) through the specific afternoon memory. Minor deduction: the phrase "suddenly timeless" risks abstraction, and "a thousand other anticipated mysteries" in the final line edges toward thematic declaration rather than image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled metaphoric density ("metallic wound spilling its secrets," "great, silent ocean of the present"). POV remains stable in third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Kael's tactile and visual focus on fragments and light). The garage sale descriptions demonstrate voice range and subtext. Register stays consistent except for one slip: "the sensation flooded Kael, not a sight or a sound, but a feeling—the 'texture' he had so longed to understand" uses distancing meta-commentary that slightly flattens the climax. Dialogue is absent; no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically strong ("thinning of the light within his own bones," "fishing in the great, silent ocean"). Information density is high; most lines serve character, world, or pressure. However, the final beat suffers from filter stacks and tell-heavy summary: "He felt the sun... the gentle weight... profound, quiet contentment" lists sensations rather than enacting them, and "The gnawing sense of his own borrowed time had vanished, replaced by the serene echo" explicitly narrates the emotional shift rather than letting the image carry it. Minor paraphrase loop: "suddenly timeless" appears as both attribute and closure state without functional variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—post-numerical-collapse timekeeper fishing for memory through poetic garage sale descriptions—is fresh and specific. The combination of time capsule, cremation urn fragment, and resonator silo feels organic rather than checklist-driven. The willow-branch detail and the traveler's cryptic reply create an earned hinge. However, the silo's sudden revelation as a memory-storage device ("pressed the cremation urn fragment against a wall panel that had always seemed slightly different") introduces a convenience late; the "always seemed" flag reads as retroactive setup, reducing inevitability and lowering originality slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael ("borrowed-time timekeeper") frames the story and drives the garage sale experiment and the final act. His choices—devising the trading post, holding the fragment, pressing it to the wall—create key beats. However, the climactic action (pressing the fragment) feels more like discovery than a high-cost decision under competing pressures; agency is present but the turn is less renunciation than revelation. Present across setup, middle, and closure; causal role in two beats (garage sale, final activation); closure linkage solid. Swappability moderate: another obsessive archivist could serve similar function with minor edits. Cap at mid-5s for replaceable protagonist role, lift to 5.8 for closure participation and two-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears early, is handled repeatedly (Kael holds it for hours, clutches it, presses it to the wall), and its willow-branch detail seeds the traveler's message and activates the silo's memory. Present in setup, middle (garage sale context), and closure (the pressing action and "still warm in his palm"). Beats: initial obsession, implicit in garage sale motivation, traveler's message linkage, closure action. Causal pressure: the fragment's painted willow is the key that unlocks the silo. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high: the willow branch is irreplaceable. Cost tied to element: the memory accessed through the fragment resolves Kael's quest. All three gates met; strong causal and closure work; specific and irreplaceable. Score 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is present from early setup ("at the silo's heart") and motivates Kael's obsession; the urn fragment it contains drives all subsequent action. It shapes the dominant stake (understanding time) and supplies the key artifact. However, the capsule itself is largely static description after the opening; the fragment does the active work. The capsule's role is more origin than constraint. Beats: setup (described), implicit throughout as source of fragment. Causal work: indirect (houses the fragment). Closure: not directly present, but the fragment it provided is central. Two gates (setup, payoff via fragment); causal role indirect. Cap ~6.0 for indirect work; lift to 6.7 for strong thematic framing and early seed that makes closure possible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is the closure state Kael achieves after accessing the memory; it appears in the final paragraph and reframes his earlier "borrowed time." However, it functions as thematic label rather than a trait that constrains action. It's told ("he had become suddenly timeless") without visible cost or trade-off enacted on the page prior to that declaration. Present only at closure (missing setup and middle gates); no beats where timelessness alters tactics. Swappability high: "serene," "complete," or "whole" could replace with minor edits. Cap at 4.6 for late intro; apply −0.4 for ornamental, label-only use. Score 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the verb framing Kael's quest ("trying to rediscover the life" in the urn, "rediscover the old ways of thinking") and the garage sale is explicitly a method to "find anyone else who remembered." The traveler's message enables rediscovery of the memory stored in the silo. Present in setup (stated motivation), middle (garage sale as means), and closure (memory accessed). Beats: initial obsession, garage sale design, message receipt, silo activation. Causal: the quest to rediscover drives the garage sale and the final act. Closure: the memory rediscovered is the payoff. Specificity moderate: "recover," "retrieve," or "find" could substitute. All three gates met; two beats; closure linkage solid; moderate swappability. Score 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale descriptions is signaled clearly in the middle third, demonstrated through two quoted examples ("Cast-iron skillet," "tarnished silver locket"), and directly enables the traveler's response that triggers closure. The method is Kael's deliberate tactic and its poetic indirection is essential to attracting the right respondent. Beats: explanation and examples (middle), traveler's reply (turn). Causal pressure: without the embedded messages, no reply and no closure. Closure linkage strong (the willow reply comes via this method). Setup late (second third); apply −0.3 for late intro. All three functions present (middle intro, demonstrated, payoff); causal and closure work strong; irreplaceable. Score 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is present throughout: home, workshop, beacon, resonator. It hums, glows, houses the time capsule, and ultimately functions as memory storage when the fragment activates the translucent wall panel. Setting constrains (the capsule is "at the silo's heart," the garage sale is "at the silo's base") and enables (the silo's resonator function is the mechanism of closure). Beats: opening anchor, capsule location, garage sale base, wall panel activation. Causal: the silo's structure and function are essential to closure. Closure linkage very strong (the silo's hum deepens, light swirls, memory floods). Specificity high: the emerald color, the hum, the translucent panel are all irreplaceable details. All three gates met; strong causal and closure role; high specificity. Score 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers change meaning" is established early ("seven ceased to be more than six") and provides world-building context for Kael's inability to measure time conventionally, motivating his search for "texture" instead. However, it functions primarily as thematic backdrop; the post-numerical state does not constrain a specific on-page choice or tactic. It colors the quest but does not pressure decisions. Beats: setup (described), implicit throughout. Causal work: indirect (motivates the quest for texture). Closure: not directly present. Two gates (setup, thematic presence); no direct beat where the broken-number state alters a tactic. Swappability moderate. Score 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated early, embodied in his hours holding the fragment, and drives the garage sale experiment. The contradiction between his borrowed time and the fragment's timelessness creates friction. The final memory delivers the texture he sought, and the closure explicitly addresses this want ("the 'texture' he had so longed to understand"). Beats: opening obsession, garage sale design, closure fulfillment. Causal: the motivation shapes all tactics. Closure linkage very strong. Friction present (borrowed vs. timeless). Cost: his gnawing sense of borrowed time vanishes, though this is more resolution than visible sacrifice. All three gates met; strong causal and closure work; friction present; cost somewhat told. Score 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is coherent throughout: the opening's lonely melancholy, the poetic garage sale descriptions, the quiet receipt of the traveler's message, and the final line's bloom of "a thousand other anticipated mysteries." Tone modulates with pressure (urgency when the message arrives, awe at the memory) and charges the final image (the library of lost feelings waiting). However, "anticipated" as descriptor is somewhat abstract and the final phrase ("anticipated mysteries now bloomed") borders on direct thematic statement rather than tonal embodiment. Present across all three sections; coherent and modulating; final image charged. Swappability moderate. Score 6.4.</comment>
