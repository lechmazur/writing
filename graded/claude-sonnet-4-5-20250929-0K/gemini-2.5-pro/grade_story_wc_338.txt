<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her methodical curiosity drives her from the torn map to the archives and finally to annotation. The trait "shielded openness" operates as both descriptor and constraint, filtering her perceptions and choices. Her decision at closure to annotate rather than repair feels earned by the prior discovery sequence. However, interiority occasionally edges toward elevated register ("empathetic rush that breached her careful shields") that reads slightly outside the working conservator's lexicon under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp: who (map framer), where (workshop), what (torn map of northern isles) anchored by the second paragraph. The causal lens holds: Elara's research leads to the archives, the footage comparison reveals the lichen disruption, which reinterprets the map tear as deliberate threshold. The closure—annotating "threshold found"—lands with conceptual cost (acknowledgment of the unknown) and reconfigures the tear from damage to intentional marker. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lichen line is discovered, narrowing options from restoration to preservation of mystery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop sensory anchors (dehumidifiers, archival glue, old paper) and the projected films provide strong micro-setting. The lichen-covered capstone functions as both object and constraint, its growth pattern enabling the discovery. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The "rain-scoured fresco vault" description, while evocative, arrives late and does little to constrain Elara's choices; it is observed in footage rather than navigated, so the vault itself remains at a remove.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—interpreting the silence of the torn map—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the 1958 and 1993 footage comparison reveals the subtle lichen disruption, forcing Elara to choose between restoration and acknowledgment. The final annotation forecloses the path of repair, a visible on-page cost that reweights her framing task. No antagonist is needed; the mystery itself generates escalation. One tightening point is sufficient at this length and fits the accumulative/causal hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the map tear, the lichen seal, and the final annotation: some silences preserve knowledge by remaining closed. The fresco vault's lichen functions as a charged image that returns with reweighted meaning—camouflage as intentional barrier. The ending avoids moralizing; "threshold found" is understated yet resonant, answering the central question (what did the mapmaker intend?) through concrete discovery rather than assertion. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—focused but receptive, attuned to fragile histories—colors the narration throughout. Distance is stable, and the final moments shift psychic distance purposefully as she moves from discovery to annotation. Minor register drift appears in elevated phrasing ("empathetic rush that breached her careful shields," "the silence screamed") that sits slightly above a working conservator's internal voice under stress, though it does not break the frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence rhythms. Some overwriting clusters appear: "Her shielded openness, a trait honed by years" front-loads descriptor rather than showing through choice; "the silence of the films screamed at her" is a stock oxymoron. The phrase "whispered chapel" appears as metaphor in the penultimate paragraph but was never earned in scene—it is asserted, not discovered. Information density is strong in the footage-comparison beat. No paraphrase loops, but figurative language in adjacent lines ("a tremor of connection, an empathetic rush") dilutes immediacy in the discovery moment. Apply −0.5 for the overwriting cluster and −0.3 for the unearned chapel metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—map conservation meets forensic video archaeology—feels fresh and well-specified. The lichen disruption as evidence of human intervention is a non-obvious hinge that grows from prior particulars. The whispered-chapel concept, while evocative, is somewhat imported; it is not discovered through scene work but asserted in narration. The emotional territory (interpreting silence with empathy) is familiar, yet the execution through silent footage and botanical evidence lends specificity. No template plot or close echo of famous lines; the piece commits to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's perception drives the key discovery (lichen line) and her final annotation choice. She appears in all three gates: setup (framing the map), middle (comparing footage), and closure (annotating the tear). Her methodical curiosity constrains tactics (archives over fieldwork) and shapes the ending. However, her choices largely follow a single investigative track without visible alternative paths or trade-offs that would raise irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The henge appears in setup (research leads to it), development (the vault's lichen is studied in footage), and closure (its sealed chamber informs the final annotation). It shapes the discovery but is not handled on the page—Elara observes it mediated through film, which reduces tactile presence. The element is functional but not indispensable; another sealed monument with observable change could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "whispered chapel" phrase appears only in the penultimate paragraph as metaphor for the sealed henge chamber. It is not signaled early, does not constrain tactics, and arrives as a label rather than a discovered concept. While it thematically resonates with silence and preservation, it is ornamental rather than causal. Missing setup and development gates cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Methodical curiosity is dramatized: it sends Elara to the archives (not the henge itself), structures her hours-long footage comparison, and results in annotation rather than repair. The trait enables her approach and constrains the timeline (patient observation). Present in all three gates with visible cost (time, foregone fieldwork), but the trait could be replaced by "detail-oriented researcher" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reopen" structures the entire arc: Elara's goal is to reopen the conversation the map started, achieved by comparing footage and concluding with the annotation that reopens mystery rather than closing it through repair. The action is signaled early, drives the middle discovery, and lands at closure as both literal (she does not seal the tear) and metaphoric fulfillment. The element shows causal pressure and closure linkage, with specificity tied to conservator ethics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the plan ("compare this silent video footage from decades apart"), executed in the central beat (side-by-side projection, lichen comparison), and delivers the key discovery (the disrupted growth line). The mechanics matter: the 1958 vs. 1993 contrast is the hinge that reveals human intervention. The method constrains tactics (requires archival access, hours of viewing) and is causally indispensable to the closure annotation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vault appears in both films as the location of the lichen discovery, and the rain-scoured detail is noted. However, it is described rather than navigated; Elara never enters it, so it does not supply resources or constrain her physical choices. It functions as backdrop for the discovery rather than active pressure. Present in middle and closure but only as observed object, not as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The torn map and its coastline rip frame the inquiry from the opening and return in the closure annotation. The "spot where a map tears" is metaphoric (known/unknown boundary) and literal (the physical damage). It shapes the dominant stake and charges the final image when Elara reinterprets the tear as threshold. However, it functions more as symbolic anchor than live temporal pressure; no ticking clock tightens decisions, so it trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "interpret silence with empathy" is stated early and governs her approach: she seeks to understand the mapmaker's intent rather than impose repair. The motivation drives her to archives, shapes her patient viewing, and informs the closure choice (annotation that honors mystery). Present in all three gates with thematic cost (she must accept not-knowing). However, the motivation is more declared than conflicted; no friction between competing wants appears on the page, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is introduced as trait in paragraph two and colors Elara's focalization throughout: receptive yet controlled, allowing connection without dissolution. The tone modulates subtly from focused observation to the "tremor of connection" at discovery, then steadies again for the annotation. It charges the final image (careful annotation rather than invasive repair) and coheres through turns. However, the phrase itself is somewhat abstract and could be clearer as embodied stance; it reads more as descriptor than active pressure.</comment>
