<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is coherent and his final choice to plant the seed feels earned by the arc. However, the initial wilting fern is purely observational and doesn't force a trade-off; his discovery of the map happens by accident rather than through an active pursuit. The weeks of reconstruction work are summarized rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. Embodied emotion is present in the trembling hand and the "breathtaking rush," but overall interiority leans toward narrated summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: map discovery → reconstruction → vault journey → seed choice. The closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (planting the seed) that forecloses his prior role as passive observer, and the final image carries conceptual cost (commitment to cultivate truth). The orientation is clean, establishing who/where/when early. One weakness: the weeks of map reconstruction compress causality into summary ("Days turned into weeks"), and the vault door's sudden appearance risks feeling convenient rather than fully earned by prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and vault arboretum are vivid and purposeful. The Silver-Vein fern constrains the opening observation, and the zinc postal plate is handled twice (taped fragment, then key insertion). However, the middle passage (maintenance shafts, conduits) provides postcard movement without spatial friction that alters Elian's choices. The final arboretum setting charges the closure image effectively, reweighting the fern's earlier presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens once when Elian realizes the seeds require sincerity as substrate. The vault discovery meaningfully narrows options: he shifts from passive calligrapher to active cultivator. However, no live opposition or trade-off complicates his descent; the door opens perfectly, and no cost is dramatized during the reconstruction weeks. The final planting carries clear agency and visible commitment, but the escalation path lacks a second reversal or friction point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fern, the map, and the seed arboretum: truth as cultivated substrate rather than lost archive. The final image (planting the Veritas seed) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One slip: "an oasis of honesty" in the penultimate sentence edges toward abstraction and states the theme rather than letting the seed image carry it alone. The phrase "a million tiny, truthful conversations were just beginning to sprout" risks sentimentality but retains some earned charge from the prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: calligrapher's precision, obsession with "candor in small moments," and attention to texture. The prose modulates well under pressure ("strange hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush"). Minor slip: "He understood everything in a sudden, breathtaking rush" tells the epiphany rather than enacting it through specific realization beats. Diction stays consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and clarity remains strong throughout. No paraphrase loops, scaffold, or template cadence detected. The figurative language ("sweet poison," "hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush") is slightly elevated but controlled and voice-consistent. One small weakness: "the gesture lost in the clamor" uses passive construction where active might sharpen. The final line ("as if a million tiny, truthful conversations were just beginning to sprout") risks softness but remains legible and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—truth-detecting plants in a post-apocalyptic greenhouse city—synthesizes familiar dystopian and botanical elements with a fresh angle: the "silent repository" not as archive but as seed bank. The postal plate as key and the Veritas Bloom requiring sincerity are specific and non-obvious. However, the arc follows a conventional treasure-hunt structure (find map, solve puzzle, open vault, gain power), and the weeks of reconstruction are summarized rather than dramatized with fresh complications. The final image of planting the seed offers a clear transformation but remains slightly within the expected moral template of "restore lost truth."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and makes the final planting choice. However, the map discovery is accidental (not his decision), and the weeks of reconstruction are summarized without on-page tactical shifts. The vault door opens perfectly without requiring him to solve a problem. His final planting is a clear decision that alters his role, but only one key turn traces directly to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zinc postal plate fragment appears in two distinct beats: taped to the map (discovery, tactile description) and inserted into the vault door (key use). It enables the climactic opening and carries thematic weight (honest communication system). However, it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; after unlocking the door, it disappears from the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Candor is present as theme and motive (fern wilts near dishonesty, Elian's yearning for "authenticity of the past"), but it does not constrain or enable a tactical choice on the page. The Veritas Bloom requires sincerity as substrate, but this is revealed exposition rather than dramatized pressure. The concept shapes the ending image but does not alter Elian's options or tactics during the journey.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The fern wilts once in the opening beat when the customer praises a competitor dishonestly. This observation frames Elian's world but does not force a choice or trade-off. The fern does not return to constrain later action or appear at closure. Its role is label-only setup for the Veritas seeds rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rereading is signaled early ("He had to reread certain fragments dozens of times") and drives the middle reconstruction work. The phrase "convergence of echoes" seizes Elian and feeds his obsession, shaping his motivation and the map's decipherment. The final placard rereading ("Elian reread the placard one last time") charges his decision to plant the seed. This action appears in three distinct beats and meaningfully shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shredded map is discovered under the floorboard in the opening third and drives the middle beats (reconstruction, decipherment, navigation). Its fragmented state justifies the calligrapher's skill and the weeks of work. However, the mechanics of piecing it together are summarized rather than dramatized; no on-page moment shows a tactical choice shaped by the shredding. The method is functional but could be replaced by "a faded intact map" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky frame the world and pressure context (artificial humidity, manufactured soil, recycled air). The vault's cool, clean air contrasts meaningfully. However, the setting does not constrain Elian's choices or tactics; he moves through it without friction or resource scarcity. The central plaza planter at closure is purposeful but brief. The setting enriches atmosphere more than it alters action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "after the oasis dried" anchors backstory and context. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The weeks of map reconstruction pass in summary without a live clock or deadline. No temporal pressure forces Elian's hand during the descent or planting. The timeframe is functional context but does not shape the dramatic arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elian's desire "to find where lost conversations go" is signaled early, drives his map obsession, and is fulfilled at closure when he realizes the seeds are the answer. The motivation is dramatized through his reconstruction work and his final planting choice. One friction: the motivation is more contemplative quest than conflicted want-versus-cost dilemma, which slightly lowers the score within the high band.</comment>
