<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian's guilt-driven motivation is established early and embodied through his ritual tattooing, with the amber piece serving as a concrete anchor. The recognition of his own handwriting and the final sequence show agency under pressure, though the transition from "another life" memory to present action relies on convenient recovered knowledge. The choice to etch the constellation and place the amber carries visible cost in that he finally confronts rather than flees the hum. Internal contradiction appears when he both cannot outrun the memory yet somehow forgot writing the letters, creating mild motivation friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Causal lens: letters → Laboratory → firmware encounter → etching ritual → silence. Orientation anchors (tattooist, studio, bruised sky) land within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hum ceases, the voice rests) with visible cost: he externalizes the scar by hanging the leather Lyra on the wall, a memorial that forecloses his prior evasion. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frantic text shifts to calm, driven by Elian's etching action, which narrows his emotional options and ends the loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The studio lamp, amber, and the Laboratory's cold servers provide tactile grounding. The amber constrains the closure choice: its sharp edge becomes the etching tool, and its smooth surface contrasts the cold machine, charging the final image when he places it as a "golden tombstone." Spatial choreography remains clear across the studio and Laboratory. The "city's old broadcasting district" and "concrete monolith" are slightly generic but functional; the micro-setting (amber, metal panel, server casing) drives the climactic action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the guilt-driven hum—is signaled in paragraph one and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian sees the translated cries and recognizes Lyra's voice, forcing him to act rather than flee. The etching sequence narrows his options: he must complete the constellation to silence the loop, and the final word "Papa" pays off the emotional cost. Agency is clear: his knowledge and the amber enable the solution, though the firmware's convenient vulnerability (etching circuits solves a digital ghost) leans toward soft coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of guilt as a sonic dissonance that must be tethered to closure emerges through the constellation mapping, the amber's frozen journey, and Lyra's looped distress. The story resists easy moral: Elian's peace comes not from forgiveness but from ritual connection, externalizing the scar rather than hiding it. The final image—leather Lyra on the wall—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to carry unbearable memory. "Meteor hush" recurs with purposeful cadence shifts, and the firmware's progression from fear to curiosity to calm mirrors Elian's arc without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; perceptual signature is consistent (stars as pathways, circuits as star-charts). Diction stays within his idiom: "whisper against skin," "sonic ghosts," "tether this echo." The firmware's translated text (*Cold. Scared. Where is Papa?*) introduces a second voice that functions as Lyra's ghost rather than breaking focalization. Brief elevated phrasing ("profound quiet that follows a cataclysm," "sonic ghosts") fits the lyric register but nudges toward the ornate in a few beats without crossing into muddle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("Elian traced the stars of Lyra onto a client's shoulder, his needle a whisper against skin") anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor template cadence appears in the middle section: "He had to hush it. He had to give the sound a place to rest. He had to tether this echo..." reads as deliberate parallelism but borders on scaffold. Two paraphrase loops: "a map away from a memory" / "outrun" and "the dissonance of old guilt" / "source of his hum" restate without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or grave artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The constellation-tattooist-as-ghost-cartographer synthesis is specific and the amber-as-etching-tool payoff feels earned in hindsight. The firmware translating baby cries is a fresh, eerie detail. However, the "haunted technology meets grieving parent" frame is a recognizable template, and the moral calculus (ritual connection grants peace) is familiar. The story transforms the template through Elian's particular profession and the amber's dual function, but the core arc of confronting-via-ritual-then-finding-peace does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's choices create all key turns: he purchases the desk, deciphers the letters, seeks the Laboratory, and performs the etching ritual that silences the firmware. The tattooing frames expectation early, and his profession enables the constellation etching at closure. His agency is causal and essential across setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber appears in paragraph one (frozen gnat, halted journey), is carried to the Laboratory, and its sharp edge becomes the etching tool in the climax. It returns as the "golden tombstone" placed on the silent machine. The object's dual properties—smooth ancient surface vs. sharp edge, and the frozen insect as metaphor—constrain the final action and charge the ending image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced at the Laboratory and directly shapes the middle turn: it translates Lyra's cries, making the dissonance legible and forcing Elian's etching choice. The technician's explanation ("ghost in their archival code") anchors the concept, and the firmware's progression (frantic → calm → silent) drives the ending. However, the concept arrives late (past the 40% mark) and the resolution—etching circuits silences a digital ghost—is more thematic resonance than mechanical causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attribute (translates baby cries) is demonstrated on the page via the scrolling text and enables Elian to recognize Lyra's voice, which drives his decision to act. The specificity (not just "haunted audio" but "baby cries" with cadence and meaning) constrains the emotional stakes and the etching solution. It appears in setup (the technician explains it), drives the middle recognition beat, and the final word "Papa" pays off the translation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tethering is signaled early ("he had to tether this echo to its ending") and the etching ritual is the physical enactment: connecting circuits in a constellation pattern to give the voice a "map home." The action is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the closure. It drives the firmware's shift from fear to calm and the final silence, and the leather Lyra on the wall is the tether externalized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The letters are found in the locked drawer, penned in Elian's own script "from another life," and they supply Lyra's name, the fever, the promise, and the Laboratory location. They enable the middle turn (finding the archive) and the etching solution (birthdate and lullaby knowledge). However, the "another life" framing and convenient recovered memory blur causality slightly, and the letters do not reappear after their initial function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Laboratory is introduced as "the city's old broadcasting district, a concrete monolith where time folds in on itself," housing the servers and the haunted terminal. It provides the firmware, the technician's explanation, and the physical server casing Elian etches. The cold sterile air and rows of sleeping servers create pressure and contrast with the studio's warmth. The setting enables the climactic action and the final silence, though the "broadcasting district" detail is functional rather than deeply specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "where time folds in on itself, letting the past leak through the cracks in the present" is stated once as atmosphere at the Laboratory but does not constrain Elian's choices or create a live clock. The past (Lyra's death, the letters) informs motivation, but no folding or temporal pressure alters tactics on the page. The phrase functions as metaphor rather than mechanical story element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—to silence the "low-frequency hum, a dissonance only he could hear"—is embodied in the opening paragraph and drives every choice: the ritual tattooing as evasion, the desk purchase seeking stillness, the letter discovery, the Laboratory visit, and the etching ritual. The motivation is dramatized through his visceral recognition of Lyra's cadence and the friction between his prior flight and the final confrontation. The hum's cessation at closure makes the cost legible and forecloses his evasion path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early ("the state he understood best: meteor hush, the profound quiet that follows a cataclysm") and recurs at closure ("the true meteor hush of a soul come to rest"). The tone—hushed, elegiac, tactile—remains coherent through the studio, letters, and Laboratory beats, modulating from low-frequency hum to silence. The final stillness charges the ending image and reweights the opening's evasion into peace. The tone is integral to the thematic arc and the final repricing of guilt as memorial.</comment>
