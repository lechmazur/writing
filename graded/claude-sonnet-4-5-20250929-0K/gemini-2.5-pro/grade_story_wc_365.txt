<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his interiority is grounded in sensory particulars—the shard, the scent of chai tea, the chill of concrete. His final choice to redirect the cascade rather than attempt rescue shows internal contradiction working in scene: the impulse to save versus the acceptance of finality. The renunciation is earned and forecloses the haunting with visible cost. Minor slip: the parents' "tension in their grief" is told rather than dramatized, reducing the weight of the withheld truth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Kael redirects the energy, accepts his sister's loss, and marks the site as finalized. The cost is legible—he loses the hope of rescue and gains only understanding. The piece teaches a Causal lens early (the shard enables sight, the resonance cascade caused Elara's death) and holds it through the redirect action. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy peaks and Kael must act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay supplies concrete sensory anchors—stained concrete, cold ozone, fractured gantry—and the green shard functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's access to the parallel visions. The cyclical hum and structural sound are filtered through his sensory-map expertise. The shard's coldness against his skin charges the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear; the bay evolves from haunted to finalized in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the truth about Elara's death—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when Kael sees the console warnings and realizes the resonance cascade origin. The escalation is causal: the energy is about to peak again, forcing immediate action. His redirect choice narrows options (he cannot save her, only prevent recurrence) with visible cost—the visions collapse, leaving only "quiet, dusty dark." The price is felt and the action is protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the nature of loss, the burden of withheld truth, and the limits of knowledge across realities. The green shard and the sensory map anchor the question without stating it. The ending offers a resonant answer—Kael completes his map not to restore his sister but to pay a "debt to a ghost who was never there," reweighting the project from haunting to finality. No moralizing; the cost is undeniable. Minor slip: "fundamental instability of existence itself" edges toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael perceives in sensory frequencies, scents, and structural sound. Diction remains controlled—"cartographer of ghosts," "layered transparencies," "river of raw power"—and reflects his technical expertise without register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the peak beat. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The voice modulates with pressure, compressing syntax at the climax ("He pushed") without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor slip: "a tide that ebbed and flowed on a schedule only the universe knew" is slightly ornamental, and "the weight of a withheld truth" recurs without clear escalation. The closure image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker premise and the green-shard vision device offer a fresh synthesis; the idea that Elara's death was a resonance cascade from a parallel universe transforms the familiar "tragic accident" trope. The ending—redirecting energy rather than attempting rescue—feels earned in hindsight. Minor derivative pressure: the "grief carries a secret" frame is widely used, though the execution through sensory mapping adds specificity. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael as sensory map maker is signaled in the opening line, constrains his method (he logs scents and frequencies), and drives the closure (he uses his map to redirect the cascade). His sensory expertise enables the final action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in the opening description, enables vision in the middle beat (raised to his eye to see parallel worlds), and is explicitly lowered at closure ("its purpose fulfilled"). It shapes tactics, constrains access, and charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is introduced early ("a realignment of the soul"), demonstrated through layered transparencies in the middle, and culminates in the redirect action that dissipates energy into "empty, uninhabited realities." The concept shapes stakes and tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous is signaled early ("the tide was coming in"), constrains timing (Kael must wait for the hum to start), and forces immediate action when the energy peaks. The trait enables the middle beat and the closure choice with visible cost, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Redirect is the climactic action: Kael finds the energy channel and "pushed" to bend the destructive wave away. The action is irreplaceable—blocking would fail, and doing nothing would allow recurrence. It redefines options and delivers closure with felt cost (the visions vanish).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Through parallel universes is signaled early (the shard reveals "layered transparencies"), shapes middle attempts (he sifts through layers searching for Elara's signature), and enables the redirect (he maps uninhabited realities to receive the energy). The method is causal and constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored in the opening line, supplies sensory particulars (rust, gantries, cold concrete), and functions as the nexus where the resonance cascade occurred. It constrains access (Kael must work here) and charges the final marking of the site. Micro-setting use is solid but not indispensable; a different location could serve similar purpose.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears only in the opening line as atmospheric flavor. It does not constrain timing, shape tactics, or return at closure. The cyclical spontaneity of the phenomenon does the timeframe work; this phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To discover the weight of a withheld truth is stated in the opening paragraph, drives the middle search (sifting for Elara's signature), and is satisfied at closure when Kael gains "the truth" and understands "the weight of the silence his parents had carried." The motivation generates friction (hope versus acceptance) and visible cost.</comment>
