<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—her attention to decay, her tactile relationship with the bread heel, her "quiet, desperate hunt" embodied through guerrilla gardening. The patrolman's whispered memory of his mother's Saturday ritual adds credible depth in minimal space. The final stance—"seen" rather than punished or validated—feels earned, though the shift could carry slightly more internal contradiction to reach higher bands. Micro-choices (kneeling, holding out the bread, continuing to plant) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through decay imagery, gardening attempts, and the encounter, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the patrolman's nod and departure reconfigure the courtyard from policed space to shared memory without resolving Elara's larger project. The cost is legible: she remains alone, her rebellion unchanged but reweighted by being witnessed. One meaningful deepening (the encounter) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting does active work: the courtyard's "crumbling colonnades," "moss eat[ing] the marble," and "pavement cracks" constrain Elara's gardening method and supply the resources (mortar gaps, statue base) that shape her micro-tactics. The bread heel and trowel function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's noticer lens—"fine, grey dust" of decay, "flour-dusted windows," the cold biting deeper—without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating life against erasure) is signaled early and tested in the encounter. The patrolman's arrival tightens options—Elara must "uncloak" her purpose—and her choice to explain rather than flee, then offer the bread, narrows the tactical field with agency. The nod and departure constitute a micro-reversal that reweights her solitary work without resolving the larger decay. Cost is visible: she stands "alone in the cold" but now "seen," a trade-off between isolation and validation that forecloses simple triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (finding the sacred in ordinary erasure, tenuous peace with loss) emerges through particulars: the petrified bread, chamomile in mortar gaps, the patrolman's whispered memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"communion" in "the ordinary dirt under her fingernails"—without moralizing. The bread's return with reweighted meaning (from fossil to shared ghost) and the final image of "specks of green life...coaxed from stone" ground abstraction in embodied action. "Tenuous absolution" risks overt thematic statement but is anchored by the prior gardening and the encounter's ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "the creeping normality of decay," runs her thumb over "unyielding crust," and sees the courtyard as "a map of a place that now existed only in memory." Diction ("communion," "guerrilla gardening," "heuristically gentle") fits an educated, observant focalizer. The patrolman's brief dialogue ("My mother waited in line...every Saturday") carries subtext and goal (recognition, not enforcement) without overarticulation. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the encounter. Minor slip: "heuristically gentle" in narration feels slightly authorial rather than Elara's exact internal idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is controlled with strong imagery: "Moss ate the marble," "a fossil from a forgotten age," "a tender sort of defiance." Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Minor pattern: "She had decided," "She had not been," "she had found"—three past-perfect constructions in key beats create a slight template cadence. The metaphor "ivy scaled the walls, a slow green conquest" works, but "the air had grown thin since the birds flew south" opens with an abstract claim that lacks immediate grounding. No loops or major scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—guerrilla gardening as rebellion in a decaying city, the petrified bread as memory object, the encounter with a tired patrolman—feels specific and earns its beats through grounded detail (Miller's Bakery, chamomile in cracks, the mother's Saturday queue). The frame avoids stock dystopia by focusing on small-scale, embodied acts rather than large politics. Risk: the "tenuous absolution" phrasing and the final "communion" line edge toward thematic overstatement, pulling slightly away from the concrete particulars that make the rest fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara as "creeping normality noticer" is signaled early (opening paragraph decay observations) and drives her choices: she catalogs loss, decides to plant, and "uncloak[s]" her purpose to the patrolman by naming what's vanished. Her noticing creates the encounter's emotional hinge when she gestures at the gardens and names Miller's. Two beats (setup, climax explanation) with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bread appears in three beats: vigil object (paragraph 2), held out to the patrolman (climax), and returned to her bag (ending). Its meaning evolves from private fossil to shared ghost, charging the patrolman's memory and the final image of "communion." Handling is embodied ("ran a thumb over its unyielding crust," "held it out on her palm"). Specific irreplaceability: "Miller's...rye...the last one" ties it to the bakery's erasure and the patrolman's mother, not generic bread.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is explicitly named in the final paragraph ("a tenuous absolution, a fragile peace made with the ghosts") and implicitly built through the encounter: Elara is neither punished nor validated, only "seen," a halfway resolution that reweights her solitary project without solving decay. The concept shapes the ending's emotional register and stakes (peace with loss rather than triumph). Slight over-articulation in the closure line keeps this from higher bands; the effect would land harder if left to implication.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is defined ("she learned by doing which seeds would take") and embodied in her method: working "in the twilight hours" with "a small trowel and pockets full of seeds," planting "chamomile in the mortar gaps." The trait constrains her rebellion to small-scale, experimental acts rather than confrontation, shaping two beats (the gardening description, the encounter where she explains rather than argues). Cost: her defiance remains "tender," insufficient to halt larger decay, a tradeoff legible in the ending's solitude.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" drives the encounter's major turn: "This was the moment she had to uncloak, not just the garment but the entire quiet purpose." The action redefines options—Elara shifts from evasion to explanation, offering the bread and naming the gardens—and precipitates the patrolman's memory and departure. Swappability test: "reveal" or "explain" could substitute with minor edits, but the dual physical/metaphorical register (literal cloak, figurative purpose) and the beat's centrality to the encounter push this into strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (paragraph 3), its mechanics detailed (seeds in pavement cracks, chamomile, mint, thyme), and active in two beats: the description of past nights and the present planting when the patrolman arrives. The method shapes Elara's rebellion as patient, experimental, embodied work and supplies the visible proof ("the small, determined patches of green") that triggers the patrolman's shift. The ending returns to "specks of green life...coaxed from the stone," charging the method with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tea house and courtyard anchor all action: the courtyard supplies the "mortar gaps," "pavement cracks," and "headless statue" that enable Elara's planting and constrain her to small-scale tactics. The setting creates the encounter's stakes—"This is palace grounds...No one is allowed here"—and its resolution: the patrolman "seeing the courtyard for the first time...as a place of memory." Three beats (vigil, planting, encounter) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight dock: the tea house itself is named but not used; the courtyard does the work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is the opening anchor and sets the season (autumn/winter chill, "the cold bit deeper"). Time pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical—no live clock tightens decisions—but the seasonal frame reinforces decay and the "deepening chill" that complicates Elara's planting. The three-month gap since Miller's closed tracks loss without urgency. Lyric setup–final echo, but middle beats don't lean on the timeframe to alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find the sacred in the ordinary things that were being systematically erased") is stated in paragraph 2 and dramatized through the bread vigil, the gardening, and the encounter where Elara names vanished particulars. Friction: her desire to preserve conflicts with the patrolman's authority and the larger decay, forcing the choice to explain rather than hide. Cost: she achieves being "seen" but not validation or change, a partial fulfillment that charges the ending. Slight over-articulation in the motivation line keeps this from higher bands.</comment>
