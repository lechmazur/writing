<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivations are clear and embodied through his scarred physicality and backward walking tell. His desire to mentor while protecting himself from past failure creates authentic internal friction. Elara's final choice to stay and rebuild is earned by the progression from passivity ("her voice small") to agency (restacking scrolls). The "combative tenderness" method and his terror when mapping her path show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though Elara's interior remains thinner than Kael's.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara refuses the journey and chooses to rebuild in exile, forecloses escape with visible cost ("She would learn to unpick the knots, right here, with him"). The piece operates under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when Kael finishes the map and pushes it away, narrowing her choice to leave or stay. The cost—remaining in a "forgotten place"—is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library is rendered through sensory specifics: dust motes settling, dusty floorboards, velvet-draped pedestal, tumbling scrolls. The playground swing sound anchors time and isolation. The crystalline cube with trapped shadow functions as micro-setting that charges the stakes by showing prior failure. Spatial choreography is clean (across the room, pedestal, table, stacks). The fallen scrolls directly enable the closure choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reversible exile and the path home. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael completes the annotated map, forcing Elara's decision. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost—staying in exile to build strength rather than risking premature return. The tea-reading ritual escalates pressure through Kael's agitation and backward retreat. The cost of staying versus the cost of leaving unprepared is made tangible through the trapped shadow and Kael's decades of failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: resilience as unpicking knots rather than escaping them. The knot motif, trapped shadow, backward walking, and fallen scrolls build without overt statement. Elara's final act of restacking scrolls reweights the opening tea-and-knot lesson without moralizing. The story resists the binary of exile/return by making "any place your home" the earned insight. Kael's broken instruction carries "the quiet roar of his belief," an embodied complexity that avoids platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single tight third-person on Elara with stable distance and no head-hopping. Kael's dialogue carries his combative register ("Are you going to stare, or are you going to learn?") distinct from Elara's tentative voice. Perceptual signature is consistent: she watches, flinches, feels small, then finds strength. The phrasing "fractured gaze seeming to multiply her in his eyes" and "quiet roar of his belief" are vivid but edge toward slight overwriting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to Elara's realization at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening image of "skin was a tapestry of fine, silvery scars" is specific and apt. Minor template cadence appears in the middle ("It was his way... He was mentoring... He motioned...") but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops. The figurative language cluster in the opening paragraph ("fractures," "tapestry," "shards," "chisel against stone") is dense but coherent and voice-motivated. Final line charges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist and tea-leaf cartography of exile offer a fresh synthesis of mentor-student and magical-return tropes. The backward-walking tell is a specific, non-obvious choice that embodies his trauma. The twist that resilience means staying rather than escaping transforms the exile premise. Kael's "combative tenderness" and Elara's choice to rebuild in a "forgotten place" feel inevitable in hindsight. The reversible-exile frame risks template familiarity but is redeemed by the emotional particulars and the refusal to grant escape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices drive key turns: he gives Elara the knot, shows her the trapped shadow, performs the tea-reading ritual, and pushes the finished map away, each escalating pressure. His backward retreat under stress reveals character and cost. His decision to annotate her path despite his terror is the story's peak causal moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shadow-in-glass appears in one extended beat where Kael uses it to warn Elara of the risks. It shapes stakes by illustrating permanent failure but does not return or constrain later action. It is causally active in the middle but absent from the closure, limiting its score under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile frames the dominant stake from the opening and drives all tactics: Kael's decades of trying, Elara's hope, the path-annotation ritual, and her final choice to refuse premature return. The concept shapes the closure image when Elara decides "any place" can be home, reweighting the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael walks backwards twice on the page under stress: once while describing the trapped shadow, again when sketching the map, bumping into scrolls. The trait is embodied, signals his trauma, and the fallen scrolls enable Elara's closure choice. It constrains his composure and charges the final beat through the mess she chooses to rebuild.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The annotation action appears early (Kael announces it), occupies the story's peak pressure beat (tea-reading ritual with charcoal and vellum), and produces the map that forces Elara's climactic decision. The finished map is the story's hinge; without it, the closure choice has no object. Indispensable to escalation and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled early ("bring me your cup"), executed on the page with Kael tracing moisture and dregs, and its mechanics matter: he interprets clusters, angles, and traps to sketch her path. The method shapes the middle beat and produces the map that drives closure. Its esoteric specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library pressures choices throughout: it is the site of exile, houses the trapped-shadow warning, supplies the scrolls whose fall and restoration frame Elara's decision. The space's quietness ("hear the dust motes settle") and Kael's cataloging work anchor stakes. The scrolls function as micro-setting that alters the final tactic, satisfying the constraint test.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The playground swing sound appears in the opening to mark isolation and "late afternoon," anchoring tone and desolation. It does not return or tighten decisions at the closure. Time remains vague ("decades" for Kael's attempts) and does not create live pressure. The hush-mood is purposeful but the timeframe does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to mentor resilience is dramatized through the knot lesson, the shadow warning, and the tea-reading ritual. His "combative tenderness" and backward retreat show the friction between wanting to help and fearing her failure. The motivation drives his peak choice to finish the map despite terror and shapes Elara's realization, but the "quietly" aspect is more told ("his belief in her") than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is embodied from the opening snap ("Are you going to stare, or are you going to learn?") through Kael's harsh lessons paired with his visible terror and the "quiet roar of his belief." The tone modulates under pressure as his agitation grows during the ritual, then softens when he hides the tremor in his hands. It charges the closure when Elara responds to his combative teaching by choosing care (restacking scrolls).</comment>
