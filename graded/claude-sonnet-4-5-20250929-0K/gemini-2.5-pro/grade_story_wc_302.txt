<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled early and sustained, but her interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("desperate," "cautious exuberance," "brilliant victory") that labels emotion rather than embodying it through contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure. The watch-guided choreography shows goal-directed action, yet the final "Stay" revelation feels received rather than earned by a visible internal conflict that forecloses a path. The piece maintains consistent focalization and avoids head-hopping, but the emotional progression reads more as smooth escalation than the messy, contradictory layering that would lift characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear premise (navigate the library before the second letter arrives) and delivers an on-page closure unit: Elara documents "Stay," the library dissolves, and she turns to face the messenger with the journal as evidence of her discovery. This qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) since the final image crystallizes her stance and the cost—time expended, veil now a relic, the coming confrontation—is felt. However, the escalation is primarily spatial and accumulative (moving through fog, triangulating light motes) without a meaningful tightening of options or a causal reversal that narrows her path; the watch guides her smoothly rather than forcing a trade-off. The closure cost is implied but not viscerally dramatized on the page, which prevents entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("ozone and regret," "pearlescent sea," "sourceless light") and the watch functions as a micro-setting element that constrains her navigation method. Spatial choreography is coherent—she repositions herself, triangulates light motes, moves toward the central chamber—and the mist's dissolution signals the time limit. However, the setting mostly frames action rather than forcing a choice; the environment enables her method but does not create a moment where access, proximity, or terrain alters her tactics under pressure, which caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the unspoken words before the second letter arrives) is clear and sustained, and the ticking-backward watch creates a felt time pressure. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—she captures phrases, approaches the central chamber, and finally documents "Stay"—but there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The resolution lands through discovery rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path, and while the cost (time spent, the messenger approaching) is implied, it is not dramatized as a visible price paid in the moment, which prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken truths and the cost of silence emerges organically from the cipher-library conceit and the relationship subtext (the confidence man's silence, Elara's desperate search). The final word "Stay" reweights the emotional premise without overt moralizing, and the watch-as-trust-currency metaphor threads through without becoming heavy-handed. However, the closure image ("the veil no longer feeling like a shield but a relic") tilts toward abstract reframing rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in concrete action, and the thematic question—what cost to recover silence—is implied more than it is dramatized through a choice that enacts the answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with a distinct elevated register ("gossamer fabric," "cathedral of his regret," "haptic tremor") that fits the dreamlike, lyric mode. However, diction under pressure—"cautious exuberance that was almost painful," "trembling," "desperate"—leans on label-only emotion rather than embodied perception, and filter verbs ("felt like") appear at key beats without being strictly voice-motivated. The perceptual signature (light-motes as syllables, propagation delays as reading method) is specific and sustained, but the uniform lyricism across all beats, including high-pressure moments, flattens the rhythm and reduces the sense of urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and generally clear, but multiple artifacting patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the place she had only seen in sleep" / "the glowing library in mist" echo each other), elevated metaphor density in nearly every sentence ("archive of echoes," "ghostly after-images," "cathedral of his regret") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and template cadence in the watch-description beat ("Its face was polished obsidian, its hands carved from bone, and it did not measure..."). The final paragraph stacks three metaphoric constructions in rapid succession ("shield but a relic," "coming dawn," "silent, backward shudder") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. These artifacts do not break causality but measurably dull line-level propulsion and clarity at the ending, triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The cipher-library-as-light-propagation-delays is a fresh synthesis of physics metaphor and emotional excavation, and the backward-ticking watch as trust-currency adds specificity. However, the core emotional arc (discovering an unspoken truth before a deadline) follows a familiar template, and the transformative particulars—why this library, why these delays, why this watch—are more decorative than inevitable. The "veiled dreamer" framing and the confidence-man backstory hint at depth but remain under-dramatized, reducing the sense that this exact combination of elements is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (veiled dreamer) is present throughout and her goal drives all action. She makes micro-choices (positioning, triangulating, documenting), and the final turn to face the messenger is a decision. However, the choices are primarily tactical executions of the method rather than decisions that alter stakes or foreclose competing paths—she follows the watch's guidance smoothly without a moment where competing options force a trade-off. Early signal and beat involvement are strong; causal pressure and closure cost are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in paragraph two, is used actively in paragraphs three and five (tracking temporal parallax, pulsing at cycle completion, guiding repositioning), and returns in the final paragraph with a "silent, backward shudder." It constrains her navigation method and charges the ending image. The watch shapes at least two distinct beats and participates in closure, meeting all three gates. However, the "trust currency" metaphor is introduced but not tested—it does not create a visible trade-off or cost tied to trust—so the object's thematic charge is implied rather than dramatized, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is introduced in paragraph three ("core concept was an unfolding cipher"), shapes her method (triangulating light-motes, solving overlapping syllables), and culminates in the final word "Stay." The concept drives tactics and is present in the closure, meeting all three gates. However, the cipher's mechanics are more atmospheric than causally constraining—she does not face a moment where the cipher's difficulty forces a trade-off or error—so its integration reads as functional but not indispensable. Early signal, development across multiple beats, and closure presence support mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cyclically reversed watch-hand (paragraph two) is the mechanism that tracks temporal parallax and guides her repositioning. It constrains her navigation method and is mentioned in the final beat. Early signal, development in two distinct beats (paragraphs three and five), and closure participation meet all three gates. However, the reversal is a tool property rather than a trait that imposes a visible cost or enables a key choice she could not make otherwise—removing the reversal and using a forward-tracking parallax gauge would require only minor edits. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Documenting is introduced in paragraph four ("vital action to document"), drives the middle sequence (capturing phrases, transcribing "I never wanted… to leave… you"), and culminates in the final act (documenting "Stay," clutching the journal). The action shapes at least three beats and is indispensable to closure—without documentation, the library visit yields no proof and the journal cannot serve as evidence in the coming confrontation. Early signal, strong beat involvement, and decisive closure participation meet all gates and elevate the score. The action is specific and irreplaceable, justifying entry into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Propagation delays are introduced in paragraph three ("a riddle about physics and feeling, a solution found only through propagation delays") and shape her method: she must position herself where delays cancel out to read the true sequence. The method is used in paragraph four (triangulating three points of fading light) and is implicit in the final approach. Early signal, development in one clear beat, and closure relevance meet two gates. However, the method is explained more than dramatized—she does not face a moment where misjudging delays creates a cost or forces a correction—so its integration is functional but not indispensable. The mechanics matter but do not drive a turn, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is present from the opening and provides the spatial frame for all action. It supplies the light-motes she must decode and the fog she navigates, and its dissolution signals the time limit. Early signal, sustained presence across beats, and closure participation (mist thinning as time ends) meet all three gates. However, the setting enables her method without creating a moment where terrain, access, or proximity forces a tactical choice or trade-off—she moves smoothly toward the central chamber without obstruction. The setting is essential to the premise but does not constrain a key decision, justifying low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (between two fateful letters) is established in the opening paragraph and returns in the final paragraph ("her time between the two fateful letters was over"). The impending second letter creates urgency and the watch tracks cycles, but the timeframe is more thematic deadline than live clock—there is no on-page moment where running out of time forces a choice, alters tactics, or creates a visible cost. Early signal and closure participation meet two gates, but the lack of mid-scene tightening or time-driven trade-off limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (to find the library of unspoken words before the second letter arrives) is stated in paragraph one, drives all action, and is fulfilled in the closure when she documents "Stay" and clutches the journal. The motivation is present across all beats and shapes her goal-directed navigation. However, the motivation is declared and pursued smoothly without on-page friction—there is no moment where competing wants or costs test her commitment. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage meet all gates and support mid-6s; the lack of dramatized internal conflict or trade-off caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is explicitly named in paragraph four ("filling her with a cautious exuberance that was almost painful") but is otherwise label-only. The tone is more consistently lyric-elevated than modulated by competing emotional pulls; the prose maintains uniform metaphoric density across beats rather than tightening or breathing with pressure. The final image (veil as relic, silent shudder) is more elegiac than exuberant. Late explicit mention, no clear modulation under pressure, and weak closure charge cap the score in the mid-4s.</comment>
