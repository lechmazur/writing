<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is concrete and his motivation—stripping drama from chaos—is embodied in repeated actions (sitting, observing through the pane). The turn from scientific detachment to "profound sense of connection" is dramatized through the orchid-to-weed water transfer, earning the shift. Minor slip: the final epiphany ("The drama was not an overlay; it was the process itself") edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though the preceding image anchors it. The choice to pick up the shovel forecloses his observer stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Aris's repeated observations through the dust-coated pane accumulate density until the orchid moment reweights his stance. The closure—wiping the pane clean and reaching for the shovel—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: he must abandon the filtered comfort and join the messy process. The single meaningful deepening (orchid transfer → connection → action) is sufficient for this length and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains Aris's choices: the dust-coated pane becomes the lens through which he observes, and removing it (wiping clean) is the final decisive gesture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silt smell, humidity weight, mildew creep). The polycarbonate pane and its dust are micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Aris's need to impose order on chaos—is signaled early and tightens through his repeated returns to the dust-lens. The orchid observation deepens the conflict by forcing him to confront the emotional truth he sought to eliminate. The final act (wiping the pane, seeking the shovel) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: he forecloses his safe observer role. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the butterfly dust as filter, the orchid-to-weed water transfer, the wiped circle as "quiet prayer." The final image (reaching for the shovel) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—how to engage with messy reality—without moralizing. The piece avoids thematic echo; Aris's realization is embodied in the water-flow observation. The ending reweights prior material (dust as lens → dust as barrier) with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Aris's perceptual signature is distinct: he sees "vectors of change," "radio wave data," "elegant equation." Diction remains character-particular (neutron stars, chitin, Cattleya) without register drift. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (short sentences at the orchid moment). Minor slip: "kindled humility" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated summary, though the gesture that follows grounds it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: the dust functions as covering, lens, and final barrier. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the opening ("alien equation," "physical weight") is voice-consistent and does not obscure. The final beats are clean and propulsive. One small slip: "the gesture feeling less like cleaning and more like a quiet prayer" uses a simile where a concrete action might have landed harder, but it does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The butterfly-dust-as-lens is a fresh synthesis that feels earned. The orchid-to-weed water transfer offers a non-obvious angle on decay and renewal. The piece transforms the "scientist learns to feel" template through specific, verifiable detail (polycarbonate, chitin scales, Cattleya). Risk-taking is modest but coherent; the ending resists easy sentiment. Proximity check: no echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's profession (neutron star researcher) shapes his perceptual bias ("cosmic clockwork," "radio wave data") and his desire to strip drama. His choice to wipe the pane and pick up the shovel is the closure turn. The attribute appears in setup, constrains middle observation, and drives the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The butterfly dust is handled across multiple beats: discovered on the pane, observed as a lens, and wiped away in the final gesture. Its properties (microscopic scales, angled chitin) enable the filtering that allows Aris to see process. Removing it (wiping clean) is the decisive action. The element is irreplaceable and causally central to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Gradual change" is the dominant stake: Aris seeks to see it as "system transitioning to a new state." The dust-lens allows him to perceive "slow, inexorable creep" and "imperceptible sag." The orchid moment reweights the concept: change is not just transition but "messy, heartbreaking, and beautiful exchange." The concept shapes tactics and the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dust "preprocesses reality" by simplifying visual noise, sharpening motion vectors, and blurring others. This trait enables Aris's middle observations (mildew colonization, beam sag, water transfer). The cost: it also filters out emotional truth, which he must confront when he wipes it away. The attribute constrains choices and the final action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Decay" drives the entire arc: the greenhouse is decaying, the orchid decays into the weed, Aris himself is "subject to its laws of decay and renewal." The orchid's cellular breakdown is the turn that forces his epiphany. The final gesture (joining the process) is his acceptance of decay as purposeful. Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is the method by which Aris observes and the lens is created. The dust's "overlapping, angled fragments" act as a "complex filter." The method is signaled early, shapes middle attempts (repeated returns to observe), and is reversed at closure when he wipes the pane. Mechanics matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse provides the setting and the wreckage that Aris must process. The humidity, silt, twisted metal, and waterlogged beam are all active elements that pressure his desire for order. The polycarbonate pane (micro-setting) is the tool he uses and then rejects. Setting constrains choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the timeframe and the decay that drives the story. "Days turned into a week" marks the accumulation period. The timeframe is present throughout but does not impose a ticking-clock pressure; it functions more as context than constraint. It shapes the decay process but does not tighten decisions in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aris's motivation "to strip needless drama from the event" is stated early and dramatized through his repeated returns to the dust-lens. The orchid moment creates friction: he feels "pure, irrational grief" and must confront that "the drama was not an overlay." The motivation is conflicted and resolved with cost (he must abandon detachment). Slightly on-the-nose phrasing ("strip needless drama") but the choice work earns it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" emerges in the final third ("a feeling he hadn't felt since he first looked through a telescope as a child"). Tone is coherent: clinical in the opening, accumulating wonder through the dust-lens observations, shifting to vulnerable in the orchid moment, and ending in quiet resolve. The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image (wiping the pane, seeking the shovel).</comment>
