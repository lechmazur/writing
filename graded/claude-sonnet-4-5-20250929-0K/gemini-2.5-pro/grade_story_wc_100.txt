<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (ending the psychic noise) is concrete and drives his choice to descend. The weariness is embodied ("etched deeper than the lines on his face"), and the trait "inadvertently stubborn" appears as a label without on-page friction or cost. The final beat delivers relief but no visible renunciation or trade-off that would elevate the arc; the resolution reads as pure gain. Internal contradiction is absent—he never wavers or doubts—limiting dramatic complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The package arrival triggers the descent, and the lens-insertion revitalizes the astrolabe, creating a clear before/after. Closure is a Decisive Change (noise → silence) with felt cost (the immense toll of "occupying impossible spaces" is declared but not shown to foreclose a later option). The orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias fits the lens, but the cost remains abstract ("rarely used due to its immense cost") rather than dramatized on the page, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered: basalt shelves, coral astrolabe, vaulted ceilings in gloom. The broken lens as a recurring object charges the final image by enabling the astrolabe. Spatial choreography is clean (pier → non-space → library center). The setting constrains the central choice (the astrolabe needs the lens), meeting the 9+ gate, but the "occupation of impossible spaces" remains abstract—no tactile detail of pressure or water parting limits full integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ending the psychic noise. The lens-fitting is the single on-page tightening that narrows options (he must reach the library and install the shard). Agency is present but uncomplicated—no live dilemma or trade-off forces a choice with visible cost. The "immense cost" of his talent is told, not shown to alter tactics. Escalation reads as a single decisive intensification (arrival and installation) sufficient for this length, but the lack of felt price at closure keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme: rest/silence as resolution for haunting. The broken lens and silent library concretize the concept. The final image (ethereal script on tablets, woven tapestry of history) offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "the chased stillness had finally been caught," a phrase that reweights prior material. Minor slip: "resolved, the threads of panic and sorrow woven into a tapestry of tranquil history" edges toward summary rather than leaving the image to resonate alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias's weary, undertaker lens filters the opening ("weariness was etched deeper"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("a map made of pressure and longing"). No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the descent), compression is acceptable and the internal texture holds. No dialogue; filter verbs are rare and voice-motivated. One minor slip: "inadvertently stubborn" feels like an externalized label rather than his own idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Rhythm varies naturally. Minor overwriting in the descent: "a non-space of crushing black, the water parting before him not as a liquid, but as a tear in reality" stacks metaphors without clarifying mechanics. The closure beat is clean. One stock phrase: "his own weariness settling into a gentle, welcome calm" reads generic for the final line's emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The underwater library for spiritual archiving is a fresh synthesis. The broken lens as both receiver and key integrates concept and object. Specific details (salt-stained box, dry seaweed, basalt shelves) ground the premise. The "occupation of impossible spaces" remains abstract, reducing irreplaceability—other conveyance methods could substitute with minor edits. The final image (moonlight script on tablets) is evocative but not wholly surprising given the setup. Solid transformation of tropes without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's choice to descend and fit the lens drives both key turns. Setup: introduced immediately. Development: his descent choice narrows options. Payoff: he installs the lens at closure. The decisions alter tactics under the chosen lens. One limitation: his resolve is declared ("inadvertently stubborn") but not tested by friction—no on-page moment where he nearly turns back or pays visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: arrives in the package, paragraph one. Development: held during descent, "the lens felt warm in his hand." Payoff: fitted into the astrolabe socket, revitalizing it and enabling closure. Appears in three distinct beats with evolving meaning (mystery → map → key). The "fractured crystal" and "jagged edges locking perfectly" are specific and irreplaceable. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "haunted by the distress signals of the unquiet dead" frames his quest. Development: the lens coalesces signals into "a feeling of crushing depth," guiding his descent. Payoff: at closure, signals are "drawn down, funneled, and sorted" onto tablets. Shapes stakes and tactics across all three gates. One gap: the concept is more atmospheric than a live constraint—Elias never chooses between conflicting signals or pays a cost tied to their presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "inadvertently stubborn, his resolve born from a quiet desperation" (end of paragraph two). No middle beat where the trait constrains or enables action. Payoff: not invoked at closure. The trait is label-only and does not force a visible tradeoff. Present and logically consistent but swappable with "determined" or "dogged" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: the astrolabe is "dormant, failing in its purpose" and needs revitalization. Development: Elias approaches and fits the lens. Payoff: "The action was not to repair, but to revitalize"—the hum, light, and script flow redefine the library's function and Elias's relief. Central to closure with high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Could not be swapped for "repair" or "activate" without losing thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "occupying impossible spaces, a talent he rarely used due to its immense cost" (paragraph two). Development: the descent is enabled by this method—"folded the world around himself," "walked through a non-space." Payoff: not directly invoked at closure. Shapes one major beat (the descent) but remains abstract—no mechanics or felt cost shown. Swappable with "teleportation" or "deep-sea travel" without breaking logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: the library is introduced at emergence (paragraph four). Development: its dormant state and the astrolabe's hollow socket create the problem Elias solves. Payoff: at closure, the library becomes functional—tablets fill, the astrolabe operates. The setting supplies the key resource (the socket) and its transformation charges the final image. High closure linkage and causal pressure. Minor limitation: late first appearance (second half) and no micro-setting constraint earlier.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story start. Development and Payoff: time is untracked—no duration, urgency, or clock pressure. The descent and installation occur in vague sequence. Functional but replaceable; removing the timeframe anchor would not alter choices or stakes. No live tightening from elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "His life's work wasn't just burying bodies; it was a desperate attempt to give rest a permanent address" (paragraph one). Development: the motivation drives his descent choice. Payoff: "The chased stillness had finally been caught, held fast within these sunken walls." Desire is dramatized in the quest and resolved at closure. One gap: no friction or competing want tests the motivation—Elias never doubts or sacrifices an alternate path, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "the stillness he chased his entire life" (paragraph two). Development: tone modulates from "roaring ocean" and "crushing black" to "suspended quiet" in the library. Payoff: "profound, unambiguous relief of silence" and "gentle, welcome calm" charge the final image. Coherent through turns with cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. High closure linkage and purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
