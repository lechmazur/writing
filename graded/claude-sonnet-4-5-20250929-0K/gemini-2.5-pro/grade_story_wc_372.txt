<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior is concrete and specific ("breath fogging," "fingers flew"), with embodied stress visible throughout the apparatus sequence. His motivation—to salvage meaning—is tested by the vow's collapse and forces the micro-choice to capture the tone at the final flare. Internal contradiction is present (he knows the end is "impossible" yet persists), and the final stance crystallizes into "guardian of ghosts" with a credible cost: endurance in profound isolation. Minor deduction: the reflection on his purpose in the archive middle section leans abstract ("cartographer of a collapsing reality") and slightly diagnostic, reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Kaelen, Aethelburg Archive, "today's work") arrive by line six. The piece accumulates density through the resonator sequence, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaelen's successful capture of the frequency and his stance as "curator of echoes" reconfigures the opening despair into purposeful endurance with visible cost (the slide becomes "inert," the city strangers). The final image ("pale disc…slow descent") reweights the opening motif of the cloud-sea, and the cost—another cycle in frozen solitude—is undeniable. One meaningful cadence shift (the nova flare into silence) narrows options and charges the closure. No causality breaks; all moves cohere under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library setting constrains Kaelen's actions throughout: frigid air fogs his breath, the obsidian vault chills the slide, the ice-glazed floor amplifies the quartz hush. The resonator apparatus—"spun silver and polished lenses"—is tactile and specific, handled across multiple beats (slot, adjust dial, capture rune). The grand observation window frames the final stance and links the archive to the city below, charging the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful (cold, hush, light) and filtered through Kaelen's focus on the task. Minor gap: the cloud-sea below and the spire's crystal structure remain postcard-vivid but do not directly constrain a mid-scene choice, limiting full indispensability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the vow's essence before it vanishes. Pressure tightens through the resonator sequence: the projection frays, frequencies scatter, Kaelen must find the carrier wave against a "failing heartbeat" of light. The final flare—"brilliant, defiant nova"—forces his desperate stab at the console, a micro-turn with visible cost (the slide dies, becomes "inert"). Agency is clear: his invention and skill enable the capture, and the choice to persist charges the closure (he prepares for "the next day" despite the encroaching void). Cost is legible: each saved vow deepens his solitude, and the city's strangers embody the loss. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—meaning salvaged from oblivion—emerges through concrete particulars: the slide's transformation from shimmer to "lifeless scratches," the equation as "tombstone and seed," the archive as "lexicon of essences." The final image (sun descending, Kaelen preparing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: purpose persists in curation even as erasure continues. No overt thesis statement; subtext operates in the contrast between "Extinguished" casket and the notation that "was not lost." The Vow of Reciprocity's death mirrors the city's collapse into "strangers," particularizing the abstract stake. Minor note: "guardian of ghosts, curator of echoes" verges on recap but is earned by prior images and does not flatten into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Kaelen's sensory field and lexicon ("quartz hush," "gently meticulous," "resonator apparatus"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he ignores the "poignant image" to focus on readouts, a character-specific filter. Diction shifts under pressure ("desperate precision," "screamed a single…tone") without breaking voice. The whispered "Hold" is the sole dialogue, purposeful and swallowed by silence. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he had to") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor deduction: "His motivation was not to halt the end…" in the middle block edges toward helpful-narrator summary, slightly flattening the present frame, though it remains anchored to his task.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the flare: "Then, the light died. The projection vanished."). Information density is high: most lines advance image, action, or thematic charge. Figurative language ("guttering candle flame," "symphony collapsing into discordant noise") is controlled and specific. Minor artifact cluster: "His task, and his penance" / "His motivation was not to halt" / "His goal was to measure" / "His fingers flew" stack possessive constructions across the middle third, creating mild template cadence. Paraphrase loop: "a cartographer of a collapsing reality" and "the slow unraveling…into forgotten mist" restate the premise without added pressure. Deduction: −0.6 for template stems and loop; artifacts do not touch closure but reduce mid-momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—archivist as frequency-measurer in a dying world—feels specific and non-obvious. The magic lantern slide, resonator apparatus, and "mathematical tone" for abstract concepts ground the premise in tactile process. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc (futility into purposeful endurance) is inseparable from Kaelen's task and the archive setting. The "lexicon of essences" frame reweights the trope of doomed archivists by making meaning literal (frequencies, equations). Risk: the quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning within-band lift. Minor note: "Great Fading" and "Luminous Vow" as proper nouns lean slightly toward fantasy-template naming, but their integration into the mechanism rescues freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (orderly records chief) is present throughout, his role shaping every beat: retrieves slide, slots it, adjusts controls, captures the tone, logs the vow. His title and task are inseparable from the story's logic. His choice at the flare—"stabbed a rune"—drives the closure. Removal would erase the story. Slight deduction: his role is established rather than contested on the page; no middle choice tests whether to preserve or abandon the task.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in at least four beats: retrieval from vault, insertion into resonator, projection flicker, final inertness. Its transformation (shimmer → lifeless scratches) charges the closure and embodies the theme. The slide's "trapped light" and "failing heartbeat" enable the task and raise the cost when it dies. Removal breaks the mechanism and the thematic weight. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" frame the dominant stake (preserve before they vanish) and the final equation names the Vow of Reciprocity. The concept appears in setup, middle (as the projection dissolves), and closure (logged, saved). It constrains Kaelen's tactics (he must capture the "foundational resonance") and reweights the ending (trust → strangers). Lyric reprise qualifies. Deduction: the vow itself is never dramatized as a choice Kaelen makes; it remains an object of study rather than a present pressure on him.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is used once as a label ("gently meticulous touch") when slotting the slide. The trait aligns with his careful resonator work and steady hand removing the dead slide, but no on-page moment shows the cost or constraint of being meticulous under the failing light. Present and consistent, but swappable with "careful" or "precise" without structural loss. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Measure" drives the entire sequence: Kaelen's goal is to "measure the vow's core signature," he tunes the sampler, captures the data point, and the final notation is the measured frequency. The action shapes setup, escalation (finding the carrier wave), and closure (the equation). Removal collapses the mechanism and the theme. The specificity—"sampling frequencies," "translating…into…tone"—makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is signaled early ("he would do this by sampling frequencies") and its mechanics matter: the resonator pulses, frequencies scatter, Kaelen tunes to find the carrier wave, the final tone screams. The method constrains his attempts (he must adjust the dial, fight the noise) and enables the capture. Present in setup, escalation, and closure. Slight deduction: the method is less tactile than the slide or resonator; "sampling" could be swapped for "recording" with minor edits to some lines.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen library pressures every action: frigid air fogs breath, the obsidian vault chills the slide, the ice-glazed floor amplifies silence. The archive's spire above the cloud-sea frames Kaelen's isolation and the final observation-window stance. The setting supplies the resonator (his invention for this place) and the "Extinguished" casket. It charges the closure: the pale sun descends, the clouds churn below. Essential to tone and stakes, near-indispensable to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" appears in the opening ("he worked while illusions fade") and as implicit pressure: the projection frays in real time, the light is a "failing heartbeat," Kaelen must act "before it vanished completely." The timeframe tightens his moves during the resonator sequence. It reappears at closure ("another piece…saved"). Lyric reprise with causal middle work qualifies for mid-6s. Deduction: no live clock (seconds, minutes) tracks the urgency on the page; the fading is felt but not counted.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated in setup ("his motivation…to distill the essence") and dramatized throughout: Kaelen ignores the poignant image, focuses on the readouts, captures the tone despite despair, prepares for the next day. The desire is tested by the vow's death and the encroaching void. Friction between his want (preserve meaning) and the cost (eternal solitude, each cycle heavier) is visible. The final stance—"guardian of ghosts"—embodies the motivation. Slight deduction: the motivation is told once in the middle block rather than purely shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is introduced early ("A quartz hush reigned"), modulates with pressure (the resonator's hum, the screamed tone, then "deeper and more absolute" silence), and charges the closure: the hush returns, Kaelen finds purpose "in the profound, frozen silence." Tone is coherent across beats and elevates the final image. The adjective "quartz" (hard, cold, crystalline) mirrors the archive's material and Kaelen's stance. Near-indispensable to the emotional register.</comment>
