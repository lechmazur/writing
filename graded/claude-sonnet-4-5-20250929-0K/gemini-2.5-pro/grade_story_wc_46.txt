<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is established through concrete anchors—stained fingers, childhood star charts, village fire memory—but the arc from observation to action lacks decisive internal friction. The motivation (share light without fire) drives her polishing work, yet no competing impulse tests her resolve; she proceeds with meditative certainty rather than contradictory want versus fear. The grandmother's whispered wisdom and fire memory provide backstory hooks, but Elara's present choices feel contemplative rather than pressured by internal conflict. The final holding-up moment offers completion without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who: Elara, where: serpentine grotto, when: days of mist) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates density through repetitive polishing motions, memory fragments, and the gradual transformation of the sea glass, culminating in the moment twilight strikes and the glass begins to glow—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image crystallizes her achievement with undeniable pressure. Cost is oblique: the "hours bled into a single, focused moment" and her solitary work, but the final image lacks a felt price that forecloses a live option or imposes a visible trade-off on the page, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, and coastal cleft anchor space and atmosphere early. Sensory details—cool air tasting of salt, damp stones, swirling mist—are filtered through Elara's star-watcher perspective and her earthbound frustration. The sliver of twilight that pierces the entrance at the climactic beat enables the sea glass to glow, making the environment causally active. The grotto's "winding, serpentine walls" curve protectively at the end, charging the final image with spatial resonance that reweights her solitude as embrace rather than confinement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and sustained. The polishing work provides a single meaningful tightening as the glass transforms from opaque to luminescent, but no live opposition tests her effort—no risk of failure, no scarcity of time or material, no competing need. The twilight's arrival feels coincidental rather than a consequence of her agency, and the resolution (the glass glows) lacks a visible price or trade-off. One tightening deepens her focus, yet escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (patient, eternal light versus hungry, fleeting fire) emerges through the village fire memory, grandmother's meteor-shower wisdom, and the sea glass transformation. The final glow—cool, serene, self-sustaining—answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The glass as "artifact of reclamation" and the serpentine walls revealed as "intricate maps of time and pressure" offer specific, non-literal resonance. Minor slip: "a quiet light for a world that had grown too loud and too bright with the wrong kind of fire" edges toward thematic summary in the closing lines, but the image work holds the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elara's perceptual signature: star charts, constellation kinship, oceanic tumbling. Diction is elevated and lyric ("zephyr bloom," "cataract," "nova"), consistent with a reflective, isolated observer. Two minor slips lower the score: "reflectively vibrant" (paragraph four) reads as an invented hybrid adjective outside natural lexicon, and the phrase "a zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding" (paragraph three) strains metaphoric coherence. Psychic distance remains close; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the prose rhythm modulates from meditative to triumphant without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer action, memory, and sensory detail without padding. Two patterns lower the score: repetitive sentence stems in paragraph two ("She began… With a wetted… she started") and paragraph four ("It was becoming… Another memory bloomed… Each stroke… The glass was"), creating template cadence (−0.5). Additionally, "reflectively vibrant" (paragraph four) is a strained coinage that muddles the glass's transformation, and the final paragraph's "Here, in her misty solitude, she held a star she could share" edges toward summary rather than trusting the image. No paraphrase loops or major pronoun drift; clarity and propulsion remain strong outside these slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—transforming sea glass into a light source through patient polishing—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, memory, and anti-fire philosophy. Emotional specificity (village fire trauma, grandmother's meteor-shower wisdom) grounds the concept in lived particulars rather than abstract longing. However, the arc follows a contemplative-maker template without a non-obvious complication: she polishes, the glass transforms, twilight enables the glow. The closing image ("a star she could share") and the fire-versus-starlight dichotomy risk familiar territory. Transformation is present but modest; removing the serpentine grotto and replacing it with another isolated workspace would not fundamentally alter the emotional or thematic trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (earthbound star watcher) is present throughout and her choices drive the polishing work. Setup: established in the opening as someone who observes the heavens but is now untethered by mist. Development: she recalls her grandmother's words and begins the gem-polishing method, a decision that narrows her options to this slow, patient craft. Payoff: she holds the glowing glass at the end, embodying her goal. Two beats (memory recall → polishing start; twilight arrival → glow achieved) involve her agency. However, the reversal or tightening is minimal—no live opposition tests her, and the twilight's arrival feels coincidental rather than a consequence of her star-watcher knowledge. The character shapes the through-line but does not create a key turn under pressure. (Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure modest +0.3, swappability −0.5 [another isolated craftsperson could perform the same arc], coincidence at climax −0.6, summary-only introspection −0.4; default 3.0 + net adjustments 1.0 → 4.0, round to observed fit.)</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sea glass: found wedged between stones (paragraph two), polished across paragraphs three and four, strikes with twilight and glows (paragraph five), held up in the final image. Setup early, development through the transformation (opaque → vibrant teal → luminescent), and payoff as the closure object. Three distinct beats (discovery, polishing transformation, glow). The glass's evolving state (murky → depth of color → self-sustaining luminescence) alters Elara's emotional arc from weighing potential to triumph. Specific properties (century of tumbling, teal, frosted skin) matter. Visible cost: hours of labor, the warming shard in her palm. (Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4; default 3.0 + net 5.7 → 8.7, slight swappability −0.5 [any translucent found object could serve] → 8.2.)</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core concept: "a pearl of stillness." The phrase appears once in paragraph five ("This was it: a pearl of stillness, a captured piece of the sky's calm majesty") as a label for the achieved glow. Setup: absent from the opening or first third. Development: not used to shape mid-story tactics or choices. Payoff: the final glow embodies stillness (cool, serene, steady), but the phrase itself is not revisited or charged in the closing lines—"a quiet light" and "a star she could share" carry the thematic work without invoking the pearl metaphor. The concept is thematically consistent but does not constrain options or alter tactics. (Late first appearance −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.3, thematic echo without causal pressure −0.6, theme support +0.5; default 3.0 + net −2.0 → 1.0, lyric-resonance allowance for embodied ending +3.1 → 4.1.)</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute: "reflectively vibrant." The phrase appears once in paragraph four: "It was becoming reflectively vibrant, not just shiny but alive with a captured, liquid energy." Setup: absent from the opening or early anchors. Development: describes the glass mid-transformation but does not enable or constrain an action—Elara continues polishing regardless of this attribute. Payoff: the final glow is described as "soft, self-sustaining luminescence" and "tranquil glow" without invoking "reflectively vibrant." The attribute is a label for the glass's state rather than a trait that alters her choices or the ending image. (Late first appearance −0.6, label-only −0.5, ornamental use −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8, no closure linkage −0.6; default 3.0 + net −3.2 → cap at lyric allowance for vivid description +2.2 → 5.2.)</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Action: "weigh." Appears in paragraph three: "She paused, placing the warming shard in her palm to weigh its potential against the heavy burden of that past." Setup: mid-story (after polishing begins). Development: the weighing is a moment of reflection that reaffirms her conviction rather than altering tactics—she returns to polishing immediately. Payoff: not directly revisited at closure, though the final holding-up gesture echoes the palm-placement. One beat with internal significance but minimal causal pressure; easily swappable with "assess," "consider," or "measure" without structural loss. (One beat +0.4, internal significance +0.3, swappability −0.7, no closure reprise −0.5, summary-only −0.4, lyric-resonance for palm → held-up echo +1.2; default 3.0 + net 0.3 → 3.3, lyric allowance lifts to 6.3.)</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method: "gem polishing." Signaled in paragraph two ("a craft learned from a dusty tome about shaping the earth's forgotten jewels"), executed with "wetted leather strip and a paste of fine sand" and "rhythmic friction" across paragraphs two through four, and the result (luminescent glass) defines the closure. Setup early, development shapes the protagonist's sustained effort, and payoff is the glowing object. Two distinct beats (polishing start, transformation reveal). The method's mechanics (leather, sand paste, slow caress) are concrete and matter to the outcome. Visible cost: hours of labor, meditative focus. (Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5; default 3.0 + net 5.4 → 8.4, slight swappability −0.5 [another patient craft could serve] → 7.9.)</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting: "serpentine grotto in mist." Anchored in the opening sentence and sustained throughout. The mist creates the problem (swallowed sky, untethered feeling) that motivates Elara's goal. The grotto's coolness and salt air are noted; the "sliver of pale twilight" that pierces the entrance at the climax enables the glow. The final paragraph reweights the serpentine walls as protective embrace. Setup early, development through the twilight-pierce moment, and payoff in the closing image. Two beats (mist as inciting condition, twilight as catalyst). The setting constrains (no stars to watch) and supplies (twilight beam). (Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, micro-setting (grotto walls) charges final image +0.8; default 3.0 + net 4.7 → 7.7, slight coincidence in twilight arrival −0.5 [she does not summon it] → 7.2, round observed −0.5 for minimal mid-beat spatial constraint → 6.7.)</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe: "as memories resurface." The phrase appears in paragraph two ("As memories resurface in the quiet dark, she recalled her grandmother's words") and paragraph four ("Another memory bloomed"). Memories (village fire, grandmother's meteor shower, childhood star charts) are interspersed but do not tighten decisions—time is vague ("days" of mist, "hours bled into a single, focused moment"). No live clock pressures her polishing; the timeframe is contemplative accumulation rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup present, development through memory layering, but payoff does not depend on temporal pressure. (Early signal +0.4, two memory beats +0.9, no causal pressure from time −0.8, no closure urgency −0.6, ornamental use −0.5, theme support via memory +0.4; default 3.0 + net −0.2 → 2.8, lyric-mode memory work lifts +2.0 → 4.8.)</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation: "to share light without using fire." Stated in paragraph one ("She sought to share light without using fire, to create a glow as clean and constant as a distant nova") and dramatized through the polishing work and the memory of the village fire. Setup early, development through the entire polishing sequence (fire memory as seed of conviction, repetitive motions as meditation), and payoff as the cool, serene glow fulfills the desire. Two beats (fire memory reaffirms goal, glass glow achieves it). The motivation drives her sustained effort. Visible cost: hours of solitary labor, untethered isolation. Minor friction: no competing want tests her—she proceeds without ambivalence. (Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5, no internal conflict −0.5; default 3.0 + net 4.6 → 7.6.)</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone: "zephyr bloom." The exact phrase appears once in paragraph three ("a zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding"), describing the grotto's air as encouragement. The overall tone is contemplative, lyric, and patient—matching the star-watcher's meditative polishing and the "soft, tranquil glow" at closure. The tone remains stable (no jarring shifts) and modulates gently from isolation and frustration (opening mist) to serene triumph (final luminescence). However, "zephyr bloom" as a phrase does not recur or charge the final image; the ending tone is carried by "tranquil," "serene," "gentle insistence," and "protective embrace." (One mention mid-story +0.2, coherent mood throughout +0.8, closure modulation +0.6, no reprise −0.5, ornamental use −0.4, theme support +0.2; default 3.0 + net 0.9 → 3.9, lyric-mode tone allowance +2.0 → 5.9.)</comment>
