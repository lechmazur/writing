<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her progression from artist to custodian is earned through discovery and action. The physicality of her work—"Heaving water-logged timbers and rolling smaller boulders"—grounds her transformation. Minor slip: the phrase "perpetually learning" and "her understanding deepened through layered meanings" edges toward abstract summary rather than embodied realization. The climactic choice to replicate the pattern feels motivated by the slide's revelation, though the internal contradiction between panic and sudden clarity could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story employs a clear causal lens: discovery of slide → projection → pattern recognition → replication → survival. Orientation is prompt (sculptor, archway, storm) and the closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (physical labor, soaking, shivering) plus a Conceptual Repricing (world not broken, merely disconnected). The final paragraph's thematic summary ("Her life's work was no longer just about shaping wood") tilts toward tell but the prior image of her standing among driftwood "no longer just forms to be carved, but letters in a language" offers resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wave forces immediate action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it traps her during the storm, provides the projection surface, and its base becomes the canvas for her survival sculpture. Sensory detail is strong—"wind keened," "rain lashed," "sea-spray"—and filtered through her sculptor's attention to wood grain and stone. The final image charges when "driftwood scattered around her" transforms from art material to linguistic alphabet. Minor: the "sea-chest" appears conveniently without prior setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival) is signaled when the colossal wave appears and pressure escalates through the ticking-clock structure of the approaching disaster. The slide's final layer provides both information and a narrow tactical window, forcing Elara to act with "desperate sync." The resolution is earned by her agency—physical replication of the pattern—with visible cost (exhaustion, soaking). The covenant theme braids neatly with survival but remains a secondary accent. One clear reversal: panic → clarity → action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of reconnection to ancient alliances emerges through concrete images (animal hides, seal creatures, captains exchanging charts) rather than assertion. The ending's insight—"world was not broken, merely disconnected"—risks thematic statement but is anchored by the prior image of driftwood as "letters in a language she was finally beginning to read." The scaffold/simplicity motif recurs purposefully. Deduction: the final paragraph edges toward overt summary ("Her life's work was no longer just about shaping wood; it was about remembering and rebuilding a world") where a closing image would resonate more strongly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a sculptural attention to texture: "gnarled burl of cypress," "velvet-lined box." Psychic distance modulates appropriately from observation to crisis compression. Minor register slip: "timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity," and "turbine-hum reverie" feel elevated beyond the moment's urgency, particularly in the opening where they read as thematic placeholders rather than Elara's lived idiom. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. Opening phrase "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" are overwritten—abstract constructions that don't clarify or propel. The phrase "her understanding deepened through layered meanings" in paragraph three is near-paraphrase of the prior sentence's demonstration. Sentence-level propulsion is strong in the wave sequence. The final paragraph contains mild scaffold: "Her motivation had always been" explicitly restates rather than trusts prior work. Overall clarity remains high and no loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magic-lantern-as-instruction-manual premise offers a fresh angle on lost-knowledge survival stories. The fusion of art practice with ancient engineering diagram feels specific and earned. Risk: embedding a projector and slide in driftwood stretches plausibility but the story commits fully. Deduction: the archway-as-covenant and GPS-failure frame are functional but approach template post-apocalyptic reconnection beats without strong transformation. The sculptural replication as survival act is the story's most original inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices create all key turns: she retrieves the projector, interprets the slide's layers, replicates the pattern under pressure. Present throughout and drives escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The slide appears in three beats: discovery in the driftwood, projection revealing covenant layers, final layer showing the survival diagram. It enables the climactic choice and charges the ending when she reads driftwood as "letters in a language." Indispensable to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is named explicitly and the slide's imagery demonstrates it (ancient figures, ships, seal creatures), shaping Elara's realization. It pressures her understanding but the concept remains more thematic echo than tactical constraint until the final diagram. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is interpretive rather than choice-altering.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is invoked to explain why she knows how to use the hand-cranked projector ("absorbing the old ways her grandfather insisted were more resilient"). It enables one key action but the trait is told rather than demonstrated through on-page struggle or error. Functional but replaceable with "trained by grandfather."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reimagine" occurs explicitly: "Elara had to reimagine everything she thought she knew about this place." The action drives her interpretive turn from artist to custodian and sets up the replication choice. Present in setup (initial interpretation) and payoff (final understanding of driftwood as language). Could be rephrased as "reinterpret" with minimal loss, but the cognitive shift is weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is signaled early ("each piece a story") and demonstrated when the slide reveals "cascade of moments layered one upon the other." The method matters: each crank of the projector unveils another thread, guiding her final action. Present across setup (cartography in wood), middle (slide's layers), and payoff (reading driftwood as language). The mechanics shape her interpretive process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archway traps her during the storm, provides the projection surface for the slide, and its base becomes the site of the survival sculpture. It appears in every beat and its physical structure enables the wave's division. The story's logic depends on this exact micro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" is mentioned in the opening to establish a post-collapse context and justify why "these stories felt more urgent, more necessary." The timeframe does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock; the storm's immediate threat does that work. The GPS detail is contextual flavor rather than a constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is stated as her artistic drive ("attempt to scaffold complexity with simplicity by charting the coastline's new moods") and tested when she must replicate a simple pattern to counter a complex wave. The motivation shapes her interpretive lens and final action. Present in setup and payoff; the middle diagram-reading beat enacts it. Minor: the phrasing is more authorial abstraction than Elara's lived thought.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" appears in the opening line and the closing: "turbine-hum of the wind easing into a sigh." The tone modulates from meditative to urgent (storm roar) and back to quiet. It charges the frame but remains more atmospheric wrapper than pressure-shaping element. The lyric reprise reweights the opening's industrial-spiritual texture with earned calm.</comment>
