<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arthur's interiority is concrete and consistently rendered through embodied emotion ("heart a heavy, leaden thing"). His turn from offering scripture to seeking to "understand the mechanics of despair" is earned. Elias functions well as a secondary pressure source with distinct past (prisoner's defiance → craftsman's patience). Minor: Arthur's realization feels slightly over-articulated in the final paragraphs ("quiet understanding settled over Arthur, deep and resonant")—the label weakens what the image of light through clouds already dramatizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, single scene, clean orientation by the opening bell-chime. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through the clockwork heart examination and breaks into the light-through-clouds image, which reweights Arthur's understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing): Arthur moves from "master repairman of broken men" to "guide, pointing out the cracks," with cost visible in his acknowledgment that his prior methods ("scripture, prayer, absolution") could not touch Thorne's despair. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair shop is vividly rendered ("dust motes, ancient and golden") and purposefully contrasts Arthur's penitentiary world. The grimy window and storm-light actively constrain the revelation: Elias gestures toward it, the sunlight "didn't choose the clean spots," charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (Arthur at the workbench, Elias bent over the locket, both turning toward the window). The shop's particulars (brass, mahogany, felt hammers) create texture without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Arthur's search for understanding ("to turn an apology into action"). The clockwork heart introduces immediate pressure; Elias's diagnosis ("a lockbox... show them where the light can get in") narrows Arthur's options and reweights his pastoral role. The tightening is meaningful: Arthur moves from offering absolution to seeking cracks. Cost is visible in his acknowledgment of failure ("the old, useless weight of his apology") and his decision to leave the heart with Elias, foreclosing the path of mechanical repair. Agency is clear in the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of grace/forgiveness as unearned light emerges organically through the storm-cloud image and the lockbox metaphor. The ending offers a resonant answer—Arthur will "stop talking about apologies and start looking for cracks in the clouds"—without moralizing. Minor deduction: "You don't fix the cage. You just show them where the light can get in" is slightly on-the-nose, edging toward thematic statement rather than pure implication. The final image ("vibrant, hopeful hush") effectively recharges the opening's "vibrant hush," but the shift is more comfort than cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Arthur; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on his interiority, pulling back for Elias's dialogue). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("We talk a lot about what we deserve in a place like that"). Perceptual signature is consistent (Arthur notices the shop's quiet as "louder, more expectant" because he's accustomed to penitentiary noise). Minor: a few filter verbs and slightly elevated diction ("aptly deliberate grace," "profound empathy") read more as narrator assist than Arthur's lived idiom under pressure, though they remain within broad plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sensory detail is strong ("felt hammers," "molten silver"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Deductions: mild overwriting in the opening ("Dust motes, ancient and golden, danced... each one a silent story") and the closure beat ("deep and resonant as a cello's final note," "warming his weary spirit")—figurative density clusters without escalating pressure. Stock phrase "the calm before realization" appears in both the narrative and as a required timeframe element, reading slightly templated. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but the metaphor load in key beats reduces propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The clockwork-heart-as-lockbox and light-through-storm-clouds are fresh inflections on the forgiveness theme. The pairing of chaplain and ex-prisoner in a music-box shop is specific and non-obvious. Deduction: the chaplain-seeking-wisdom and prisoner-as-craftsman-sage beats are familiar redemption tropes; transformation is present but modest. The emotional arc (guilt → peace) follows a recognizable template, though the particulars (Thorne's suicide, the device itself) add texture. Solid synthesis, not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arthur is on the page throughout; his choice to bring the heart for "a second opinion" initiates the scene, his question-and-response dialogue with Elias drives the middle, and his decision to "keep it" (leave it with Elias) and shift his pastoral approach shapes the ending. Two beats (arrival/request, final choice) plus continuous presence. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clockwork heart appears in three beats: unwrapping on the workbench, Elias's examination and diagnosis ("a lockbox"), and Arthur's final instruction ("make it play a new song"). It is the physical anchor of the central conflict and Elias's metaphor reweights its meaning from soul-replacement to cage. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present. Not quite indispensable—dialogue alone could carry the theme—but very strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Second opinion" is explicitly stated ("I came for a second opinion") and frames Arthur's visit. It shapes the tactic (seeking Elias's craftsman insight rather than offering his own pastoral answer) and the ending pivots on accepting that opinion. Setup and payoff present; middle development is implicit in the dialogue exchange. Solid causal role in one major beat, but swappable with "seeking help" or "asking for insight" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" is shown in Arthur's movement ("moved with an aptly deliberate grace") and echoed in his measured dialogue and final decision. The trait constrains his opening approach (careful unwrapping, patient waiting for Elias to look up) and enables his receptiveness to Elias's metaphor. Label-only mention in the opening slightly weakens it; the trait is more decorative than causally active. Present in two beats (entrance, ending tone), modest cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Deserve" is central: Thorne "didn't deserve a soul," Arthur reflects on what "we deserve," Elias critiques the idea that "forgiveness is something we have to earn," and Arthur's shift hinges on abandoning the deserve/repair framework. The concept drives the diagnosis beat and redefines Arthur's pastoral stance at closure. Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure linkage clear. Not fully indispensable—"worthiness" could substitute—but tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storm-cloud/light image is seeded early (storm "having just broken"), demonstrated mid-scene (Elias gestures to the window, describes how he "finally understood it"), and charges Arthur's final resolve ("start looking for cracks in the clouds"). The mechanics matter: light "didn't choose the clean spots... just broke through," supplying the metaphor that shifts Arthur's method. Early signal, causal enabler, closure reprise with reweighted meaning. Strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The repair shop frames the visit and supplies the craft metaphor ("dissected carcass," "felt hammers," "tiny screwdriver"). The grimy window provides the storm-light view that enables the key image. The setting constrains choice (Arthur must come here for Elias's insight) and the ending's "vibrant, hopeful hush" reprises the opening. Two beats (arrival, window moment), modest causal pressure. Could be any contemplative trade space, but the music-box specificity adds resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"The calm before realization" is named in the narrative ("He was in the calm before realization") and tracks Arthur's emotional state from doubt to "quiet understanding." The timeframe is more atmospheric than mechanical—no live clock tightens decisions. It appears in setup and payoff (the realization lands), but does not constrain tactics in the middle. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake without mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation "to turn an apology into action" is stated and dramatized: he brings the heart (action), seeks understanding rather than offering platitudes, and commits to a new pastoral method ("stop talking about apologies and start looking for cracks"). The motivation conflicts with his prior reliance on "scripture, prayer, absolution" and costs him his former certainty. Three beats, clear friction, closure linkage. Minor: the phrase itself is slightly abstract; the on-page moves earn it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" is named twice (opening: "vibrant hush of the antique music box repair shop"; closing: "vibrant, hopeful hush") and modulates with pressure—quiet expectancy becomes hopeful resolution. The tone coheres through Elias's soft-voiced wisdom and Arthur's internal restraint, intensifying at the light-through-clouds beat. The reprise charges the final image by adding "hopeful." Present in opening and ending, modest causal role, purposeful modulation.</comment>
