<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is densely rendered with contradictory impulses ("furiously tranquil," "screaming hurricane" vs. "statue of calm"), and the vigil-to-action shift is motivated. However, the core motivation—understanding scars—remains largely abstract until the final beat, when the key suddenly reframes the vigil as preparation rather than contemplation. The embodied trembling at the end ("hands that were finally, honestly trembling") earns the turn, but the bulk of the middle is reflective mapping without micro-choices that alter present options, pushing against the BRR ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the sealed envelope's contents (key + negative) trigger a Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts the vigil from passive understanding to active journey ("His vigil in pause was over"). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—storm imagery, darkroom metaphors, and rarefaction language build to a cadence shift when the timer pings and the mask dissolves. Cost is conceptual (he must "develop" the scars, face them) and legible in the final image of the distant city light as promise and threat. One meaningful deepening occurs; no causality breaks. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered and pressures the protagonist's state throughout: the trapped lightning echoes his inner storm, the dead telescope mirrors his silenced voice, and the clouds' parting at the end opens a spatial path that charges the closure. The darkroom timer, bus timetable, and telescope control panel function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is strong (light, thunder, metal echoes), filtered through Elias's poet's eye, and the setting's particulars (mildewed periodicals, iron catwalk, alcove) are integrated into action rather than cataloged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The timer's one-hour countdown creates a visible time constraint, and the ticking rhythm tightens attention until the ping announces the mask's dissolution. The envelope's contents then narrow options: Elias must choose between remaining on the mountain or beginning the journey. The final image (city light through clouds) charges the trade-off between solitude and confrontation. One meaningful deepening; cost is felt in the shift from "furiously tranquil" to honest trembling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the darkroom metaphor: understanding scars is not enough; they must be developed, brought into light. The vigil-as-darkroom reframes passivity as preparation, and the negative's ghostly face literalizes the unprocessed past. The final image (city light as promise) offers a non-literal answer—truth requires not just mapping but facing with all its terror—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sealed envelope (a decade's silence broken), the photographer's ghost, and the obsolete timetable as both hiding place and escape route. The storm-kissed wonder modulates to fury and then to honest trembling, avoiding tidy emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is elevated and metaphor-dense ("skull holding a single, stormlit thought," "cartography of scars," "rarefy the past"), creating a distinct poet's register. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the metaphoric density occasionally tips into overwriting: "vigil in pause," "storm-kissed wonder," and "rarefied" recur without always advancing pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The final beat's shift to plain embodiment ("hands that were finally, honestly trembling") contrasts effectively with the ornate earlier voice, marking the mask's dissolution. One filter-verb stack ("felt a kinship," "felt louder") in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several phrases approach overwriting: "skull holding a single, stormlit thought" (opening), "cartography of scars" (repeated), "rarefy the past" (used twice), and "storm-kissed wonder" cluster metaphors without always serving propulsion. The paraphrase loop "His vigil was not for a person, but for a moment of clarity; he had come here to understand…" restates intent across two sentences. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("He remembered… They had called… He had only…") flattens rhythm. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Information density is high elsewhere, but the overwriting in the first half triggers the patterned-artifact penalty (−0.6) and disallows 9+ globally per the tight pack rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The darkroom-as-vigil conceit is purposeful and transforms the familiar "artist seeking redemption" template through the photographer's timer, the undeveloped negative, and the rarefaction language. The storm-above-clouds observatory setting is vivid but not wholly fresh. The sealed-envelope dead drop and bus timetable are specific enough to feel non-generic. However, the core arc—solitary reflection → artifact revelation → decision to act—follows a recognizable structure. The negative-lit-by-lightning beat is the story's most original image, merging past and present through literal and metaphoric exposure. Emotional specificity in "furiously tranquil" and the trembling hands elevates the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The censored poet identity frames expectation early ("only page left to him"), pressures the middle reflection (poems as "corrosive" vs. "honest"), and the final decision to unlock the telescope and follow the timetable is a poet's choice to transform silence into action. The trait enables the metaphor-dense voice and the rarefaction impulse. The vigil is poet-specific (understanding through language, "arrange them… capture a truth so sharp it drew blood"). Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure; drives two beats (reflection on censored work, decision to develop scars). Causal pressure moderate; cost visible in trembling hands and the terrifying journey ahead. Swappability low (a painter or musician would alter the rarefaction and cartography language). Late signal slightly lowers score; profession is named but profession-specific tactics (how a poet would uniquely solve this) are underdeveloped in the action layer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer is introduced early (paragraph 3), wound to sixty minutes, its ticking structures the middle vigil, and the ping announces the ending turn ("the mask was gone"). It belonged to the photographer whose ghost is the "rawest of his scars," charging it with relational cost. Used in three beats: winding, ticking rhythm during reflection, and the final ping. The timer's mechanics (sixty-minute dial, needle crawl, decisive click) matter; it measures "the hour when masks slip" and enables the closure shift from tranquility to fury. Causal pressure strong; specificity high (a darkroom timer, not a generic clock, ties to the photographer and the development metaphor). Closure linkage direct. Irreplaceable; removing it would flatten the timeframe constraint and the darkroom-as-vigil conceit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vigil in pause is named explicitly ("conduct his vigil in pause," "His vigil in pause was over") and structures the dominant stake: Elias seeks clarity before action. The concept shapes tactics—he winds the timer, reflects on scars, waits for the mask to slip—and the ending reframes the vigil as a darkroom (preparation, not stasis). Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure line. Drives one key turn (vigil → journey). However, "pause" as a distinct constraint is more thematic than tactical; the vigil could function identically without the "pause" modifier. Causal pressure moderate; cost visible in the shift from tranquility to trembling. Swappability moderate (a "vigil of preparation" or "vigil of reckoning" would work with minor edits). The concept charges the final image but does not uniquely narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is introduced early ("a state he had perfected"), embodied in "inner world a screaming hurricane, his body a statue of calm," and dissolved at the timer's ping ("no more tranquility, only the fury"). The trait enables the middle vigil's reflective stillness and constrains the ending choice (he could not act until the mask slipped). Present in setup, middle embodiment, and closure negation. Drives one beat (mask dissolution). Causal pressure moderate; the trait allows reflection but does not uniquely shape tactics—other emotional states (numb resolve, forced patience) could serve similarly. Swappability moderate. Cost visible in the trembling hands. The attribute is well-integrated but not indispensable; the story's logic would hold with a different emotional baseline.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears twice: "rarefy the past, to boil away the fury and shame until only the essential truth remained" (paragraph 2) and "attempting to rarefy a decade of pain into a single, manageable shape" (paragraph 4). The action names the vigil's method and drives the middle reflection. At closure, the rarefied insight is that scars cannot be mapped as static—they must be developed. The action is poet-specific (distillation, essence) and thematically apt. Present in setup and middle; closure reframes it (rarefaction alone is insufficient). Drives one key turn (understanding → development). Causal pressure moderate; cost felt in the realization's terror. However, the action is more method than plot driver—easily swappable with "distill," "clarify," or "refine" without structural change. Specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable is introduced in paragraph 2 ("a whisper passed through the white noise of forgotten things") but not opened until paragraph 6. The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter: the timetable is obsolete, the envelope is crisp and alien, and the hiding place is a dead drop. The envelope's contents (key + negative) enable the closure turn. Present in setup and closure. Drives one beat (revelation). However, the method does not shape middle attempts—Elias waits for the timer, then opens the envelope. No middle development; the envelope is passive cargo until the ending. Causal pressure low in the middle; strong at closure. Swappability moderate (any hidden artifact could serve similarly). Introduced early but dormant until the final third; closure linkage strong but middle absence caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is introduced in the opening line and pressures every beat: the trapped lightning mirrors Elias's inner storm, the dead telescope reflects his silenced voice, the iron catwalk and alcove enable discovery, and the clouds' parting at the end opens the path to the city. The setting is poet-specific (a high solitude, "the only page left to him") and the storm's wildness offers "storm-kissed wonder that temporarily soothed." Present in setup, middle reflection (telescope, periodicals, catwalk), and closure (clouds part, city light). Drives three beats (discovery, reflection, escape route). The observatory's height and isolation constrain options (he is removed from society) and the telescope control panel—locked—becomes the first step in the journey. Causal pressure high; specificity high (stormlit, above clouds, dormant telescope). Irreplaceable; the setting's particulars charge the closure image and enable the darkroom/scars metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "when masks slip" is embodied in the darkroom timer's sixty-minute countdown. The timer is wound in paragraph 3 ("the hour when masks slip"), its ticking structures the middle vigil, and the ping announces the mask's dissolution ("The mask was gone"). Time tightens decisions: Elias has one hour to prepare, the needle crawls, and the final ping is "louder and more final than any thunder." Present in setup, middle (ticking rhythm), and closure (ping and mask drop). Drives two beats (preparation, dissolution). The timeframe's mechanics matter and are tracked on the page. Causal pressure high; the hour constrains reflection and enables the fury's release. Cost visible in the shift from tranquility to trembling. Swappability low (a generic deadline would lack the "mask slip" resonance). The timeframe is indispensable to the vigil's structure and the closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to understand the cartography of scars is introduced early ("come here to understand the cartography of scars, both his and those he had inadvertently carved") and structures the dominant stake. It drives the middle reflection (memories of censored poems, "the people who had believed his honesty and paid the price") and is reframed at closure: understanding alone is insufficient; scars must be developed, faced. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Drives two beats (reflection, realization). Causal pressure moderate; the desire justifies the vigil but does not uniquely narrow tactics—other motives (penance, escape) could serve similarly. Cost visible in the terrifying journey ahead. Swappability moderate ("understand his guilt" or "map his past" would work with minor edits). The motivation is thematically strong but its friction with wants and costs is more told than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Storm-kissed wonder appears explicitly in paragraph 4 ("felt a kinship with its wildness, a storm-kissed wonder that temporarily soothed the acid of his memories") and is embodied in the opening's stormlit imagery and the vigil's "furiously tranquil" state. The tone modulates: opening wonder → middle rarefaction → ending fury and trembling. The storm's violence and beauty mirror Elias's inner state and the tone charges the final image (storm receding, city light as promise). Present in setup, middle embodiment, and closure modulation. Drives two beats (reflection, tonal shift at timer's ping). The tone is coherent through turns and purposefully shifts under pressure. However, "storm-kissed wonder" is named once and otherwise conveyed through setting description rather than distinct tonal texture in syntax or rhythm. Swappability moderate (other tones—"tempest-struck awe" or "lightning-edged clarity"—could serve). The tone supports but does not uniquely charge the final image.</comment>
