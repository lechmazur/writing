<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through repeated acts of trawling and observation. Her interior contradiction—using others' catastrophe as her classroom, the selfish method framed as volunteering—creates genuine complexity. The parasol tip functions as a small, hard truth that charges the fold-in-patience moment without overt symbolism. Minor deduction: the "changed one Tuesday morning" remains abstract; a micro-choice reflecting that change would sharpen interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern taught early (trawling = learning endings), culminating in the ice-calving sound that reweights the dominant stake with visible cost (the calm that settles, her work done). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): comprehension achieved, the final image crystallizes her stance with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening—sound as answer—suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains her method (debris field supplies the textbook) and charges the final image (ice calving provides the sound she sought). Sensory hierarchy filters through her purpose: salt, diesel, splintered wood, tidal surge residue. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is clean: pier, debris piles, ice edge. The "immense, unhurried separation" sound shapes the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: learn the sound of approaching endings before her own clinic appointment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ice-calving sound provides the answer, narrowing her options (her work here is done) and foreclosing the search with visible cost (the profound calm that replaces the taut wire of impatience). Agency is attention that discovers and reweights meaning. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as cadence shift and density break at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: endings as dignified severance, not violence. The parasol tip (a relic of beginnings) juxtaposed with debris (clipped sentences of interrupted lives) and the ice's "deep, resonant sigh of release" creates layered meaning without statement. The fold-in-patience concept shapes the middle beat with cost. The final image—wind as affirmation, calm vast as ice—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what does an ending sound like?) without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "clipped-off sentences," reality as water in palms, patience as old fabric with folds. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control peaks in the closure beat: "low groan…prolonged, sighing crackle…thousand crystalline heartbeats slowing." Diction matches her educated, contemplative stance throughout. The "windborne solace" phrase and "grips reality loosely" metaphor sustain voice under pressure without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stake. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative ("That was it. That was the sound.") punctuates longer lyric passages. Minor deduction: "a presence that scoured the coastline and carried with it a peculiar kind of peace" and "windborne solace that promised nothing but erasure" restate the same content in adjacent beats (paraphrase loop, −0.2). The ice-calving description ("immense, unhurried separation…sighing crackle") is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourist learning endings through disaster relief at a drift-ice marina—feels specific and non-obvious. The parasol tip (beginning relic) amid debris (interrupted endings) is a fresh inflection. Risk: choosing the sound of ice calving rather than human grief as the answer feels earned and heightens thematic stakes. Minor deduction: the "waking up changed one Tuesday morning" frame remains template-adjacent (sudden alienation trigger); more lived detail would sharpen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist is setup early (paragraph one: "ticket booked to a quiet clinic"), shapes middle choices (her method is to trawl through endings), and charges the closure ("her work here was done" after learning the sound, implying she can now proceed). Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. The element is irreplaceable: removing it collapses the stakes and the asymmetry (she uses their loss as her textbook). Cost is visible: the selfishness acknowledged on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in paragraph three (setup gate met), returns in paragraph four during the fold-in-patience beat (middle development: "holding the parasol tip…created one such fold"), and is held in her palm during the closure beat (ending gate met). Lyric reprise structure reweights meaning (beginning relic / endings / final calm). The object constrains one choice (the fold moment) and charges the final image ("silver parasol tip cold in her palm"). Swappability moderate: another small heirloom could serve with edits, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fold in patience is setup (paragraph four: "a fold in patience would appear without warning"), directly shapes a middle beat with cost ("holding the parasol tip…created one such fold…threatened to tear"), and the resolution (calm settles) is the fold's payoff. The concept constrains her emotional state and alters tactics (she continues methodically despite the taut wire). Present in all three gates with causal pressure. Irreplaceability high: removing "fold" collapses the textured portrayal of her waiting and the peak tension beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Grips reality loosely is setup (paragraph two: "grips reality loosely, like holding water in her palms"), enables the middle perceptual filter (debris as clipped sentences, marina as reflection of her mind), and charges the closure (the "profound calm" contrasts the loose grip, implying a tightening or acceptance). The trait constrains her worldview throughout and shapes her receptivity to the ice-calving sound. Cost is conceptual: the loose grip is both her vulnerability and her method. Swappability moderate: "alienation" or "dissociation" could replace with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Trawl is setup early (title beat: "trawl through the final moments"), recurs in action (paragraph two: sorted debris; paragraph five: "continued to trawl"), and directly enables the closure (being present at the ice edge to hear the sound). The action is irreplaceable: it's her method, her classroom, and the causal engine. Removing it breaks the plot and stakes. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost visible: using others' catastrophe selfishly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is setup (paragraph one: "registered with the recovery effort…bright orange vest"), shapes middle method (trawling debris, other volunteers give her wide berth), and is causally necessary for her presence at the ice edge during the calving. The means is signaled early and constrains her access. Removing it requires rewriting the entire framing. Present in all three gates with causal pressure. Cost visible: she's "masquerading as a saint," using their loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is setup (title beat and paragraph one anchor), supplies resources (debris field, fractured pier, ice sheet) that shape her method throughout, and delivers the closure sound (ice calving from the sheet). The setting constrains every choice and charges the final image (vast ice, tide, wind). Removing it collapses the plot and stakes. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceability high: no other disaster setting could supply the ice-calving sound.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is setup (paragraph one: "since waking up changed one Tuesday morning"), frames the present motivation (the clinic ticket is future, this is the interim search), but does not constrain middle tactics or tighten the closure beat. The element is present in setup and thematically relevant but lacks mid-scene pressure or a visible clock. Two of three gates met (setup, weak thematic payoff). Cost is implied but not on-page. Lyric reprise structure earns mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is setup (paragraph one: "learn the sound of approaching endings"), drives every middle beat (trawling as method, the fold in patience as friction, listening), and the closure delivers it ("That was the sound"). The desire is dramatized with cost (selfishness, using others' loss, the taut wire of impatience). Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceability high: removing this collapses the dominant stake and the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Windborne solace is setup (paragraph three: "wind…carried with it a peculiar kind of peace…windborne solace that promised nothing but erasure"), modulates with pressure (paragraph four: wind as constant companion; final beat: "wind picked up…felt less like an assault and more like an affirmation"), and charges the final image (tone shift confirms her comprehension). Tone is coherent through turns and reweights the stake at closure. Present in all three gates with closure linkage and specificity.</comment>
