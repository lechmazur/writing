<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness shapes her artistic stance credibly—she reads anxieties and postures rather than features—but the final act (pressing the stone) is given rather than chosen, reducing agency at closure. Interior texture is strong through fingertip work and sensory bias; the embodied connection to pigments and touch reads character-particular. Motivation remains consistent, though the dying master's whisper diminishes her ownership of the goal. No internal contradiction or competing impulse surfaces to deepen the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: the sky blooms within walls about to fall, crystallizing the guild's ambition with an undeniable bittersweet cost (sanctuary achieved, destruction imminent). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern (fractal), sensory density (light veins), and cadence shift (from silence to cerulean bloom) reweight the stake. Orientation anchors promptly (Elara, tree trunk library, condemned building). One tightening: the lock mechanism narrows options, then the heartwood placement completes the task. Cost is felt in the juxtaposition of cosmos and collapse, though it is opportunity rather than decision cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The petrified oak library is vivid and purposeful: circular room, oldest rings converging at the knot, shelves as spatial anchors. The heartwood knot constrains the final action—Elara must press the stone there—and the wood's fractal grain charges the closure image by channeling the sky-light. Sensory detail (dust motes, dry rot, vibrating floor) reflects urgency and filters through Elara's bias. The micro-setting (coin, obsidian stone, vellum slip) functions as object-as-setting, driving the sequence. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirror the sky inside walls) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the lock mechanism delays resolution while the building groans, narrowing time. Agency is present in the fingertip decoding and placement, but the whispered duty reduces ownership. The final act (pressing stone to heartwood) reweights the ambition with visible cost—sanctuary achieved as destruction looms—but the stone's appearance is a given, not a trade-off Elara wrestles. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through sensory and temporal density rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme ("discovering limits is not about defeating them, but finding the beauty within their boundaries") emerges from concrete particulars: Elara's face-blindness as strength, the fractal pattern on finite coin, the infinite sky held within walls about to fall. The final image (cosmos in condemned wood) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. No thematic echo contaminates the ending. The obsidian stone and heartwood knot embody the paradox of boundless wonder in finite space, charging the closure with undeniable conceptual cost. One phrase—"discovering limits was not about defeating them"—borders on articulation but remains anchored in Elara's enacted choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited close on Elara holds steady; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: fingertips sensitive from pigments, faceless dark as familiar refuge, focus on pattern over profile. Diction matches her artistic lens ("texture of their hopes," "fractal geography"). Filter verbs ("letting the world fall away") appear but feel voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the lock work and heartwood press. A few phrases ("a lifetime of mixing pigments and tracing sorrow") edge toward exposition but anchor in present action. Rhythmic control under pressure is clean, with short clauses tightening as machinery returns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (sensory anchoring + temporal pressure + character bias). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and the final image is vivid without overwriting. Minor loop: "the chaos of history scored into its metal" and "a scratch from being dropped in a forgotten market, a tiny pit from a chemist's acid" both describe the coin's marks, though the second adds specificity. A few elevated constructions ("cerulean light bled," "fractally precise veins") work for the moment but cluster near closure, risking density. One template stem repeats ("a way to trap," "a map of infinity") without cost. No significant artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis (face-blind artist + fractal lock + mirroring sky within condemned space) is specific and non-obvious. The fractal motif (coin indentations, wood grain, sky veins) unifies sensory and thematic layers credibly. Risk-taking is present in the quiet, lyric ending and the passive gift (obsidian stone), though the latter reduces protagonist-driven ingenuity. The condemned-building frame and scholar's guild lore carry some template echoes (lost knowledge, final task) but gain freshness through embodied detail (fingertip reading, heartwood knot). Transformation is solid; swapping names would require reimagining the core constraint (face-blindness as strength).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness frames her artistic stance and enables the fingertip decoding of the coin (Setup, Development). Her choice to press the stone completes the arc (Payoff). The trait constrains her method (touch over sight) and charges the thematic answer (limits as strength). Two beats: coin decoding, heartwood placement. Causal pressure is moderate; the stone's arrival is given, not earned through a trade-off her blindness forced. Cost is conceptual (sanctuary in collapse) rather than tied to a specific price her condition imposed. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; removing face-blindness would require rewriting the decoding method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The book safe appears early (Setup), holds the final key, and its lock mechanism drives the middle beat (Development). Its opening reveals the obsidian stone that shapes the ending (Payoff). Two distinct beats: lock work, contents revealed. Causal pressure: the safe's esoteric lock delays resolution and forces Elara's touch-based method. Closure linkage is strong—without it, the stone does not enter play. Swappability is low; the bark-bound safe fits the petrified-tree setting and the guild's archival tradition. Visible cost is indirect (time pressure while locked), not a trade-off imposed by the safe itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is signaled early ("the limit of her time was closing in"), stated explicitly mid-story, and dramatized in the fractal pattern (infinity on finite coin) and final image (cosmos in walls about to fall). Setup, Development (fractal decoding), Payoff (sky contained). The concept shapes stakes (achieve boundless wonder before demolition) and the thematic answer. One explicit articulation ("discovering limits was not about defeating them") reduces subtlety. Causal pressure: the concept motivates the task but does not force a mid-story tactical choice with visible cost. Closure linkage is strong; the final image embodies the concept undeniably.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears in the coin's pattern description (Setup), drives the lock mechanism's decoding (Development), and reappears in the sky-light veins on the wood (Payoff). Three beats: coin inspection, lock transcription, light spread. Causal pressure: the fractal property enables Elara's translation method and charges the closure image with pattern continuity. Specificity is high; "fractal" is not ornamental—it defines the map's structure and the sky's appearance. Closure linkage is undeniable. One friction: the term is used twice in quick succession ("fractally precise" pattern, "fractally precise" veins), risking label repetition, but the second instance charges the ending visually.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Craft" shapes the story: Elara's fingertip map-making from the coin (Setup, Development) and the final crafting of the sky via stone placement (Payoff). Two major beats: lock decoding, heartwood press. Causal linkage: her craft method (touch-based translation) is the only way to open the safe, and the final sky is described as "her creation." Swappability is low; removing "craft" would require a found or mechanical solution. Visible cost is indirect (time spent decoding while machinery threatens). The final sky is a craft product, but the obsidian stone's role blurs agency—Elara places it, yet the stone's mechanism does the work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method (reading faint indentations on the coin) is signaled early, explained in detail, and executed on the page (Setup, Development, Payoff). Two beats: coin inspection, lock transcription. Causal pressure is strong—the method is the only way to open the safe, and its mechanics (scratch, pit, gouge forming a fractal map) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure linkage: without this method, the stone never enters play. Visible cost: time elapsed under threat. One friction: the method is told more than shown—Elara's fingers move, but we do not see a failed attempt or adjustment that would demonstrate mastery with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is present throughout (Setup, Development, Payoff): Elara stands within it, the shelves and circular room anchor spatial choreography, and the heartwood knot at the center is the final target. Three beats: initial anchoring, lock work at the central shelf, stone placement at the heartwood. Causal pressure: the setting supplies the resource (heartwood knot) that completes the task. Closure linkage is decisive—the sky blooms through the wood's grain, and the setting's imminent demolition charges the final image with bittersweet cost. Irreplaceability is high; the petrified oak's rings and knot are narratively essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (hush before demolition) is signaled in the opening, tracked through groans and machinery tremors, and shapes the final image (cosmos held "within walls about to fall"). Setup, Development (machinery returns as Elara decodes), Payoff (building's final protest). Two beats: initial hush, machinery resuming. Causal pressure: the clock tightens Elara's choices, forcing her to work quickly. Closure linkage: the imminent collapse charges the sky-light with urgency and poignancy. Visible cost: limited time to complete the task. One friction: the exact countdown is vague—no specific duration or second-by-second tracking—so the pressure is felt but not minutely calibrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is stated early as the guild's ultimate ambition and Elara's final task (Setup). It drives her sequence (unlock safe, find means, complete mirroring) and is fulfilled in the ending (Payoff). Development is present but passive—Elara follows the whispered duty rather than wrestling with conflicting desires. Causal pressure: the motivation shapes all her moves. Closure linkage is undeniable—the sky blooms on the page. Friction between wants and costs is limited; Elara never doubts the goal or faces a trade-off that tests commitment. The motivation is told by the dying master, reducing Elara's ownership. Cost is conceptual (sanctuary vs. destruction) rather than a personal sacrifice the motivation forced her to weigh.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" opens the story ("silence was a physical weight"), modulates through the machinery's return ("building groaned its final protest"), and charges the closure ("here, inside the heart of the tree, there was only a heightened stillness, a perfect and unending cosmos"). Setup, Development (stillness breaks, returns), Payoff (final stillness). The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the Accumulative lens by layering quiet against threat. Closure linkage is strong—the final phrase reprises "heightened stillness" explicitly, binding the ending to the opening. Modulation under pressure is credible: stillness deepens as the sky blooms, contrasting the external destruction. Specificity is high; the tone is not generic calm but a charged, bittersweet hush that reweights the miracle's cost.</comment>
