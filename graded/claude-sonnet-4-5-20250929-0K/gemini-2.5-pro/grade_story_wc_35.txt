<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is concrete and drives his final choice to subsume the pavilion's grief. His emotionally contagious touch is embodied through the Warlord's "grinding stones" sensation and the fossil's flood of sorrows, creating genuine constraint. The climactic act of becoming a conduit is earned by prior suffering, though the shift from passive taster to active subsuming agent could be more causally seeded. Minor: the Warlord's worry at the gate feels slightly unearned given his earlier characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: fossil → memory-map → pavilion discovery → subsumption → peace. Orientation anchors quickly (chef, fortress courtyard, post-rain). The closure is a clear Decisive Change—Kaelen's touch no longer transmits grief, signaling his internal transformation—with visible cost (he is "scoured clean," "terrifyingly smooth"). One friction: the mechanism by which tasting the fossil reveals a location feels slightly convenient, though the prior puddle-analysis ritual seeds the pattern-reading skill.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly rendered ("wet stone and bruised creosote"), and the coral pavilion's "impossible, unmelting ice" provides tactile constraint when Kaelen digs and enters. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered throughout. The pavilion's physical dissolution mirrors the emotional release, charging the closure image. Minor gap: the fortress kitchens receive only one line, reducing the tangibility of Kaelen's daily world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping the daily anvil of others' grief—is clear and tightens when the pavilion's "collective sorrow" threatens to "pulverize his bones." Kaelen's choice to subsume rather than flee is agency-driven and narrows his options (he becomes "terrifyingly smooth," losing the brittle parts). The Warlord's arrival and Kaelen's touch test the transformation with visible proof. One gap: the leap from tasting one fossil to deciding to excavate and enter the pavilion could show more hesitation or trade-off in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of Processing others' pain and the paradox that accepting all grief leaves one "impossibly, terrifyingly smooth"—invulnerable but also emptied. The fossil as "key" and the pavilion as archive literalize stored remorse without stating a moral. The final image—touch without echoes—offers a resonant answer to whether peace requires self-erasure. The "unspoken dream" frame and "waking peace" close the thematic loop with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance tightens under pressure ("He didn't fight them or hoard them; he became a conduit"). Diction is consistently elevated and particular ("shovel scraping rock," "peeled back the sand like a scab"). The Warlord's single line of dialogue is spare and functional. Minor register drift: "emotionally contagious touch was the anvil upon which his own soul was hammered" reads slightly expository mid-crisis, though it clarifies the core constraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("desert's long history," "blizzard of grief"). Sentence rhythm varies and propels. Two frictions: "the brittle parts of him finally gone" after "terrifyingly smooth" is near-paraphrase; "the collective sorrow was a physical pressure" leans abstract where embodied sensation would sharpen. The pavilion's dissolution sequence is vivid and kinetic. No loops or template cadence in peak beats, though some metaphors cluster heavily in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of chef-as-grief-eater, fossil memory key, and icebound coral beneath dunes is specific and non-obvious. The puddle-analysis ritual seeds the pattern-reading skill freshly. Risk: the pavilion's existence and Kaelen's absorption power are not fully constrained by prior rules, lending a slight fairy-tale convenience. The transformation of "tasting" into "subsuming" is thematically apt but borders on late rule expansion. Still, the synthesis of tactile empathy and archaeological memory feels original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's chef identity and memory-tasting ability drive the fossil scene (beat 2) and the pavilion subsumption (climax). The trait enables the memory-map and the final conduit act. Early signal in paragraph 1; causal pressure across three beats; closure depends on his unique gift. High integration, though "chef" as occupation is more label than enacted skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion is absent until the second half but becomes the story's spatial and thematic anchor. Kaelen's excavation, entry, and subsumption of its stored remorse are the climax; its dissolution shapes the final image. The impossible ice and bone-white coral provide tactile constraint. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; the late arrival is the only friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Stored remorse" is the premise: the Warlord's grief, the fossil's legion of sorrows, and the pavilion's motes all literalize it. The concept shapes Kaelen's motivation and the climax (subsume or be crushed). Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives escalation and closure. Specificity is high—remorse as tangible weight and light. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious touch is established early ("grinding stones," "grief flooded him") and creates ongoing cost. It enables the fossil tasting and explains Kaelen's daily suffering, motivating his quest. The trait constrains his interaction with the Warlord in the final beat (now absent). Present across three beats with visible cost, though the mechanics are more asserted than dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" is the climax: Kaelen opens his senses, pulls in the motes, and processes millennia of grief. The act is unique, irreplaceable, and redefines his state (from brittle to smooth). Setup via tasting; middle escalation via the pavilion's pressure; payoff in the dissolution and his transformed touch. Strong causal linkage and closure necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations is introduced early as his "sacred work" and reappears when the fossil's taste becomes "a map" connecting sediment patterns to the pavilion's location. The method enables the discovery but is more evoked than enacted—we don't see him read the puddles in real time. Present in setup and middle; shapes one key turn. Functional but somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain provides the puddles, the scoured dunes, and the excavation site. The post-storm environment enables discovery (wind peels back sand) and grounds the sensory texture. The fortress gate frames the opening and closing. Setting constrains movement and supplies resources; contributes to closure atmosphere. Solid integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" frames the opening and closing ("his unspoken dream…was over, but a waking peace…had just begun"). The temporal marker is more lyric than literal—a psychological threshold rather than a ticking clock. It charges the final image but doesn't constrain tactics. Early and late reprise with thematic weight; mid-band for symbolic rather than functional time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to sandpaper rough memories…until their edges were too smooth to cut" is concrete, stated early, and drives every choice: retreating to taste the fossil, seeking the pavilion, subsuming the grief. The final smoothness is both fulfillment and cost ("terrifyingly smooth"). Present in setup, escalation, and closure with visible trade-off. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" operates throughout: Kaelen's daily fragility under others' grief, the pavilion's delicate lattice that threatens to crush, and his final "sturdy" peace after "the brittle parts…finally gone." Tone modulates from oppressive (grinding stones) to catastrophic (pulverize) to quiet release. The adjectives anchor the opening and closing images, reweighting the stake. Strong thematic coherence and closure charge.</comment>
