<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—his belief in whispers over shouts drives the central action. The interiority shows embodied emotion ("a screaming tenderness that had no voice") and micro-choices under pressure (pressing the cork to the lens, closing his eyes). Internal contradiction is present but could be stronger; the conviction feels too settled for the high stakes. The captain's backstory fragment anchors well and tilts the present, but Elias's final silence reads as modest rather than genuinely conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (Elias, lighthouse lantern room, predawn). The drive lens is Situational—Elias's stance crystallizes through his focused beckoning, and the Stellaria's approach validates his method with felt cost (his exhaustion, the risk taken). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the captain's testimony and Elias's silent acknowledgment reweight the whisper-versus-shout premise with undeniable pressure. One minor slip: the mechanism (lens as "filter for the heart") is told rather than tested on the page before the climax, slightly weakening causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and predawn setting are vividly established with purposeful sensory detail ("world outside a predawn bruise of purple and indigo"). The vial cork functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The fog's vanishing at the end is asserted rather than shown through environmental cues, and the timeframe (dawn breaking) could more actively pressure the action rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Elias's silent beckoning versus Hemlock's failed foghorn blasts. The Stellaria's appearance is a clear reversal driven by protagonist agency. The cost is legible (Elias's focused silence, "minutes stretched into an eternity," the physical and emotional toll of channeling intent). One persistent constraint (the dead radio, the fog) shapes tactics effectively. The escalation is clean under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the whisper-versus-shout premise without heavy-handed moralizing. The vial cork returns with reweighted meaning, and the captain's testimony offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The ending avoids a stated moral, instead letting the image (Elias slipping the cork back, the fog burned away) carry thematic weight. Minor slip: "quiet, unstoppable force of a whisper" in the final line edges toward thematic echo, though it's anchored in prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias with clean distance control. Perceptual signature is strong ("He believed in smaller things," focus on scent and memory). The captain's dialogue feels natural and advances plot, with distinct idiom. Minor issues: "a sound of profound relief" tells rather than shows, and "a screaming tenderness" mixes registers slightly (the phrase works thematically but feels author-voiced rather than character-filtered). No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and information density is high. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor overwriting: "a fragrance that was less a smell and more a memory of safety" stacks modifiers, and "the frantic, hopeful beating of his own heart" is slightly stock. One paraphrase loop: "It was anger, not guidance" follows immediately after the foghorn description without added pressure. No major artifacts, but density could tighten in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse lens as emotional amplifier) is fresh, and the scent-as-beacon method is specific. The whisper-versus-shout conflict transforms a familiar quietude-versus-force trope through the vial cork and lens mechanics. Risk-taking is moderate; the stakes could press harder (the Stellaria's danger is told more than felt). The final image feels earned but not fully inevitable—removing the lens-as-filter backstory would weaken but not break the arc, suggesting the synthesis is solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (assistant keeper) drives the key turn: his decision to use the lens and cork instead of the foghorn. He appears in setup, middle (the beckoning action), and closure (slipping the cork back, looking at the sunrise). His choice narrows options (rejecting Hemlock's method) and the cost is visible (his exhaustion, the risk taken). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: introduced with backstory in the setup, pressed to the lens during the beckoning, and slipped back into Elias's pocket at closure. It constrains the method (scent as beacon) and charges the final image. The cork's warmth at the end signals use and cost. Highly specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the mechanics and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" shapes the tactic (Elias channeling his will through the lens) and is present in setup (the lens hums, "raw vibrations of intent"). It appears in the beckoning beat and is implied at closure (the "unstoppable force" that burned the fog). The concept could be stronger if it constrained a choice or created visible friction; here it enables without tradeoff. Functional but mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is described in setup ("burning away the selfish and the superficial") and implied during the beckoning (Elias's "singular, purified wish"). It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; the purification is asserted rather than tested. The attribute is present and thematically coherent but does not shape tactics or force a tradeoff. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Beckon" is the central action: Elias beckons "not with his hand, but with his will," pushing the scent through the lens. It appears in setup (his intention), drives the middle beat (the beckoning itself), and is echoed at closure ("a whisper that had finally found its way home"). The action is irreplaceable; swapping it would break the story's logic and thematic arc. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Scent of a garden at night" is signaled in setup (the vial cork, night-blooming jasmine), shapes the method (Elias imagines it unfurling over the water), and is confirmed at closure (the captain: "Like following the scent of my wife's garden"). The method is specific, constrains the tactic, and charges the final testimony. Removing it would collapse the mechanics. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is established in the opening and frames the entire action. The lantern room and lens are essential to the method; the dawn provides urgency (the fog must clear before full light). The setting constrains choice (Elias uses the lens, not the foghorn) and the final image (sunrise painting the sea) reweights the premise. Solid integration, though the dawn's pressure could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" is mentioned in the opening ("The heat wave had finally broken") and sets the clean, sharp air as context. It does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the fog's arrival and the dawn's approach provide the real temporal pressure. The timeframe is present and coherent but largely atmospheric. Functional but replaceable with another weather shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is established in setup, drives the beckoning action, and is validated at closure (the fog clears, the captain's testimony). The desire is embodied ("a screaming tenderness") and shapes every key choice. The cost is visible (Elias's silence, the risk, the exhaustion). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; highly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is signaled early ("a screaming tenderness that had no voice") and modulates through the beckoning (silent intensity) to closure (quiet triumph). The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (Elias's modest nod, the warm cork). One slip: the phrase "screaming tenderness" is stated rather than purely embodied, edging toward label. Still, the tonal control is strong and integral to the ending's resonance.</comment>
