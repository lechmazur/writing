<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and embodied—"protect" functions as both instinct and compulsion, grounded in his silent routine. The interior work is strongest in the storm-crossing and lantern-room discovery; "a luminescent ache filled Silas's chest" risks soft phrasing but the surrounding concrete action (repairing the lamp, building the stone circle) earns the turn. Minor slip: the keeper remains entirely off-page, reducing relational crucible pressure. The renunciation (farewell via stone circle) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: letter discovery → repair decision → stone-circle farewell forms a clean through-line. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Silas cannot protect the keeper but protects the light, and the final stone circle forecloses the relationship with visible cost. The beam-restoration beat and sea-glass reprise charge the ending image. One persistent constraint (the absent keeper) shapes tactics and the final gesture. Cost is legible in "Farewell" and the ache held in the sea glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse cove, cliff stairs, and lantern room are concretely anchored and guide Silas's choices (mooring in calm water, climbing slick stone). The Fresnel lens, fuel line, and stone shore all constrain action. The sea glass charges the final image by refracting the resurrected beam. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (foam, spray, wind howl, cold iron). The "haunted lantern room" legend is introduced then dismissed efficiently; the mechanics (clogged fuel line, match-scratch) are plausible and affect closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the light and keeper—is signaled early and tightens when the beam vanishes. The storm crossing and lamp repair are both protagonist-driven escalations that narrow options. The logbook discovery is a micro turn that reconfigures the goal (protect light, not keeper) with felt cost. The stone-circle choice at the end forecloses the relationship. One visible price: the keeper is gone, and Silas's fragile intimacy ends. The escalation is causal and the cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—intimacy across distance, the cost of silent connection—emerges from the letter chain, stone language, and sea-glass exchange without thesis statements. The final stone circle offers a non-literal answer to "What remains when the other is gone?" and reweights the entire bond as both real and lost. The "luminescent ache" in the final image fuses light, loss, and beauty without moralizing. Subtext operates in the unspoken bond and the choice to protect rather than mourn. The ghost-loneliness line is a small thematic echo but stays within character perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Silas's perceptual signature—silent economy, sea-creature attunement, spatial problem-solving—is consistent and distinct. Diction remains within his register (oilskins, skiff, spyglass, fuel line). Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the storm and lantern room. The "warmly observant gaze" phrase risks slight elevation but reads as Silas's felt experience. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short bursts during the storm, longer reflection in the stone-building closure. No dialogue; all interiority is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are strong; most sentences do double work (e.g., "a cold weight in his pocket" anchors object and emotional state). Rhythm varies purposefully—short action beats in the storm, longer reflective sentences at the ending. Minor scaffold: "a strange and fragile intimacy, a bond woven from distance and silence" paraphrases within the same paragraph. The phrase "luminescent ache" appears twice in close proximity (once as tone anchor, once in final image); the second use is earned but the recurrence slightly dulls the payoff. No filter-verb stacks, loops, or template cadence. Information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—silent supply skipper and absent keeper communicate via stones and notes—is a fresh synthesis. The bond-across-distance frame and stone-language invention avoid stock tropes. The lamp-repair turn and final stone circle (circular message meaning "farewell") feel earned and specific. Small derivative pressure: the lonely-lighthouse-keeper motif is familiar, though the execution personalizes it through the stone-stacking method and the sea-glass token. The final image (sea glass holding light and ache) is particular and resonant. Risk-taking is present but moderate; no bold structural choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas makes two key decisions: cross the storm to reach the lighthouse, and build the farewell stone circle after restoring the lamp. His reticence is embodied in the ten-year silent routine and the choice never to look up. The trait enables the stone-language invention and shapes his response to crisis (action over words). Present in setup, middle storm-crossing choice, and closure stone-building.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in three beats: initial gift and pocket-keeping (setup), cold weight during the storm (middle embodiment), and final light-refraction (closure charge). Its teardrop shape and cobalt blue color are specific. The object's smooth, tide-worn quality mirrors the bond's fragility. Removing it would weaken the closure image's emotional and sensory anchor. It shifts from gift to talisman to vessel of ache.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The letter chain frames the bond and provides the keeper's voice ("The gulls are learning a new song"). The logbook discovery—"Thank you for the stones"—is the chain's final entry and triggers the goal shift from protect-keeper to protect-light. Present in setup and closure beat. Does not constrain middle tactics directly but primes the emotional cost at the end. Functional but one step shy of driving multiple turns.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is ascribed to the keeper's gaze through Silas's perception: "he could feel that warmly observant gaze." It enables the bond's existence and Silas's willingness to continue the silent exchange. The trait is felt rather than shown in action (keeper is off-page). It primes closure (the ache of losing that warmth) but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Present setup, implied middle, felt at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Protect" drives the entire second half: the storm crossing, the lamp repair, and the final stone-circle gesture all trace to this imperative. The verb narrows from protect-keeper to protect-light after the logbook discovery, a pivot that redefines the ending. The motivation—"to bottle the feeling of safety"—is tied to this action. Swapping "protect" for "restore" or "preserve" would require rewriting the core drive. Indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early with two examples (low pyramid = all well; tall spire = rough sea) and taught as a language Silas invented. It does not constrain the middle storm-crossing or repair but becomes the sole method of closure: the new circular shape meaning "The light is safe" and "Farewell." The mechanics matter at the end and the invention is specific to Silas. Present setup, absent middle, essential to closure gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lantern room is the site of the logbook discovery and lamp repair, both essential beats. The "haunted" legend is introduced then dismissed; the dismissal ("The ghost was just loneliness") ties to theme but does not pressure choice. The Fresnel lens and fuel-line mechanics enable the repair. The room provides resources (lamp, logbook) that alter outcome. Setup, middle repair, closure. Functional across beats but the "haunted" aspect is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lamp's flicker-out is the inciting incident that launches the storm crossing. "Tonight, a squall had blown in" and "Then, it faltered" anchor the timeline. The timeframe tightens decisions: Silas acts immediately, crosses at night in the storm, and restores the beam before returning. The clock is implicit (storm duration, urgent repair) rather than tracked in minutes, but it shapes all middle tactics and the need to restore light before ships are endangered. Present inciting, middle pressure, closure payoff (beam resurrected).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety that the steady beam had always given him" is stated once but dramatized in the storm-crossing risk and lamp repair. The motivation conflicts with the impossibility of protecting the absent keeper, forcing the shift to protecting the light. The desire is embodied in the final image: holding the sea glass to the beam, the safety partially restored. Friction between want (protect keeper) and cost (keeper gone) is visible. Present setup, drives middle choice, charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named twice: once in setup as tone anchor ("A luminescent ache filled Silas's chest") and again in the final image ("it seemed to hold all the light and all the ache in the world"). The tone modulates through urgency (storm), quiet discovery (logbook), and bittersweet resolution (stone circle, sea-glass light). Coherent through turns and charges the ending image by fusing beauty and loss. The repetition slightly dilutes the second use but the payoff holds.</comment>
