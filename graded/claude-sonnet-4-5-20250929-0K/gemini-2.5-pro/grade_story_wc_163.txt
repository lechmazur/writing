<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to find belonging is consistently rendered through embodied choices (the feather in pocket, dimming lights, mapping energy). Elara's arc from skepticism to tears feels slightly rushed but her professional curtness is maintained throughout. Internal contradiction appears when Kaelen clutches the feather with trembling hands yet speaks calmly—a genuine tension. The final realization about belonging feels somewhat articulated rather than purely dramatized, though it follows from the shared moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through station groans, flickering conduits, and the countdown to sunrise, culminating in the light-jellies' arrival that reweights Kaelen's isolation with shared wonder. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the burnt feather's grief "smoothed," belonging redefined) with visible emotional cost—release of a past he can't inhabit. The causal link between energy mapping and jellyfish migration is softly ingenious and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The deep-sea facility is rendered through specific sensory detail: stressed metal groans, emergency lighting weaving with shadow, plasteel dome, crushing pressure equalized in the case. The geothermal grid as "slumbering circulatory system" makes infrastructure tactile. The dome's darkness and subsequent bioluminescent meadow constrain and then reward Kaelen's choice to wait and dim lights. Spatial choreography (corridors to dome, Elara already there) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving his theory to earn belonging) is signaled early and tightens through the sunrise deadline and Elara's skepticism. The light-jellies' arrival constitutes one meaningful deepening—Kaelen's months of mapping pay off, transforming isolation into connection. Agency is present in his choice to dim lights and wait despite Elara's doubt. The cost is visible: releasing attachment to the burnt home (feather's "sharp edges smoothed") to accept the present. No reversals mid-story, but the accumulative pressure model doesn't require them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through concrete imagery: burnt feather, dying city's heartbeat, light-jellies as living poetry. The final paragraph risks stating the theme too directly ("Belonging wasn't about finding a replacement...") rather than letting the image carry it. The "shared exhale spotting fireflies" moment offers genuine resonance, a particular that reweights the isolation. However, "he knew he had finally found his place" tells rather than trusts the dramatized beauty to land alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen; no head-hopping despite access to Elara's reflection in the dome. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees systems as living (city "breathes slowly," energy as circulatory). Some elevated diction ("palpable force field," "shadowseam wonder") reads slightly ornamental but doesn't break voice. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and distinct (Elara's curtness vs. Kaelen's calm). The phrase "his approach was softly ingenious" intrudes as author assessment rather than dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; opening long sentence contrasts with later fragments. Some overwriting: "a world of shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite from the oppressive dark" stack modifiers in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "forgotten city" appears twice in opening, and "crushing pressure/isolation" echoes. The phrase "unshed tears and newfound understanding" uses stock coupling. Information density is generally high, but "It was his anchor to a past he could no longer inhabit and a constant prod towards finding a new one" tells what the feather means rather than showing its use.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The landscape-astrologer-in-underwater-city combination offers fresh synthesis, and mapping bioluminescent migration to dying infrastructure is specific. However, the emotional arc (isolated person finds connection through shared wonder) follows a familiar template. The "burnt feather from childhood home" as talisman reads conventional. The piece transforms the lonely-scientist trope through the astrology angle and jellies-as-stars inversion, but the final beat's articulation of theme reduces surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's profession shapes his approach (mapping energy rhythms, seeing the city as alive) and his key choice to dim lights and wait drives the turn. Present in setup, middle (mapping months), and closure (realization). His decision enables the spectacle but the emotional closure feels slightly separated from the astrology work itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Burnt feather appears in three beats: clutched with trembling hands, felt during the spectacle, and revisited at closure when "sharp edges of grief had been smoothed." It anchors past vs. present but the final reweighting is told ("its sharp edges... smoothed") rather than shown through altered handling. Setup and payoff present; middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" describes the jellies' arrival, which shapes stakes (proving beauty in isolation) and enables closure. The phrase appears explicitly once ("luminous respite from the oppressive dark"), charging the final third. However, it doesn't constrain earlier tactics—Kaelen's plan predates the concept's articulation. Present in closure but not in setup or middle development as active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" is explicitly stated once ("His approach was softly ingenious") describing his method of mapping energy vs. using force. The trait enables his success but isn't dramatized through a visible tradeoff—we're told his approach rather than seeing it constrain another choice. Label-only mention in middle; no setup or payoff beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears as explicit goal ("He needed to captivate her") and the jellies' spectacle achieves it, turning Elara from skeptic to believer. The action shapes the key reversal. However, the mechanics (months of mapping) were complete before this moment; captivation is outcome, not method driving multiple beats. Present in middle and closure; thin setup.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" is both explicit simile and dramatized moment—they both release held breath as the dense cluster passes. The method (shared recognition of beauty) is signaled through the watching, enacted in the breath release, and reweights their isolation into connection. Shapes the emotional closure directly. Present in setup (implicit in his need to share), middle (the waiting), and payoff (the exhale).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater facility provides constant pressure (groans, flickering conduits, crushing depth, sunrise deadline), resources (dome, geothermal grid Kaelen maps), and the final payoff stage. The "forgotten" quality matters—its dying heart attracts the jellies. Setting shapes tactics (using the grid's pulse) and charges closure (city's heartbeat syncing with jellies). Present across all three gates with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated early and the "first, faint hint of a distant sunrise" arrives at closure, bracketing the wait. However, the deadline doesn't visibly tighten mid-story—no clock checks, no rising urgency as time passes. It frames the window but doesn't alter tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development (tracking time's pressure) absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated explicitly in paragraph one and drives Kaelen's theory-proving. The motivation creates friction (months alone mapping, trembling hands, need to convince Elara) and the closure directly answers it ("tuning into the rhythm of the now"). Desire is embodied in his watching and waiting. Present in all three gates with visible costs (isolation endured, home released).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" appears explicitly once, describing the corridors. The tone of beauty-within-darkness is maintained (groaning station, inky blackness, then bioluminescent meadow) and modulates from oppressive to graceful. However, "shadowseam" as specific idiom isn't established early or reprised at closure. Tone coherence is strong but the phrase itself integrates weakly—more label than lens.</comment>
