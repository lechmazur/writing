<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and layered—outwitting cosmic tricksters to save a fracturing community—with visible micro-choices (spreading the chart, engaging the sequence) that embody her contradictory impulses: dread versus cautiously hopeful persistence. The interiority is character-particular ("a sliver of something else persisted") and the final tension draining is embodied. Minor slip: the tricksters remain abstract antagonists never tested on-page, slightly limiting the earned quality of her endurance, but her agency at closure (transmitting the counter-frequency, watching the fever break) forecloses passivity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara proves the tricksters are not untouchable, and the final image ("quiet hope humming into the divided world below") crystallizes her stance with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing vigilance). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The causal lens holds: her weeks of reverse-engineering enable the counter-frequency, the transmission causes the fever to break, and the cost (lonely station, perpetual night shifts, tricksters will adapt) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when she engages the sequence and watches the quad.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio station is vivid and specific ("dusty bubble of analog warmth," "bakelite cool and solid," vacuum tubes and copper wire) and constrains her choice: she transmits via the station's carrier wave using salvaged equipment. The astronomical charts, waveform generator, and VU meters are handled objects that pressure tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ozone and dust, the low thrum). The micro-setting functions as the sole arena for her rebellion, charging the final image of her lonely vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (stop the tricksters before they break the community) and tightens when tonight's transmission correlates with the violent town hall collapse. Elara's agency drives escalation: she reverse-engineers the method, engages the sequence, and the counter-frequency breaks the fever with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing vigilance, tricksters will adapt). The price is legible in the final paragraph ("ready tomorrow night, and the night after"). One clear reversal occurs when the young woman lowers her sign and the man's fury softens—earned by Elara's on-page action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: individual agency can counter unseen manipulation, and small acts of rebellion matter against cosmic arrogance. The tricksters' mistake ("never imagined their pawns might learn the rules") and Elara's counter-frequency embody the central question without stating a moral. The final image ("quiet hope humming into the divided world below") reweights prior material—her cautious hope is no longer passive but weaponized. Subtext operates in the contrast between her lonely station and the fracturing campus, and the "ethereal grit" tone charges the resonance without overt philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices astronomical charts as "anchors," the community's schism as "invisible lines," and her weapon as "a hum, an imperceptible vibration." The prose modulates with pressure ("her heart hammering against her ribs" as she watches the quad). Register is consistent (scientific idiom filtered through her mindset: "neuro-acoustic level," "subsonic frequencies"). No dialogue appears. Distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches her knowledge, and the tricksters' arrogance is presented as her inference, not omniscient fact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure). Clarity is strong with vivid specifics: "bakelite cool and solid," "VU meters barely trembled," "ozone and dust." Minor loop: "the air crackled with a particularly virulent transmission" and "a new signal would pulse" echo structurally without added pressure. Figurative language ("cosmic ocean of paper," "dying stars") fits voice but borders on density in the opening. No major artifacts touch closure; the final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—celestial signals manipulating human discord via neuro-acoustic resonance—offers a fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and radio-tech resistance. The transformation of the lone interpreter into active disruptor avoids the passive-observer trope. The counter-frequency as "hum" rather than shout is a specific, non-obvious tactic. Minor weakness: the sci-fi frame (cosmic tricksters, subsonic counter-signals) leans on familiar genre furniture (Lovecraftian indifference meets frequency-warfare), and the resolution (signal counters signal) is mechanically tidy. The emotional truth of isolation and cautious hope elevates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celestial signal interpreter shapes early setup (logging transmissions, correlating signals with protest groups), middle development (reverse-engineering the method), and closure (transmitting the counter-frequency, watching the fever break). Her choices drive every major turn. Causal pressure is high and the role is irreplaceable—no generic "scientist" would carry the same specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in two distinct beats: pinned to the wall as "true anchors" tracking sources, then "spreading a new chart over the console" tonight. The second use reweights the first (from passive map to active tactical tool). They enable her correlation work but do not constrain the climactic choice (the waveform generator does that). Setup and development are clear; closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Power plays (cosmic tricksters versus human pawn) shape the dominant stake: Elara must outwit arrogant immortals playing with a fragile world. The concept drives her tactics (reverse-engineering their method, countering with subsonic frequencies) and charges the closure ("proven they were not untouchable"). The tricksters' arrogance and her weaponized hope embody the power dynamic on the page. Early signal, middle development, and closure participation are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is embodied twice: as "a sliver of something else persisted" beneath dread (setup), and as "a quiet hope humming into the divided world below" (closure). The trait enables her final action (engaging the sequence despite exhaustion) and the reprise reweights the opening. It does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, so development gate is weak. The lyric reprise earns ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's engine: the decision settles "with the quiet finality of a closing airlock," she transmits the counter-frequency, and the interference breaks the fever. Every major turn traces to this action. Signaled early ("She had to interfere"), executed mid-story, and the outcome (people lowering signs, confusion replacing fury) hinges on it. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early ("building a counter-frequency that wouldn't block their signal but would subtly alter its reception on a neuro-acoustic level"), explained in detail ("subsonic frequencies, piggybacking on the station's carrier wave, too low for human ears"), and executed at closure ("the low, gut-deep thrum"). The mechanics shape her method and the outcome (soothing agitated pathways). Setup, development, and closure participation are all present; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>University radio station provides resources (waveform generator salvaged from physics department, station's carrier wave for transmission, VU meters), constrains her tactics (she transmits via the station's subsonic capability), and charges the final image ("her small, lonely station" as the site of rebellion). Sensory detail (bakelite, vacuum tubes, ozone and dust) is tactile and specific. The setting is indispensable to her method and the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames urgency: the schism grows with each new signal, tonight's transmission correlates with the violent town hall collapse, and opposing factions are live on the quad during her transmission. Time tightens her decision ("She had to interfere") and the ending acknowledges ongoing pressure ("tomorrow night, and the night after"). The timeframe shapes stakes but does not impose a live countdown that alters tactics beat-by-beat, so development is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To outwit cosmic tricksters" is her stated motivation ("simple and fierce") and drives every beat: logging signals, reverse-engineering their method, transmitting the counter-frequency. The desire is dramatized in action and the closure proves she succeeded ("they were not untouchable"). Friction between want (stop them) and cost (exhaustion, perpetual vigilance, tricksters will adapt) is legible. Setup, development, and closure all strong; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is coherent throughout: "dusty bubble of analog warmth," "cosmic tricksters," "vacuum tubes and copper wire," "low, gut-deep thrum," "quiet hope humming." Tone modulates with pressure (dread tightens into action, then exhaustion and cautious resolve) and charges the final image. The pairing of cosmic scale (dying stars, nebulae) with tactile radio-tech (bakelite, ozone) sustains the ethereal-grit texture across all turns. High integration.</comment>
