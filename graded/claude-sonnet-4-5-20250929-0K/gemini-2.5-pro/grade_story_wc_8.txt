<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to "rescue truth" is clear and drives his parallel-drawing tactic, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("measured as a metronome," "precise"). Elara's shift from guardian to collaborator happens entirely through listening; we see no embodied hesitation or contradictory impulse in the moment of surrender—the click of the latches feels too clean. The backstory about the Northern Confederacy supplies the argument but flattens present tension; Aris lectures rather than struggles. Internal conflict is declared (Elara's "weight seemed less like a sacred burden") but not dramatized through competing micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The dominant stake—whether Elara will yield the document—is signaled early and resolved on-page when she slides the vellum across. Causality is present: Aris's historical parallel persuades Elara, she unfastens the case. However, the persuasion unfolds as exposition rather than pressure; the Ashworth Collapse analogy is delivered in uninterrupted blocks without Elara resisting, questioning, or complicating. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (document handed over) but cost remains abstract—"difficult work...yet to come" tells rather than shows forfeiture or consequence in the final image. Drive lens reads Causal but the because/therefore linkage is thin at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The disused station and ivy are vividly rendered ("brick mausoleum choked with ivy," "dust motes danced"). The ivy returns as a metaphor ("slow and steady suffocation") that Aris points to during his argument, which charges the image slightly. Spatial choreography is clear (opposite benches, ticket window). However, the setting does not constrain choice—the conversation could occur anywhere—and the final beat (sliding the vellum "across the dusty space") uses setting as backdrop rather than pressure. The rosebush petal in the opening functions as a poetic marker but does not recur or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (will Elara surrender the document?) is present throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aris's parallel lands and Elara looks down at the case, seeing it as a "millstone." Cost is visible in Elara's "quiet, resigned click" and the acknowledgment that "difficult work" remains, but the price feels largely deferred rather than paid on the page. Agency tilts toward Aris as persuader; Elara's decision arrives after passive absorption of his argument without on-page friction or counter-move. No reversal complicates the persuasion—Aris speaks, Elara listens, Elara yields—so escalation reads linear rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of foundational lies versus uncomfortable truth) emerges clearly through the Ashworth parallel and Elara's shift. The ivy as "slow suffocation" and the case as "millstone" carry thematic weight without overt moralizing. The final image—Aris accepting the vellum, "first and most critical piece...recaptured"—resonates but leans slightly toward summary ("difficult work...yet to come") rather than letting the document's transfer speak for itself. The piece avoids a stated moral and allows complexity (the lie bought peace, the truth carries risk), but the Ashworth analogy functions as blueprint rather than lived tension, reducing emotional ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Aris until the story pivots to Elara's perception in the final third; the shift is clean and occurs at a paragraph break, so no head-hopping. Narrative distance is controlled, with perceptual signature evident ("his task now officially begun," "careful excavation"). Dialogue feels formal and exposition-heavy ("It has bought us a century of peace" / "Peace is not the same as stability") but fits the historian-guardian register. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("metronome," "bedrock," "curator of a structural weakness") without register clash. Elara's brief interior turn ("weight seemed less like a sacred burden") anchors her shift but remains tell-heavy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence lengths and no obvious loops. However, the Ashworth exposition runs for three uninterrupted paragraphs with similar syntactic patterns ("They, too, had...," "It worked...," "But a story built on nothing...," "People felt..."), creating template cadence in the persuasion beat. Figurative language is purposeful (ivy, millstone, gilded cage) but "the weight of unspoken history" and "the canvas for the image he was painting" edge toward stock metaphor. Information density is adequate but momentum sags during the history lecture. The opening petal and the closing vellum frame the piece, yet the middle stretches into summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—historian persuades guardian via historical parallel to reveal a foundational lie—is clear and thematically coherent but not particularly fresh; the "noble lie" debate and the archive-versus-truth setup are familiar. The Ashworth Collapse parallel functions as in-world evidence but reads like a thought experiment rather than lived material. The station setting and illuminated letter add texture but do not transform the template. Emotional specificity is modest; Aris's "careful excavation" mission and Elara's "last guardian" role remain archetypal. The piece executes its premise competently but does not surprise or deepen the trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris (fictional historian) is present throughout, frames the stakes early ("rescue truth"), and his choice to draw the Ashworth parallel drives Elara's decision. He appears in the opening, shapes the middle argument across multiple beats, and accepts the document in the final image, satisfying all three gates. However, his agency is largely rhetorical—he persuades rather than risks or sacrifices—so cost tied directly to his character is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The illuminated letter 'V' is introduced early as the object inside the case, is referenced during Elara's deliberation ("the weight...seemed less like a sacred burden"), and is physically handled and transferred in the final beat ("She lifted out...slid the document across"). It appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure, and its transfer constitutes the story's decisive change. Specificity is strong (vellum, golden 'V' for 'Vindication' vs. 'Valor'), and the stakes pivot on this exact artifact. Cost is visible in Elara's surrender and Aris's acceptance of future "difficult work."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The noble lie (Founder's Accord fabrication) is the story's premise, shapes the dominant stake (whether to reveal or protect it), and is tested on-page via the Ashworth Collapse parallel. The concept appears in setup ("noble lie...necessary fiction"), drives Aris's entire argument in the middle, and is resolved when Elara yields the document. The parallel demonstrates the concept's mechanical consequences (censorship, erosion, collapse), making the idea causally active rather than merely thematic. Closure hinges on rejecting the lie, and cost (future turmoil) is acknowledged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is declared in the final third ("His emotionally rational argument had done what no threat could have") as a label rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. Aris's approach reads as calm rhetoric rather than a visible blend of emotion and logic constraining action. The trait is summary-only and arrives late, so it lacks beat involvement and causal pressure. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Recapture" is signaled early ("his entire life...a careful excavation, a mission to rescue truth"), motivates Aris's journey to the station, and is completed on-page when he accepts the vellum ("successfully performed an extraction, rescuing...from a gilded cage"). The action is not easily swappable—persuading or stealing would change the story's moral calculus. It drives the final beat and charges the closure image. Cost is acknowledged (future work) though largely deferred.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is explicitly named in the setup ("He would do it by drawing parallels") and then enacted across three paragraphs as Aris recounts the Ashworth Collapse. The method shapes his entire persuasion tactic and is causally responsible for Elara's shift. It is not merely cosmetic but the mechanism of the dominant conflict. However, it unfolds as lecture rather than interactive pressure, so the method's cost or friction is modest. Present in setup, middle, and indirectly in closure when Elara responds to the parallel.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station is anchored early (opening paragraph), provides atmosphere throughout ("dust motes," "ivy," "shattered panes"), and the ivy recurs as metaphor in Aris's argument ("slow and steady suffocation"). However, the setting does not constrain choice—the conversation could occur in any private space—and does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters tactics. The station frames but does not pressure. Present in setup and thematically charged in the middle, but absent as a causal force at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the final petal drops") appears only in the opening sentence as a poetic marker. Time does not create urgency, and no clock tightens decisions—the conversation unfolds at discursive length without temporal pressure. The petal does not recur or reweight meaning at closure. The element is ornamental and could be removed without affecting causality, escalation, or the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aris's motivation "to rescue truth from...lies" is explicit in the opening ("mission to rescue truth from the deep and comfortable pit of lies") and drives every choice he makes—traveling to the station, preparing the parallel, accepting the document. It shapes setup, middle argument, and closure ("rescuing a nation's authentic past from a gilded cage"). The desire is clear and causally active, though friction between want and cost is modest; Aris does not visibly sacrifice or endure on-page doubt. Cost is deferred to future work rather than paid in the scene.</comment>
