<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her exhaustion embodied through "skin around her eyes bruised with shadow." Kael's desperation is shown through "quiet desperation" and his weeping, though his internal conflict remains thin—he's a receiver more than an agent. The gargoyle shard functions as both anchor and tool, grounding her process. The moonlight-healing attribute is mentioned but doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost, remaining label-only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Elara, mangrove stilt-hut, "tonight"). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael gains "shattering understanding" and Elara angles the shard toward the rising moon, reweighting her depletion and his regret with felt cost. The tightening is modest—spirits swell, words appear, memory surfaces—but the final image reconfigures both characters' stances with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: Elara "hollowing her out," Kael's silent weeping, the apology's silence "filled with a painful, luminous truth."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth with singing spirits is vividly anchored: "tangled roots...drank saltwater," "humid night pressing against the glass." The stilt-hut, window, and gargoyle shard create micro-setting that frames the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: condensation blooms, spirits' keening hymn, the shard's coldness. The environment constrains the ritual (spirits as medium, window as canvas) and charges the final image (moon rising to heal). Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elara's task to evoke Kael's turning-point memory so he can understand his choice. Pressure accumulates through the spirits' swelling song, condensation forming words, and the scene shimmering in mist. The tightening is Elara's evocation narrowing to the specific moment ("the boat...your hand...a fear of drowning"), which reweights Kael's understanding. Cost is visible: Elara "swayed, the effort hollowing her out" and Kael's weeping marks his irrevocable confrontation with truth. Agency is present in Elara's ritual choice; Kael's passivity is structural to his role as seeker.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: unsent apologies, the space before deciding, regret as a tidal force. The gargoyle shard and condensation-words function as charged images, not symbols. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"some things were not meant to be fixed, only to be finally, truly seen"—without moralizing, reweighting silence and understanding. Subtext operates in "fierce tenderness," the spirits as voices of regret, and the moon as restoration. No prompt-language intrusion mars the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with brief access to Kael's reaction. Voice is distinct: "stones rubbing together underwater," "temporal stillness heavy with the ghosts of words." Psychic distance shifts intentionally when Kael's vision is rendered ("seeing her face, hearing the unspoken promise"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Register occasionally elevates beyond the scene's visceral need: "surplus of fear," "luminous truth" read slightly polished for peak-stress moments, though not fatally so.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly controlled: "air...as thick as an unsent letter's ink," "low tide" energy. Two minor loops: "key turns in the condensation" restated as "words began to form" without added pressure; "shattering understanding" echoes "broken sound" within three lines. Template cadence appears in the spirits' song description ("murmur to a low, keening hymn"). Propulsion is steady; no artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is high, though some phrases ("painful, luminous truth") verge on stock elevation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mangrove setting, condensation-messages, and singing spirits as grief's medium feels specific and non-obvious. The gargoyle shard as psychic anchor is a fresh inflection on ritual tools. "The space where an apology waits unspoken" as temporal frame is conceptually bold and well-integrated. The evocation-as-service premise (cryptic medium offering clarity, not comfort) resists easy sentiment. Emotional specificity—"surplus of fear," not mere cowardice—lifts the piece above template regret narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is signaled early ("her precise and painful craft"), drives the middle evocation beat (lifting the shard, pressing it to glass, whispering the name), and her moonlight-angling choice closes the piece. Her decisions create all key turns. Cost is visible: exhaustion hollows her out, the moon must restore her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard appears early as "anchor in the tidal pull of memory," is used mid-story ("lifted...its jagged edge glinting," "pressed...to the glass"), and returns at closure ("placed...on the sill, angling it toward the sky"). Its coldness and weight constrain the ritual; its final positioning toward the moon reweights Elara's need for restoration. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the concept early ("air...as thick as an unsent letter's ink") and the spirits "carry the weight of what was never said." The condensation-words are fragments of an unsent apology. The final beat clarifies "The apology had not been sent, but the silence...was now filled." The concept shapes stakes (finding the unspoken) and reweights the ending image, though it operates more thematically than tactically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is introduced early ("only the moon...could restore her") and mentioned at closure ("pale light would knit her back together"). It constrains timing implicitly (she must wait for moonrise) but does not visibly alter a mid-scene choice or incur on-page cost. The trait remains more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Evoke" is signaled early ("this was her precise and painful craft"), drives the central beat ("She began to evoke the specific memory"), and the evocation's success constitutes the story's climax. The act is irreplaceable: without it, no memory surfaces, no understanding arrives, no cost is paid. The method (spirits, shard, window) is inextricable from the evocation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Condensation-messages are seeded via the window and humid air, enacted mid-story ("condensation bloomed...words began to form"), and dissolve at closure ("last word...dissolved as the warmth...reclaimed the glass"). The method's ephemeral nature shapes the scene's urgency and the spirits' role. Mechanics matter: cold shard on humid glass, breath mingling with mist. The method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is anchored early (tangled roots, stilt-hut, saltwater) and the singing spirits pressure the evocation throughout ("restless tonight," song swells, grows louder, softens to a sigh). The setting supplies the resource (spirits as medium) that enables the ritual. The swamp's humidity makes condensation possible. The environment shapes tactics and charges the ending, though it does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "space where an apology waits unspoken" is introduced early and frames the entire piece's atmosphere and stakes. It recurs implicitly ("temporal stillness," "apology had not been sent") and reweights the ending image. The concept charges the setting and theme but does not tighten decisions tactically—no live clock narrows options. Lyric resonance present; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to find the moment before deciding" is stated early and drives Elara's evocation. The condensation-words deliver that exact moment ("the boat...a fear of drowning...the choice to stay instead of go"). The motivation is fulfilled on the page with visible cost: Kael weeps, gains "shattering understanding," and the scene reweights his regret. The want conflicts with the pain of seeing, creating friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is signaled early ("Her work demanded a fierce tenderness") and modulates under pressure: the ritual is both gentle (whispering a name, breath as prayer) and wrenching (spirits keening, effort hollowing Elara). The tone charges the final image: placing the shard "angling it toward the sky" is tender care for self and client. Coherent throughout; the tone does not merely describe but enacts the premise.</comment>
