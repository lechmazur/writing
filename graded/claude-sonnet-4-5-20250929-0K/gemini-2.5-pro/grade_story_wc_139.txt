<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and well-embodied through her work rituals and the atonement framework. Her internal contradiction—using her father's most dishonest tool for a "profoundly fair" act—drives the central choice with visible cost. The relationship with her absent father is well-drawn through objects and comparison, though Mr. Silus remains functionally passive cargo rather than a pressure source. Minor slip: "strange clarity this room sometimes afforded her, a place that liquefies rigid thinking" edges toward meta-commentary on the attribute rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing—the brachistochrone diagram reweights the fair-trade mathematics with undeniable conceptual cost (the risk taken, the week of uncertainty). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Elara, prep room, tonight). One meaningful tightening: the casket loading forecloses all options and shifts from preparation to consequence. The "week later" ellipsis is motivated and the cost—living with "the cold, hard math of her gamble"—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prep room is vividly rendered with chemical tang, steel table, ventilation whisper, and dragon-clawed ink pot—all purposeful. The setting constrains choice: the repatriation contract provides the breach method, the table becomes Mr. Silus's liminal space. The final prop (graph paper, brachistochrone curve) charges the closure image. Minor density note: "porcelain stillness" and "chemical tang of formaldehyde" are strong, but "universe settle" reads slightly abstract for Elara's concrete professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repaying her father's theft with Mr. Silus's life—is signaled early and tightens through the prep ritual, forgery, and casket transport. One clear reversal: the envelope's arrival shifts from gamble to confirmation with felt cost (the week of uncertainty, the stakes of the breach). Agency is all Elara's; the plan's illegality and the 72-hour Ghost timer create persistent constraint. Cost is visible: she commits "the most dishonest thing she had ever done" and waits in heavier silence afterward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—fair trade, cosmic ledger, equilibrium through transgression—emerges organically from Elara's rituals and her father's ink pot without sermon. The brachistochrone curve is a resonant, non-literal answer: the path of fastest descent becomes proof of efficiency and fairness, charged by prior mathematical language ("equation," "variables aligned," "calculus"). The oxymoron "most dishonest thing… most profoundly fair" interrogates justice without resolving into binary. No thematic echo in dialogue or final-paragraph moralizing; the graph paper does all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "deathly vitality," "porcelain stillness," "fever dream" logic fit Elara's mortician lens and calibrated interiority. Diction remains character-specific under pressure ("predatory stillness," "bizarre parody"). Dialogue is minimal and functional ("It is time"). One slip: "liquefies rigid thinking" in paragraph four momentarily exits her concrete professional register into meta-awareness; the phrase reads more like prompt vocabulary than earned insight. Otherwise, psychic distance and focalization are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line clarity is strong; rhythm varies appropriately. High information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor loop detected: "calculus" / "equation" / "mathematics" / "cosmic ledger" recur across paragraphs without new meaning each time—acceptable thematic motif but edges toward synonym churn. "Deathly vitality" and "predatory stillness" are fresh. One template-cadence run: "She worked… applying… chilling… coaching…" in paragraph five uses parallel -ing stems, but the effect fits the procedural moment and does not obscure causality. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—mortician uses corpse-repatriation to smuggle asylum-seeker—is fresh and well-integrated with the atonement motive. The dragon ink pot and "The Ghost" chemical add Gothic specificity. The brachistochrone curve as confirmation is elegant and non-obvious. Risk: the piece commits fully to its moral calculus and the transgression's cost. Slight deduction: the con-artist father backstory and the "honest child seeks atonement" frame are familiar moral templates; transformation comes through the prep-room particulars and the asylum breach, but the emotional arc itself is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character trait drives the entire plot: Elara's honesty compels her to balance her father's swindle, and the tension between her integrity and the forgery creates the story's moral engine. Present throughout, shapes the dominant stake, and the final confirmation via graph paper is her validation. Cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ink pot appears early (paragraph two), returns functionally in paragraph six where Elara uses "The Ghost" fluid to forge documents, and its dragon iconically brackets her father's grift legacy. Two distinct beats (introduction, use) plus thematic charge. The object is indispensable: without the Ghost, the breach fails.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Political asylum is the inciting need, shapes all tactics (the repatriation contract, the corpse disguise, the 72-hour window), and the neutral-territory postmark confirms success. The concept is not ornamental—remove it and the story collapses into generic smuggling. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is attributed to the prep room in paragraph one and explicitly referenced in paragraph four ("a solution born from the strange clarity this room sometimes afforded her, a place that liquefies rigid thinking"). However, it functions more as atmospheric label than constraint: Elara's plan is already formed when we meet her. The attribute does not visibly enable or prevent a choice under pressure; it describes the setting's effect rather than dramatizing it. Lyric presence but minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Breach" is signaled early ("a breach, not of a border, but of a process"), the entire middle dramatizes the prep-room violation of legal and professional boundaries, and the closure hinges on whether the breach succeeded. The word and concept redefine the asylum path and charge the final gamble. Indispensable and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively, a state of predatory stillness" is introduced in paragraph two and frames the entire prep sequence—Elara is poised, tools arranged, ready to act the moment Mr. Silus arrives. The method shapes her tactics (preparation over improvisation) and is dramatized through the makeup, chemical packs, and coaching. Present in setup and middle; implied in the week-long wait for confirmation. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prep room is anchored early, supplies the repatriation contract resource, provides the tools and chemical packs for the disguise, and its "heavier" silence at the end charges Elara's isolation. The setting is not interchangeable—only a funeral home with foreign-body contracts enables this breach. Causal pressure across all beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "mathematics of a fair trade" is stated in paragraph one, dramatized through the entire asylum plan (life for livelihood), and confirmed by the brachistochrone diagram—a geometric proof of fairness. The motivation is conflicted: Elara commits her first dishonest act to achieve it, and the cost (uncertainty, professional risk) is felt. Present across all gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is signaled early ("She worked with a deathly vitality") and modulates the tone throughout: stillness/action, death work/life-saving, formaldehyde/urgency. The oxymoron holds coherent pressure and charges the prep sequence. However, the phrase itself appears only once; the tonal effect is sustained more by situation than by rhythmic reinforcement. Solid integration with room for deeper craft.</comment>
