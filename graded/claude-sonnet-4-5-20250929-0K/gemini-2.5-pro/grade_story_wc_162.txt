<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and evolves meaningfully—from wanting home to needing to understand sacred thresholds. His micro-choices (tracing grain, cross-referencing the logbook, choosing to step through) are embodied and escalate under pressure. The interiority is concrete and particular ("featherly determined" is a fresh, character-specific frame), and the final choice to analyze grain on the new platform shows credible transformation with visible cost: he accepts permanent separation. Minor slip: the phrase "featherly determined" appears once as telling rather than being fully dramatized through contradiction or struggle in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (prism terrace, Elian, post-butterfly-effect world by ~80 words). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grain analysis → logbook symbol match → threshold prediction → passage, with each beat reweighting his understanding and narrowing options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he kneels at the new chair, still analyzing grain, accepting permanent distance as the cost—"he had chosen the terms of his distance." The cost is legible and felt. One micro turn (discovering the spiral is a code) sets up the final passage without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid, strange, and functional: shards, airless space, a single wooden table that provides the grain he must read. The environment constrains his method (wood is the only navigable text) and the northernmost threshold he predicts charges the final choice. The silver void and empty chair in the closing beat shift setting purposefully and underscore his new isolation. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor: the terrace's physics (airless, floating) are evocative but not tested under pressure—he never struggles with drift or breathlessness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover why thresholds feel sacred, which braids with survival (finding passage). Pressure tightens through the logbook decoding sequence—violet pulse (temporal squall) and green shimmer (causal stability) forecast the white threshold. The final threshold choice narrows options absolutely: passage means permanent separation, a visible and irreversible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation works through pattern recognition that deepens understanding and forces the ultimate stance. Agency is present: he chooses to step through, accepting the terms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—necessary distances between realities for survival—emerges through the grain reading, the logbook code, and the threshold's "fundamental rule" vibration. The concept is tested concretely: he must accept permanent separation to cross. The final image (analyzing grain on the new chair, "still separate, still apart, but he had chosen the terms") reweights the opening question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, hand on threshold) and image (empty chair, whole silence). No moralizing. Minor: "sacred boundary" is articulated slightly more than shown; the "vibration of a fundamental rule" nears abstraction but is anchored by the hand-on-threshold beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single tight POV; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: Elian notices grain, light patterns, and weather code—his father's and grandfather's tools shape how he sees. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("featherly determined," "fractured hush," "spacial sheer" from the logbook register). Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decoding, slightly distant in the silver void's calm). Minor: "sinking into still water" is a touch generic for the threshold-crossing sensation; one more concrete sensory detail there would sharpen the perceptual signature at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—nearly every line advances understanding or pressure. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding. Grammar and punctuation are clean. Figurative language is purposeful (prism shards, fractured hush, white gateway). Minor deductions: "The fractured hush deepened" in the penultimate move relies on the opening metaphor without fresh sensory anchoring at the peak beat, risking a slight echo rather than escalation. "Calm, silver void" and "soft, pervasive light" in the final paragraph are serviceable but slightly abstract for the closure image; one concrete sensory detail (texture, temperature, sound) would lift propulsion. Overall strong with minor slips that do not touch the core closure choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather-code navigation, wood-grain analysis, and splintered realities is specific and non-obvious. The inherited logbook as map transforms a familiar "lost child" frame into something strange and earned. Risk-taking is present: the prism terrace physics and the "butterfly effect" fracture premise could collapse into spectacle, but they remain tethered to Elian's concrete method and the threshold's conceptual cost. The emotional truth—choosing permanent distance over impossible return—feels fresh. Minor: the butterfly-effect setup is gestured at rather than uniquely detailed; "a world splintered into maybes" is evocative but slightly generic without further specificity that distinguishes this fracture from other multiverse premises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian (corn maze architect's lost child) drives every key turn: he traces grain, decodes the logbook, cross-references light with symbols, predicts the threshold, and chooses to step through. His choices alter tactics (finding north, recognizing the spiral as code, timing the passage) and deliver the closure. Early signal (kneeling, tracing grain in opening lines), middle development (logbook cross-reference), and closure participation (stepping through, kneeling at the new chair) are all present. Specificity: his inheritance (maze logic, grain reading, pilot's weather code) is irreplaceable. Cost connection: he accepts permanent separation. Causal pressure across three beats (grain discovery, logbook match, threshold passage) and closure linkage earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pilot logbook weather code appears early (pulled from pocket, "SKC," "BKN," "spacial sheer") and is used actively in two beats: matching the spiral symbol and cross-referencing prismatic flares with symbols to predict the threshold. It reweights the terrace from random drift to navigable weather system—a conceptual turn. The logbook is causally indispensable: without it, Elian cannot decode the light sequence or time his passage. Closure linkage: the white threshold predicted by the code is the passage he takes. Specificity: the weather-code symbols are concrete and irreplaceable (not a generic map). Only minor gap: the logbook does not return in the final silver-void beat, so the charged reprise is implicit rather than on-page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Necessary distances is articulated mid-story ("Some realities... had to be kept apart for either to survive") and governs the threshold's rule: crossing makes distance "permanent and absolute." It shapes the stakes (understanding why thresholds are sacred) and the final cost (choosing separation). The concept constrains the ending choice—he cannot return, only passage forward. Early thematic seed (sacred threshold sensed at terrace edge), middle articulation (the core concept named), and closure cost (accepting the terms of distance) are present. Minor: the concept is told more than shown through a unique tactical constraint; it operates as thematic frame and rule rather than a problem he must solve with distinct, concept-driven actions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" is named once ("He was featherly determined, a small, fragile thing refusing to be swept away") and colors the interiority, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff. The trait aligns with his persistence (standing, cross-referencing, walking toward the threshold), yet those actions would read similarly if described as "stubborn" or "resolute." No beat where fragility costs him (e.g., nearly failing, needing to rest, or a choice shaped by smallness). Present and thematically coherent, but functionally replaceable. Lyric resonance (the phrase charges his stance) earns mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Intuit drives the method throughout: he intuits patterns in the grain, feels the logic behind chaos, cross-references light with symbols "with a speed born of desperation and deep familiarity," and senses the sacred boundary before decoding it. The action is present in at least two beats (grain intuition, light-pattern cross-reference) and shapes the threshold prediction. Closure linkage: the final intuition (understanding "necessary distances") enables his choice to step through. Minor: "intuit" blends with "analyze" (Q9 F) at times, creating slight functional overlap; the intuition is more a continuous cognitive mode than a distinct, irreplaceable method with visible mechanical steps that another verb could not capture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Analyzing grain in wooden furniture is signaled early (opening beat: tracing whorls, "Every line is a memory"), used to discover the spiral code (middle beat: "snagged his attention, looking less like a tree's scar and more like a deliberate symbol"), and returns in the closure beat (kneeling at the new chair, "He began to analyze the grain"). Three beats, causal pressure (the spiral discovery unlocks the logbook match), and charged closure reprise. The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other technique in the story could substitute. Cost connection: his method reveals the threshold but also confirms the permanent separation. Mechanics matter: the grain reading is concrete (whorls, spirals, hidden north).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is present early (opening line, "place untethered to any ground"), supplies the wooden table (the sole object enabling grain analysis), and its northernmost point becomes the threshold location he predicts and approaches. The terrace's drift and prismatic light are not postcard—they function as the weather system he must navigate. Middle beat: recognizing the terrace is navigating realities via the light flares. Closure: stepping through from the terrace to the silver void platform marks the transition. Causal pressure: the terrace's properties (floating, light patterns, the table) enable his method and constrain his passage. Minor: the terrace itself does not alter his tactics (he never struggles with drift or uses the environment defensively); it is backdrop that houses functional elements.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is named once as backstory framing ("This was the inheritance of the butterfly effect, a world splintered into maybes") but does not tighten on-page decisions. No countdown, no urgency linked to elapsed time, no tactical constraint from when the fracture occurred. The timeframe contextualizes the setting (post-catastrophe) but is not tracked or pressured. Middle and closure beats proceed without reference to time running out or a temporal window. Functional framing, but swappable with "after the collapse" or similar without structural loss. Lacks causal pressure or closure linkage beyond thematic color.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover why some thresholds feel sacred—is articulated early ("He needed to discover why...") and tested through his decoding sequence and the final threshold choice. The desire is dramatized: he works to understand (grain analysis, logbook cross-reference) and then acts on the insight (stepping through). Friction between wants and costs: he wants understanding but the cost is permanent separation. Closure linkage: "in understanding its sacredness, he had found a new way to be." The motivation is specific and drives the arc. Minor: the shift from "not simply to go home" to the threshold question happens as summary in paragraph one rather than unfolding through a contested choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named in the opening line and sustained through imagery: "sound of light breaking against crystal," "airless space," "silence was whole now, unbroken" at closure. Tone modulates with pressure—agitated during the decoding sequence (tight spirals, chilling realization, desperate speed), hushed and calm in the silver void. The tone charges the final image: the shift from fractured to whole silence underscores his acceptance of distance. Coherence is strong; no jarring register breaks. Minor: "fractured hush" as a phrase recurs but the sensory anchoring of sound/silence could be denser in the middle beats to sustain the tone during peak pressure rather than relying on the metaphor alone.</comment>
