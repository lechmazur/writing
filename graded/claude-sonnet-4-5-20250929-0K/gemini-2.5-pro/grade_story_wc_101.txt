<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices (organizing runs, bringing the bell to elders, declaring the promise at the arbor). Internal contradiction appears when "hunger outvoted suspicion" and her shift from feeding to bridge-building feels earned. The character exhibits credible leadership without safety-hedging, though the emotional progression at the arbor declaration could carry more visceral cost. Secondary characters (elders, youths) apply pressure relevant to the intergenerational stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's arbor declaration and the community's groundbreaking crystallize a shift from passive consumption to active cultivation, with the donor's seed-and-tools approval charging the final image. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—donations layer meaning until the bell unlocks memory and reweights the stake. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elara, exile community, sanctions). One meaningful deepening (bell discovery → intergenerational bridge) tightens the dominant stake with visible cost (exposure, commitment to labor).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: a "skeletal structure" and "place of ghosts" that Elara transforms into a garden site, constraining her choice to respond publicly rather than in ambush. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wind through clay pillars, "sliver of moon," withered vegetables). The sanctions period manifests in "hollowed cheeks," "stooped shoulders," and the scarcity that makes an orange crate bring tears. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the ridge-to-settlement sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feeding → intergenerational continuity) signals early and deepens when the bell reweights the donations from charity to shared-history message. One meaningful tightening: Elara's arbor declaration forecloses passive receipt and commits the community to visible labor, with the donor's seed response escalating the pact. Agency is dramatized (she organizes runs, stands exposed at the arbor, declares the promise) and the final image shows the community working under the new terms. Cost is legible: exposure, sustained labor, and the risk that the donor might not approve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (reclaiming agency and continuity from anonymous aid) emerges through the bell's unlocking of memory, the arbor's transformation from folly to garden, and the seeds-for-food substitution. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "the donor's identity was a seed best left buried, allowing something far greater to grow." Subtext operates in the donor's silence and the shift from food to tools. Minor thematic echo appears in "planting its future" but remains grounded in the garden image rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara's leadership lens ("She became gently persistent," "stole the air from Elara's lungs"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("dog-eat-dog reality," "rusted gates," "gentle scrape of hoes"). The arbor declaration is quoted directly, allowing Elara's spoken register to differ from narration without head-hopping. Narrative stance modulates appropriately from exhaustion to cautious hope to resolve. Minimal filter-verb use; psychic distance tightens at key beats (bell discovery, arbor declaration).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening sentences establish urgency ("The sanctions had bled the color"), and the arbor beat slows to match ceremonial weight. Information density is high (bell etched with five-petaled lily anchors history and motive in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in "amplified quiet" and "achingly familiar" trends slightly elevated but remains voice-coherent. The final image ("gentle scrape of hoes on hard earth") recharges the opening's "hollowed cheeks" with concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of anonymous aid + intergenerational bridge + arbor-as-garden transforms a familiar exile premise through specific grounded choices (the bell's provincial lily, the donor's shift from food to seeds). The turn—Elara's public declaration rather than ambush—feels earned and non-obvious. Emotional specificity (the old ones' tears at oranges, the elder teaching soil-testing after twenty years) avoids generic templates. The donor's identity remaining buried is a fresh inflection on mystery-benefactor tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices create key turns: organizing runs (early), interpreting the bell (middle), declaring the arbor promise (climax), and the community gathering (closure). Her agency drives escalation and the final reconfiguration. Present across all beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bell appears in discovery (middle), is brought to elders to unlock memory (development), and rests "cool in her pocket" at closure, its chime having reweighted donations from charity to shared-history message. Evolving use across three beats; irreplaceable (etched with provincial lily). Directly enables the intergenerational bridge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Anonymous donations frame the inciting mystery, shape Elara's organizing runs, and escalate when the bell signals "one of their own." The donor's seed-and-tools approval at closure validates Elara's declaration. Present across all acts; the anonymity itself becomes thematic ("a seed best left buried"). Causal and closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" manifests in Elara organizing runs "not to catch their benefactor, but to understand the miracle" and in her standing exposed at the arbor rather than ambushing. The trait constrains her method (transparency over confrontation) with visible cost (exposure, vulnerability). Visible in two key choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The declaration at the arbor ("We will honor it… Tomorrow, we will break ground here") redefines the community's stance from passive receipt to active cultivation. Drives the climax and closure; the community's gathering and the donor's seed response both trace to this act. Irreplaceable; swapping for silent work would lose the public-commitment charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled early ("through midnight food runs under a sliver of moon"), organize Elara's investigation, and deliver the bell. The mechanics (secrecy, moonless timing, the ridge location) matter to discovery and later to Elara's exposed arbor response. Present in setup and middle; shapes attempts but not directly invoked at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor supplies the donation drop-point, frames Elara's exposed declaration, and transforms into the garden site that charges the ending. Its "skeletal" state and ridge overlook supply both constraint (exposure) and resource (space for the garden). Drives middle and closure beats; irreplaceable to the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctions period establishes scarcity ("hollowed cheeks," "stooped shoulders," food as miracle) and motivates the donations' life-or-death stakes. Mentioned early and implied throughout but not tracked as a ticking clock. Shapes the dominant pressure but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Building intergenerational support becomes Elara's explicit motivation after the bell discovery: "This became Elara's true motivation." Dramatized through bringing the bell to elders, their memory-sharing with the young, and the elder teaching soil-testing at closure. Friction appears in the gap between generations ("born in the grayness") and the labor commitment required. Drives middle and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is introduced early ("oppressive nights… amplified quiet where every gust of wind sounded like a marauder"), modulates through the bell's "clear, soft chime cutting through the quiet," and shifts at closure to "no longer amplified by fear… filled with the gentle scrape of hoes." Coherent through turns and charges the final image with contrast. Tone-as-pressure device.</comment>
