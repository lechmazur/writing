<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's arc from rigid traditionalist to adaptive wisdom-seeker is earned through embodied frustration ("coiled in his gut"), the physical rediscovery of the ribbon, and micro-choices that shift his perception of the crystal from wound to germination. The internal contradiction—holding his daughter's stolen ribbon while resenting her departure—acts continuously and resolves through the seed-planting choice. Minor slip: the epiphany moment ("wave of accidental wisdom") edges toward declared insight rather than pure dramatization, though the subsequent action grounds it. Backstory and reflection anchor concretely to the ribbon and crystal, tilting present stance with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with lyric accent. Elian's rediscovery of the ribbon and seed narrows options (abandon old tools, plant the seed), and the closing choice forecloses the path of imposing mending while opening reconciliation with Lyra. Orientation anchors cleanly (cathedral rafters, orchard, commission termination) by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the ribbon left as "a small blue prayer" crystallizes future reconciliation with felt cost (letting go of control, leaving the token behind). One meaningful tightening through protagonist agency under the causal lens with cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters micro-setting constrains the mending choice (tools beside him, fissure accessible only at height) and charges the final image (climbing down, ribbon left behind). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "scent of apple blossoms and damp stone," "milky quartz," "faint lines of light." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the climb and wrap. The body and recurring object (ribbon, seed) function as setting elements that alter tactics at closure, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly but losing points for minor over-reliance on the visual sense in the Heartwood description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: mending the Heartwood (external) braided with reconciling generational conflict (internal). One meaningful tightening: traditional tools fail, forcing Elian to the "forgotten bag contents" and the ribbon-seed choice, which narrows options and reweights the repair from sealing to supporting. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency (planting the seed, wrapping the ribbon) with visible cost: renouncing his rigid method, leaving the ribbon behind as offering. No antagonist required; the crystal's resistance and Lyra's remembered words supply coherent pressure. Minor slip: the stakes hinge slightly on convenient object placement, though causality holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—"deciduous vows" and adaptive wisdom—emerges from concrete action: Elian's shift from forcing closure to offering support, the seed planted in the fissure, the ribbon left as splint. The final image (blue ribbon around the future, understanding that vows heal and grow) reweights prior material without stating a moral. Lyra's voice as memory and the seed's germination create subtext. Minor slip: "the most profound vows were not the ones that never broke, but the ones that knew how to heal and grow together" edges toward thematic summary, though integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Elian's perceptual signature (quartz-eye showing stress fractures, sensory focus on stone and blossom) is consistent and character-specific. Diction modulates with emotional intensity: "physical blow, knocking the air from his chest" at the ribbon discovery. Lyra's remembered dialogue carries distinct voice and generational contrast. Minor slips: "a wave of accidental wisdom washed over him" and "It was a beautiful scar, a fusion of old and new" drift into slightly elevated summary register that doesn't quite match the grounded tactile voice elsewhere. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (ribbon, seed, crystal mechanics compressed efficiently). Clarity holds across spatial choreography and the wrap/planting sequence. Minor loop: "his tools—the resonant chisel, the harmonic mallet" then "Setting aside his tools" recycles the anchor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-story reflection: "He had been trying to… when all he had needed to do…" reads slightly formulaic. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Propulsion is steady; the final image recharges the ribbon motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion and quartz-eye mender premise offer fresh synthesis; the deciduous-vows metaphor is specific enough to avoid template feel. Transformation test passes: plot depends on these exact details (seed in fissure, ribbon as splint, quartz-eye perception). Minor derivative echo: the "rigid old master learns from absent child" arc is familiar, though the crystal-germination twist and the tactile mending vocabulary elevate it. Risk-taking in the lyric closure (ribbon left as prayer, no on-page reconciliation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting small positive adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender drives setup (commission terminated, crystal diagnosis), middle choice (rejecting old tools, reaching for bag), and closure (planting seed, wrapping ribbon, climbing down with new understanding). Choices create all key turns; the specific sensory gift (seeing fracture as germination space) is irreplaceable. Early signal, three-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Daughter's hair ribbon appears in beat one (rummaging, rediscovery), beat two (untying knot, finding seed), and closure (wrapping crystal, leaving it behind). Each use reweights meaning: theft-token → memory catalyst → offering of support. Drives the emotional and thematic turn; removal would collapse the bridge metaphor and the reconciliation setup. Strong causal pressure, closure shaping, cost tied directly to leaving it behind.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Deciduous vows frames Lyra's remembered argument, shapes Elian's epiphany ("making room for new growth"), and informs the closure tactic (splint vs. seal). The concept alters his approach from forcing to supporting, a visible cost in method and pride. Setup by paragraph three, invoked at the insight turn, charged at closure. Could be slightly more irreplaceable—another metaphor for flexibility might substitute—but the seasonal/organic specificity ties tightly to the seed and orchard.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Endearingly feisty appears once as label in remembered dialogue ("endearingly feisty even in memory") and influences Elian's recalled argument. Trait mentioned but not enacted on the page; no present choice constrained or enabled by it. Functions as backstory color that primes the thematic turn but remains swappable with another warm descriptor. Setup present, contributes to one beat (memory), but lacks middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Persist anchors the inciting situation ("Yet he would persist"), drives the middle attempt (continuing despite termination, rummaging for solution), and charges closure (climbing down with new understanding of what persistence means). Redefines from stubbornness to adaptive endurance. Present in three beats, shapes the dominant stake, and the reprise reweights the verb's meaning. Strong integration, though slightly less irreplaceable than ribbon or mender role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Using forgotten bag contents is signaled early ("He reached for his worn leather satchel… using forgotten bag contents as a last resort"), enables the ribbon/seed discovery in the middle beat, and supplies the materials for closure (seed planted, ribbon wrapped). Mechanics matter: the forgotten status creates surprise and the lump-in-knot detail. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Swappability: another method of rediscovery could work, but the "last resort" framing ties to the desperation stake.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush orchard in cathedral rafters provides the spatial constraint (height, isolation), supplies the Heartwood crystal as the problem object, frames the "living architecture" metaphor that supports the deciduous-vows theme, and anchors the climb-down closure. Environment alters tactics (tools beside him, access to fissure) and charges the final image (leaving the ribbon "in this high and lonely place"). Setup paragraph one, pressure throughout, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After breach of contract signals the timeframe in paragraph one ("terminated a season ago"), sets the stakes (no longer commissioned, working alone), and contributes to the motivation (silent argument with council and daughter). The breach creates the condition for desperate improvisation but doesn't tighten decisions dynamically in scene—no live clock or escalating deadline. Functional setup and context, minor development (isolation), no strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>To bridge generational wisdom is stated early ("a desperate attempt to bridge generational wisdom"), dramatized in the tool failure and memory friction, and resolved at closure when Elian understands he must "create a bridge for another's [wisdom] to grow" and knows "what he needed to say to his daughter." Desire creates internal conflict (pride vs. learning), drives the ribbon/seed choice, and forecloses the path of imposition with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom tone is established in the title beat ("wave of accidental wisdom washed over him"), modulates from frustration through surprise to quiet resolve, and charges the final image (ribbon as "small blue prayer," understanding arriving unbidden). Coherent through turns; the unforced discovery contrasts with prior imposing attempts. Minor slip: the tone is declared rather than purely emergent in the "wave" line, and the final paragraph's summary register slightly dilutes the accidental quality. Still, the seed-as-forgotten-gift detail supports the tone throughout.</comment>
