<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is concrete and rooted in grief over Lena's disappearance and the reef's death, driving his obsessive rhythm-tapping practice. His interiority shows genuine contradiction—mourning versus seeking, isolation versus connection—embodied in physical action (drumming, studying charts). The final choice to accept the "once in a while" reaching feels earned by his progression from defeat to revelation. Minor weakness: Lena remains an absence rather than a presence that tests his loyalty in scene, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Aris, Tethys station, post-ban monitoring duty). The piece operates under a Causal lens: environmental confluence triggers the tapping sequence, the missing central rhythm is discovered via the atlas symbol, and the reef vision materializes as earned closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration—Aris shifts from drifting searcher to moored keeper of periodic memory—lands with visible cost (he cannot hold the vision permanently, only "once in a while"). One meaningful tightening through the neap-tide alarm narrows his window and forces assembly now-or-never.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station functions as both prison and micro-setting constraint: the console is the anchor for tapping, the viewport frames the bleached reef and later the resurrected vision. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cool metal casing," "shimmering like heat haze," bioluminescent coral colors—and filtered through Aris's scientific yet grieving POV. The station's spatial economy (single chamber, viewport, console) remains coherent. The atlas page as recurring object charges the final image when its spiral notation unlocks the sequence, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discover why Lena and the reef "disappear." Escalation is causal—Aris reconstructs rhythms across weeks, the rare tidal confluence arrives, he taps the outer-current sequences, fails, discovers the spiral notation, and retries with the central beat. The neap-tide alarm creates a now-or-never pressure window. Agency is his assembly and the incorporation of the missing heartbeat rhythm. Cost is legible: the vision holds "only a minute" and recurs only under rare alignment, so he trades absolute arrival for periodic glimpses. One clear tightening and deepening under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as something summoned rather than recovered, and loss as cyclically accessible rather than final—emerges from the rhythmic practice, the atlas symbol, and the resurrected reef without thesis statement. The delayed revelation that he was summoning rather than finding reweights all prior action. The final image (vibrant coral fading back to bones, hands poised at console) offers a resonant answer: permanence is replaced by periodic communion with undeniable cost. Subtext operates in "moored," "drifting," and "eternity" without meta-commentary. No thematic echo or moralizing in the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited POV remains stable; Aris's perceptual signature filters setting through scientific observation and grief ("skeletal monument," "desolate boneyard"). Diction stays consistent—technical yet elegiac, no head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the tapping sequence and discovery beat. Purposeful compression in the weeks-long monitoring loop conveys accumulation without dragging. Minor slip: "A detail he had overlooked for years swam into focus" leans slightly expository when showing the spiral would suffice, but voice recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies cleanly; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, motive, or the tapping-practice mystery. Figurative language ("a concrete anchor in the vast, indifferent blue," "shards of stained glass") is vivid without overwriting. Minor density lapse: "His motivation was a quiet, desperate need" tells what prior beats have shown. The final image—viewport blooming then fading—propels without scaffold. Zero loops; coherent propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—summoning past ecology through rhythmic resonance rather than time travel—offers a fresh synthesis of climate grief and speculative agency. The twist that Lena found the key to "make the past tangible" rather than vanishing reweights prior mystery. Execution is competent but the "periodically eternal sanctuary" and tapping-as-harmonization veer toward familiar mysticism without fully grounding the mechanics in world logic. The emotional truth of mourning and the reef's visual return elevate, but the core remains a recognizable template (lost researcher, cryptic map, secret method). No proximity echoes; tone coheres.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris as coral-bleaching witness drives his motivation, isolates him at Tethys, and charges both his initial defeat and final acceptance. His choice to continue the practice "once in a while" at closure is rooted in witnessing the reef's death. Present in setup (reef funeral memory), middle (monitoring the ghost reef), and ending (vision/fade). Causal across all three beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in setup (Lena's final clue), middle (traced "one last time"), and ending (spiral notation discovery that enables the summoning). Handled physically in multiple beats; its detail (hand-drawn spiral) unlocks the missing rhythm. Charged reprise at closure when Aris understands its true function. Essential; removal breaks the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire arc: Aris believes he is finding a path *to* Aethelburg, but the ending reveals he was summoning the place itself. The spiral notation withheld for years is discovered at the climactic beat. The concept shapes stakes (assembly urgency), tactics (rhythm reconstruction), and the final image (vision appears, then fades). Indispensable to closure logic and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is established in setup (Aethelburg "existing only when the planet's rhythms aligned") and paid off at closure (reef vision holds one minute, recurs under rare confluence). Constrains Aris's access—he cannot sustain the vision—creating visible cost. Present across setup and ending; middle use is implicit in the tidal-confluence research. Functional across two gates with cost, but not causally active in a distinct middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Assemble is the dominant verb: Aris assembles rhythms from Lena's notes, assembles the complete sequence at the console, and his final assembly of the spiral-centered pattern triggers the reef vision. The action structures escalation (weeks of reconstruction → neap-tide urgency → failed attempt → notation discovery → successful summoning). Drives at least three beats; irreplaceable. Closure hinges on successful assembly with visible cost (transience).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms is signaled early ("complex, polyrhythmic patterns"), practiced across weeks, enacted twice at the climax (failure, then success with the central beat), and its mechanics matter: outer currents, coastal eddies, abyssal plains, plus the spiral heartbeat. The method shapes all middle attempts and delivers closure. Removal collapses the entire causal chain. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tethys station is both prison/sanctuary (framing Aris's isolation) and the physical platform for the console and viewport. The station "hummed," the floor "thrummed" during summoning, and the viewport transitions from bones to blooming coral. Setting constrains choice (remote, solitary) and charges the final image. Present across setup, middle monitoring, and ending vision. Essential to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" anchors the premise (reef already dead, Aris in monitoring duty) and subtly underscores that the damage is done—resurrection is impossible except as periodic memory. Present in setup; implicit context throughout. Does not tighten a live decision clock or alter tactics in the tapping sequence. Functional world-building but replaceable with another post-catastrophe marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths (and Lena) disappear drives Aris's reconstruction obsession, rhythm practice, and refusal to abandon the quest despite years of failure. Friction between grief and hope creates internal pressure. The ending reframes the question: paths don't disappear; they wait for the right summoning. Causal across setup (Lena's obsession inherited), middle (assembly attempts), and ending (discovery and acceptance). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is embodied throughout: Aris is physically moored at Tethys yet mentally adrift in memory and obsession. Tone modulates from resigned ("prison and sanctuary") to desperate (neap-tide urgency) to quiet revelation ("no longer drifting"). The oxymoron charges the final image: "His mooring had a purpose now, a fixed point from which he could... reach out and touch eternity." Coherent intensification; essential to thematic closure.</comment>
