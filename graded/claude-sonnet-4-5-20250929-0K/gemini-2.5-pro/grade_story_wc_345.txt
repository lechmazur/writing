<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara's faith and Kaelen's cynicism are asserted via labels ("her faith a fragile shield against his cynicism") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The family dynamic is declared ("found family," "strangers who became family") but never tested on the page through a difficult trade-off. Anya's climb shows physical struggle but not internal conflict that would earn the collective-effort closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page (the bell resonates, clearing the magnetic path), but cost is purely mechanical—no visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options or charges the final image. The causal chain (messages → wreckage → bell → arch → resonance) is traceable but thin; each step is accepted without friction or adaptation. The ghost's "Go home" message supplies warm sentiment but no reweighted stake or felt price. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating arches, petrified orchards, and fused-sand sidewalks create vivid setting texture, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The arch climb uses spatial choreography (pulleys, cable, wind) yet the mechanics feel generic rather than leveraging the arches' specific crystalline or magnetic properties. The bell's interaction with the arch (striking rock to produce resonance) charges the final image, granting modest credit for object-as-setting, but the broader setting remains postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (escape via nebula) is signaled early, but pressure remains flat—each message is followed without doubt or competing option. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows choices; the team obeys instructions in sequence. The climb introduces physical difficulty (wind, height) but no cost that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off among the family. Kaelen's grumble is deflated in the same beat, and Anya's success feels inevitable rather than earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and found family is stated ("the family they had become," "worked as one") rather than emerging from dramatic particulars. The bell-as-tuning-fork image offers conceptual resonance, but the final "Go home" message moralizes instead of letting the image speak. Brambled hope appears as a single metaphor ("strangler figs choked the life from skeletal trees, a perfect image of the brambled hope") that does not recur or constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Elara remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (tracing the butterfly wings, seeing the ghost's message with a "true, untroubled smile") provides some texture, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("formless presence," "symphony of desperation") that sits uneasily with survival-mode urgency. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kaelen's grumble and Elara's reply carry subtext but do not advance plot through indirection or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "symphony of desperation and trust," "wave of pure sound that shook the very dust from the air" layer metaphor without adding causal detail. The phrase "Hope was a story they told each other" and "her faith a fragile shield" rely on stock constructions. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but density could be tighter in the climb sequence where physical micro-movements are narrated without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The altruistic-ghost-guiding-survivors premise and chalked-message mechanics feel familiar; the combination does not transform through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The bell-as-tuning-fork twist offers a single inventive beat, but the resolution (strike the bell at the apex during eclipse) reads as puzzle-box convenience rather than emergent character logic. Emotional specificity in the family dynamic is thin, and the ending's warmth ("a true, untroubled smile for the first time in years") leans toward generic uplift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The ghost is told motivation in paragraph three ("His motivation was singular...") and provides messages, but makes no on-page choices that create turns. Observation without decision; cameo at closure ("the ghost watched") does not count as causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell appears in the biodome (beat 1), is examined and doubted (beat 2), and is struck at the arch to produce resonance (closure beat 3). Its specific property (tuning-fork for the planet) is revealed only at the end, so it does not constrain middle choices, but it is causally active at closure. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift the score, but mid-development use is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nebula is the declared destination and frames the stake early, but it never appears on-page and does not alter tactics or choices during the climb. It functions as goal label rather than shaping pressure. Present in setup and mentioned at closure ("pointing directly to the soft, glowing heart of the nebula"), but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" describes the first message's effect ("the message felt strangely trustworthy") but does not recur or constrain later choices. The family follows all messages without testing trustworthiness on-page. Label-only; introduced early but not developed. Missing middle constraint and closure participation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reexamine the wreckage" is the first chalked command, executed in beat one, yielding the energy cell. It frames the story's method (following messages) but does not create a major turn or redefine options beyond validating the ghost. Present early, enables one beat, but swappable with any initial instruction. Missing closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Messages chalked at dawn appear in four beats: the first command, subsequent directions, the biodome drawing, and the final diagram. The method shapes attempts (team follows the ghost's guidance) and is specific (chalk, sidewalks, dawn timing). It drives multiple beats and contributes to closure (the final "Go home" message), but the mechanics (how/why chalk, who writes) are not leveraged for cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly described and supply the climb's physical challenge. The arches' resonance property is revealed at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting does not pressure middle choices or constrain tactics beyond generic difficulty (wind, height). Present across beats and active at closure, but mid-pressure role is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is backstory context; the current window spans dawn messages and the climb, but elapsed cycles are vague. No live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe shapes emotional stakes (they have endured three cycles) but does not alter tactics on-page. Present thematically, missing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is told in paragraph three and enacted through messages, but never dramatized with conflicting wants or on-page cost. The family's collective work is shown in the climb, but the ghost's motive remains summary. Label-only for the ghost; the family's execution is visible but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named once ("a perfect image of the brambled hope that defined their lives") via the strangler-fig metaphor and modulates through Elara's faith versus Kaelen's cynicism. Tone shifts from rust-and-regret opening to purposeful packing at the end, but the progression feels declarative rather than charged by accumulating imagery. Present early and at closure, but static mood in middle beats.</comment>
