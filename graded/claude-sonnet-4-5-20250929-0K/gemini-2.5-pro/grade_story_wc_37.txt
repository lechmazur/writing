<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—rekindle the realm through song—but her characterization leans heavily on abstract interiority ("shattered reflection," "bright shards") without embodied contradiction or genuine friction. The memory-gathering feels more like a quest checklist than internal conflict; she moves through tasks without visible struggle between competing impulses. The final act of singing is framed as duty rather than a choice that forecloses another path with felt cost. Micro-choices exist (tending plants) but don't reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (greenhouse, twilight world, Lumina tree), and the accumulative/textural lens is legible: fragments coalesce into the complete song. The closure lands on the page—the nascent sun bathes the greenhouse, the tree recovers, and Elara's memory becomes whole—constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (her scattered mind begins to heal). However, the cost feels stated rather than felt; the ending asserts hope and healing without dramatizing what Elara has risked or lost in the act of singing. The lens holds, but the final beat lacks visceral price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific flora (Sun-Drop Fern, Shadow-Vine, Petal-Moths) and the mica window returns at closure to frame the new dawn, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's POV (humid air, mossy flagstones, phosphorescence). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains choice—the tree's fading state drives the quest—and the alchemical properties enable the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the realm via song—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: gathering fragments into the whole Canticle. However, escalation is thin; each plant-tending moment yields a fragment with no resistance, complication, or false path. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned by protagonist struggle. The climax is a performance, not a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres but does not deepen meaningfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory, community, renewal—emerges from concrete images (shattered reflection, woven light, nascent sun) rather than assertion. The final image of abstract-painted hope through mica glass offers non-literal resonance. However, the piece tilts toward overt symbolic convenience: the song "knits communities together" is declared rather than dramatized, and the ending's "promise of a future" edges into gentle moralizing. The core question (can fragments birth wholeness?) is answered, but the answer feels tidy rather than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's world is filtered through synesthetic memory (four-note phrase "felt like the color yellow") and poetic diction ("humid air," "spider's thread voice"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, narrowing at the climax. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully—short clauses at the song's start, longer at the swell. However, some filter-verb stacking ("she knew," "she needed") and slightly elevated register ("nascent sun," "vortex of burgeoning energy") drift from intimate interiority during peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is high; sentences propel and rhythm varies. No major loops or scaffold. However, figurative density is elevated throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "heavy cloak," "seeds in barren soil," "spider's thread," "graveyard of her thoughts," "abstract painting of hope" crowd the text, occasionally muddling rather than sharpening (e.g., "bound release" as tone is abstract). Some stock constructions ("sharp as a thorn," "color of ash") and elevated diction in peak beats ("nascent sun," "vortex of burgeoning energy") reduce immediacy. No paraphrase loops detected, but the metaphor density triggers a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—last keeper restoring a realm through song—is a familiar fantasy template (chosen one, restoration quest, magical catalyst). Transformation is partial: the alchemical-orchard greenhouse and synesthetic memory fragments add texture, and the "swaddle the sun in sound" image is fresh. However, the emotional arc (loss → gathering → wholeness) follows a predictable path without moral ambiguity or subversion. The ending's "promise of a future" and "healing her own scattered mind" land safely in the resolution middle, avoiding bold risk. Specificity of flora elevates but does not fully escape derivative structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (tending plants, singing) create the key turn at closure. However, most of the story tracks her observations and internal gathering rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. The final act—singing—is framed as duty rather than a dilemma with visible cost. Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, and closure linkage are strong, but low causal pressure and thin friction limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The mica window appears in the opening and closing beats, reweighted at the end as a frame for the new dawn ("distorted glass turning the new dawn into a beautiful, abstract painting of hope"). However, it is not handled or used in between; it functions as a static frame rather than a tool that constrains choice or evolves tactically. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but no mid-scene use and no causal pressure on options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is established early as the core concept: the Canticle summons light-motes that coalesce into a sun, literally weaving dawn. The concept shapes the climax—Elara must wrap the orb in song to insulate it—and the final image depicts the woven dawn bathing the greenhouse. Setup, development (gathering song fragments), and payoff are all present. Causal pressure is moderate (the method determines the ending), and closure linkage is strong. The concept is essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is declared in exposition ("the very magic that knits communities together, binding the fate of the flora to the fauna") but not dramatized as a constraint or enabler on the page. The symbiotic orchard exists, but no on-page choice is shaped by this communal binding; Elara acts alone. Label-only mention without visible cost or tactical friction. Setup present, development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Swaddle" is the climactic action: Elara wraps the nascent sun in the final protective notes, insulating it to allow it to pulse and release warmth. This action is irreplaceable—it is the delicate final task that completes the woven dawn. Signaled in the penultimate beat, it drives the resolution and defines the closure image. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. Not present in the first third, so late-signal penalty applies, but the action is indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is the core method: Elara gathers lyric fragments from memory while tending plants, then assembles and sings the Canticle of First Light to summon the dawn. The method is signaled early, shapes middle beats (each plant interaction yields a fragment), and executes at closure. Mechanics matter—song triggers alchemical response, notes insulate the sun. Setup, development, and payoff all present with causal pressure. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is the sole setting, present throughout. It supplies the resources (phosphorescent motes, pollens, spores, dewdrops) that Elara uses to weave the dawn, directly affecting the outcome. The fading Lumina tree anchors the dominant stake. Spatial choreography is clear (mossy flagstones, vaulted ceiling). The setting pressures choices (tree must be saved) and enables tactics (plants release materials). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, causal pressure, and cost connection all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" is mentioned once in the opening ("In this mirror world, forever shrouded in endless night") as a label for the realm but does not constrain tactics or tighten decisions. Time is not tracked; no clock pressures Elara's actions. The "thousand cycles" without sunrise is backstory, not a live deadline. Setup present, but development and payoff absent. Ornamental worldbuilding without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To rekindle a dying realm" is Elara's explicit motivation, stated early ("her singular motivation was to rekindle a dying realm") and dramatized through her tending of the orchard and singing. The motivation drives all on-page choices and shapes the closure (the realm's heart begins to beat again). However, there is little friction between want and cost—Elara never hesitates or confronts a competing impulse. Setup, development, and payoff present with strong closure linkage, but low internal conflict limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Bound release" is articulated explicitly ("The tone of the coming moment was one of bound release") and present in the structure: Elara is constrained by duty, and fulfillment releases both her and the world. Tone modulates from heavy ("heavy cloak") to tentative ("thin as a spider's thread") to triumphant ("gentle, golden radiance"). However, the tone is more declared than embodied in rhythm and image. Coherent across turns, charges the final image, but the meta-commentary reduces immersion.</comment>
