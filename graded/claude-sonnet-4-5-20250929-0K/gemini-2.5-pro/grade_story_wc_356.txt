<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior journey is grounded in embodied sensory experience—the "nutty, earthy aroma" anchors her focus, and her micro-choice to turn inward during the sensory assault is concrete. The contradiction between her hypersensitive nose and her ultimate test (a malodorous bloom) creates authentic tension. Internal state and external action align consistently, with her stillness under pressure earned through prior meticulous care. Minor slip: the character's struggle feels somewhat predictable in arc, though execution remains strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: treetop village, herbalist protagonist, corpse flower seed as test. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a single meaningful deepening when the sensory assault forces Elara to find her still point; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where her cultivation of internal serenity reweights the external ambition. The final image—the still point drawn on wrapping paper—charges prior material with visible cost (relinquishing the urge to block sensation). One causally earned tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treetop setting constrains movement ("perpetual sway," rope bridges, wind chimes) and actively complicates Elara's task during the tide shift. Sensory hierarchy is sharp: her nose filters "damp earth, sweet decay, sharp tang of minerals," and the wind's riot of smells is specific (moon-petal orchids, lightning-scorched tree, wet-fur scent). The seed's terracotta pot functions as micro-setting and the wrapping-paper canvas charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tested when the new winds arrive with sensory overload. The tightening is the protagonist's active choice to anchor on the seed's scent rather than flee, narrowing options with visible cost (pain behind her eyes, immense urge to block it all). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible ("profound calm settled...deeper than any she had felt before"). No multiple reversals required at this length; one meaningful deepening lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between the seed's patient potential and the wind's chaos, without direct statement. The wrapping-paper doodling shifts from tracing the seed to sketching the wind's patterns with a still point at center—non-literal answer to the central question of serenity within motion. Subtext operates in the quiet choice to draw wind patterns rather than the flower itself, reweighting ambition as "quiet partnership" instead of "restless striving." The final image recharges prior material with resonance rooted in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused on Elara's sensory experience; perceptual signature is distinct (olfactory primacy, "she could smell the thirst of a leaf"). Diction stays consistent with character register: "quiescent life," "bouquet," "nutty, earthy aroma." Psychic distance narrows during the sensory assault and widens slightly at closure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("could smell," "threatened to overwhelm") in peak stress moments slightly dull immediacy, though voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the wind's arrival ("riot of smells," stacked sensory details) and breathing at resolution. Information density is high: "damp moss within her treetop conservatory" anchors multiple facts in one image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction: occasional figurative density without clear payoff ("storm cloud in the otherwise clear sky of her focus") and one filter-verb cluster during the peak beat ("threatened to overwhelm," "urged to flee") slightly reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of treetop setting, olfactory sensitivity, and corpse flower creates a fresh synthesis; the wrapping-paper journaling custom is specific rather than generic. The turn—finding stillness within chaos rather than blocking it—avoids the expected trajectory of simply coaxing the bloom. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and sensory focus elevate above template, though the emotional arc (calm through acceptance) follows a familiar path. Transformation test passes: the specifics of wind, seed, and scent anchor the universal question of serenity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to focus inward during the sensory assault is the key turn; her decision to sketch wind patterns rather than the seed at closure reweights her ambition. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, payoff) and causally active across at least two beats. Cost is visible: pain, urge to flee, and shift from striving to partnership.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seed appears in setup (opening paragraph), anchors Elara's focus during the middle crisis (its "nutty, earthy aroma"), and is present in closure reflection ("still safe, still patient"). However, it is more a stable anchor than an object that evolves or is actively handled across beats. Fulfills two gates solidly; closure participation is reflective rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept shapes the dominant stake (finding serenity as wisdom) and is tested during the wind's arrival when Elara must listen for "what to listen for" rather than "knowing everything." Present in setup ("undercurrent of wisdom...through patterns of the living world"), middle choice, and closure image (still point within wind patterns). Functional across gates but slightly abstract; could be more concretely embodied in specific micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Her nose enables detection of the seed's scent ("nutty, earthy aroma...only she could likely detect") and creates the crisis (sensory overload from the wind's "riot of smells"). Constraint is visible: pain behind her eyes, urge to flee. Cost is on the page and the trait drives two distinct beats (seed monitoring and wind assault). Essential to both escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Journaling bookends the story (setup and closure) and shifts in content (from seed diagrams to wind patterns), reweighting her approach. However, the action is more reflective frame than causal driver of the middle turn; the key choice occurs internally during the sensory assault. Present in setup and payoff with thematic charge, but middle development is weak. Swapping for another recording method would not break the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The family custom is introduced early (setup) and returns at closure with shifted content, creating a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning. However, it does not constrain middle choices; the crisis and resolution occur independent of the wrapping paper. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is absent. Functional early-final bracketing reaches mid-band but lacks beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The treetop village constrains Elara's task (perpetual sway threatens her serenity), supplies the crisis mechanism (wind carrying new pollens and scents), and charges the final image (wind patterns she now accepts). Setting is causally active in setup (establishing motion as obstacle), middle (wind assault), and closure (wind redrawn as pattern). Essential across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tide shift is signaled in setup, triggers the middle crisis ("the tide turned"), and is referenced at closure ("new wind"). It creates a time-sensitive pressure window and alters conditions for Elara's task. Present in all three gates but functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a ticking clock that visibly narrows options. Causal role is moderate; replacing with a generic "seasonal change" would weaken but not break the story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "cultivate serenity within motion" is dramatized in her meticulous care, tested under the sensory assault (choosing to anchor rather than flee), and reweighted at closure (serenity "in the soil of herself"). Motivation drives setup, middle choice with visible friction (pain, urge to block), and payoff. The cost—accepting chaos rather than blocking it—is on the page. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("quiet, deep-rooted," "hushed moment") and modulates with pressure: accelerating during the wind's "riot" and "cacophony," then settling to "profound calm" and "wildflower hush" at closure. The final phrase "wildflower hush" directly charges the ending image. Coherent through turns and integral to the accumulative lens. Strong closure participation elevates above mid-band.</comment>
