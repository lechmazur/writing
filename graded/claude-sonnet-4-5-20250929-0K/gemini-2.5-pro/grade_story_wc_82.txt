<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's grief is embodied through craft—polishing the gem, folding paper—with visible micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when he simultaneously fears and needs the dream's luminous torment. The transformation at closure (grief as current, not void) is earned by the pilgrimage's accumulative pressure. Minor deduction: Elara remains an abstraction; her presence is told through memory rather than dramatized friction that would test Kaelen's resolve in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (workshop, floating isles, mnemonic gem). The pilgrimage structure coheres through spatial ascent and memory deepening; the basilica scene lands Resonant Reconfiguration (grief transforms from drowning sea to navigable current) with felt cost—the promise forever broken. One meaningful tightening: gem polishing across the climb reweights raw memory into bearable form. Closure is on-page and legible under the accumulative lens, though the final crane fold feels like a coda rather than the climactic reweighting itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating isles, crystalline staircase, glass basilica, and tea garden are vivid and purposeful. The paradoxical physics (descends while ascending) constrains movement and mirrors internal descent into memory. The gem's "powdered starlight" dust and the basilica refracting aether into rainbows provide sensory specificity filtered through grief. The lotus lantern at the dais charges the closure image. Minor gap: the tea garden's spatial choreography in the final beat (stone bench, paper from satchel) lacks the tactile grounding present earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform formless grief into bearable shape. One meaningful deepening: each ascending step plunges Kaelen deeper into memory, threatening to shatter resolve, until gem polishing provides method. The basilica dream revelation tightens—beauty and broken promise crest together, forcing acceptance that grief is part of him. Agency is clear: he chooses pilgrimage, polishes the gem, and makes the first crane fold. Cost is felt (forever-broken promise) and forecloses the path of drowning avoidance. No need for antagonist; pressure coheres through accumulative memory waves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief as transformation, not erasure) emerges through particulars: gem facets clarify rather than erase, dream shows unattainable future, grief becomes current not void, crane has wings but won't fly. The final image (folding luminous torment into crane with wings) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "luminous torment," "drowning sea," and the paradox of falling upward. The thousand-crane motivation frames the thematic question early; the single crane's closure reweights scale and acceptance. Avoids sentimentality by holding beauty and brokenness in tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates appropriately (closer during basilica vision, pulled back during transit). Perceptual signature is grief-tuned: lantern skeletons, heavy water, powdered starlight. Diction elevates but stays consistent ("aether," "mnemonic gem," "luminous torment") without mid-crisis register breaks. No dialogue to assess. Purposeful compression in the pilgrimage sequence (each isle triggers memory waves) accelerates without obscuring causality. Minor slip: "strange physics of the archipelago took hold" tells the rule rather than showing its sensory effect on Kaelen's body in that first step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; figurative language ("shadow detaches," "grief…a formless, heavy water," "dust…like powdered starlight") is dense but coherent. Sentence openings vary. Information density is high in the pilgrimage compression. Two line-level issues: "His singular motivation now was a quiet, desperate thing: to fold his grief…yet the sorrow was a formless, heavy water" paraphrases the same idea (formless grief) across adjacent clauses. "The dream was not a tragedy; it was a promise" + "achingly beautiful and forever broken" stacks three abstract emotional summaries in rapid succession without concrete image anchor, dulling peak-beat immediacy. Apply baseline artifact deduction −0.6 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of grief pilgrimage, fantasy setting (floating isles, mnemonic gems), and craft-as-healing avoids pure template by grounding in specific objects (gem polishing, origami crane, lotus lantern). The descends-while-ascending paradox and dream-as-broken-promise offer fresh angles on familiar grief arc. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would alter the floating-world logic and craft specificity. Risk: lyric compression and fantasy frame elevate without obscuring. Deduction: the core emotional arc (pilgrimage to accept loss) remains recognizable; freshness lies in execution rather than premise invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (lantern maker) makes three key choices: undertake pilgrimage, polish the gem during ascent, fold the crane at closure. Craft identity shapes method (lotus lantern at dais, origami fold). Present across setup (workshop, unfinished lanterns), development (gem polishing), and payoff (crane fold). Causally essential to closure image. Moderate deduction: "crafty" attribute is label-only; no scene shows clever problem-solving or resourcefulness under pressure—his choices are methodical rather than ingenious.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glass basilica appears at setup (destination signaled early), development (he arrives, places lantern), and payoff (dream blooms, closure image). Two beats: arrival and dream revelation. Specific properties (refracts aether, becomes vessel for dream) are irreplaceable. Shapes closure by transforming into the space where grief reweights. Deduction: basilica is reached and used but does not constrain a prior choice or narrow options mid-pilgrimage; it functions as stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream recording (mnemonic gem) is the quest object, signaled early (velvet box, Elara's last dream), polished during ascent (method shapes middle beats), and activated at basilica (closure payoff). Dream content (quiet future, grandchildren, broken promise) reweights grief from void to current. Irreplaceable: story logic collapses without the captured dream. Cost tied to element: seeing the beautiful, unattainable vision is the luminous torment that forces acceptance. All three gates satisfied with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is signaled at first step, recurs across the climb (each upward step plunges into memory), and is declared gone at closure ("paradoxical sensation…replaced by profound stillness"). Two beats: onset and resolution. Constrains movement by layering memory waves that threaten resolve. Charges closure by marking transformation (true ascent from depths). Deduction: the mechanism is told ("strange physics took hold") rather than shown through body sensation; swappable with "each step triggers memory" without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Transform" operates at two scales: Kaelen transforms the gem (polishing facets to clarify light) and transforms his grief (from drowning sea to navigable current). Signaled early (fold grief into cranes, yet formless), enacted mid-story (gem polishing as method), and realized at closure (crane fold begins the transformation). Major turn traces to this action: grief's reweighting in the basilica enables the crane fold. Irreplaceable at thematic level. Deduction: the gem-polishing "transform" and emotional "transform" run parallel rather than intersecting with friction; they complement but do not complicate each other.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early (rough gem in satchel, polishing tools), enacted across the climb (facet by facet, abrasive prayer, starlight dust), and delivers the clarified gem to the basilica for dream activation. Shapes middle beats by giving Kaelen method to resist grief's consumption. Specific mechanics (grinding, facets, dust) matter to both process and metaphor (clarify not erase). Cost connection: the labor anchors him through memory waves. All three gates with strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Minor deduction: the polishing itself does not fail or impose a trade-off—it succeeds linearly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tea garden appears at setup (place they cherished, placid ponds reflect his hollowed expression), frames the dream content (old and grey, grandchildren, paper butterflies), and returns at closure (stone bench, no longer a wound, crane fold begins). Lyric reprise reweights the stake: from wound to site of hopeful craft. Two-of-three gates (setup and payoff; middle development absent—he leaves for the staircase). Does not constrain a middle choice. Charged at closure by dream memory. Moderate score for purposeful seed-and-return with thematic cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" (timeframe) is signaled in the opening line and establishes the world rule (shadow departure = death analogue). Frames the entire narrative window and explains Elara's absence. Does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock during the pilgrimage; time remains untracked and elastic. Present at setup, implicit throughout, but does not constrain tactics. Functional context rather than active pressure. Mid-band for clear framing with no escalation role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation (fold grief into origami cranes) is declared early, drives the journey (find shape for formless sorrow), and is enacted at closure (first crane fold with steady fingers). The cranes are the method to transform grief, making the motivation and action tightly braided. Desire is dramatized through pilgrimage and gem polishing as preparation. Cost: the grief's luminosity must be seen and accepted before folding can begin. Deduction: the crane motivation is told more than tested—no scene shows Kaelen attempting and failing to fold before the pilgrimage, so we lack friction between want and obstacle mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" (tone) coheres across the narrative: light fled with Elara, yet memory waves are luminous; dream is achingly beautiful and forever broken; grief as "luminous torment" folds into crane. Tone modulates with pressure (quiet desperation at workshop, cresting agony at basilica, profound stillness after). Charges the final image by holding beauty and pain in unresolved tension (wings that won't fly). Irreplaceable tonal signature. Strong closure linkage and beat consistency. Minor deduction: the phrase "luminous torment" is stated twice (opening paragraph and basilica climax), reducing subtlety at peak moment.</comment>
