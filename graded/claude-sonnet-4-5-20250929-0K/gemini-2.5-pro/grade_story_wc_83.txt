<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is clear and sustained—grief transformed into a cosmic hunt—but her interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("needle in her soul," "cold, dense star in her chest") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The geode functions as a focusing object, yet her micro-choices feel more like procedural steps than genuine dilemmas with visible cost. The wedding memory is invoked but remains abstract; we don't see her struggle with competing wants or make a trade-off that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with a Charged Poise closure: the discovery of the resonance signature reconfigures her hunt from open wound to targeted trajectory, and the cost (grief remains "a cold, dense star") is legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The escalation—pushing the array beyond specs, circuit breaker trip, data window—narrows options cleanly. One persistent slip: the bracketed "[intricately tangible a force as gravity" is an on-page typo/artifact that disrupts the final third's causality slightly but does not break the closure unit itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital observatory and the capacitor bank's metronomic cooling anchor the scene vividly. The geode, console, and panoramic viewport are handled across beats and the geode charges the final image with its "terrible, beautiful coordinates." The cooling timeframe constrains her window, making the setting functional. However, the observatory itself is described more for atmosphere than as a resource that alters tactics; the circuit breaker reset is announced but doesn't force a new choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating where unused potential pools after violent loss—is signaled early and sustained. The array failure creates a tightening: limited time to parse aftershock data. The discovery of the resonance signature is a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and gives her hunt a target. The cost is primarily emotional (grief gains trajectory) rather than a visible forfeiture; no live option is foreclosed on the page, but the Charged Poise reconfiguration is legible and the pressure coheres under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as a cosmic wound, the hunt for stolen futures—emerges organically from the equations, the geode, and the perturbation-theory frame without explicit moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the reservoir of unused potential is found, and her grief gains a trajectory. The geode's shift from wedding gift to focusing lens to reflector of coordinates is purposeful. One slip: "intricately tangible" in the bracketed line reads as a forced thematic echo of the "intangibly tangible" attribute rather than an earned insight from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Amal's perceptual signature—physics metaphors, grief filtered through mathematics—is distinct and consistent. Diction ("needle in her soul," "festering heart," "bleak exhilaration") is purposeful but occasionally elevated beyond immediate embodiment. The bracketed fragment "[intricately tangible a force as gravity" is an on-page artifact (incomplete sentence, unclear syntax) that disrupts voice coherence in a high-stakes beat. No dialogue present to assess, correctly avoiding it at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("ticked like a deathwatch beetle," "white-hot shriek," "thump-click") and information density is high. However, several lines loop or restate: "The geode felt warm in her palm, a focusing lens for the grief that fueled her" closely echoes earlier mentions without adding pressure. The bracketed "[intricately tangible" fragment is a generation artifact that obscures sense in the final third. Metaphor density ("veins of a violation," "silent chord," "reservoir") occasionally stacks without clear referents, reducing propulsion in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Premise—physicist uses perturbation theory to trace grief's cosmic signature—is specific and non-obvious. The geode as wedding gift turned focusing lens is a strong synthesis. However, the "hunt for where unused potential pools" frame, while vivid, echoes familiar genre templates (scientist channels personal loss into obsessive research) without transforming it through lived professional detail or surprising moral calculus. The resonance discovery feels inevitable in concept but arrives without a trade-off that tests her commitment in an unexpected way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amal, the drone strike wedding survivor, is present throughout and her past trauma anchors her motivation. She makes the decision to push the array beyond specs and to pursue the aftershock data during the cooldown window. Her final choice—to stare at the coordinates rather than immediately act—crystallizes her stance. However, her decisions are procedural (refining boundary conditions, feeding loss into equations) rather than dilemmatic; no on-page reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The geode crystal appears in three beats: clutched in the dust after the strike (backstory anchor), felt warm in her palm as a focusing lens mid-scene, and picked up at the end to reflect the coordinates. Its meaning shifts from wedding gift to grief token to lens to reflector of her trajectory. The final reprise charges the closure image with its "crystalline facets reflecting the terrible, beautiful coordinates." Slightly ornamental in the middle beat (described but not used to constrain a choice), but the lyric early–final arc and closure linkage elevate it solidly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is invoked explicitly ("Her unfiltered awakening had come not in a flash of satori…") and frames her transformation from illusion to raw truth. It shapes her motivation—the hunt is a response to that awakening. However, the concept functions more as thematic label than active constraint; it does not alter her tactics on the page or create a visible trade-off. The story could function with "traumatic clarity" or "shattering realization" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is named once as "the intangibly tangible echo of twenty-seven stolen futures" and echoed in the bracketed fragment "[intricately tangible a force as gravity." The attribute describes her felt pressure but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action. It remains a poetic label rather than a trait with mechanical consequence; no choice turns on this quality, and the bracketed line is incomplete/artifactual. Present but ornamental, with no middle development or closure participation beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "hunt" is signaled early ("This was her hunt"), sustained as the dominant action (tracking the resonance, sifting aftershock data), and culminates in the discovery of the signature. The hunt frames her goal and the array failure creates urgency. The ending explicitly names the hunt's next phase: "Her hunt wasn't over; it had just been given a target." However, the hunt itself is largely internal/computational; no physical pursuit or adaptive tactic in response to resistance. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage, but the action is more conceptual than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named and explained in a dense paragraph: "she treated the drone strike as the titular perturbation—a violent, localized disruption…" The method is her means of tracking the ripples. The equations sprawl across the screen, she refines boundary conditions, and the cascading solution appears as a result. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown; we don't see her adjust the method under pressure or face a trade-off in how she applies it. Present in setup and payoff, but its workings remain abstract, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory is named and the panoramic viewport, console, and capacitor bank anchor the scene visually. The setting's orbital isolation supports the tone. The circuit breaker trip and coolant flow stabilization create a time constraint tied to the setting's systems. However, the observatory itself does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters her tactics; it is backdrop more than crucible. The diagnostic chime and breaker reset participate in escalation, lifting the score above ornamental, but the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"while the circuit breakers cool"—is signaled early ("this fragile peace while the circuit breakers cool"), tracked mid-scene ("Her time was running out"), and culminates with the breaker reset ("A loud *thump-click*… ready for the system to be brought back online"). The live clock narrows her window and heightens urgency. Her choice to stare at the coordinates instead of moving when the system resets is charged by the elapsed time. Strong causal and closure participation; the time constraint is irreplaceable and tightens the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find where unused potential pools after it's ripped from the tapestry of spacetime"—is explicit, rooted in grief, and sustained throughout. It drives her to push the array, parse the data, and refine the equations. The discovery of the reservoir is the direct payoff. However, the motivation is dramatized through procedural steps rather than conflicted choices; no friction between her want and a competing cost appears on the page. Present across all three gates and integral to closure, but the lack of visible trade-off caps the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named explicitly ("The feeling was one of bleak exhilaration, like standing on a cliff edge…") and embodied in the imagery: the "cold, dense star" of grief, the "terrible, beautiful coordinates," the wound that now has a trajectory. The tone modulates from metronomic oppression (opening) to exhilaration at discovery to the charged poise of the ending. The final image—grief with trajectory—captures the blend of bleakness and exhilaration without stating it again. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to the closure effect.</comment>
