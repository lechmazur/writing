<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical work—kneeling, fertilizing, pressing seeds—with micro-choices visible on the page. His "quiet atonement" and belief in "submerged concord" drive consistent action without self-conscious introspection. The piece lacks internal contradiction or visible struggle; his resolve faces no meaningful friction, only the birds' minor navigation guidance. The ending crystallizes his stance (return tomorrow) with visible cost (aching back, lighter satchel), though the cost is gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (jetty, twilight, dead ocean). The piece accumulates through density of image and ritual action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he has planted a garden on a gravestone, translating submerged concord into a new tongue, with the visible cost of labor and the promise to return tomorrow. The closure reweights the opening premise—stubbornness against loss—through the final image of dark soil patches breaking grey stone. One tightening: the birds' instructions narrow his choices from abstract intent to specific placement and seed selection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The jetty's alien blooms, dead reef, and weathered fissure constrain the coachman's work: he finds a basin, prepares soil in cracks, places seeds in specific micro-environments. The setting charges the final image—dozens of soil patches breaking uniform grey—and the narrow/vast spatial opposition mirrors the thematic tension. Sensory detail is vivid (chemiluminescent blooms, cold stone, perfume/silence contradiction) and filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. The body in space (kneeling, aching back) grounds the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting hope on a dead ocean's edge—is signaled immediately. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the birds' cryptic calls complicate his choices (salt depth, silt pockets), forcing him to translate their language into specific seed and placement decisions. One meaningful tightening: the gull's spiral descent leads him to the basin, narrowing his options from abstract to concrete. The ending forecloses passivity (he will return tomorrow) with visible cost (labor, depleted satchel). Coincidence does not resolve; the birds guide but do not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—atonement through patient restoration—emerges from particulars (seed pods, fissures, bird calls) without thesis statement. The final image ("planted a garden on a gravestone, a narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question of stubborn renewal. Subtext operates in the birds as "frantic librarians" and the coachman's quiet ritual. The "submerged concord" motif recurs with shifted meaning: first as belief, then as action ("translated…into a new tongue"). No moralizing; the piece embraces complexity (he hasn't restored the ocean, only planted seeds).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices fissures, soil texture, seed properties—what matters for his work. Diction is elevated but consistent ("chemiluminescent," "tabernacle," "submerged concord") and voice-motivated for a solitary ritualist. The birds' language is rendered as translated interiority ("The salt is too deep here"), clean free indirect. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during seed-planting, wider during birds' chorus. No head-hopping. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagistic with strong propulsion. Opening line ("where the world ended and stubbornly began anew") anchors voice and stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no runs of identical stems. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph 2 ("He carried…drove…was…had come…knelt…opened") slows momentum slightly but remains voice-coherent. Metaphors are controlled ("stone finger," "library of potential futures," "ocean's frantic librarians") without muddle. The final image ("narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark") recharges the opening "narrow vastness." Clarity high; no loops or paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—coachman who speaks dead languages via bird calls to plant seeds on a dead reef—synthesizes eco-elegy, ritual labor, and linguistic mediation into a specific, non-obvious frame. The birds as "frantic librarians" and the translation mechanic feel fresh. Emotional specificity (quiet atonement, patient hope) avoids generic templates. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. Risk is moderate: elevated diction and lyric pacing could alienate some readers, but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous works detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman's choices (kneeling, opening satchel, selecting seeds per bird calls, fertilizing fissure, pressing seeds) create every key beat. He is present in all three gates and drives the closure (standing, satchel lighter, promise to return). Decisions alter tactics (walk to basin, choose Cliff-Thistle vs. Ghost-Lily). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity high (no generic "man"). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The seed-pod collection appears in setup (opened with reverence, described), development (seeds selected and pressed per bird guidance), and closure (satchel "significantly lighter"). Handled on-page in three beats. The collection's depletion charges the final image (he has given something, must return). Causal role: enables the central action. High specificity (spiny spheres, feathered wisps, dense kernels). Slightly below indispensable only because the precise variety matters less than the act.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" appears early (belief in harmony sunk but lingering), shapes motivation (atonement, reclamation), and returns at closure ("translated the submerged concord into a new tongue"). It drives the dominant stake (restore harmony) and tactics (planting as translation). Present in all three gates. Causal linkage moderate: it frames intent but does not constrain specific choices. The phrase itself is somewhat abstract; the on-page work (seeds, birds, soil) carries more concrete pressure. Swappability moderate; "lost harmony" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The trait (speaks dead languages via bird calls) appears in setup (he listens, understands Pearl-fin and Leviathan echoes), middle (birds' calls instruct seed and placement choices: "salt too deep," "sweet silt," "iron-hard seed," "gossamer pod"), and closure (birds give "grim satisfaction" and fly inland). Constrains tactics: he depends on their guidance. Causal pressure high: without this ability, he cannot choose correctly. Cost: he must wait, listen, heed. Irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Fertilize" is the central physical action: he takes loam, works soil into stone, prepares beds, presses seeds. Present in setup (satchel holds loam), development (fingers working soil into fissure), and closure (dozens of patches now break grey). The entire middle sequence is fertilization. Major turns trace to this act: it enacts the translation of concord, alters the jetty's state, and charges the final image (dark soil vs. uniform grey). Irreplaceable; "plant" alone would not capture the preparatory labor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bird-call method appears in setup (he listens, can translate), development (calls direct every seed choice and placement: staccato = Cliff-Thistle, wail = Ghost-Lily; spiral descent = basin location), and closure (unified cry of satisfaction, then departure). Mechanics matter: the calls are rendered as specific instructions, and he obeys. Without this method, he has no way to choose correctly; the story's logic depends on it. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all strong. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight provides the physical stage and constraints: fissure for basin, weathered rock requiring soil, salt spray, alien blooms pulsing. Setting pressures choices (where to plant, which seeds suit salt/silt). Appears in setup (opening description), development (he walks jetty, finds basin, reads fissures), and closure (dozens of patches on jetty). Micro-setting (fissure, basin) alters tactics. The twilight→night progression tracks time and charges the ending (first star, violet sky→canopy of night). Strong causal role and closure linkage. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" appears in setup ("decades after the reef died") and frames the entire premise (dead ocean, atonement). It establishes loss as the story's ground state and motivates the coachman's work. Present at closure implicitly (the reef remains dead; he plants on its gravestone). The timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no urgency or countdown—but it shapes the dominant stake (restoration after catastrophe). Two gates (setup, thematic closure). Causal pressure moderate; swappability low (any other catastrophe would change tone). Contributes but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation (let a garden reclaim a battlefield) is dramatized in setup (opening the satchel, kneeling), development (every planting action), and closure (dozens of patches, promise to return). Friction is gentle—birds complicate but do not oppose—so the want/cost tension is lower than ideal. The labor itself (aching back, lighter satchel) embodies cost. The motivation is irreplaceable; removing it leaves no story. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Slightly short of indispensable only because the friction is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness"—the single jetty path across immeasurable ocean loss—is established in setup ("narrow vastness he had come to know"), modulates through the piece (fissures vs. expanse, silence vs. perfume), and charges the final image ("narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark"). Tone coheres: elegiac, purposeful, stubbornly hopeful. The opposition (narrow/vast) structures the entire piece and reweights at closure. Strong specificity and closure linkage. Irreplaceable; swapping it would flatten the thematic tension.</comment>
