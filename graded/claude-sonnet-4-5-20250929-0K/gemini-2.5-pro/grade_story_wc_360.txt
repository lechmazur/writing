<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is given a consistent internal drive—understanding emotion as mathematics—that shapes his actions throughout. The borrowed-personality trait is shown embodied (taking on Anya's cadence, her posture of grief) and constrains his method. Anya's interiority is thinner; her grief is more object than lived contradiction, which limits the relational crucible. The final separation reads as earned stasis for Elias, but Anya's shift feels more conceptual than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elias, Anya), where (topaz workshop), and the temporal frame (between constellations) by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the machine's ritual until the final embossed card reconfigures Anya's grief as geometry. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (her unbearable weight "recontextualized," not removed); the cost is disorientation and the loss of unmediated feeling. One strong deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The topaz walls, halo fragment, and letterpress are rendered with tactile specificity and constrain Elias's method (he lowers the lens, pulls the lever). The timeframe between vanishing stars pressures the ritual window. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's detached focus (geometry, light, metal clicking like bones) versus Anya's emotional disorientation. The embossed card—a captured nebula—charges the final image and makes the setting's alchemy indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Anya seeks to "unmake a feeling"; Elias seeks its mathematics. The press ritual tightens once, transposing her grief into cold geometry and yielding the card. That single deepening narrows Anya's options (she cannot unsee the shape of her sorrow) and forecloses emotional simplicity. The cost is legible—disorientation, the unbearable weight "recontextualized" but not vanished. One meaningful turn suffices under the Accumulative lens; Elias's agency drives the beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: empathy as mirror, grief as fractal, feeling as equation. The embossed symbol is her sorrow's architecture, not comfort—a non-literal answer to her plea. Elias's obsession with "elegant, terrible mathematics" resists tidy resolution; Anya leaves disoriented, clutching a piece of her soul. The halo fragment and press ritual accrue thematic weight without thesis statements. The final image—newborn stars, card in hand—reweights the opening's "vanishing" without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Elias's POV cleanly; his perceptual signature (empathy as data, sorrow as theorem) is distinct. The prose modulates: detached geometry during the press operation, then "lucid turbulence" as air thickens. Anya's brief quoted whisper contrasts with Elias's dry rasp, though she speaks only twice. Minor filter-verb density ("seemed to," "realized with") in the final paragraph slightly dulls immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (topaz catching starlight "like honey," lead slugs "clicking like bones") is controlled and specific. Two micro-loops appear: "singularity" and "perfect, unbroken curve" restate the same geometric idea adjacently; "the shape of it" echoes "architecture of their feelings" within three lines. The final paragraph stacks two "she realized" constructions. No clarity loss at closure, but density wavers slightly under pressure. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress as emotional calculus engine, halo fragment as divine-physics relic—feels specific and non-obvious. "Transposed empathy" and borrowed personalities are not stock tropes; the press ritual and fractal grief-card avoid sentimental resolution. Risk-taking (cosmic workshop, grief as geometry) heightens stakes without obscuring the arc. The closing image—Anya stepping into newborn stars with her soul's map—resonates as both inevitable and fresh. No close echoes of famous templates detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias frames the story, performs the ritual (lowering the lens, pulling the lever), and refuses comfort—his choices drive all major beats. His cryptic withholding ("Structure requires pressure") disorients Anya as intended. Present in setup, middle, and closure; his detachment charges the final separation. Removing him collapses the entire causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears first as description ("crystallized light… relic from a place where physics and divinity were the same word"), then Elias lowers the brass-and-crystal lens over it to focus its power, and it flares at the climax to cast "sharp, dancing shadows that seemed to rewrite the room's geometry." Three distinct beats; its divine-physics nature enables the transposition. Swapping it for generic "magic crystal" would flatten the tone. High integration, just shy of indispensable because the press mechanism could theoretically function without this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named and executed: Elias experiences Anya's grief "not as pain, but as a complex, elegant equation." The concept shapes his method and the card's output. It appears in setup (motivation), middle (the press operation), and closure (the embossed fractal). Removing it would require a different metaphysics. Causal role across beats; specific irreplaceability. Minor cap: the mechanics are more lyric than tactical—Anya does not navigate altered empathy mid-scene—so it trends high mid-band rather than top tier.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Habitually borrows personalities" is shown twice: Elias adopts Anya's posture and cadence early ("his own shoulders stooped," voice mimicking "unshed tears"), then at closure "her borrowed personality had vanished from his posture." The trait enables his diagnostic method and charges the final withdrawal. Present in setup and closure; causal role is visible. Cap at mid-band: it does not constrain a middle choice or create visible cost—Elias's borrowing aids rather than complicates his work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as method: Elias uses "deliberate ambiguity… a tool to disorient his subjects just enough to see the pure, unfiltered architecture of their feelings." Anya "felt exposed" and later "disoriented, as if she had been spun around." The action shapes his approach and her final state. Present in setup and closure; causally meaningful. Mid-band cap: disorientation is more outcome than turn—no middle beat where disorientation alters tactics or forces a new choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is signaled early ("Structure requires pressure"—leaving Anya to decipher), identified as his "primary method," and paid off in her final disorientation. It shapes his diagnostic tactic and her inability to parse comfort from architecture. Present across setup, middle rationale, and closure effect. Solid integration; just below high band because the method is more atmospheric frame than on-page constraint—Anya does not navigate competing interpretations in real time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored early, provides the press and halo fragment, and its walls "vibrate" during the ritual, light swirling into "lucid turbulence." Spatial grounding is clean; the setting enables the transposition. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Mid-to-solid band: the workshop supplies resources and charges atmosphere but does not constrain a choice—Elias could perform the ritual elsewhere with the same tools. Micro-setting (press, fragment) does more causal work than the walls themselves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Between the vanishing of one constellation and the birth of the next" frames the ritual window and bookends the story ("The vanishing was over… the next celestial pattern locking into place"). Time pressures the single-session structure and signals Elias's habitual rhythm. Present in setup and closure; lyric reprise reweights the passage. Cap at mid-band: the timeframe is poetic container, not live countdown—no middle beat where the clock narrows Elias's options or forces a rushed choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's drive to "understand [emotion's] fundamental mathematics" is stated early, embodied in his detached observation ("elegant equation unfolding in his mind"), and satisfied at closure ("the elegant, terrible mathematics he had just proven"). The motivation shapes his refusal of comfort and his data-extraction posture. Present across all three gates; causes his method and final withdrawal. Solid integration; minor friction: the motivation is told more than shown in conflicted choice—Elias never hesitates or sacrifices another goal for this one.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is embodied in the climax: "thick with a feeling… profoundly alien—cold, geometric, and vast" and "topaz walls… vortex of lucid turbulence." Tone modulates from cryptic quiet (setup) through sensory storm (middle) to "deafening" silence and disorientation (closure). Coherent across turns; charges the final image of Anya clutching the card, "dizzied," under newborn stars. High integration; the exact phrase appears once, but its paradox—clarity within chaos—structures the entire emotional arc.</comment>
