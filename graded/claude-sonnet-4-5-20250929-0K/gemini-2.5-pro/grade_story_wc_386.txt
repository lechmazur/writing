<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—salvaging pure truth from tragedy—but her interiority remains somewhat abstract and distant. The boy and the man are sketched through dream fragments rather than fully dramatized, which limits contradictory impulses and embodied emotion. The final release feels more thematically declared than earned through specific internal struggle. Micro-choices exist (deepening the trance, weaving truth through images) but lack visceral cost or genuine risk of failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers dream fragments that deepen into a coherent accusatory pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the boy's smile and the soul's release). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost—the boy freed, the man's facade dissolved—though the "borrowed starlight" final beat edges toward thematic summary rather than concrete image. One meaningful deepening (scattered cameos → unified dream theater) satisfies the length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (breath-hollowed space, blue million-year-old cold, weeping walls) and the melted snow globe functions as both anchor and constraint. The dream-ocean and the old research outpost are detailed enough to ground the climactic scene. The candle flames dipping during the trance and the final steadiness charge the closure moment, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility even though the dreamscape itself remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the truth that binds the boy and the man—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through dream fragments, then tightens when Elara creates the shared dreamscape and projects contradictory evidence. The man's dissolving facade and the boy's smile constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; Elara's agency is never tested by genuine opposition or risk of failure, and the resolution unfolds without visible sacrifice or tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the melted snow globe, the dream cameos, and the final image of truth salvaged from wreckage. The piece resists overt moralizing and allows dramatic irony (the man's repeated excuse, the boy's silence) to generate meaning. The final image—broken relic as memorial, borrowed starlight feeling like her own—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "borrowed starlight" in the closing line reads as slightly over-articulated thematic summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; diction is elevated but consistent with a specialized, solitary practitioner. Perceptual signature is present (the "breath-hollowed space," "wreck-diver of a peculiar sort") and voice modulates appropriately under pressure. The phantom dialogue ("It was an accident") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "a lie solidified" and "psychic theater" edge toward expository labeling rather than trusting the image. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong figurative language ("human eclipse," "smile that doesn't reach his eyes"). However, several lines carry overwriting or near-redundancy: "delicate art, conducted in a trance state" could be tightened; "shimmering ocean" and "tide of slumbering minds" repeat the water metaphor within two sentences; "the profound lightness of a soul released" edges into abstract summary. Template cadence appears in the dream-cameo list ("He stands… he watches… He never speaks"). Information density is high, but a paraphrase loop around the man's "carefully constructed excuse" and "manufactured dream" slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—ghost whisperer analyzes dream cameos to expose a hidden crime—is specific and fresh, and the melted snow globe as psychic anchor is a strong, concrete detail. However, the core structure (gather clues, confront villain, release victim) follows a familiar investigative arc. The dream-weaving method and the glacier shrine setting provide distinctive texture, but the emotional resolution (boy smiles, fades, Elara feels lightness) concludes without a non-obvious turn or complication. Risk is present in the elevated register and dream logic, but the piece does not fully transform its genre scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as wreck-diver ghost whisperer is signaled in the opening paragraph, drives the middle investigation (gathering dream fragments, creating the shared dreamscape), and shapes the closure (weaving truth, witnessing the boy's release). Her choices—deepening the trance, projecting evidence—create the key turn that exposes the man and frees the boy. Specific cost: the candle flames dip, the air grows heavy, and she must borrow starlight to whisper truth. Irreplaceable; the story would collapse without her exact role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in the opening (shelf of ice, anchor and epicenter), recurs as the boy's perfect globe in dreams, and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning (no longer a prison, now a memorial). It constrains Elara's work (broadcasting the signal she tracks) and charges the closure image. Causal pressure is strong; cost connection is present (the melting marks the crime). Specificity is high; a different artifact would not carry the dual states (broken/whole) that articulate the boy's trauma and release.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Windows of connection are present throughout: Elara wades into the dream-ocean seeking "windows" in strangers' dreams, the boy's cameos are described as windows, and at closure "a window of connection opening directly to her" enables the boy's final smile. The concept shapes tactics (she must create a "bigger window" for full manifestation) and is indispensable to the method. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the concept functions more as metaphor than as a constraint with visible cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is named in the climactic scene and demonstrated through Elara's choice to project evidence from other dreams rather than accuse directly. The attribute enables the exposure (showing the man's cameos in banker and pilot dreams) and carries implied cost (restraint, precision). However, the trait is asserted more than it constrains; Elara does not face a temptation to be careless or a moment where weaving carefully versus bluntly accusing creates visible trade-off. Present in two beats (the method description and the climax) but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Expose" is the story's central action: Elara gathers evidence, creates the shared dream, projects the man's prior crimes, and whispers the accusation that dissolves his facade. The action drives the major turn (man's confident facade dissolves, boy's fear becomes finality) and redefines options (soul released, truth salvaged). Causal pressure is high; the exposure is not swappable. Minor friction: the actual exposure is more summary than dramatized confrontation; the man simply "wavers like smoke" without resistance or counter-move.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is signaled early ("unplanned cameo appearances that betray a spirit's lingering presence") and structures the investigation (wedding dream, exam dream, banker's nightmare, pilot's nightmare). It shapes Elara's attempts (she must gather these glimpses, then project them in the shared dream) and the mechanics matter to the closure (the contradictory cameos dissolve the man's lie). Present in setup and payoff, though the middle "gathering" phase is more told than shown in distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine in glacier ice is established in the opening paragraph with vivid detail (breath-hollowed, weeping walls, million-year-old cold) and returns at closure (candles steady once more). The setting provides the melted snow globe and the candles respond to Elara's trance (dipping low, then steady), creating a small constraint and atmospheric charge. However, the shrine does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions primarily as evocative backdrop. Lyric reprise (opening → closing) reweights the dominant stake slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to salvage something pure from the wreckage—is stated in the opening and dramatized throughout: Elara listens for souls, gathers fragments, and exposes the lie to release the boy. The desire is coherent and conflicted (she must borrow starlight, withstand sorrow, risk failure in the trance). Cost is present (weeks of vigil, the weight of tragedy) and the final image (salvaged truth, borrowed starlight feeling like her own) reweights the motivation with felt reward. Friction between "pure" and "wreckage" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight appears in the method description (Elara "borrows the starlight of a distant, dreaming astronomer" to whisper truth) and in the final line ("borrowed starlight of her work feels, for a moment, like her own"). The tone—fragile, mediated, ephemeral yet luminous—is coherent through the dream-weaving and modulates at closure (borrowed becomes briefly her own). However, the tone is more asserted than embodied in rhythm and diction; the piece's elevated register is consistent but does not shift cadence to heighten the "borrowed" quality under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights meaning.</comment>
