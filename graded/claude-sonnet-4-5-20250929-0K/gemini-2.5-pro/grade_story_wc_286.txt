<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's potter-specific perception (clay having memory, hands shaping earth back into purpose) is concrete and drives his choices. The final act—rebuilding the channel—shows clear agency with visible cost (forgetting food, forgetting night). Interior motivation is consistent throughout, though the "zen-minded" label does more work than embodied contradiction under pressure. The progression from observation to intervention feels earned, but the interiority remains somewhat externalized rather than showing simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly: Kaelen's understanding crystallizes through the completed channel work, and the answer to his question appears on-page with felt cost (his own small act woven into eternal memory). The accumulative/textural lens holds—each act of kindness deepens the thrum and brings visions more vividly until the final handful of clay completes the pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when watering the rose unlocks the vision, shifting his purpose from observation to restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The oasis setting constrains Kaelen's choices throughout: hexagonal hive shadows guide his tracking of light angles, the collapsed irrigation channel becomes the object he must repair, the spring is "the oasis's heart." Micro-setting elements (alluvial clay patch, rose bush against stone wall) charge the final image when his potter's hands shape earth "back into its purpose." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his craftsman's perception (clay "familiar and cool beneath his fingers"). The wasteland contrast creates urgent context without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightens when Kaelen grasps the phototropic-to-kindness principle. His choice to rebuild the channel is agency-driven with visible cost: he forgoes food and rest, committing his craft entirely. The escalation follows accumulative logic: observing → intuiting (glass shard) → testing (watering rose) → full commitment (channel repair). No forced reversals; pressure deepens through each compassionate act until the final answer arrives with his hands still clay-covered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the oasis resists wasteland through accumulated acts of care, demonstrated by Kaelen's own hands joining that history. The phototropic-kindness concept avoids label-speak by showing visions triggered by watering and rebuilding. The final image—"his own small act of kindness now woven into the oasis's eternal, gentle memory"—answers the central question without moralizing. "Built not of stone and wood, but of a thousand small, repeated acts of care" risks edge-of-sermonic but stays grounded in his physical clay work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature rooted in Kaelen's craft: "potter's intuition," "clay having a memory of the wheel," earth worked "not into a vessel, but back into its purpose." Diction stays character-consistent—"quiet deliberation of water finding its level" fits his zen-minded framing without slipping into therapy-speak. The prose modulates appropriately from observation to urgency ("forgetting food, forgetting the coming night"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully with few template stems. Minor overwriting in "the sun bled out" and "surrender its climb" could tighten, but figurative language doesn't dominate high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop near the end: "profound silence... quiet not of emptiness, but of peace" restates without added pressure (−0.2). The "thrum" motif returns effectively across beats without becoming mechanical. Propulsion is strong through the channel-building climax with clear sequence and no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The phototropic-kindness concept offers a fresh synthesis—places anchored by accumulated compassion rather than physical hardness. Kaelen's potter identity transforms the repair trope: he treats earth restoration as his craft, shaping clay "back into its purpose" rather than building a new vessel. The fractured-timeline mechanic (visions through lantern glass triggered by kind acts) feels specific and earned. Risk-taking is present but measured; the piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise without retreating to safer ground. The beekeeping-oasis particulars prevent generic mysticism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and his potter-specific skills drive the climax: he finds alluvial clay and rebuilds the channel with craftsman's hands. His "zen-minded" quality shapes perception (watching smoke flatten, letting breath out slowly) and motivates his patient observation before action. Two key decisions: watering the rose (unlocking visions) and rebuilding the channel (completing the answer). The character's craft-identity is indispensable to how the story resolves—a non-potter would lack both the skill and the conceptual frame ("clay having memory").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early (first scene, picking it up) and returns in the middle section ("which he now kept tucked in his shirt"), used to see visions during the channel work. It enables perception of fractured timelines but doesn't constrain a choice—Kaelen would rebuild the channel regardless. The glass functions as a viewing tool rather than shaping tactics or bearing cost. Present in two distinct beats (discovery, channel-building observation) with consistent properties (distortion lens for past), but swappable with another scrying object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape the core mechanic: past visions bleeding into present as Kaelen performs kind acts. The concept appears early (flicker through glass) and intensifies through the middle (woman tending roses, beekeepers in white suits) until the climax where "the past bled more vividly into his present." It provides his answer—kindness anchors timelines—and the visions alter his understanding, driving the shift from observation to restoration. The timelines don't constrain his actions but they reweight his motivation and charge the final realization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is dramatized on-page with visible cause-effect: watering the rose triggers the vision ("That was when the world dissolved"), and each repair section deepens the thrum and visions. The attribute constrains Kaelen's approach—only compassionate acts unlock the past—and enables his final understanding. The phrase itself is Kaelen's epiphany mid-story, then demonstrated through his channel work. The concept is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic for why his potter-work summons the visions and answers his question.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The thrum appears in the inciting beat (first felt as smoke flattens), sharpens when he handles the glass, grows strongest when light passes through apiary frames, swells into hum when he waters the rose, deepens into chord as he rebuilds the channel, then subsides at closure. It's the sensory manifestation of the fractured timelines and kindness principle, guiding Kaelen's tracking and signaling intensity. Major turns trace to thrum escalation: discovering the principle, committing to repair. Removing it would require reconstructing the story's entire sensory-feedback system.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Following sun patterns" is mentioned in the opening line (how he found the oasis) and returns when he tracks "precise angles of sunlight as they fell upon the ruins" to discover the thrum's strength. The method enables his arrival and observation but doesn't shape the climactic choice—the channel repair relies on potter's skill, not sun-tracking. Present in setup and middle development but absent from closure. Functional but could be replaced with another navigation/observation method without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis supplies every essential element: hexagonal hive-box shadows chart bee-flight paths that focus the thrum, the rose bush against the wall becomes the test site, the collapsed irrigation channel is the wound Kaelen must heal, alluvial clay nearby provides his material. The oasis's "stubborn green" depression contrasts the fired-ceramic wasteland, making visible why some places resist. The setting's every detail pressures and enables Kaelen's investigation and final act. Removing the beekeeping-specific features (hives, apiary frames, honey scent) would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" marks the inciting moment when Kaelen first feels the thrum—"the time... when the world held its breath." The phrase establishes a specific atmospheric condition (cooling air, stillness) that charges the opening. It reappears conceptually in "the coming night" urgency as he works without pausing. The timeframe creates a contemplative tone but doesn't tighten decisions—Kaelen's work spans "the next day" and continues until "the last sliver of the moon rose" without time-pressure tactics. Present in setup and closure framing but doesn't constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The question "why some places resist change" is foregrounded immediately ("simple, stubborn question... taken root in his zen-minded soul") and every action serves it: tracking sun patterns, observing the thrum, testing with the rose, rebuilding the channel. The motivation drives his shift from passive observation to active restoration when he grasps the kindness-anchor principle. His final realization ("Some places did not break because...") directly answers the question with visible cost—his own labor now woven in. The entire narrative arc is shaped by this inquiry; no other motivation would generate these specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" manifests in controlled contrasts: Kaelen's "quiet deliberation" paired with the wasteland's "brittle, grey ceramic," his "unthinking and pure" act of watering amid scorched ruin, precise craft-work as offering. Diction like "murdered" for the shed (cut from final draft) would sharpen further, but "skeletal apricot trees" and "tough, waxy leaves" carry edge within the oasis's tenacity. Tone modulates from meditative opening through discovery's intensity to the "profound silence... of peace" at closure. The gentleness charges rather than softens the final image; coherent throughout without single-note flatness.</comment>
