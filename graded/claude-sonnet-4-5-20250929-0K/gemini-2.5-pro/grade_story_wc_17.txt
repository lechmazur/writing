<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession and perceptual signature are distinct and character-specific. Her choice to return the negative and leave the evidence in the fireplace is clearly motivated by her ethos ("not hers to carry, only to chart") and forecloses the path of exposing the legacy. Minor weakness: the internal contradiction between professional curiosity and ethical restraint could be more viscerally embodied under pressure; the final choice reads deliberate but calm rather than fought-through.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara records the burden without claiming it, renouncing intervention with visible cost—she leaves evidence that could reshape historical understanding. The accumulative layering (corridor hum → journals → negative → final notation) builds density and the cadence shift at "leaving the ghosts to their ivy-veiled passage" reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening is present and cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, damp flagstones, and the fireplace maw anchor setting and pressure. The film negative caught in sunlight is a vivid micro-setting moment that charges the climactic discovery. The post-climate-shift world is sketched efficiently through "resurgent green" and "the generation that witnessed the world change." The fireplace functions as both spatial anchor and symbolic locus, constraining Elara's final choice to leave the journals where she found them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering what walls dream about, which tightens into "a burden of knowing" when Elara uncovers the Prometheus formula. The escalation is driven by her agency (kneeling, tracing soot, piecing narrative, choosing to replace the negative). The cost is clear: she forgoes exposing a catastrophic legacy to honor professional boundaries, a renunciation that forecloses intervention. One meaningful deepening—realizing the formula was an accelerant—narrows her options and charges the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated images: the walls' hum of anxiety, the scientist's guilt, the film negative as "seed of hope" turned "contagion." The final notation "A burden of knowing" and the act of leaving the evidence offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without stating a moral. The story engages the ethics of witnessing and recording versus intervening, honoring complexity without tidy resolution. The conceptual repricing—that some dreams are nightmares best left undisturbed—reweights the cartographer's ethos with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature is consistently filtered through her professional lens: "sigh of settling dust from the ghost of a footstep," "walls hummed with...anxiety." Diction remains stable and voice-particular ("corridor echo cartographer," "legacy's burden"). Distance is controlled throughout; no head-hopping. Minor slip: the scientist's diary voice ("the floods are my children") is vivid but borders on over-articulated poetic register for a person mid-breakdown, though it remains within plausible bounds for a precise, scientific mind under duress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The air was thick with the scent of moss and the memory of rain" establishes atmosphere and temporal layering). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor texture debt: "charted" recurs four times in slight paraphrase (charted acoustics, charted before, charting tools, chart and move on), creating subtle synonym drift that does not obscure clarity but reduces freshness. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—corridor echo cartographer discovering a climate-catastrophe formula through acoustic mapping—synthesizes genre elements (post-apocalyptic, archival mystery) with fresh specificity. The film negative preserved in fire is a striking, non-obvious detail. Elara's choice to leave the evidence rather than expose it subverts the expected reveal-and-confront arc. Minor proximity concern: the "walls dream" frame and the ethical renunciation echo familiar archivist-versus-truth dilemmas without fully transforming them through on-page friction or a second live constraint that tests her ethos under direct pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Corridor echo cartographer is signaled in the opening sentence, frames her perceptual method throughout (discerning "sigh of settling dust from ghost of a footstep"), and drives her final choice to chart rather than expose. Setup, development (piecing the journals), and payoff (the notation and replacement) are all present. The profession's ethos—"not hers to carry, only to chart"—narrows her options at closure with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing the profession would break the logic of her restraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Film negative strip appears at the midpoint (tucked between pages), is lifted to sunlight for the climactic glimpse of the Prometheus diagram, and is deliberately replaced at the end. Three distinct beats. It enables the key discovery but could theoretically be swapped for another preserved artifact (a sketch, a microfiche) with moderate edits to the fireplace logic. The specificity—"fantastically complex molecular diagram"—and the act of returning it charge the closure but do not render it fully indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is signaled early ("legacy's burden, a feeling she had charted before"), drives the middle discovery (scientist's guilt, "the floods are my children"), and is crystallized in the final notation "A burden of knowing." The concept shapes Elara's dominant stake and her closing choice to leave the evidence, altering tactics (she does not take the negative or report the formula). Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong; the concept is indispensable to the story's thematic and structural arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive hearing is named in paragraph two ("her own sensitively perceptive hearing, trained to discern...") and enables her professional method. It informs the accumulative texture (she hears the walls' hum, resolves echoes into pacing and arguments) but does not constrain or visibly trade off against another option under pressure. The trait is more a skill-set enabler than a lived friction. Present across beats, functionally relevant, but not irreplaceable—keen observation or practiced attention could substitute with minor rephrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glimpse occurs at the story's peak (lifting the negative to sunlight, "she could glimpse the image it held") and directly reveals the Prometheus formula, the major turn that redefines the legacy from failure to active accelerant. Setup (finding the negative), development (cross-referencing with diary), and payoff (the realization and return) are all present. The action is central to the closure realization. Moderate swappability: "examined," "deciphered," or "studied" could replace "glimpse" with minor tonal cost, but the quick, partial nature of "glimpse" fits the fragility and incompleteness of the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in the fireplace are signaled when Elara kneels by the hearth, structure the middle investigation (fractured chronicle, agitated script, the Prometheus caption), and house the film negative that drives the climactic discovery. The fireplace's role as site of attempted erasure ("tried to burn his research") is causal; it explains the diaries' condition and the miracle of the negative's survival. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the method is indispensable to the narrative's logic and the closure choice to return the journals to the hearth.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage is named in the opening, establishes post-shift atmosphere, and bookends the story in the final line ("leaving the ghosts to their ivy-veiled passage"). The passage itself does not constrain Elara's choices; the fireplace and study do the spatial work. The ivy functions as a lyric marker of time and reclamation, reappearing with slight reweighting at closure. Two-gate lyric reprise (setup and payoff) with thematic resonance but minimal causal pressure; swappable with "moss-covered" or "overgrown" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After the climate shifts is anchored in the opening ("born from the silence after the climate shifts") and informs world texture (resurgent green, the generation's anxiety, the scientist's guilt over floods). The timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock; it is backdrop. Setup and thematic development present, but no payoff constraint at closure. Functional and purposeful but replaceable with another post-catastrophe premise (war, plague, economic collapse) with moderate rewrites to the scientist's guilt and the Prometheus formula.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To discover what walls dream about is stated in paragraph one, frames Elara's professional method, and is answered in the climactic resolution: "The dream of these walls was a recurring nightmare of that single, catastrophic act." Setup, development (listening to echoes, interpreting the hum), and payoff (the final notation and her choice to leave the dream uncharged) are all present. The motivation drives her restraint at closure—she charts the dream without claiming it. Strong causal and thematic integration; irreplaceable without breaking the story's logic.</comment>
