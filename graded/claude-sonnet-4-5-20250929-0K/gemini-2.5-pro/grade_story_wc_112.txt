<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn with concrete physicality (hydraulic-stained hands, scars) and a consistent professional temperament. His interior life is mostly embodied through perception and micro-choices, though the climactic vertigo moment edges toward abstract epiphany ("infinite, sprawling map"). The emotional progression from obliging mechanic to profoundly re-calibrated observer is earned by the on-page event. Aris functions primarily as motivational pressure rather than a full secondary character, but his trembling hands and tears provide embodied contrast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear (sky mechanic, research station, violet gas giant). The causal chain is clean: Aris needs steady hands → Elias pulls lever → hologram shifts → both men grasp the implication. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's understanding is "irrevocably re-calibrated," the device worked, and the cost is conceptual—his sense of singular selfhood is dissolved into "multitudes." The inferred lens is Causal with Conceptual Repricing overlay at the end, and it holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The violet gas giant, crystalline-winged lepidoptera, and icy-warm station air create a vivid, specific world. The lever, hologram lattice, and Elias's left-behind hydro-spanner all constrain or charge key moments. Spatial choreography (observation deck, the device's core, diagnostic screen placement) is clean. The "mechanically warm" device energy is a purposeful sensory contradiction that recurs and tensions the "icy warmth" motif, grounding the conceptual shift in physical experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and singular: prove Aris's theory of lateral time. Pressure tightens through the alignment sequence (Aris's instruction, Elias's hesitation, the lever pull). Agency is collaborative but Elias's physical action triggers the result. The cost is conceptual and existential—Elias loses the linear simplicity of selfhood—and it's legible in "falling sideways into an ocean of possibility." One meaningful tightening (the lever pull) generates the closure turn, satisfying causal escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—multiplicity of the present, choices as co-existing rather than sequential—emerges organically from the holographic echo and is charged by the hydro-spanner detail (a different tool, a different now). The final image of "multitudes" reweights Elias's entire lived experience without stating a moral. The "mechanically warm" / "icy" diction braiding and the waking-wing thunder closing the frame create resonant bookends. No thematic echo or sermon; the epiphany is particular and embodied in vertigo and the two-hands gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct ("obliging," "mechanically warm," "icy warmth"). Aris's dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven, though brief. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the lever pull and the hologram shift. Minor register drift appears in "co-existing moments rather than a single, forward-marching line" and "inextricable" phrasing, which edges toward exposition, but the perceptual signature (mechanic's hands, tool awareness) holds throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and propulsive with strong imagery ("continent-sized lepidoptera," "icy warmth," "falling sideways"). Some minor scaffolding: "This was the hush" and "It was one of the most subdued awakenings imaginable" front-load commentary rather than trusting the image. The phrase "a mechanically warm and deeply resonant truth" in the climax is slightly abstract and repeats the motif label rather than letting the image speak. Rhythm varies well; no loops or template cadence. One paraphrase near the end ("he knew that his understanding…re-calibrated forever" restates the vertigo moment) costs ~0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "lateral time / adjacent now" premise is fresh and the holographic-echo visualization is specific and non-obvious. The hydro-spanner detail (left on the workbench, held in the echo's hand) is a memorable particular that grounds the abstraction. The combination of hard-SF device and quiet, interior closure avoids template beats. Risk is moderate: the concept could have leaned harder into causal consequence or character friction. The ending's reflective turn is earned but slightly comfortable; a bolder friction would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, frames the opening, and his steadiness enables the device activation. His lever pull is the pivotal action and his interior vertigo provides the closure image. His role is collaborative rather than solo-decisive, but removing him would break the causal chain and the focalization. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is set up early (twilight, orbital resonance, planetary stillness), motivates the entire experiment, and is present in the device's function. It does not appear explicitly in the final image but enables the holographic shift that drives closure. Two beats (setup, activation) with clear causal pressure. Swappable with "quantum field" or similar without major rewrites, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" is signaled in the title-like phrase ("one of the most subdued awakenings imaginable"), shapes the tonal approach (no flash, no violence), and the echo's quiet appearance is the core event. The concept constrains both method and emotional register, and the final image (waking wing thunder, "multitudes") directly reprises and charges it. Indispensable to tone, structure, and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" is used three times: the device radiates it, the realization settles as it, and the station air is reframed by it at the end. It tensions the "icy" cold throughout and charges the final reconfiguration. The trait does not enable a discrete action with visible cost but provides sensory and conceptual continuity that reweights the ending. Purposeful and specific, though not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lever pull is the story's hinge: prepared across two paragraphs, executed with tactile specificity ("oiled click"), and directly triggers the holographic shift. The closure effect (echo appearance, Elias's vertigo, Aris's tears) cascades from this single action. Removing it would require a total rewrite. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Holographic principles are set up early (the translucent image in the device's core, the projection language), enable the method, and the echo is explicitly holographic ("made of silver light"). The mechanics matter to the experiment's logic. It does not constrain a mid-story choice and could be replaced with "quantum scan" or similar with moderate edits. Two gates (setup, payoff) but limited middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station frames the entire scene, supplies the observation deck and device, and the station's life-support sigh punctuates Aris's vindication. The violet gas giant and lepidoptera plains provide sensory pressure and the "hush" timeframe. The setting enables the experiment and charges the atmosphere but does not constrain a tactical choice. Strong setup and payoff, moderate middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hush (beating wings at rest) is the story's temporal window, mentioned in the opening and closing (waking wing thunder). It creates urgency ("fleeting wrinkle," "sacred window") and the experiment depends on it. The timeline is tracked: twilight begins, experiment runs, wings wake as it concludes. The timeframe tightens the stakes and bookends the action, providing clear causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aris's motivation (prove lateral time) drives the setup, dialogue, and device design. It is dramatized through his trembling hands, tears, and pariah status. Elias inherits the stakes through his participation and the vertigo-closure hinges on the theory's confirmation. The desire faces friction (doubt, delicate calibration, the theory's controversial status) and the on-page proof costs Elias his prior worldview. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is seeded early (device's "mechanically warm energy" vs. "encroaching chill"), recurs in the charged-air moment ("icy warmth of a held breath"), and is reprised in the final lines ("icy air…like a cradle"). The tonal contradiction supports the conceptual theme (coexisting opposites) and modulates from ambient description to emotionally charged metaphor at closure. Coherent, purposeful, and indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>
