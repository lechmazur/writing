<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elias's motivation is clear and sustained—cataloging silence to pursue empathy—and the synesthetic attribute ("taste colors and hear textures") generates distinct perceptual choices during the frequency-tuning sequence. The memory-triggered insight that shifts the dial "past the measured increments to a place that just *felt* right" shows interiority driving the climactic action. However, the grandmother remains a placeholder; no contradictory impulses complicate Elias's reverence, and the final shelving gesture lands without visible emotional cost or foreclosed alternative, weakening the sense of earned transformation.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The piece sustains a causal lens: Elias's choice to tune by memory rather than machine readings unlocks the clasp, and the fireworks frame creates escalating time pressure. The closure—a click followed by shelving the unread diary—delivers a clear before/after (locked → open, pursuit → preservation) with thematic cost (foregoing the words to honor the silence). One structural seam mars clarity: the phrase "recovering that silent feeling was enough" tells closure rather than letting the shelf-label and fireworks counterpoint dramatize it, costing full high-band entry.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The workshop is anchored early with sensory specifics—ozone, old paper, copper wires "thin as spun hair"—and the fireworks timeframe tightens spatial pressure (thud through floorboards, sky visible from window). The leather-bound diary and brass clasp become tactile focal points that constrain the tuning sequence. The setting does not force a mid-scene choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it frames rather than pressures, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the clasp to recover its emotional frequency—is signaled early and tightened by the fireworks countdown ("Time was running out"). Elias's pivot from machine to memory at the climax demonstrates protagonist agency under the causal lens. The cost remains conceptual rather than visceral: no foreclosed path is dramatized (he could have walked away, continued machine-only tuning, or opened the diary later), and the final smile undercuts urgency, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—empathy through honoring unspoken emotion—emerges from the tuning sequence and shelf-label without overt moralizing. The fireworks/silence counterpoint charges the final image, and the choice not to read the diary embodies thematic commitment. One line weakens execution: "recovering that silent feeling was enough" states the theme rather than trusting the dramatized act and labeled shelf to carry it, costing eligibility for 9+.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The voice sustains a theatrical-poetic register—"varieties of silence," "velvet fabric," "chrysanthemums of gold"—with synesthetic interiority that remains character-particular throughout. Psychic distance stays close; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Dialogue to the diary and machines ("Now, my dear") integrates voice with action. Minor strain: "feeling in his chest" is generic at a peak beat, and "smiled" at closure lacks the embodied contradiction that would elevate the ending to 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms vary purposefully, and figurative language (foghorn sorrow, sun-warmed stone) stays coherent without mixed metaphors. Information density is high in the tuning sequence. Two issues prevent higher: the phrase "recovering that silent feeling was enough" is scaffolding summary mid-closure; and "a surge of insight, he twisted the dial" tells the pivot rather than showing perceptual cues that trigger it. No loops or template cadence weaken the ending beat, so penalties stay modest.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—synesthetic pacifist tuning emotional frequencies in metal under a fireworks deadline—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The locked-diary-as-silence premise transforms a familiar object through the cataloging frame. The ending pivot (memory over machine) feels earned in hindsight. Modest deduction: the shelf-label finale ("The Silence of Unwavering Devotion") risks preciousness, and the fireworks counterpoint, while vivid, operates more as poetic frame than causal pressure, keeping ingenuity in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elias as "eclectic pacifist" is established early and drives the choice to catalog rather than read; his pacifism toward the diary's privacy motivates the frequency method and the final shelving decision. He appears in all three gates (setup, tuning sequence, closure). The trait shapes two beats—rejecting intrusion, pivoting to memory—and the closure choice to leave the diary unread coheres with his reverence. However, "pacifist" itself does not constrain a specific on-page cost (he faces no live temptation to violate the diary; the choice is pre-decided), limiting causal pressure and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The locked diary clasp is handled in multiple beats: initial placement, wire attachment, frequency scanning, and the climactic click. Its physical state (locked → open) drives escalation and marks the closure unit. Removing the clasp would collapse the central conflict and the tactile sequence. Strong integration across all three gates with closure linkage. Minor swappability (another locked object could serve similar function with moderate rewrites) and the fact that the *diary's words* are narratively irrelevant (only the clasp's metal matters) prevent a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The "path to empathy" is articulated early as Elias's grand motivation and returns in the closing reflection ("felt a little closer to the soul"). It shapes his refusal to read the diary and his commitment to cataloging silence. Present in setup and closure; absent from the middle tuning sequence, where mechanics dominate. The concept functions as thematic frame rather than on-page constraint; no mid-scene choice tests competing empathy tactics or trades off understanding for other stakes. Lyric reprise earns modest credit, but lack of middle friction or causal pressure keeps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Intuitively descriptive" (synesthesia) is demonstrated early and drives the tuning sequence: tasting "sharp, metallic anger," hearing "mournful blue," seeking "sun-warmed stone" warmth. This trait enables the memory-based pivot ("a frequency in itself, a gentle, steady hum in his mind's ear") that unlocks the clasp. Present in setup, middle problem-solving, and implicit in the closure success. Causal pressure is clear: without synesthetic perception, the dial adjustment fails. Slight swappability (another sensory gift could serve) and lack of visible tradeoff (no cost to using the trait; it simply works) prevent 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>"Recover" defines the action from the opening declaration ("to recover the feeling stored") through the tuning attempts to the successful click and shelving. The verb frames every major beat and the closure unit ("recovering that silent feeling was enough"). Removing this action collapses the plot; substitution would require fundamental rewrites. Present across all gates with strong causal and thematic linkage. Caps below 8.5 because the action is abstract (recovering a feeling vs. a tangible object), reducing irreplaceability slightly, and the closure tells rather than fully dramatizing the recovery moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Tuning frequencies is signaled early, detailed through the dial-turning sequence, and produces the climactic clasp-opening. The mechanics matter: wrong frequencies taste/sound wrong, the correct one is "a sculpted void." Present in setup (device described), middle (escalating attempts), and closure (the click). Causal pressure is undeniable: without the frequency method, no unlock. Minor swappability (another resonance tech—ultrasound, magnetism—could substitute with rewrites) and the fact that the final twist relies on *memory* more than frequency science slightly reduce irreplaceability, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is established in the opening and returns in the closing window view. The workshop supplies the listening device and velvet cushion, and the stars/fireworks frame time pressure. Present in setup and closure; the middle sequence happens inside but could occur in any enclosed space with the device. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome (Elias could tune anywhere with his equipment). Lyric reprise (stars → fireworks) earns modest credit, but lack of causal pressure or micro-setting constraint keeps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"The final stillness before fireworks ignite" is named in the opening, tightened by the "low, pre-emptive thud" mid-scene, and paid off when "the first firework rocketed into the sky" just as the clasp opens. The timeframe creates urgency ("Time was running out") and structures the attempt. Present in all three gates with clear causal pressure on pacing. The clock does not force a tactical trade-off (Elias does not abandon a step or rush visibly), and the fireworks function more as poetic counterpoint than hard deadline, preventing a score above 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"To catalog the varieties of silence" is declared early and motivates the refusal to read the diary, the frequency search, and the labeled shelf at closure. Present in setup and closure; the middle tuning sequence enacts the cataloging but does not dramatize friction between this want and a competing desire or cost. The motivation is told and consistent but never conflicted on the page—no moment where reading the diary tempts him, no cost to cataloging beyond time spent. Thematic coherence and closure linkage earn mid-band credit; lack of on-page friction or trade-off caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is embodied in Elias's spoken addresses to the diary ("Now, my dear"), poetic interiority ("velvet fabric," "chrysanthemums of gold"), and the earnest pursuit of an eccentric goal. The tone coheres through escalation and modulates purposefully: heightened lyricism at the pivot, quiet satisfaction at closure. Present across all beats and charges the final image (fireworks as "counterpoint"). Minor tonal seam: the phrase "recovering that silent feeling was enough" dips into plain summary, briefly undercutting the theatrical register. Strong integration overall, but this single lapse at closure prevents 8.5+.</comment>
