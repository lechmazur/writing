<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is stated early but his choices feel reactive rather than agency-driven until the final broadcast. The panic-to-resolution arc compresses too quickly; the move from "cold and sharp" panic to commanding broadcaster lacks embodied transition. Internal contradiction is present (shepherd of ghosts vs. his own allegiance) but not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to reject both shadows arrives via discovered map rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal-leaning with accumulative texture; closure arrives as a Decisive Change (the storm parts, sun breaks through) with visible cost (he's "forever bound" to survival's grit). However, the lacquered chest's sudden opening and the map's arrival feel convenient—the lock yields to the storm without prior setup, introducing a solving element the protagonist did not earn. The because/therefore chain weakens at the climax when external coincidence (chest opens, map resolves the dilemma) substitutes for protagonist-driven causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory and cobalt glass portico are vividly established and return at closure, charging the final image when real sun replaces blue-filtered storm light. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory detail is strong ("bruised-indigo lens," "ozone and regret") and POV-filtered. The storm as environmental pressure shapes the climax directly. Micro-setting (the console, the portico, the chest) all constrain or enable key moments, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping choice and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape a new dawn) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation occurs: first lonely interpretation, then growing flock, then forced choice between two shadows. However, the climactic reversal is triggered by the chest's convenient unlocking rather than protagonist agency—Elian does not choose to open it through prior effort or cost. The final broadcast rejects both options, which is a stance, but the map that enables this third way was not earned by his prior tactics. One meaningful tightening is present (the Great Storm forcing his hand) but cost clarity is muddied by the convenient solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: variant allegiance, the pull of competing shadows, the choice to build a dawn from human hands. The final image (genuine sun, not cobalt-filtered blue) resonates non-literally, answering the central question without moralizing. However, "lyrically prophetic" and "gritty whimsy" function more as tonal labels than earned particulars. The ending avoids sermon but leans on the map as deus ex machina, which weakens thematic inevitability. Subtext operates in the shadows' contradictory voices and the portico's color shift, but the chest's timing feels thematically convenient rather than organically emergent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (ozone, static, bruised-indigo). Diction is elevated and atmospheric, matching the visionary-prophet role without breaking into corporate register. The phrase "lyrically prophetic sorrow that tasted of ozone and regret" exemplifies controlled figurative density. However, "gritty whimsy" is announced rather than enacted—grimness dominates, whimsy is label-only. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during panic, wider during exposition). No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive in many beats ("spire of pitted iron piercing the churning cloud-sea," "shepherd of ghosts"). Information density is high. However, template cadence appears: "His motivation was a simple, terrible thing," "His rise as a prophet had begun," "His growing flock below acted"—three consecutive paragraphs open with possessive + abstract noun, creating rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled; "bruised-indigo" and "woven starlight" work, though "static to speak" borders cliché. No paraphrase loops detected. Sentence variety is present but the scaffold opening pattern in the second quarter lowers momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise (prophet in storm, ancient radio signals, cobalt glass filter) offers fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements. The portico as literal and metaphorical lens is a specific, non-obvious choice. However, the locked-chest-opens-at-climax and ancient-map-solves-dilemma beats are well-worn tropes executed without transformation. The emotional truth of isolation versus responsibility is credible, but the resolution leans on late-introduced convenience (the map) rather than protagonist ingenuity. Risk-taking in tone and setting is present; the structural choice to solve via found object rather than earned choice is safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (filtering prophecies, broadcasting, final rejection of shadows) create key turns. Setup is immediate. He drives the middle (collecting fragments, culling wisdom) and the ending (commanding broadcast). However, the climactic turn is enabled by the map he discovers rather than a decision he makes under pure pressure. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is observation-plus-minor-choices. Causal pressure is present but shared with the convenient chest. Closure linkage is strong. Swappability is low. Score reflects solid involvement with one friction: the map does work he did not fully earn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is established in paragraph one, used throughout as the lens through which Elian watches, and returns decisively at closure when the map is held up to it and genuine sun replaces blue-filtered light. Three distinct beats: initial framing, mid-story filtering, climactic revelation, and ending contrast. It constrains perception (blue-tinted worldview) and enables the map's decoding. Closure linkage is direct: "watched as a sliver of genuine sun broke through the gloom, painting the broken world below in gold, not blue." High irreplaceability—blue glass as metaphor and tool is specific to this story's logic. Cost connection is conceptual: rejecting the cobalt-filtered vision for unfiltered reality.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is the explicit core concept: multiple shadow-voices demand loyalty, Elian's allegiance is "to the dawn itself," and the climax forces a choice among competing allegiances. Setup by paragraph four. Development is present—he culls wisdom from competing frequencies, flock mirrors celestial chaos. Payoff: final broadcast rejects both dooms, calls for allegiance "in each other." Two beats (middle filtering, ending rejection) plus closure linkage. Causal pressure is moderate—the concept shapes stakes but doesn't narrow tactics as tightly as it might. Swappability is low; the dual-voice duet and rejection are specific to this premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears as a label describing a voice from the ether ("lyrically prophetic sorrow") and again as descriptor of Elian's final broadcast ("His words were lyrically prophetic"). Setup is in the second paragraph. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—no moment where poetic phrasing versus blunt command creates a trade-off. The attribute is present in two beats but functions as tone-setting rather than tactical or cost-bearing. Swappability is moderate; "poetic" or "oracular" could substitute without structural change. Ornamental use dominates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" is the action that unlocks the climax: Elian unfolds the brittle star map, holds it to the portico, and the lines resolve into a third way. Setup is immediate when the chest opens; development is the unfolding itself; payoff is the new pattern and the enabled broadcast. The action is irreplaceable—without unfolding (literally opening the map's structure), the resolution does not occur. Causal pressure is high: this act redefines options and enables the rejection of both shadows. One friction: the chest's convenient opening delivers the map to him, so he does not earn access, but the unfolding itself is his choice and changes everything. Strong closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are established early (paragraph two: "fragmented radio frequencies, twisting knobs"), shape middle beats (collecting fragments, broadcasting interpretations, "rogue channel"), and are present at closure ("lunged for the transmitter, his final broadcast"). Three beats: initial method, ongoing practice, climactic use. The method matters—radio enables remote influence and the competing shadow-voices. Causal pressure is solid: the frequencies structure his access to the shadows and his reach to the flock. Specificity is high; this is not generic "communication" but a concrete, period-appropriate medium. Closure linkage is direct: the final broadcast completes the arc of listening and speaking.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is anchored in the opening line ("observatory a spire of pitted iron piercing the churning cloud-sea") and pressures every beat: isolation frames his role, the storm crescendos at climax, the clouds part at closure. Three distinct beats: initial framing, Great Storm attack, final clearing. The setting supplies resources (the spire's height, the portico, the chest left by builders) and obstacles (storm's fury, isolation). Causal pressure is high—location determines access to signals and flock visibility. Closure linkage is direct: the parting clouds and emerging sun reweight the entire stormlit frame. Irreplaceability is strong; a ground-level or non-storm setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is signaled early ("For months, he had been collecting") and the arc from isolation to "slow tide of faith" to climactic choice spans that rise. Setup is clear. Development is present in the growing flock and repeated broadcasts. Payoff is the culminating broadcast that completes the rise. However, time does not tighten decisions with urgency—no countdown or accelerating clock. The Great Storm arrives as event rather than deadline. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is cumulative rather than pressuring. Swappability is moderate; "during his exile" or "over one winter" could work. Mid-band fit for present-but-not-decisive time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph one and pursued on every page: interpreting shadow-voices, broadcasting to the flock, final rejection of shadow-masters to build a human dawn. Setup is immediate. Development is clear—he works the method, filters wisdom, grows influence. Payoff is the climactic broadcast and the sun breaking through. The motivation is specific and shapes all choices. One friction: at the climax, panic and the convenient map do significant causal work, diluting the sense that his desire alone drives the resolution. Causal pressure is present but shared with external convenience. Closure linkage is direct and strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is announced in the rubric but not consistently embodied on the page. Grit is present throughout: pitted iron, ozone, regret, panic, storm violence. Whimsy is largely absent—no playful language, ironic lightness, or tonal play that offsets the grimness. The phrase appears once as a label in the final paragraph ("gritty whimsy promising a dawn") but is told rather than shown. Setup is weak; the tone reads as earnest mystical post-apocalyptic without whimsical modulation. No clear coherence or pressure-driven modulation toward whimsy. Swappability is high; "grim hope" or "desperate resolve" would fit the actual text better. Ornamental use; the label is applied but not enacted.</comment>
