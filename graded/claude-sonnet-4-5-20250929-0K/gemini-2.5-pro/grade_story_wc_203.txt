<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is concrete and embodied through his "weightless burden" and consistent upward gaze. The internal conflict between noting the anomaly and engaging is brief but genuine, with the ghost's anxiety providing external pressure. The choice to ascend the ladder and the tactile moment with the mainspring barrel demonstrate decision under pressure with visible cost (time, effort, spiritual engagement). Minor slip: the vision-flood feels slightly convenient as an information delivery mechanism rather than earned through Leo's own perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Leo completes the task the ghost could not, the spirit dissipates, and the final image—Leo holding the barrel, understanding he has "repaired a crack in the veil"—reweights the opening premise with felt cost (engagement with the spectral world, acceptance of his vocation). Drive lens is Causal with situational elements; the power cut triggers the ghost's full appearance, Leo's observation drives discovery, his choice to engage enables resolution. Orientation is clear by the third sentence. One meaningful tightening occurs when silence crashes down and the ghost resolves, narrowing Leo's options to ignore or engage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, purposeful detail: peeling paint, cracked clowns, phantom popcorn smell, greasy lift mechanism, stained acoustic tiles. The dust accumulation pattern on the ceiling tile becomes the key constraint that enables discovery—Leo cannot find the barrel without analyzing the disturbance. The rusted ladder's screech and the trapped-time smell from above charge the sensory experience. The setting embodies the core concept of "cracks in the façade" and directly enables the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Leo's choice to engage with the ghost's unease versus packing and leaving. The power cut meaningfully tightens pressure by removing artificial light and sound, allowing the ghost to resolve fully. The moment of choice—"This was the moment of choice, the fulcrum on which his quiet life teetered"—is dramatized with cost (physical effort, spiritual engagement, accepting his vocation). The escalation from routine repair work to spectral interaction is clear and earned. Minor slip: the ghost's resolution feels slightly automatic once Leo retrieves the barrel, with less friction than the setup promised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of incompleteness and repair emerges through concrete action: the clockmaker's unfinished carousel heart, Leo's dual role mending machines and spirits, the title's "cracks in the façade" literalized in cracked clowns and the hidden ceiling cavity. The ending avoids moralizing—"he had repaired a crack in the veil"—and offers resonance through the physical object as proof. Subtext operates in Leo's habitual upward gaze and "weightless burden" framing. Minor slip: "what ceilings hide" as motivation borders on thematic statement rather than pure dramatization, though it's grounded in Leo's consistent behavior.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Leo notices dust patterns, spectral residue, wiring diagrams, lift mechanisms—the world filtered through his dual expertise. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "liminal spaces," "phantom smell," "smudges of spiritual residue," "the drip of water somewhere deep." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ghost encounter. The vocabulary (horologist, mainspring barrel, hoist cables) fits Leo's technical background. No head-hopping; the ghost's history arrives via vision-jolt, maintaining POV boundary. Rhythm varies with pressure: longer sentences during setup, shorter during the climb and discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery: "silence crashed down," "beam cutting a sharp cone through the gloom," "furry grey blanket" of dust, "trapped time and dry rot." Information density is high in the middle section (dust analysis, tile selection, ladder placement). Minor artifacts: "the moment arrived, the one Leo both anticipated and quietly dreaded" tells what could be shown through action; "its form grew thinner, its edges blurring into the gloom until it was nothing more than a memory" stacks three phrases describing the same fade. The opening's "liminal spaces, the in-between places where machines slept and spirits stirred" borders on poetic overreach for the established voice, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—elevator technician who sees ghosts discovers a clockmaker's hidden component—synthesizes occupational specificity with supernatural detection in a fresh way. The dust-pattern method and the "cracks in the façade" concept feel earned rather than ornamental. The abandoned circus setting with its cracked clowns provides vivid particularity. Transformation test passes: changing Leo to another profession or the object to something generic would fundamentally alter the story's logic. The horologist/carousel detail and the fire backstory add texture without feeling researched-and-inserted. Risk-taking is present but not extreme; the piece executes its premise cleanly rather than subverting expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) is present throughout, drives the central choice (engage vs. leave), and his dual expertise enables the discovery. His occupation provides the setup (decommissioning the lift), his ghost-sight triggers the conflict (seeing the anxious spirit), and his technical observation (dust patterns) leads to resolution. The character shapes at least three beats: initial work, power-cut ghost appearance, ceiling investigation. Removing this exact character would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears in setup (as the hidden object Leo will seek), drives the middle choice (Leo must retrieve it), and provides closure (the ghost dissipates when Leo holds it; the final image is Leo's fist around the object). It is handled physically, its properties matter (brass, cool metal, dense), and it carries the story's thematic weight (incompleteness, repair). The vision-jolt it triggers reveals the ghost's backstory and completes the causal chain. Removing it would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is signaled early (cracked clowns, peeling paint, decaying plaster), operates as concrete setting detail, and thematically frames Leo's work (repairing cracks in the veil). The concept shapes Leo's attention to dust disturbances and tile edges—literal cracks that hide secrets. It reappears in the final line ("repaired a crack in the veil"), reweighting the opening. It does not directly constrain a tactical choice but charges the closure image and unifies the thematic and physical layers.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" enables Leo's key action: analyzing dust accumulation patterns to identify the disturbed tile. The trait is dramatized through his methodical cataloging of wiring diagrams, hoist cables, and spectral residue, then proven essential when he spots the pattern break. It is framed as "a requirement for the job, but for Leo, it was also a survival tool for navigating the spectral world." The cost is implicit (time, focus) and the trait shapes his tactics. Without this skill, Leo could not discover the barrel.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Engage" is the fulcrum choice explicitly named: "He could note the anomaly, pack his tools, and leave the dead to their secrets. Or he could engage." The action defines the major turn from observation to intervention, drives the ladder-climb and retrieval, and enables closure (the ghost's release). The alternative (leave) is credible and present, making the choice real. Removing "engage" as the story's hinge would require fundamental restructuring. It appears mid-story and resolves at the end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is signaled as Leo's method, demonstrated in real time ("Decades of neglect had left a uniform, furry grey blanket, but in one corner, the pattern was disturbed"), and its mechanics matter (the lines of settled grime, cleaner edges of the shifted tile). The method enables the discovery and is specific to Leo's skillful observation. It appears once but is essential; without this exact technique, Leo cannot locate the hidden tile. The method is concretely shown rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies the power cut (county supervisor cuts main from the street), the rusted ladder (dragged from storeroom), the drop ceiling with disturbed tile, and the rafter where the barrel rests. The setting's decay (peeling paint, grimy linoleum, stained tiles) enables Leo's dust-pattern analysis. The circus context motivates the carousel timepiece backstory. Removing this exact setting would break the causal chain (no lift decommissioning, no drop ceiling, no reason for the clockmaker's commission). It pressures choices and supplies essential resources.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" is the exact trigger for the ghost's full appearance and the story's tightening. The power cut is motivated (county supervisor), dramatized ("silence crashed down, thick and absolute"), and immediately reweights the stakes (artificial hum to organic quiet, faint smudges to detailed ghost). It forces Leo's choice and marks the transition from routine work to spectral engagement. The timeframe is specific, signaled, and indispensable; without this moment, the ghost does not resolve and Leo has no decision to make.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leo's motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is established early ("his true vocation," "simple, almost childlike"), shown through his consistent upward gaze ("most people's eyes are drawn downward...his were always drawn up"), and drives his choice to investigate the tile rather than leave. It is conflicted—he "both anticipated and quietly dreaded" the moment—and carries cost (engagement with the dead, accepting his vocation). The desire is dramatized through the climb, reach, and retrieval. Removing it would make Leo's choice arbitrary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is established in the opening ("a condition he carried not as a curse, but as a weightless burden") and modulates through the story: routine work, quiet dread, the "gentle pull of his singular purpose," the final calm as the ghost dissipates. The tone avoids melodrama, treating Leo's gift as matter-of-fact yet charged. It shapes the register (no therapy-speak, no grand heroics) and charges the ending ("a tangible piece of a story the ceiling had hidden away"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, though it does not dramatically shift at closure.</comment>
