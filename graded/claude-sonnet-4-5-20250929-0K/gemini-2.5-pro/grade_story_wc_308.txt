<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is clear and shapes the action: the desire to navigate without moving drives the stone-skimming art and the climactic gesture. The character's reverent nature constrains their search method (waiting rather than disturbing) with visible cost in patience. Interiority is concrete and embodied ("quiet fire," the resonance felt in palm), though the final epiphany moment—realizing the path unfurls—edges toward epiphanic convenience. The protagonist's agency is clear but the transformation from listener to guide feels slightly telescoped in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory discovery (new frequency → arrowhead → bird-pattern reading → harmonic release) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Kaelan's consciousness-path unfurls. Orientation anchors by line 3 (canyon, towers of bone, Kaelan's name and art). The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Kaelan does not physically leave but gains the psychic pathway, and the cost is the patience and reverence that shaped the entire vigil. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flock fractures, revealing the hunter's story and reweighting the pulse from obstacle to task. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (centuries of waiting, the release of the wandering pulse) and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly realized and pressures choices: Kaelan climbs the rib cage to gain height for the bird-appraisal, and the acoustic properties (every whisper a chorus) frame the harmonic skimming method. Micro-setting details—vertebra as millstone, fossilized rib cage ramp, dusk-ravens roosting in skeletal jaws—are specific and functional. The arrowhead's nesting in sediment "that marked the passage of ages" charges the timeframe. The setting constrains the method (acoustic heart of the canyon) and charges the final image (stillness settling over bone towers). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (sound and vibration dominate, filtered through the skimmer's art).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to learn consciousness-navigation by understanding the discordant pulse. The tightening occurs when the flock fractures, revealing the hunter's story and transforming the task from silencing to guiding the pulse. Agency is clear: Kaelan chooses to hum and pour the reassuring thought rather than throw the arrowhead, a renunciation of crude action consistent with reverent nature. The cost is patience (centuries of listening) and the psychic expenditure of the harmonic gesture. One meaningful deepening (flock-reading) narrows options and changes knowledge, fitting the Accumulative lens. The resolution is earned by Kaelan's alteration of method (guiding rather than silencing) with visible cost in the final stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: navigation without moving, reverence for the dead, the difference between silencing and guiding. The arrowhead returns with reweighted meaning (weapon → anchor of sorrow → inert stone) and the bird-flock image (living cloud → fractured scatter → map of sorrow) recharges at closure. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question: true navigation begins with guiding lost pulses to rest, not forcing one's own will outward. No overt moralizing; the sigh and unfurling path are concrete images. Subtext operates in gesture (not throwing the stone) and the irony that learning to move consciousness outward first requires helping another's consciousness find peace. The conceptual cost is legible: Kaelan must release the hunter's regret before their own path opens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization through Kaelan's perceptual signature (acoustic attention, reverent patience, harmonic sensing). Narrative distance is stable and voice modulates purposefully: longer, lyric cadences during waiting ("Through centuries of layered dust, Kaelan had sat, listening") compress to sharper syntax at the climactic hum. No head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("pulse left wandering," "ache in the air without a body to house it"). One filter-verb cluster in the flock-reading paragraph ("saw the story... showed the beast turning") slightly dulls immediacy under peak pressure but does not obscure clarity. Psychic distance deepens appropriately during the harmonic gesture. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong imagery ("vertebra the size of a millstone," "dusk-ravens... a living cloud of black"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor text-pattern issues: "The method was an ancient one: to read the answer through the patterns in a flock" is slightly expository scaffold, and the phrase "weathered resolve in their eyes" at the very end is a label rather than embodied image. The arrowhead sequence has one paraphrase loop ("It was obsidian, chipped with a desperate precision... This was the source, or at least its anchor" restates urgency without added detail). No major loops or register drift. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports rhythm. The closure image ("profound stillness") is somewhat abstract but the prior line ("contented sigh... clear and pure") anchors it concretely enough.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—harmonic stone-skimming, bone-tower canyon, bird-pattern divination, psychic navigation—feels specific and integrated rather than checklist. The core premise (learning to navigate by guiding a wandering pulse to rest) offers a fresh angle on psychic-skill narratives. Emotional particularity in the hunter's final regret (family he failed to feed) avoids generic sorrow. The resonant-frequency climax is distinct and the reversal (not throwing but humming) grows from established character. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. Minor deduction for the slightly derivative "learn X skill through centuries of patient practice" frame, though the bird-divination and acoustic method add freshness. Risk-taking in the quiet, non-confrontational closure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelan's choices create the key turns: waiting rather than crude search (reverent nature), climbing to observe the flock (agency), and humming the reassuring thought (climactic decision). Present in setup (first line), development (appraisal choice), and payoff (harmonic gesture at closure). The skimmer's unique art (navigate without moving, send consciousness like a cast stone) directly shapes the method and ending. Strong causal pressure; visible cost in patience and psychic expenditure. Irreplaceable: the story hinges on this exact character's discipline and art.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears in three beats: discovery (base of tower), handling (frantic pulse in palm), and closure (humming into it, then inert). Its properties matter: obsidian as anchor for the pulse, chipped with desperate precision that speaks of the hunter's story. Early signal (discovered ~25% in), middle use (appraisal trigger), and payoff (vessel for harmonic thought at closure). The object's transformation from active anchor to silent stone charges the ending. Strong causal linkage and specificity; removing it would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pulse left wandering is the dominant stake: Kaelan detects it (discordant thrum), investigates its source (arrowhead), deciphers its origin (hunter's regret via bird-pattern), and resolves it (harmonic thought at closure). Present in setup (new frequency), development (intensifies in palm, fractures flock), and payoff (softens, sighs, fades). The concept shapes tactics: Kaelan must appraise rather than silence, guide rather than expel. Visible cost in the psychic labor of the harmonic gesture. Irreplaceable: the entire arc turns on understanding and releasing this exact phenomenon.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Historically reverent constrains Kaelan's method on the page: "one did not disturb the dead or their dusty shrouds without cause" leads to waiting rather than crude search, a visible tactical choice with cost in patience. The trait reappears in the climax when Kaelan chooses to guide (respectful) rather than silence (crude). Present in setup (explicit label), development (waiting as tactic), and payoff (guiding aligns with reverence). The cost is time and restraint. Moderate causal pressure; the trait could be replaced with "patient" or "disciplined" without major structural loss, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Appraise drives the middle turn: Kaelan climbs to a perch and reads the flock's flight to decode the arrowhead's story, which reweights the pulse from obstacle to mission. Present in setup (implicit in skimmer's art), development (flock-reading as appraisal method), and payoff (appraisal's output—hunter's regret—informs the harmonic gesture). The action is irreplaceable: without appraisal, Kaelan cannot know what message to send. Strong causal linkage; the climax depends on the knowledge gained. Minor deduction for the appraisal being slightly passive (observation more than active struggle).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The bird-flock method is signaled ("to read the answer through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight"), dramatized (flock fractures, scatter maps the hunter's story), and its output shapes the climax (Kaelan knows to send "They are safe" based on the pattern). Present in setup (implicit in canyon's ecology, dusk-ravens introduced), development (flock-reading as key appraisal beat), and payoff (knowledge from pattern informs harmonic gesture). Irreplaceable mechanics: removing the flock eliminates the story-revelation mechanism. Strong causal pressure and specificity; the method's visual-poetic logic fits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes pressure tactics throughout: the acoustic properties shape the harmonic-skimming art, the rib cage provides a perch for the bird-appraisal, and the "canyon's acoustic heart" is the target of the final gesture. Setting constrains method (echoes make every sound linger, requiring precision) and charges the ending ("profound stillness settled over the towers of bone"). Present in setup (first lines), development (climbing the rib cage), and payoff (harmonic thought skimmed into the acoustic heart). High irreplaceability: the acoustic logic and bone architecture are essential to the skimmer's art and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "through centuries of layered dust" establishes Kaelan's long vigil and charges the ending (patience rewarded with the unfurling path). Present in setup (explicit), implied in development (sediment layers mark ages), and payoff (stillness after centuries). However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page tactics; it functions more as atmospheric weight than a live clock. The cost is felt (centuries of waiting) but not urgent. Moderate causal linkage: the long wait primes the revelation but does not actively narrow options in real time. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to learn to navigate without moving is explicit ("quiet fire within") and shapes the arc: Kaelan's patient listening is training, the arrowhead event is a test, and the final unfurling path is the payoff ("the first true path... leading out of the canyon"). Present in setup (explicit), development (appraisal as practice of psychic projection), and payoff (path unfurls as reward). Visible cost in patience and psychic labor. Moderate causal pressure; the motivation is told clearly but the friction between desire and obstacle is somewhat muted (Kaelan's struggle is more patient discipline than active conflict). The motivation drives tactics but lacks sharp internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is coherent throughout: Kaelan's patient waiting, controlled focus during the flock-reading, and deliberate hum at closure all embody steady determination. The tone modulates appropriately: longer, reflective cadences during waiting ("Through centuries") compress to sharper syntax during the climactic gesture. The final line ("weathered resolve in their eyes softened into a quiet, knowing peace") explicitly marks the tonal shift and charges the ending. Present in setup (implicit in centuries of discipline), development (reverent patience), and payoff (resolve softens to peace). The label at the end is slightly tell-heavy but the tonal arc is otherwise well-integrated.</comment>
