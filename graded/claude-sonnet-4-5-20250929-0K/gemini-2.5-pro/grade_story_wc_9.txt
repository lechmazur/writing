<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—diviner who cannot grasp her own present—is established early and drives the quest. The renunciation at closure (abandoning the search for lost time) feels earned by the saucer examination and tablecloth failure. However, the epiphany that "lost time was simply vapor" arrives more through narrative assertion than dramatized discovery; the protagonist passively receives insight rather than wrestling toward it through a charged micro-choice in the final beat. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hand, weight on lungs) but occasionally tips into stock phrasing ("aching soul," "crushing burden").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara abandons the foolish question and vows to create new moments, forecloses the search with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds—phosphorescent moss, star-dusted clouds, and the saucer accumulate meaning that reweights at the cloak-drop and hand-tracing beats. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the family-custom failure drives her to the glade, and the final hand-tracing reverses that smudge with a vow. The cost is legible in the cloak release and the shift from seeker to creator, though the turn from anxiety to calm compresses quickly without intermediate friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade setting is vivid and charged—ozone, starlight, phosphorescent moss, churning clouds—and the altitude/beauty motif recurs purposefully. The saucer's cool ceramic contrasts with the thrumming energy, grounding tactile detail in the POV's present perception. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice; Elara could reach the same realization in any contemplative space. The glade functions as atmospheric stage rather than pressure source, capping the score below 9-band eligibility despite strong sensory work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and drives the quest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tablecloth-smudge failure propels Elara to the glade. The final renunciation (letting go rather than recovering) narrows options and forecloses the search with on-page cost (cloak shed, new vow traced). The turn from desperate need to profound calm compresses rapidly without intermediate resistance; the realization that lost time is "simply vapor" arrives as insight rather than through a forced trade-off or visible price paid in the moment, slightly softening the escalation's grip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the saucer's crack reweighted as "character, of a story started" and the hand-tracing shift from smudge to vow. The closing image—mother's promise on new linen—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries (loss vs. creation, past vs. future) through embodied particulars. Minor slip: "cloudbound repentance" and "foolish question finally abandoned" edge toward abstract summary in the penultimate paragraph, though the final gestures (cloak drop, hand trace) re-ground the theme in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (cartomancer's fate-reading filtered through maternal terror). Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon, blending elevated ("phosphorescent," "skeins of fate") with embodied immediacy. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, and the narrator's perceptual bias (seeing time as treasure/debt) is character-specific. One slip: "a choking beauty" and "aching soul" lean generic at peak beats where sharper embodiment would elevate. No dialogue present; interior voice carries the full load cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly coherent ("undertow of loss," "vapor dissolving into ether"). Information density is high, with most lines advancing interiority or image. However, multiple lines exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She turned it over and over" adjacent to reflection on the crack; "a testament to the clumsiness" restates "fractured heart" without added pressure; "not as a seeker… but as a creator" repeats the renunciation already shown in the cloak-drop. Stock metaphor strings appear in high-pressure beats ("weeping smudge," "crushing burden," "aching soul"). Apply baseline −0.6 for paraphrase/template artifacts and −0.3 for stock metaphor concentration, totaling approximately −0.9 in-band deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cartomancer-as-mother frame offers a fresh synthesis, and the saucer's crack reweighted from failure to character is a strong particular. The midnight-glade setting above clouds is vivid but not structurally novel. The central turn—abandoning the search for lost time—grows logically from prior beats. However, the quest-to-acceptance arc and the closing vow to "create new moments" follow a familiar template without deeper transformation; swapping cartomancy for another mystical profession would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged. The proximity to widely used "letting go of the past" structures limits originality, though the specific images (tablecloth hands, cracked saucer) provide enough texture to avoid pure derivativeness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (examining the saucer, reflecting on the tablecloth failure, shedding the cloak, tracing her hand) create the key turns. Early signal strong; two distinct beats (saucer examination, cloak drop/hand trace); closure linkage clear. The final hand-tracing is a decisive act that shifts from seeker to creator. Cost is visible in the renunciation and the vow. Specificity moderate—cartomancer trait colors perception but does not constrain tactics under stress as sharply as it could.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The saucer appears in two beats: early examination and final reweighting as "character, of a story started." Setup early, development through reflected interiority, payoff in the penultimate paragraph's reconception. The crack's meaning shifts from fracture to narrative beginning, charging the closure. However, the saucer is not handled or used in a physical action that alters tactics; it remains an object of contemplation. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong; swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance is named in the opening and closed in the penultimate paragraph ("Her cloudbound repentance was complete"). It frames the quest and the final abandonment of the foolish question. Setup early; payoff at closure. However, the concept does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; it functions more as thematic label than pressure source. The repentance is completed through realization rather than through a trade-off where the concept's mechanics matter. Functional but somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is stated once: "Her quest had left her willingly perplexed, for she knew her cards would offer only symbols and shortcuts." It colors her motivation (choosing not to use divination for genuine understanding) but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Label-only mention without dramatized friction. The trait is consistent with her refusal to divine her own present, but it does not shape a beat where the perplexity forces a trade-off. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears as the cloak-clasp release: "She needed to unfasten herself not from the cold, but from the crushing burden of her search." This action is the physical pivot into the final renunciation. Setup through prior weight imagery; the unfastening beat enables the hand-tracing vow. The action redefines options from burdened seeker to unburdened creator. Causal pressure strong; closure linkage direct; irreplaceability high—no other verb would carry the same metaphoric and physical charge. Cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands appears twice: the failed attempt with her daughter's fist (black smudge) and the final vow-tracing on new linen. Setup in the middle third; payoff at closure. The custom's mechanics (hand-tracing on cloth) shape both the failure that drives her to the glade and the resolution that reweights the tradition. The method constrains the final symbolic act and charges the closure image. Two distinct beats; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Slightly late first mention (~mid-story) and the mechanics are more symbolic than tactical, capping at upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is vividly described and present throughout. Setup immediate; the setting provides the contemplative space for the entire action. However, the glade does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could reach the same realization in any isolated, beautiful location. The altitude and beauty contribute to tone and atmosphere but function as postcard backdrop rather than pressure source. Functional and immersive but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the birth" anchors the timeframe and motivates the quest (terror of lost moments with her daughter). Setup early; the newborn's presence drives both the initial undertow of loss and the final vow to return and create new moments. The timeframe tightens the emotional stakes (new motherhood's urgency) and explains the tablecloth attempt one week prior. However, the clock does not track across beats or alter tactics within the glade scene itself. Causal role clear in motivation; closure linkage moderate through the return-vow. Time functions more as premise anchor than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost time accumulates" is stated early and drives the entire quest. It is dramatized through the saucer examination, tablecloth-smudge reflection, and the final realization that lost time is "simply vapor." Setup strong; development through conflicted reflection (diviner who cannot grasp her own present); payoff in the abandonment and vow. Friction between want (recover time) and cost (crushing burden, failed ritual) is visible. The motivation shapes two key beats and the closure turn. Causal pressure strong; closure linkage direct.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone of "choking beauty" is established in the opening ("beauty of it all was a weight on her lungs… a choking beauty") and recurs through star-dusted clouds, thrumming energy, and the cool saucer against phosphorescent moss. The tone modulates from oppressive wonder to profound calm as pressure releases. Coherence across turns; the final image (steady hand, hopeful outline) shifts from choking to breathing but maintains the beauty motif (stars as "simple, beautiful lights"). The tone charges the closure image by contrasting earlier suffocation with final ease. Slightly generic phrasing ("crushing burden," "aching soul") at peaks prevents higher score.</comment>
