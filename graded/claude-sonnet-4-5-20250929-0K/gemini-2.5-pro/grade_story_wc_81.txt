<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and specific ("tranquilly perceptive," "dissatisfied with that conclusion"), and his micro-choices under pressure—kneeling to catch moss-light, clutching the stamp—are purposeful and embodied. The final decision to begin "long, slow work of re-indexing" demonstrates renunciation of upheaval with visible cost (isolation, unrecognized labor). Minor slip: the "profound sense of peace" label reads slightly therapeutic and could be more embodied, but it does not flatten the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias's discovery of theft reframes the Athenaeum's origin, and his choice to pursue correction rather than announcement forecloses the path of immediate revelation with felt cost (solitary labor, no public vindication). The causal lens holds cleanly: blackout → access to forgotten objects → stamp match → decision. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~90 words. One meaningful tightening (the stamp match) narrows his options and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: biolamps, condensation drip, phosphorescent moss. The micro-setting (moss-light, salt-sealed drawer) constrains Elias's physical choices—he must kneel and crane his neck to verify the match. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and pressure device, isolating him in "reclaimed stillness." The setting charges the closure image (silent library as partner in reclamation) without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when the stamp match reveals theft rather than acquisition. The blackout complicates access (no primary lumens) but does not resolve; Elias's agency (seeking the stamp, physical readjustment to verify) drives the turn. The cost is legible: he commits to solitary, unrecognized labor and forgoes immediate announcement. One meaningful deepening (discovery of erasure) reweights his task with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the "reclaimed stillness" motif recurs (opening hum-death, final silent partnership) and shifts meaning from loss to invitation. The closure offers a non-literal answer to the central question (what are the honest origins?) without stating a moral—the frond-symbol and Elias's resolve to re-index embody the thematic repricing of conquest as starting point. The "clarifying calm" is earned through concrete discovery, not assertion. Subtext operates in the contrast between "enlightened patronage" and theft, and in Elias's refusal to announce.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (indexer's eye for dissonance, "dissatisfied with that conclusion"). Diction matches Elias's scholarly register ("saline-treated paper," "cartouche," "maker's mark") without drift. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under discovery pressure. The prose reflects his methodical mind through syntax and rhythm. Minor: "profound sense of peace...deeper than the fathoms" edges toward elevated metaphor in a high-pressure beat, but remains voice-coherent and does not obscure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance setting, discovery, or stakes). The opening ("hum...died without a whimper") and closure image ("reclaimed stillness held him") frame the arc cleanly. Clarity and momentum are strong. Minor deductions: "A profound sense of peace washed over" is slightly abstract and could be more embodied; "dappled resolve" in the penultimate paragraph reads as prompt-label echo rather than earned image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("ghost of an impression") remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovers theft during blackout via forgotten stamp—is specific and non-obvious. The combination of sunken-city setting, indexer protagonist, and "reclaimed stillness" as both constraint and invitation feels fresh. The discovery mechanism (moss-light enabling verification) is grounded in particulars. The emotional arc (calm rather than anger at theft) resists generic moral binaries. However, the underwater-library and lost-civilization tropes are familiar; transformation through Elias's "dappled resolve" and methodical stance elevates but does not fully escape template territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's indexer logic drives the discovery (cataloging dissonance, hypothesis testing, verification) and his final choice to re-index rather than announce. The role is causally active across multiple beats and shapes the closure stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stamp appears in setup (logged with question mark), development (retrieved from sealed drawer), and payoff (held beside the mark, clutched at closure). It enables the key turn (proof of theft) and charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the discovery mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reclaimed stillness is signaled early (blackout creates it), reweighted at closure (becomes "silent partner"), and alters Elias's perception of the discovery as invitation rather than chaos. It shapes his stance but does not directly constrain a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tranquil perception enables Elias to "listen more closely" during the blackout and notice the "faint dissonation" in records. It influences his approach but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with cost; the trait trends descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The readjustment (kneeling, craning neck to catch moss-light) is the physical pivot enabling verification. It is dramatized on the page, redefines his posture and access, and directly leads to the match. Removing it would require a different verification mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alternative hypothesis (mark as artifact of creation, not decay) is signaled early and drives the middle beat (seeking the stamp to test it). It structures his investigative method and the discovery turn, though the mechanics are brief.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sunken library provides the core constraint (blackout isolates, biolamps fail, moss-light enables) and supplies the forgotten desk and stamp. It pressures every beat and is inseparable from the closure image (silent library as reclamation partner).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blackout creates urgency (no power, emergency lighting), tightens access (must use moss), and isolates Elias for the discovery. It is present in setup, middle, and ending, altering his tactics and charging the "reclaimed stillness" motif.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tracing honest origins is dramatized through Elias's dissatisfaction with water-damage explanation, his retrieval and verification actions, and his final commitment to re-index. The motive is conflicted (calm vs. anger at theft) and drives every beat to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dappled resolve appears explicitly ("dappled gloom," "dappled resolve") and the tone of measured calm is coherent across beats. It modulates subtly (stillness → discovery → commitment) and charges the ending, though the label in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly imposed rather than fully emergent.</comment>
