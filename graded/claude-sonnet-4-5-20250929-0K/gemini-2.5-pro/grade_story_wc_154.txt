<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is strongly characterized through embodied micro-choices: worrying the coral, leaning in to decrypt symbols, strategic gentleness with both child and General. His motivation to bridge divides is enacted through concrete action rather than summary. The General's flicker from commander to father arrives quickly but is earned by the coral-mirror of his own unspoken anxieties. Minor: Elias's "shrewdly innocent" trait is asserted more than dramatized in choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (atrium, twilight, post-anesthetic window). The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the General's throat-swallow and hand-touch crystallize the shared vulnerability Elias translated, foreclosing command-only tactics with felt cost. Drive lens reads Causal: the decryption sequence narrows options and changes the General's stance. One meaningful tightening—child's code to father's heart—lands with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, sterile air against humid chaos, and violet twilight establish tone and contrast effectively. The cast itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (plastic chair, glass walls, atrium doors) remains clear. Does not quite reach the 9-band: the environment supports but does not constrain a pivotal choice; the coral is handled twice but remains more thematic anchor than tactical tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging the conflict through shared human pain—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias chooses to translate fear of thunder rather than expose tactical secrets. Agency is clear: his decision to reframe the child's code as the father's own heart is a renunciation of transactional leverage with visible cost (he gambles trust). The General's response completes the pressure arc. One solid tightening under the Causal lens; entering 8.8+ would require a more explicit trade-off or a second complication that Elias must navigate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—shared anxieties as universal human language—emerges from concrete particulars (honey-cakes, thunder, silence) without assertion. The ending offers a resonant answer: the General's guarded heart opened not by maps but by mirrored vulnerability. The coral motif recurs with reweighted meaning (physical knot of memory → emotional unknotting), though its thematic work is more illustrative than indispensable. No moralizing; the lotus-hearted ache in Elias's chest charges the final image without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during decryption, zooms slightly out for the General's entrance). Perceptual signature is strong: translator's instinct to "unknot meaning," bias toward bridging. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Anja's syrupy speech and the General's clipped tone distinguish voices. Minor: "lotus-hearted ache" is a slight register lift but remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; filter verbs appear but fit the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high in the decryption sequence. Two minor issues: "It was a dense, physical knot of memory he could never quite unpick" and the immediately following "His life's work was to find the sense in the noise, to build bridges" form a subtle paraphrase loop, restating Elias's decoder role. "Lotus-hearted ache" registers as slightly elevated diction in a peak beat. Both artifacts appear outside the closure beat, so accumulation cap applies: −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—war mediator decrypts child's symbols to touch enemy commander's heart—transforms a familiar reconciliation frame through specific, grounded detail (brain coral, smudged graphite, honey-cakes). The "shared anxieties" lens is a fresh angle on conflict resolution, avoiding both sentimental shortcut and cynical futility. Emotional specificity (fear of thunder, house too quiet) avoids template. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits fully to its quiet, lyric mode without gimmick, but the structure and arc follow a legible path without bold formal experiment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (translator) is present from the opening, drives the decryption sequence (middle), and his choice to translate the General's own heart shapes the closure. His occupation enables the core method and his "calm center" stance constrains his tactics (no demands, only coaxing). Two beats: decryption and the final exchange with the General. Causal pressure is clear; the closure depends on his agency. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment appears in the opening paragraph (early signal) and is explicitly a "physical knot of memory" that mirrors Elias's work. It recurs in the final paragraph as a thematic echo when "something had imperceptibly cleared." Two touches, purposeful lyric reprise, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. The object supports theme but remains swappable with another keepsake; transformation is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" is the story's engine: Elias actively seeks them in the child's code (middle), and the final beat depends on the General recognizing his own fear mirrored in his daughter's symbols. The concept narrows options (Elias rejects tactical intelligence for emotional truth) and reweights the conflict. Setup (Elias's mission to "coax from guarded spaces"), development (decryption sequence), and payoff (General's flicker) all depend on this exact premise. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is asserted in one sentence ("He cultivated a presence that was shrewdly innocent, a disarming quietness") but not dramatized through a visible tradeoff or constrained choice. Elias's gentle approach with Anja reads as competent calm rather than strategic naiveté with cost. The trait is present and logically consistent but could be replaced with "patient" or "strategic gentleness" without structural change. Label-only mention; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unknotting (decryption) is Elias's core action, signaled early ("instinct to unknot meaning") and enacted in the middle beat where he decodes the cast symbols. The final turn—unknotting the General's guarded heart—depends on this method. Two beats, clear causal role, and the ending image ("something had imperceptibly cleared") reprises the unknotting motif. Strong integration, though the action is more methodological than a singular decisive physical act; it shapes tactics rather than being a one-time climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Decrypting the smudged notes is introduced early (Elias leans close, asks Anja to explain symbols) and occupies the story's central beat. The method's mechanics matter: graphite marks, recurring symbols, translation from child-code to emotional truth. The final payoff depends on this exact process—Elias uses the decoded anxieties to reach the General. Three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met; the method is irreplaceable and drives escalation. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established in the opening paragraph and recurs in the final line ("the mist swirled against the glass"). It provides atmospheric pressure (sterile versus chaotic, enclosed truce space) and the glass walls stage the General's entrance. The setting supports tone and frames the action but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the scene could unfold in any quiet medical space. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The anesthetic timeframe is signaled in the opening line and brackets the scene (Anja is drowsy, eyes fluttering). The medication softens her speech and creates urgency (a narrow window while she can still answer). However, the time constraint is not visibly tracked or tested; Elias completes the decryption without time pressure altering his moves. Functional setup and thematic fit but no middle escalation or closure participation tied to the ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized through his choice to translate shared pain rather than expose secrets. The motivation shapes his tactics (asking Anja gently, reframing for the General) and the final image (the General's touch and the cleared space). Friction is present: Elias risks trust and foregoes tactical advantage. Setup, development (decryption driven by this desire), and payoff are all met. Strong causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("a lotus-hearted ache blooming in his chest") and charges the final image of the General's gentle touch. The tone—compassionate, tender, mournful—is coherent from the opening (softening anesthetic, violet twilight) through the quiet ending. It modulates under pressure (Elias's focus sharpens during decryption, then opens into ache). The phrase itself is slightly elevated but voice-motivated. Tone is consistent and shapes the closure; one strong beat suffices for this length.</comment>
