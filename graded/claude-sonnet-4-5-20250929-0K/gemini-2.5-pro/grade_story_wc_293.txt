<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is articulated but remains mostly internal declaration rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final decision to learn the fluttering pattern arrives as epiphany without prior visible struggle or foreclosed option. "Dynamically observant" reads as a label; the trait enables perception but never constrains a choice with cost. The glass flake and Lyra's vanishing provoke wonder, yet no contradictory impulse complicates his immediate leap toward possibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit—Elias beginning to play the scaffold rhythm—reads as Charged Poise: options crystallize (learn the code, find his door) with conceptual cost implied in the question mark of "impossible hope." However, the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is visible. The middle accumulates descriptive density (glass flake detail, scaffold observation) but lacks a meaningful pressure turn that reweights his stance before the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain pullout, bridge scaffold, and glass flake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ozone tang, resinous pine, iridescent grid). The scaffold wrap's fluttering pattern constrains Elias's final choice: he must decode it to proceed, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The piece does not exceed 7.2 because the environment does not evolve causally or supply a resource that alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias finding his own door/amnesty—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates through lyric observation (the glass flake, the fluttering code) but lacks a mid-story tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending shift from passive witness to active musician is a tonal deepening rather than a reversal with visible cost. Coincidence (Lyra's appearance and vanishing) sets the stage but does not resolve; Elias's agency at closure is present but its cost remains implied rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—possibility versus constraint, the coded escape from limitation—emerges organically from the scaffold pattern and Elias's "never" history. The final image (playing the fluttering rhythm) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Pixelated amnesty" and "luminous disbelief" recur purposefully, reweighting the premise. Minor reduction: the "ashes of 'never'" phrase in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it remains anchored in Elias's interiority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with a distinct lyric register: "dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief," "question mark of impossible hope." Distance and focalization remain stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with a musician-narrator filtering perception through metaphor. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (breathless laugh, tentative bow-draw). Lyra's brief dialogue feels poetic and goal-driven. Minor slip: "recount it, to spin the memory" in paragraph two uses filter verbs that slightly dull immediacy, though the effect is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the prose advances character and atmosphere in most lines. Two clusters of elevated figurative language appear in quick succession: "thrumming with absence," "great bell had been struck," "ozone tang of a miracle," "spin the memory into something solid before it dissolved like her" (paragraphs 1–2). The density is purposeful but borders overwriting in the opening third. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Spatial choreography is clear. The final line's "question mark of impossible hope" charges the closure cleanly. Apply −0.3 for figurative clustering without pattern-teaching in high-pressure opening beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of 19th-century wet-plate collodion and digital corruption ("iridescent squares," "corrupted digital file") offers a fresh visual hook. The scaffold-wrap code as language is non-obvious and earned through Elias's musician's eye. Emotional specificity (the "louder" solitude, the desperate hum beneath his days) avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise. Minor reduction: the "backdoor," "pixelated amnesty" idiom occasionally drifts toward prompt-like abstraction rather than lived detail, though Lyra's poetic voice justifies the register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bridge-song fiddler: Setup clear (paragraph 1); middle beat (recalling bridge-songs as "lonely tunes"), closure participation (playing the scaffold rhythm). The trait enables the final choice (musician's eyes decode the pattern) but does not constrain an earlier option with cost. Two-gate participation plus closure linkage; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Wet-plate collodion glass flake: Setup (paragraph 3, pressed into palm); middle beat (study of fractured image and grid); closure (implicit proof that charges his decision to play). Three gates met; the object's specific properties (fractured, grid overlay) matter. It does not constrain a mid-story choice or return with reweighted meaning, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty: Setup (Lyra's dialogue, paragraph 2); closure echo ("she had been granted her pixelated amnesty," paragraph 5). The concept frames theme but does not change on-page options or tactics. Two gates (setup, closure thematic mention); no middle beat that alters choice. Functional but replaceable with a synonym phrase.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dynamically observant: Setup (paragraph 2, "a survival trait"); middle use (noticing scaffold pattern, paragraph 4). The trait enables perception ("musician's eyes searching for a rhythm") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Label-only in opening; functional but replaceable. Two gates; no felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Recount: Setup (paragraph 2, "He had to recount it"); middle beat (recounting Lyra's words and the flake); closure participation (playing the story as "glitching music"). Three gates met; the action frames the entire arc. However, the recounting is primarily internal summary rather than a decision that narrows options. Causal role present; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters: Setup (Lyra's final words, paragraph 4); closure participation (Elias plays the rhythm). The method's mechanics (staccato versus slow billows) are described and matter to the final choice. Two gates; late signal (~60% mark) and no middle attempt to decode it. Introduce penalty −0.3 for late arrival; causal pressure at closure raises floor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mountain scenic pullout: Setup (paragraph 1); middle reference (spatial anchor for the bridge a mile away); closure presence (he stands there playing). Three gates met; the setting provides the vantage to see the scaffold code, a micro-constraint. It does not evolve or supply a resource that alters tactics. Functional across beats; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After the hitchhiker vanishes: Setup (title timeframe, paragraph 1 "the moment after"); middle reference ("this was the moment… a timeframe that had no clear end"); closure anchor (his decision emerges in this continuous aftermath window). Three gates met; the timeframe creates a reflective pressure window. It does not impose a ticking clock that narrows tactics. Moderate causal work; felt in tone.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never": Setup (implicit in opening solitude); explicit middle beat (paragraph 5, "he felt an overwhelming urge to sculpt possibility"); closure participation (playing the new song to find his door). Three gates met; the desire drives the final choice. Visible friction between past limitation and present action. Cost is conceptual (risk of failure) rather than a felt trade-off on the page. Strong causal role; moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief: Setup (paragraph 1, "ozone tang of a miracle"); middle escalation (paragraph 3, "impossibly detailed eye"; paragraph 5, "His mind, reeling with luminous disbelief"); closure charge (final paragraph, "a melody of luminous disbelief," "impossible hope"). Three gates met; tone modulates from stunned to active and charges the final image. The phrase recurs purposefully and shapes perception under pressure. Strong closure linkage; high irreplaceability.</comment>
