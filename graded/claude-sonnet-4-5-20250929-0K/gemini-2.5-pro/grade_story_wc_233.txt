<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the silk gloves shroud, the grit she craves, and her final pull-back from the light. Her internal contradiction—seeking escape yet finding agency in refusal—drives the closure choice with visible cost. The "softly commanding" voice recurs purposefully, constraining her role. Minor: Kael remains a functional shadow without distinct interior pressure beyond loyalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the recurring dreams drive the climb, the grotto delivers the promised dissolution, and Elara's renunciation earns the shift from escape to sentinel. Orientation is clean by the first beat. The closure—Earned Stasis with brutal purpose—lands on the page with felt cost: she accepts the gilded cage to guard others. One meaningful tightening (the hypnotic pull vs. Kael's grip) sufficiently narrows options at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight constrain the climactic choice: the light's beauty is the peril. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"viscous drops," "cold diamonds," the hum—and filtered through Elara's disenchantment. The fireflies offer a purposeful tonal pivot. Spatial choreography across the climb and inside the grotto remains clear. Minor: the kingdom below is sketched minimally, but sufficient for this single-scene frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel the dreams or succumb—is signaled early and tightens when the light promises erasure. The reversal (Kael's grip, Elara's pull-back) narrows options with agency under the causal lens. The cost is legible: she trades escape for duty, the "terrible knowledge and newfound brutal purpose." One meaningful escalation suffices at this length, and the coincidence of finding the grotto is foretold, not convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the gloves-as-shroud, the fireflies' simpler magic, the dissolution vs. duty calculus. The ending offers a non-literal answer—standing guard rather than escaping—without moralizing. The "lacy menace" and "bleeding starlight" accumulate pressure and reweight at closure. Minor: "gilded cage" risks cliché, though the context rescues it. No thematic echo in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual signature—silk as shroud, grit as antidote to polish—is character-specific. The two dialogue lines ("We leave at dusk," "We are going down") carry subtext and closure weight. Diction remains within her register; the elevated phrasing ("lacy menace," "visceral filigree") reads voice-motivated. Minor: Kael's single whispered line lacks distinct idiom, though brevity mitigates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense ("wound in the mountain," "bleeding starlight," "lacy menace") but coherent and purposeful. Minor deductions: "the first fireflies of summer" feels slightly labored in proximity to "hesitant constellation," and "the dissolution of self, the blissful erosion" borders on synonym stacking. Otherwise, clarity and momentum hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto-as-soul-trap transforms the quest-for-meaning template through specific imagery (bleeding starlight, serene empty faces) and the Earned Stasis turn—guarding the gate rather than crossing it. The fireflies moment and the shared exhale add lived texture. Derivative premise (disenchanted royal seeks mystical truth) is elevated by the grotto's dual promise/peril and the sentinel resolution, but the frame remains recognizable. Fresh inflection present, not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's disenchantment is setup (gloves shroud, hollow ceremonies), drives the climb (middle development), and transforms at closure into sentinel duty. Her pull-back is the pivotal choice with cost. Present in all three gates, with causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ember/cobalt grotto is foretold in dreams (setup), encountered as the destination (middle), and its light offers dissolution at closure. Its specific properties (bleeding starlight, hypnotic pool) constrain the final choice. All three gates, high causal pressure, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is the core concept seeded in dreams, realized in the grotto, and tested at closure when Elara resists its pull. It shapes stakes (erasure vs. meaning) and the final image's charge. All gates, strong causal role, and closure participation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice in dialogue tags framing the journey ("We leave at dusk" / "We are going down"), constraining her royal role and marking the arc from escape to duty. Setup and closure present; middle development less distinct. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The climb is setup and sustained through the middle (ascent past cloudline), enabling the grotto encounter and the final choice. Removes her from court, literalizes the quest, and positions the reversal. All gates, multiple beats, high causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shared exhale spotting fireflies occurs once in the middle as a tonal pivot ("simpler, purer magic"), momentarily displacing the lacy menace. Setup absent; closure link weak. Functional in one beat but swappable with another moment of shared wonder. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is foretold (setup), reached (middle), and its interior (pool, crystalline ceiling) supplies the dissolution choice at closure. The grotto's beauty and peril are inseparable from the climax. All gates, high constraint on final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames the opening and the astrologer's prophecy recurs as Elara recognizes the grotto's peril. Setup and closure present; middle time tracking is vague ("hours later"). Tightens initial stakes but does not constrain tactics during the climb or inside the grotto.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams drives Elara from court (setup), sustains the climb (middle), and is answered at closure when she sees dissolution vs. duty. Desire is embodied ("desperate need," "visions of a cobalt grotto") and the final friction (madness or meaning) resolves with cost. All gates, strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is named early ("the lacy menace of her quest"), modulates with the fireflies' reprieve, and crystallizes at closure ("the lacy menace of the place was finally clear"). Tone charges the grotto's dual beauty/peril and supports the ending's brutal clarity. All gates, coherent pressure modulation.</comment>
