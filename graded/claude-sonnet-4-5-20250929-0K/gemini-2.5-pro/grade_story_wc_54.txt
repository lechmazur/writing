<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves cleanly from philosophical search to tangible problem-solving, anchored in her engineering mindset. Her actions—kicking through debris, cross-referencing schematics, wiring generators—are consistently purposeful and embodied. The final realization ("not an equation to be solved, but a current to be rerouted") feels earned by her concrete work rather than declared. Minor weakness: the trait "functionally creative" is told rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara achieves activation and experiences wonder while beginning new calculations, crystallizing her philosophical search into actionable engineering. The cost is legible—she has spent hours of work, bypassed safety protocols, and committed to documenting rather than demolishing. Causal lens holds throughout: sextant discovery → schematic investigation → power rerouting → activation. One tightening occurs when she shifts from vague hope-seeking to concrete problem-solving after finding the sextant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through selective detail: "old ozone and new popcorn," "defunct Gate A-12," "dusty baggage carousels." The carnival's leftover generators and cables become essential resources that constrain and enable Elara's solution. Spatial choreography is clean across maintenance shafts, gantries, and the departures hall. The electro-chromic ceiling charges the final image decisively, transforming from "dead panels" to living star chart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning in failed infrastructure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the sextant coordinates match the hidden grid. Her agency drives all turns: she chooses to investigate, to repurpose carnival equipment, to complete the circuit. The activation attempt carries visible risk of failure ("rational disappointment"), and success reweights her philosophical question with concrete discovery. One meaningful escalation suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action: hope as "a current to be rerouted, a potential to be unlocked from the wreckage." The architect's hidden purpose (monument to destination, not departure terminal) provides thematic heft without statement. The final star chart—viewing the Milky Way from outside—answers Elara's opening question through image rather than exposition. The closing line ("began to write down a new set of calculations") extends theme into action without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all detail through Elara's engineering perspective: "functionally creative," "frequency she understood better than words." Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible engineer register ("hallowed glow of an alien sky," "stoic wonder"). The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful, though some metaphors ("ghost of a ghost") feel ornamental. Perceptual signature—noticing gradations, schematics, power flows—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in paired abstractions: "quiet hum of curiosity vibrated through her, a frequency she understood better than words" restates the same idea. The phrase "maze of intentions, a hidden layer of purpose" loops conceptually. Opening metaphor "ghost of a ghost" and "resurrected dreams" lean slightly purple but don't obscure causality. Information density is high in the technical middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—abandoned spaceport repurposed as carnival site hiding a celestial monument—offers a fresh synthesis of decay and wonder. The sextant-as-key and hidden power grid provide specific, non-obvious infrastructure for the reveal. The view "from sixty-thousand light-years away" is conceptually bold. Minor derivative notes: the lone engineer solving an architectural mystery follows familiar beats, and the philosophical framing ("equations for hope") gestures toward profundity without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives every major beat: she puzzles over the terminal's fate, investigates the sextant fragment, cross-references schematics, and pursues activation. Her engineering skillset enables the solution. She appears in all three gates (setup, development, closure) and her choices create the story's primary turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sextant piece is discovered early, identified as coordinate key in the middle, and physically inserted to complete the circuit at climax. Its "impossibly fine gradations" and non-standard symbols provide specific, irreplaceable properties. Without this exact object's nodal coordinates, the activation mechanism fails. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is explicitly named ("a true maze of intentions, a hidden layer of purpose") and realized physically through the terminal's labyrinth of secondary conduits. It shapes Elara's investigative approach and provides the puzzle structure. However, the concept functions more as setting descriptor than active constraint on choice; Elara solves rather than navigates competing purposes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is stated directly ("Elara, functionally creative and accustomed to finding solutions") and demonstrated through her improvisational generator-daisy-chaining and bypass work. It enables her middle-beat problem-solving. However, the trait is told more than shown through contradictory impulses, and no visible cost or tradeoff attaches to this creativity specifically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" governs the climactic action: "the ceiling began to resurrect" with "pinpricks of soft, silver light" becoming a "living star chart." The verb choice is integral to the story's core movement from death to renewal and appears in the title concept ("resurrected dreams"). The entire causal chain builds toward this specific restoration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Redirected flows are signaled early in Elara's schematic investigation, executed through three hours of cable-running and generator daisy-chaining, and named at closure: "Through the redirected flows of energy, the ceiling blossomed." The method's mechanics—bypassing the dead heart, creating temporary arteries—matter throughout and provide the story's central technical problem.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is established in the opening line and provides essential resources (carnival generators, maintenance shafts, the hidden grid itself). Its dual nature—transit hub turned carnival site—embodies the thematic question. The terminal's architecture constrains Elara's approach and supplies the climactic revelation space. Present across all gates with strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The carnival's overnight departure frames the story's starting condition and leaves behind necessary equipment. However, "after the carnival leaves" functions as static setup rather than active pressure; no ticking clock constrains Elara's three-hour work session, and temporal urgency never tightens her choices. Present in setup only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early, drives Elara's investigation, and is directly answered in the closing realization ("no grand formula for hope...but a current to be rerouted"). The motivation faces friction (rational disappointment, demolition mandate versus preservation instinct) and transforms through concrete action. Closure explicitly reframes the initial question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is unnamed but pervasive: Elara works with "focused intensity," experiences "quiet hum of curiosity," feels "rational disappointment," then settles into "profound, stoic wonder" in the final paragraph. Tone modulates appropriately under pressure—clinical during technical work, then expansive at revelation—and charges the final image of solitary figure beneath alien stars.</comment>
