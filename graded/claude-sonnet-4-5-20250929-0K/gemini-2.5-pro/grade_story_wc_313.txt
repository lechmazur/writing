<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is specific and embodied throughout ("the loss felt measured in ghosts," his hands steady during the act of correction). The arc from perfunctory duty to obsessive inquiry to purposeful witnessing is causally earned. The great-uncle remains opaque—face literally scratched out—so the character work centers on Elias and his grandfather's storytelling motive, which reads credibly. Minor slip: the shift from "quiet obsession" to community educator feels slightly compressed in the final beats, though the trade-off (private quest to public witness) carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The structure is a two-shard design (descent to ruins, archive/attic research; then ledger correction and hall display) within one continuous window. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias corrects the record with visible cost (official signature, public exposure) and transforms haunting into shared history. The cost is legible in the deliberate act and its public consequence. One meaningful tightening: the trail of photographs narrows from mystery to family identity to Elias's own lineage, reweighting his vigil's purpose. Orientation is prompt (name, role, place, twilight time by line two). No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Midnight Ridgeway, reservoir bed, and skeletal town create a coherent spatial frame. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "cracked mud… sucking at his boots," "warped floorboard," "dusty boxes." The liqueur label functions as micro-setting—a tangible artifact that anchors the past and charges the final display. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the peak beat (the ledger correction occurs in an archive, spatially generic), which keeps this from the 8-band. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift or floating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Elias's vigil and the "loss felt measured in ghosts." One meaningful tightening: the photograph trail narrows from anonymous woman to his own great-uncle, raising personal and communal cost. The climactic choice—correcting the ledger—is protagonist-driven and forecloses passivity (he signs as warden, accepting accountability). The cost is visible: official record alteration, public vulnerability. Agency reads as decision with on-page consequence. No antagonist, but the stain on memory and community poison create coherent pressure. One micro-reversal (grandfather as storyteller, not liar) deepens rather than redirects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: storytelling as both shield and poison, the necessity of spinning "frayed threads… into a coherent whole." The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "He had turned a haunting into a history," achieved through specific action (ledger, photographs, label, hall). The "mirrored hush" motif recurs with reweighted meaning (valley's breath-holding becomes shared understanding). Subtext operates in the grandfather's fiction and Elias's "precisely humane" method. No thematic echo or abstract lecture. Minor: "stories into shared meaning" is somewhat prompt-adjacent but is earned by on-page acts rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance. Voice is controlled and textured: "the drought's severity in feet and inches" vs. "measured in ghosts"; "a quiet obsession"; "his voice as calm and steady as the ridgeway itself." Perceptual signature: professional measurement vs. emotional weight. No head-hopping. Diction stays in register (warden, clerk, archive) without sudden elevation. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (photograph, label, logbook) and tilts stance via micro-choices (continuing the search, signing the correction). No filter-verb stacks or voice convergence. Strong control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image. Information density is high: most lines advance character, discovery, or theme. Clarity throughout; no loops or paraphrase. Minor: "A fiction designed to shield a child from the truth of a hero who had actually drowned trying to save one last family who had refused to leave" is a long, clause-stacked sentence that slightly slows momentum in a key reveal. One instance of mild filter stacking ("his grandfather, sitting on the porch, spinning a tale") but voice-motivated. No artifacts touch closure. Propulsion strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—resurfacing town exposes family secret—is familiar, but the transformation is specific: not just revelation but active correction of the record, with the warden's professional signature as the hinge. The "precisely humane" method (drawing a line, not scratching out; appending evidence) feels fresh and character-specific. The liqueur label as museum-jewel and the mirrored-hush frame offer non-obvious texture. Risk is moderate; the arc is legible and earned but does not surprise in structure. Emotional truth anchors the freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (vigilant levee warden) is seeded immediately and his professional role frames the discovery. His choice to correct the ledger is the climactic turn; his signature as warden provides official weight and risk. His vigil shifts from measurement to memory-work, and the final beat (community hall, answering questions) closes the arc. Present in setup, middle (archive obsession), and closure (ledger correction, hall display). Causal pressure: his role enables access and lends authority; his decision forecloses retreat. Cost is visible (accountability, exposure). All three gates; drives multiple beats; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued liqueur label appears twice: discovered on the tavern floor (beat one) and displayed in the hall beside photographs (closure beat). It functions as a sensory anchor to the lost town and charges the final image as "a small, vibrant jewel of a lost world." Setup and closure gates met; no middle development. The label does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it enriches atmosphere and thematic resonance (lost beauty, local identity) but remains somewhat ornamental. Lyric reprise reweights the past but does not alter present stakes. Solid 6-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reservoir town resurfacing (Aethelburg exposed by drought) is the inciting condition, seeded in the opening paragraph. It enables the entire discovery arc (photographs, tin box, tavern ruins) and raises the stakes (town's memory, family's name). The climax directly engages the concept: correcting the town ledger and publicly reweaving Aethelburg's narrative. Closure participation is strong: the community hall "by the dam" and descendants of Aethelburg attending ground the ending. Setup, development (discovery enabled by exposure), and payoff all present. Causal pressure high; specificity (Aethelburg, not generic town) matters. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is dramatized in the climactic action: Elias does not scratch out his grandfather's words (which would be rage or revisionism) but draws a clean line, writes "Record corrected," and appends evidence. The attribute constrains method and charges the act with moral weight. It appears as a label in paragraph five but is immediately enacted on the page with visible cost (restraint, procedural care, signature). Setup implicit in character intro, development in research patience, payoff in ledger scene. The trait is irreplaceable—a different temperament would yield different action. Cost is felt (vulnerability, exposure). Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Expunge (correcting the ledger entry) is the story's decisive action, seeded as motivation ("he had to expunge the official record") and executed on the page with specific detail: "drew a single, clean line… 'Record corrected'… his own signature as levee warden." This act is the before/after hinge; it transforms private knowledge into public accountability and resolves the thematic question (how to restore a name). Setup in paragraph five, enacted in paragraph six, consequences in closure (hall, murmurs, understanding). Irreplaceable: no other action would serve. Cost is high (official exposure, vulnerability). Drives closure entirely; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory is introduced in paragraph two (label and tin box with photograph) and developed across paragraph three (archive, zoning map, ledger) with escalating clarity. The method shapes attempts: each photo narrows the search and builds pressure. Payoff in attic (grandfather's logbook) crystallizes identity and reframes memory. The photographs return in closure (corkboard display) with reweighted function (evidence, shared history). All three gates; drives multiple beats; the mechanics matter (scratched face, trail, final clarity). Causal and essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Midnight Ridgeway at twilight opens the story with strong atmospheric charge ("abrupt silence… thin, resonant wire") and spatial anchor (above the reservoir). It establishes Elias's vantage and the valley's "mirrored hush." However, after the opening, the setting shifts to reservoir bed, tavern ruins, archive, attic, and hall; the ridgeway does not return or constrain a later choice. Setup gate met; no middle development or closure participation. Lyric function (tone anchor) but not tactical. Replaceable with another overlook. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>After a wind chime falls silent (timeframe) is mentioned in the opening line as an atmospheric cue ("The familiar melody… had ceased"). It signals a threshold moment but does not track or tighten across beats. The story spans "the next morning" then "evenings in the county archive" with vague duration before the climactic act. No live clock or urgency tied to the chime's silence. Setup gate met (opening frame); no middle or closure participation. Ornamental rather than causal. Swappable with any twilight marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To spin stories into shared meaning is seeded in paragraph four ("his own purpose… to spin stories into shared meaning, to weave the frayed threads of the past back into a coherent whole") and drives the climactic choice (ledger correction, evidence page) and closure (hall display, answering questions). The motivation is dramatized through obsessive research, careful method, and public act. Internal conflict is implicit (private knowledge vs. communal poison; safety vs. exposure). Cost is visible (signing as warden, standing with community). Setup, development (research as meaning-making), and payoff all present. Essential; irreplaceable desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mirrored hush is introduced in the opening ("the whole valley seemed to hold its breath, a mirrored hush between the still sky and the even stiller water") and returns in the final sentence ("The mirrored hush of the valley was finally filled, not with noise, but with understanding"). Tone is coherent and restrained throughout, modulating from haunted stillness to purposeful quiet. The reprise reweights the motif (from suspended breath to shared comprehension) and charges the final image. Setup and closure gates met; middle tone remains consistent but does not shift pressure. Strong lyric function, though not quite indispensable to story logic.</comment>
