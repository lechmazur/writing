<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's fragmented perception is embodied through his inability to see whole faces and his slashed canvases, creating consistent interior contradiction. The shift from crestfallen artist to "cartographer of the fractured soul" is earned through the sustained engagement with the box fragments and threads, showing work rather than epiphany. The final renunciation of mending in favor of redesign carries visible cost in his charcoal-blackened hands and years of quiet. Minor therapy-adjacent phrasing ("luminescent ache," "descended into necessary darkness") approaches label-speak but stays anchored in bodily perception and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the layered work with box fragments, threads, charcoal, forming a spiral cartography that reweights his fragmentation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (lighthouse, library, portrait artist). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the final map on the floor and "quiet, resilient sense" crystallize a new relationship to brokenness with felt cost (years of silence, blackened fingers, the long climb still ahead). One meaningful deepening when he shifts from attempting repair to charting fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's circular stone room, closing walls, and spiral staircase all constrain and charge the protagonist's choices—the space literally pressures him and provides the architectural mirror for his spiral design. Sensory details (salt-laced dust, brittle spine cracking, groaning floorboards) are selective and filtered through his artist's attention. The sweeping lighthouse beam functions as metronome, shaping the work rhythm and final "gentle, knowing glow." Micro-setting (the floor itself) becomes the canvas for resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating psychological fragmentation—is signaled early and tightens when he discovers the broken tarot box, a system for order now shattered. One clear escalation: his decision to redesign rather than mend, spending hours arranging fragments into a new spiral cartography. Agency is redesign itself, with visible cost (hours of work, charcoal-blackened fingers, the "long climb back" still required). The suffocating walls receding and ache transforming register the reweighting of his relationship to brokenness under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of navigating fragmentation rather than demanding wholeness emerges through the concrete shift from slashed portraits to deliberate spiral cartography. The broken tarot box—a shattered ordering system—charges the irony without stating it. Elias interrogates platitudes ("why fight the current?") through specifics of loss and hollowing, grounding reflection in felt cost. The final map offers a resonant, non-literal answer: not repair but new relationship to pieces, charged by "luminescent ache" that transforms rather than vanishes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and distinct perceptual signature—an artist's eye that sees "constellation of disconnected features" and transforms box splinters into islands. Purposeful compression in the work sequence ("hours…metronome…fragments became islands") fits the Accumulative design. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mocking familiarity," "luminescent ache") that slightly exceeds a man in crisis, but the texture remains consistent and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high in the central work sequence; sentences advance through concrete action (gathering, arranging, crushing charcoal). Some overwriting in figurative clusters: "luminescent ache," "geography of his own inner world," "cartographer of the fractured soul" stack metaphors in quick succession without mechanical grounding. Paraphrase loop appears: "suffocating pressure…recede" / "walls…had seemed to press in…now simply stood" restates relief across two beats. Minor template stems ("He would…He would…He pulled…He arranged") in the redesign paragraph. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The transformation of fragmentation-as-failure into cartography-as-method offers a purposeful inversion of the artist-descends premise. Tarot box as broken ordering system is a familiar trope but gains specificity through the lighthouse spiral mirroring and thread/charcoal materials. The interrogation of rhetorical platitudes adds conceptual texture. Execution is competent but the final insight—map the fragments rather than mend them—reads as a therapeutic commonplace given vivid staging rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout; his choice to redesign rather than mend drives the central turn and the spiral creation shapes closure. Present from the opening and causally active in the work sequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken tarot box is discovered mid-story, handled across multiple beats (kneeling, gathering pieces, arranging splinters into spiral), and its shattered state as a failed ordering system charges the redesign. Returns in the final image as the basis for the new map.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fragmented reality shapes Elias's perception (disconnected features, slashed canvases) and the central problem. The redesign creates a new relationship to fragments, altering his options. Present throughout but risks thematic echo over enacted constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias explicitly questions two rhetorical platitudes mid-story ("what if the current was flowing over a waterfall? … is it, or does the loss just hollow you out?"). This questioning moment reweights his stance but does not directly constrain a physical choice with visible cost. Appears once, mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Redesign is the pivot action—"He would not mend the box; he would redesign it"—and structures the entire work sequence (arranging splinters, laying threads, crushing charcoal). Drives the closure and could not be swapped without breaking the cartography logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Untangling threads is both literal (pulling silk and hemp fibers to connect box fragments) and stated as method ("begin by untangling threads"). Mechanics shape the spiral creation across multiple beats. Signaled explicitly and used on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the lighthouse provides the circular stone room, closing walls, spiral staircase (architectural mirror), and lighthouse beam metronome. Setting pressures choices (suffocating enclosure) and supplies materials (maritime atlas, rope). Present from the opening and integral to resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is established early as ongoing psychological pressure ("months…now they were so close") and tracks through the work sequence ("hours"). The receding pressure at the end registers time's cost. Time shapes urgency but is not a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to descend into necessary darkness" is stated early and drives his engagement with the box and the sustained work. Slightly tell-heavy but gains friction when he questions whether the loss just hollows him out. Shapes the trajectory but lacks moment-to-moment conflict between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears twice, pulsing with the lighthouse beam and transforming from pain to "gentle, knowing glow" at closure. Tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image, though the phrase itself leans ornamental. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
