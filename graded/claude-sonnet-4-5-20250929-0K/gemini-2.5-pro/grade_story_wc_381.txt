<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, and the tranquil-blaze contradiction shows purposeful internal tension. However, her solitary work offers no relational pressure or secondary character to test her commitment, and the power flows without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The ending declares the work "done" and her role as "silent guardian" without dramatizing what she has sacrificed or altered within herself. Embodied emotion is sparse—most interiority consists of abstract energy-flow description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara maps silence, saturates the wing, sends energy along pathways, and the whispers fade—a single deepening wave rather than causal reversals. Closure reads as Earned Stasis (she remains, work done, secrets asleep) with the "fragile blanket" image. However, the cost is asserted ("until the world's whispers threatened to grow loud again") rather than shown as a forfeited option or visible price on the page, weakening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, brook, moss-covered stone, and moon-drenched clearing anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The brook's murmur establishes a baseline and returns at closure, and the stone serves as the fulcrum's platform. Yet the environment functions primarily as backdrop—it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource she must navigate. Spatial choreography (kneeling, palms hovering, eyes opening) is clear, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before chaos spreads—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through one continuous ritual action (mapping silence, channeling energy, swallowing whispers) without a reversal or complication that tests Elara's commitment. The whispers "falter" and "thin" smoothly; no credible friction forces a trade-off. The ending lands on "work done" without showing what she gave up or what remains at risk beyond the abstract "until…again" frame, leaving escalation and cost clarity under the Accumulative lens incomplete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as active force, the map-as-method metaphor, and the "tranquil blaze" oxymoron. The closing image of "fragile blanket over dangerous fire" reweights the hush as temporary, not absolute, which resists a tidy moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("her work done," "silent guardian") that tells the theme rather than embodying it in a charged, non-literal image. The piece invites reflection on control versus suppression but stops short of a resonant, specific answer that reconfigures prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance and tense are consistent. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric-fantasy register ("insidious rustle of a contagion," "terrestrially cosmic," "placid inferno") that remains coherent under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Elara listens *past* sound to gaps and voids—but the prose occasionally tilts toward elevated abstraction ("architecture of fate," "overwhelming peace") that reads more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue appears; filter verbs ("she felt," "she sensed") appear but are voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the ritual sequence, where each line advances method and effect. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "smoothed hush" recurs with near-synonyms ("profound and overwhelming peace," "placid inferno consuming noise," "silence expanded"), and the closure paragraph summarizes rather than tightens ("work done," "silent guardian," "until…again"). Minor figurative muddle: "tranquil blaze" and "placid inferno" are oxymorons used to atmospheric effect, but "star about to fold into itself" and "terrestrially cosmic" stretch coherence without clear payoff. No major artifact or template cadence, but paraphrase loops and elevated diction in peak beats warrant penalty under Q7 routing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "mapping silence" method offers a fresh angle on prophecy-suppression, and the origami wing as fulcrum is specific. Yet the core frame—solitary mage performs ritual to neutralize a spreading threat—follows a well-worn template without transforming it through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The "tranquil blaze" oxymoron and "terrestrially cosmic" label gesture toward originality but remain abstract. Removing Elara's name and replacing the wing with another talisman would leave plot and emotional arc largely unchanged, signaling mid-range freshness. The ending's "fragile blanket" image is evocative but does not surprise or reweight expectations established by the opening.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to perform the ritual structures the entire piece. However, the ritual unfolds without complication or secondary choice that alters tactics—she kneels, maps, channels, and succeeds in one smooth arc. No turn or reversal traces directly to a choice she makes under pressure. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is passive (she observes the hush complete). Swappable with another solitary mage without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The origami wing appears early (setup), is described as "fulcrum" and "paper-thin key," is handled in the channeling beat (palms hover, energy saturates folds), and is noted unchanged at closure. Two touches across setup and middle development; closure mentions it but only to declare it "unchanged, just a piece of folded paper once more"—no reweighted meaning. Functional but not indispensable; a different ritual anchor (stone, talisman) would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named in the opening, described as "active and pervasive quiet," and the ritual's goal is to create it. The middle sequence enacts the hush (silence expands, whispers thin, noise consumed), and the closure declares it "complete" as a "fragile blanket." All three gates met; the concept shapes stakes and the ending image. However, the hush does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a trade-off—it flows smoothly without friction. Specific but not irreplaceable; "overwhelming silence" or "protective stillness" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is introduced early as a label for Elara's magic ("drew from deep, grounding energies…to touch the architecture of fate"). The ritual enacts this duality (energy "cool and heavy like river stone" rises and spreads planetarily), meeting setup and development. No on-page cost or constraint tied specifically to this attribute—Elara does not struggle with the tension between grounding and cosmic reach. Closure mentions the "moon-drenched clearing" and "work done" but does not return to the trait. Label-only use; swappable with "elemental-celestial" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Flow" is signaled early ("let her power flow"), enacted in the central ritual beat ("It was not a torrent but a tide, rising…saturated the delicate folds…pushed the flow outward"), and recedes at closure ("the flow of power receded"). All three gates; the action structures the entire middle and enables the hush. However, the flow succeeds without complication—no reversal or secondary attempt traces to failure or adjustment of flow. Specific mechanics (tide, saturation, outward push) matter, but removing "flow" for "channeling" or "emanation" would require only synonym swaps.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is introduced in paragraph two ("her method was one of her own design"), explained via analogy (charting absence of sound, pockets of peace), and enacted in paragraph three (she listens past the brook to gaps and voids between whispers). Setup and development gates met; the map guides the energy's pathways. Closure does not revisit the map—only the result (hush complete). No cost tied to the method; the map works as planned without a moment where gaps resist or mislead. Functional across two beats but swappable with "by tracing silences" or "by finding the voids."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is established in the opening line, the brook's murmur serves as Elara's baseline, and the moon-drenched clearing anchors the closure image. Setup and closure gates met. However, the setting supplies atmosphere, not tactical pressure—Elara could perform this ritual in any quiet outdoor space. The brook's sound is a sensory anchor, not a resource or constraint that alters her method. No middle development where the haven shapes a choice under stress. Postcard description elevated by lyric voice but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" frames the opening ("the insidious rustle of a contagion spread amid whispered secrets") and the middle tracks the prophecy's echoes fading. Setup present; the timeframe is continuous ritual within one night. No closure gate—the ending shifts to "until the world's whispers threatened to grow loud again," a future conditional rather than present pressure. The whispers do not impose a live clock or deadline that tightens Elara's choices; they thin smoothly as she channels. Ornamental temporal flavor rather than a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated in the opening ("Her motivation was not to unmake…but…to hush a prophecy spoken in code until its voice was lost"), enacted through the ritual (she targets "the very heart of the growing din," swallows coded sounds), and the closure declares the secrets "now asleep, their power…muted." All three gates; the motivation shapes stakes and the ending. However, the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice—Elara experiences no friction between wanting to silence and the cost of doing so. No moment where hush conflicts with another want or imposes a visible sacrifice. Clear and sustained but not tested by internal contradiction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced early ("A tranquil blaze burned behind her eyes"), repeated in the climax ("burned at its brightest, a placid inferno consuming noise"), and the closure sustains calm resolution ("the air settled and calm"). Setup, development, and closure gates met; the oxymoron modulates from restrained focus to peak intensity and back to stillness, charging the final image. However, the tone remains static in type—consistently serene-yet-intense—without genuine volatility or surprise shift under pressure. The contradiction is asserted via paradox ("tranquil," "placid inferno") rather than embodied through syntax or rhythm that tightens and releases. Purposeful and coherent but not dynamically reconfigured by events.</comment>
