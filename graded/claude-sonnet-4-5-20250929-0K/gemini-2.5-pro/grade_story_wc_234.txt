<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is embodied through physical action (tracing the shell, cupping the sphere) and her progression from abstract perfection to emotional particularity is earned through Kael's confession. The turn away from the nautilus to pour grief and love into the sphere demonstrates contradictory impulses resolved through choice with visible cost. Minor slip: "scientifically romantic" and "distill feeling" risk over-articulation in the opening, though they anchor her particular obsession. The final choice forecloses her prior method with clear emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the secret, realization, and alchemy attempt, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's method shifts with visible emotional and conceptual cost. Orientation anchors early (Ember Nexus, twilight, two characters present). The piece teaches a pattern of failed attempts building to breakthrough; Kael's departure announcement serves as the tightening that forces revaluation. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: abandoning the mathematical ideal to embrace messy presence, charged by the shared glance and tear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Ember Nexus functions as active setting—residual magic justifies the alchemy and the dusk/twilight palette mirrors the fading friendship. The failed sphere, nautilus shell, and final living sun are handled objects that constrain and enable choices. Spatial choreography is clean (standing close, handing the sphere). Minor limitation: the setting could pressure a choice more directly; currently it's atmospheric backdrop rather than obstacle, keeping this shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence) is signaled early and tested at the climax. Kael's departure serves as the tightening that transforms Elara's approach; the act of pouring emotion into the sphere rather than relying on math is protagonist-driven escalation. The cost is clear: abandoning her lifelong method (dropping the nautilus) and accepting emotional vulnerability. One meaningful deepening with visible price, fitting the inferred accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image progression: sterile mathematical sun → confession's density → warm chaotic sun. The nautilus spiral reweights from divine perfection to "dead thing of calculated beauty." The piece resists stating the moral directly, though "she had to approach her alchemy anew" verges on summary. The final image (tear in the sun's light) offers non-literal answer: presence is found in messy particulars, not equations. Solid thematic coherence with minor exposition in mid-story realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's alchemist lens filters everything through equations and forms. Psychic distance control is clean in single POV. Dialogue naturalness holds ("It's empty," "Wait"). Minor register drift: "directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" feel slightly elevated for peak emotional beats, as does "unbearable weight of his imminent absence" when simpler diction might sharpen. Kael's voice is brief but distinct in quietness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Opening metaphor string ("distill not gold, but feeling, to bottle the very weight of a moment") risks overwriting in a single beat. Paraphrase check: "The math is perfect, the form is divine, yet the result is… sterile. The presence isn't there" repeats the same content across two sentences without added pressure (−0.2). "Directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" appear as scaffold phrases without full dramatization. No loops or major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemy-of-emotion premise is familiar but executed with specificity (nautilus spiral, ember nexus). The turn from mathematical to emotional method is earned rather than convenient. Risk: the piece leans on several craft terms from the prompt itself ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity," "palette of resolve") which reduces the feeling of organic voice. The ending image (tear in sun's light) is fresh enough, though the transformation arc follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive both key turns: she produces the nautilus in frustration, then abandons it to attempt emotional alchemy. Present in setup (opening), development (revaluation), and payoff (successful sun creation). Causal pressure narrows her method; closure depends on her shift. Specific cost tied to her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nautilus appears in three beats: introduction/tracing, cold realization after Kael's secret, dropped and forgotten at climax. It reweights from perfection to sterility, charging the pivot. However, it resolves a thematic problem (static beauty) rather than a tactical one it helped create, and its mechanics (golden ratio) remain ornamental. Solid reprise but not indispensable to plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Referenced once explicitly ("palette of resolve... softened and swirled") at the realization beat. It names the shift in her approach but doesn't constrain earlier attempts or shape the final action—Elara's decision to pour emotion could occur without this exact framing. Present in closure moment but more as thematic echo than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("scientifically romantic; she sought to distill not gold, but feeling") as character trait. It enables her alchemist pursuit but the label itself doesn't constrain a specific choice with visible cost—her methods are described in other terms (equations, catalysts). Functional flavor rather than plot-shaping attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Revaluation is the story's hinge: setup frames failed attempts, Kael's secret triggers it, and the climax dramatizes it through the act of pouring emotion. The action appears in all three gates and the final change depends on it. Swapping "revalue" for another verb would require rewriting the entire arc. Strong causal role with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Returning differently to the art she thought she knew" is stated at the realization and enacted at climax when she ignores equations to pour feeling. Present in middle development and payoff. The method shapes her final attempt's mechanics, though the phrasing itself is somewhat abstract. Two-gate presence with closure participation but could be stated more concretely.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mentioned in opening and used to justify alchemy ("convergence of fading energies"). The twilight palette and crystalline dust supply atmosphere but don't constrain a choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Postcard function; removing it would require minor setting adjustments but no plot changes. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The secret-whisper moment is framed explicitly ("This was it, the precise timeframe...") and drives the entire realization and climax sequence. It tightens Elara's choice by making the moment urgent and dense. However, the timeframe is more thematic container than tracked clock—no racing deadline alters her tactics. Solid lyric integration with closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated early ("to capture the density of presence"), tested through failed suns, intensified by Kael's overwhelming presence after his confession, and resolved when she finally captures it. The motivation drives all three beats and the final success/cost. Friction between mathematical approach and lived emotion creates visible struggle. Indispensable to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is named once at the realization ("a jolt of clarity that felt like directed spontaneity"). The tone modulates from frustration to realization to warmth, supporting pressure shifts. However, the phrase itself feels imposed rather than enacted—the spontaneous breakthrough could be described without this exact label. Functional but replaceable tonal marker.</comment>
