<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—the "snowmelt ardor" and "quiet sea of fulfillment" embody his shift from past failure to present purpose. His technically gentle precision and the way his fingers move "with reverent purpose" show character-specific physicality. Internal contradiction is thin; he experiences only positive resolve and fulfillment without visible cost or renunciation at the ending. The final choice to sketch and cast the sigil feels more like an addendum than a foreclosing decision that alters his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (glacial sanctum, post-forgiveness timeframe, Elian's preservation mission) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through detailed craft work toward a final luminous sigil that reweights the forgotten name with light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sigil projected, then sketched for casting)—yet the felt cost is muted; Elian ends "heart full" with no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The reconfiguration deepens his archive mission but does not visibly narrow options or exact a price on the page, keeping it shy of high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora timepiece, ice-carved workbench, and phosphorescent rope anchor setting vividly and filter through Elian's craft focus. The rope's braids and the ice dome constrain and enable his work, charging the final light projection. Sensory detail—cool pliant strands, pearlescent radiance, emerald aurora—integrates action without catalog. Micro-setting (the workbench, the rope) functions as the crucible for his act of preservation, satisfying the 9+ gate in spirit but not surpassing 8.4 because spatial choreography is minimal and the environment does not force a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving Lyra's forgotten name—is signaled early and drives Elian's meticulous rebraiding. The story offers one meaningful tightening: connecting the final strand and waiting for the sigil to appear. Yet the rope complies without resistance, the aurora answers "as if in answer," and Elian faces no trade-off or sacrifice; his action succeeds smoothly. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow options or impose visible cost, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory, preservation, and the translation of loss into new forms—emerges organically from image and action: the punched-card scrap, the rebraided rope, the light sigil. The final image (projecting the "shape of her sound") offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. "He hadn't brought back the sound, but he had honored its memory with light" risks an on-the-nose thematic statement yet pivots quickly to the embodied act of sketching. The conceptual repricing of absence-into-presence carries weight, but the lack of visible cost or ambiguity holds it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elian's artisan perspective: "technically gentle," "reverent purpose," "surgeon's precision born from the memory of clumsy, grieving hands." Diction is elevated but consistent; perceptual signature is craft-focused (threads as notes, holes as absence). One slip: "his action was complete; his task now was to illuminate" reads slightly authorial/expository rather than Elian's own idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the craft sequence. Minor scaffold appears: "the snowmelt ardor cresting into a quiet sea of fulfillment" stacks metaphors without full coherence (snowmelt/sea), and "technically gentle" recurs decoratively. "As if in answer" and "the sanctum held its breath" veer toward stock phrasing. No major loops or template cadence, but figurative density in non-peak beats (aurora as timepiece, rope as voice) slightly dilutes propulsion without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of wax-casting lineage, street-organ punched-card encoding, phosphorescent ceremonial rope, and light-projection is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "holes" (absence) into "presence of a specific weave" and then into a visual sigil feels fresh. Yet the emotional arc—guilt → forgiveness → fulfillment—follows a familiar redemption template without complication or risk; Elian's success is untroubled, and the ending consolidates rather than surprises. The premise is inventive; execution hedges toward safe resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (unbraid, reconfigure, connect final strand, sketch sigil) drive all beats. He shapes the rope's pattern and decides to cast the sigil in silver, altering his ongoing mission. His role is active and essential, meeting setup/development/payoff gates. However, the final sketching/casting is an extension rather than a turn with visible cost; it consolidates his success without foreclosing a path. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure elevate the score, but lack of cost connection and swappability (another artisan could perform similar work) cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The punched-card scrap appears early (setup), Elian cross-references it to reconfigure the rope (development), and it informs the sigil's pattern (payoff). It drives two distinct beats (initial examination, pattern translation) and its specific hole-pattern is irreplaceable for the weave. Yet its role is primarily informational; removing it would require a different encoding device but not fundamentally break the preservation logic. Causal pressure and closure linkage are present; irreplaceability is partial. Strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transcribed memory frames the entire premise: Lyra's name encoded in holes, translated into rope braids, then projected as light. It shapes Elian's goal and method throughout, meeting all three gates and driving every beat. The concept is thematically and causally central; removing it collapses the story. However, the mechanics of "transcription" remain abstract—how the punched card encodes the name and how the braids translate it lack granular specificity, keeping the concept from full indispensability. Strong thematic and causal work but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is introduced early as Elian's defining trait, applied in the opening and again when he unbraids the rope ("technically gentle touch"). It signals his recovery from past clumsiness but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. The gentleness succeeds without friction; no moment shows a trade-off (e.g., speed vs. care). The trait is present across beats and consistent but remains label-adjacent, not mechanically decisive. Functional setup and thematic echo, but no felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the story's climactic action: Elian completes the rebraiding, the rope glows, and the sigil projects onto the ice. This beat is the payoff of all prior work and directly produces the closure image. The action is signaled ("his task now was to illuminate"), executed on the page, and irreplaceable—without it, the memory-preservation fails. It drives the final third and charges the ending. Only the slight passivity (the rope "began to glow" rather than Elian actively triggering it) and the ease of success keep it shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the rope's braids is introduced early (the coiled rope in the sanctum's heart), executed across multiple beats (unbraiding, weaving new pattern, connecting final strand), and produces the climactic illumination. The method is specific and irreplaceable; the rope's ancient structure and his weaving skill are causally necessary. It shapes all middle development and the ending. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable (another ceremonial tool might substitute) but essential to the story's logic and texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is established immediately and provides both isolation (miles from thaw) and resources (ice-carved workbench, the rope, projection surface). The aurora marks time and answers at the climax ("as if in answer, a soft hum"). Setting enables Elian's work and charges the final image (sigil on ancient ice). It meets all three gates and contributes to atmosphere and closure. Yet it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; the setting facilitates rather than pressures. Strong atmospheric integration but not indispensable to the core logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the opening and establishes Elian's emotional baseline, shaping his calm focus and the story's reflective tone. It seeds the character arc (past failure → present purpose) and resonates in the final fulfillment. However, it functions as backstory context rather than live pressure; the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The aurora marks duration lyrically but no clock constrains tactics. Setup and thematic payoff are present but the element does not drive beats or alter choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is stated early, dramatized in Elian's meticulous work, and fulfilled in the sigil projection. It drives his choices across all beats and anchors the closure. The desire is clear and consistent, with embodied passion ("snowmelt ardor," "heart full"). Yet there is no friction or cost—Elian's want and his success align perfectly without sacrifice or competing need. Strong causal and thematic integration, but the absence of dramatized conflict or trade-off keeps it from the high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is named explicitly and embodied in Elian's "rising warmth," "passion of the builder," and final "cresting into a quiet sea of fulfillment." The tone is coherent—gentle yet intense—and modulates through the work sequence to the climactic glow. It charges the final image of light and fulfillment. However, the tone remains uniform (positive resolve throughout) without tension or counter-pressure; it does not shift under duress or complicate the ending. Purposeful and present but static, meeting mid-band lyric-resonance criteria.</comment>
