<comment>Elian's motivation is clear and rooted in prophecy-driven purpose; his interiority shows genuine wonder ("his breath caught in his throat") and specific sensory detail ("stained with soil and chlorophyll"). The transformation at closure—"no longer just an orderly sorter"—is legible but arrives through an external trigger (the prod) rather than internal contradiction under pressure. His characterization remains somewhat one-note: reverent, precise, patient throughout, without embodied conflict that tests competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with causal elements (sorting→pattern recognition→monument building→prod→transformation). Closure is a Decisive Change: the arbor awakens, green replaces ash, Elian's role transforms—cost is legible as irreversible world-state shift and identity reconfiguration. The "prod" moment functions as catalyst; the piece teaches its pattern (leaf-sorting as decipherment) and pays it off, though the escalation is primarily external wonder rather than internal choice narrowing.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and purposeful: "perpetual twilight," "pale branches," "ashen veins" create coherent atmosphere. The moonstone speck's "coolness" and the mica monument anchor micro-setting that charges the final image when "viridian green wood" emerges beneath ash. Spatial choreography is clean (sorting bench, miniature landscape, monument spire). The arbor constrains Elian's world and supplies the medium (leaves, seeds) for his work, though the setting functions more as backdrop than active pressure on tactics until the transformation beat.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the prophecy message. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anomalous leaf with moonstone appears, narrowing Elian's focus to the speck as key. The "prod" is protagonist action, but the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than narrowing options under pressure—Elian's choice to prod feels inevitable given his role, not a trade-off between competing goods. Cost is present (world transformation, identity shift) but largely positive; no visible loss or foreclosed path accompanies the awakening.</comment>

<comment>Theme of transformation through attention to small things emerges organically from Elian's sorting practice and the monument-building. The phrase "monumental power of the very, very small" in the final paragraph risks stating the thesis, but it follows earned scene work. The arbor's shift from ash to green, Elian's shimmering hands, and the new leaves "promising a message not of memory, but of becoming" offer a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. The moonstone/memory/renewal motif coheres and reweights prior material at closure.</comment>

<comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("mossy delight in the precision," "breath caught in his throat") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction remains elevated but coherent: "confluence of ashen veins," "trembling precision," "profound and mossy delight." No head-hopping. The rhythmic control supports the meditative tone, though some phrasing risks purple register ("brittle as spun sugar," "impossible small moonstone cabochon dust speck"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reverent observation to intimate trembling at the climax.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative pace; information density is high without significant loops. Minor template cadence in "A tremor ran… A shiver of awakening. The ash… began to flake… The moss… now glowed" where parallel constructions risk mechanical accumulation. The phrase "impossibly small moonstone cabochon dust speck" stacks modifiers densely, and "profound and mossy delight" in the final line borders on overwrought. No major paraphrase loops; clarity remains strong. Figurative language ("spun sugar," "long, slow sigh") is functional but frequent, skating the density threshold without breaking it.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The skyborne arbor setting and seed-sorter protagonist offer specificity, and the monument-building method is distinctive. However, the core arc—reluctant chosen one discovers artifact, performs prophesied action, restores dead world—follows a familiar template. The "prod" as climax is endearingly understated, a fresh inflection, but the transformation itself (ash→green, sorrow→life) resolves into a tidy restoration without complication or ambiguity. Emotional honesty is present, yet the outcome grants symmetric satisfaction: Elian gains purpose, the arbor gains life, no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elian is present throughout; his sorting and monument-building anchor the first two-thirds, and his choice to prod the speck drives the climax. However, much of his activity is observation and arrangement rather than decision under conflicting pressure—he sorts, he notices, he constructs, he prods. The prod is a key turn, but it feels inevitable given prophecy rather than a choice that narrows competing options. Two beats (sorting/monument-building, prod/transformation) and closure linkage lift the score, but lack of internal friction limits causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The moonstone speck appears at midpoint (around 40%), is handled with tweezers, placed atop the monument, and prodded to trigger transformation—three distinct beats. Its unique properties (coolness, pearlescent light, ties to Arbor-Heart lore) matter causally; removing it breaks the climax. It returns reweighted in the final image as Elian's hands shimmer with residual light. Early signal is absent (it arrives midpoint), applying −0.3, but beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.4), and specificity (+0.6) push it into the high 8s.</comment>

<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>Regional folklore is established in paragraph two and frames Elian's motivation (prophecy that "a tender of small things" will decode the message). It shapes his interpretive lens but does not constrain on-page choices—Elian was already sorting leaves before the story opens, and the prophecy does not create friction or alter his tactics. It provides thematic resonance and context but functions primarily as backdrop. Setup gate met, payoff gate met (transformation fulfills prophecy), but middle development is absent; cap 4.6, adjusted +0.1 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Emerges transformed always" is signaled in folklore context ("every cycle, every seed, every story emerges transformed always") and paid off at closure when Elian and the arbor both transform. It constrains narrative expectation and charges the final image ("He had emerged transformed, just like the arbor"). However, it is primarily thematic claim rather than trait that forces a visible tradeoff in scene. Setup, payoff gates met; closure linkage (+1.2) and conceptual cost (identity shift, +0.4) raise the score, but lack of middle friction and some abstraction limit it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prod is signaled ("He had to prod it"), executed with specificity ("a single, deliberate finger… the gentlest prod"), and triggers the climactic transformation (chime, light flow, arbor awakening). Removing the prod removes the turn; swapping it (e.g., "touch" or "tap") would require rewriting the entire beat's texture. Setup, development, payoff gates all met. Beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.6), closure linkage (+1.8), and irreplaceability (+0.7) combine for high integration. Minor deduction for slightly late emphasis on necessity ("He knew… He had to prod it" tells more than earlier foreshadowing shows).</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Monument-building is introduced early ("His method for understanding was to build tiny monuments") and shown in action when Elian constructs the mica-and-root spire for the special leaf. The method matters: the monument holds the moonstone speck at its apex, and the transformation flows down from it. Setup and payoff gates met; the monument shapes one key beat (midpoint construction) and participates in closure (light flows down the monument). Beat involvement (+0.4), early signal (+0.5), and closure linkage (+0.9) lift it into mid-6s, though it does not drive multiple turns or constrain competing tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is anchored in the opening line, provides the leaves and setting for Elian's sorting, and undergoes the story's central transformation (ash→green). It supplies the medium (falling leaves, seeds) and houses the climax. Setup, development (supplies leaves/seeds), and payoff (transformation) gates all met. Beat involvement (+0.9), early signal (+0.7), closure linkage (+1.4) combine solidly. However, the arbor does not constrain Elian's choices—he works within it but it does not pressure tactics or force tradeoffs until the passive transformation at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is poetic framing in the opening but does not function as a live clock or constrain pacing. Elian's sorting routine is ongoing; the special leaf's arrival is not time-pressured. The timeframe sets atmosphere (twilight, anticipation) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Setup gate met (mentioned early), but no middle development or payoff tightening; primarily ornamental. Cap 4.6, adjusted −0.5 for lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elian's motivation to decode the message is stated early ("driven by a single, consuming motivation"), shown through his sorting and monument-building, tested when the anomalous leaf appears, and fulfilled at closure when the arbor awakens. The motivation drives multiple beats (sorting→monument→prod) and shapes the final image (Elian as awakener). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.2) lift it to mid-7s. Minor friction: the motivation is not visibly conflicted—Elian never doubts, fears cost, or weighs competing wants—reducing tension slightly.</comment>

<comment>"Mossy delight" is named twice (opening: "mossy delight in the precision," closing: "profound and mossy delight") and sustained through gentle, reverent diction ("trembling precision," "quiet, certain joy"). The tone modulates slightly under pressure (breath caught, trembling) but remains fundamentally positive and wonder-filled throughout. It charges the final image and coheres across the arc. Setup and payoff gates met; early signal (+0.6) and closure linkage (+1.0) support mid-6s, but the tone is somewhat static—no sharp tonal shift under escalation—and naming it twice risks label-reliance.</comment>
