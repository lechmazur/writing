<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia and grief are embodied through physical detail—cold sweat, ragged breathing, the tightness in his chest that opens at closure. His contradictory impulses (fear of enclosed spaces vs. duty to grandmother) drive the phase-transition choice with visible cost. The interiority is concrete and particular, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the shift from "my grandmother" to "his grandmother" creates brief pronoun confusion, and the motivation could show more internal resistance before the final act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: chronometer → collapse obstacle → phase transition → console act → release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghosts wink out, Elias feels "blessedly open")—an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost (alone but unhaunted). The four-hour tidal window creates clean pressure and the ending image reweights prior material. Minor gap: the phase-transition mechanism arrives late without prior setup, slightly weakening the earned quality of the solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flooded relay hub, rebar-choked collapse, and tidal clock constrain every choice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "taste of salt and forgotten time," "ozone and granite on his tongue." The codex fleck and star-shaped console indentation function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grant grandmother peace) is signaled early and tightens through the collapse obstacle, forcing the phase-transition choice. The tidal clock and claustrophobia create layered pressure. The ending forecloses the haunting with visible cost: he's alone now, duty discharged. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes he cannot squeeze through and must use the codex method. The cost is legible and scales well to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory, duty, and release emerges from concrete particulars without moralizing. The gold fleck's return to its slot embodies completion; the phrase "stand by the unremembered" gains resonance when the shimmering outlines finally rest. The ending image—"no longer haunted"—reweights the oppressive static-filled silence into "true, clean emptiness" without stating a thesis. The crashing hush motif charges the closure without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signature: Elias sees distortions as "heat-shimmer," tastes "ozone and granite." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, slightly pulled back for the grandmother memory). Diction remains controlled under pressure—"nauseating, colorless vibration" captures phase-state confusion. Minor slip: the shift from first-person framing ("my grandmother") to third-person Elias creates a brief distance inconsistency in the second paragraph, though it stabilizes quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high. Strong figurative language: "fossilized leviathans," "jagged mouth of rebar," "probability wave." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "crashing hush" appears twice in identical phrasing without pattern-teaching, and "impossibly, blessedly open" stacks modifiers at the closure beat. The phrase "his motivation a burning certainty" tells rather than dramatizes. Otherwise propulsion is excellent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The phase-transition solve and "tracking invisible things" attribute offer fresh synthesis of grief narrative and speculative tech. The codex-fleck-as-key is specific and non-obvious. The undersea-cable graveyard setting transforms the haunted-facility trope through lived sensory detail. Risk: the late introduction of phase-shifting (no prior setup) feels convenient, lowering the earned quality. The transformation of "stand by the unremembered" into embodied action elevates the piece above template plotting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia forces the phase-transition choice at the collapse; his decision to press the fleck into the console drives closure. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The codex margin illuminant gold fleck is handled in four beats: pinched as guide/tool, used to phase through rock, described as resonating with the facility, pressed into star-shaped slot to complete the closure. Early signal, irreplaceable mechanics (star-slot fit), and closure linkage with visible cost (releases grandmother). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables shape the setting ("fossilized leviathans"), house the trapped consciousnesses, and terminate in the flooded hub where closure occurs. They constrain Elias's path and enable the ending act. Present across all gates with causal and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" enables Elias to perceive the shimmering distortions, guiding his journey and identifying the grandmother's presence near the console. The attribute is signaled early, used across multiple beats, and directly shapes the closure moment. Cost: the ability exposes him to the "electric" chorus of data-fragments.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Return" frames the entire structure: Elias has been here before as a boy; now he returns with new knowledge and method. The action redefines his approach (he cannot physically squeeze through anymore, so he phases). The codex fleck is itself a return of a component. The final act is explicitly a return to complete the story. Structural and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through phase transitions" is used once at the key obstacle (ceiling collapse) and described with specificity ("probability wave," "immense, dead pressure"). It enables the middle turn but arrives without prior setup, reducing inevitability. Present in development and affecting tactics, but swappable with another speculative mechanism. Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility (Kaelan Point Relay) pressures every choice: tidal access window, flooded floor, rebar collapse, defunct cables, primary console with star-slot. Micro-setting elements (chronometer, gold fleck slot) charge the closure. Early signal, persistent constraint, indispensable to plot and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Between tidal changes" is tracked via chronometer in the opening and returns as "first tendrils of the returning tide" at closure, framing urgency. The four-hour window tightens Elias's decisions and creates a live clock. Present in setup and payoff with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To stand by the unremembered" is stated early, internalized as duty tied to grief, and dramatized in the final console act. Friction between claustrophobia (fear) and obligation (motivation) creates authentic tension. The ending—"he had stood by them, and now they were gone"—delivers fulfillment with visible cost (alone, unhauntened). Strong causal and emotional integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" appears in the opening ("crashing hush where the roar of the surf outside met the dead silence within") and resolves at closure ("The crashing hush had finally broken, leaving only the hush"). Tone modulates with pressure: oppressive static during the journey, peaceful emptiness at release. The oxymoron charges the final image and coheres across the arc.</comment>
