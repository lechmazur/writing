<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is consistently embodied through concrete actions—following rain trails, working the brooch free, choosing story over possession. His wryly earnest self-awareness ("A fool's errand") operates as genuine character texture rather than hedge. The exchange decision crystallizes a hierarchy of values (meaning over material gain) with visible cost in the final shift from landscape to portraiture. Interior contradiction surfaces in the insomnia framing: predator versus companion, a shift earned by the story's event.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias gains narrative meaning but returns to insomnia, now "less a predator and more a quiet companion"—the cost is visible in his continued sleeplessness but reweighted by the grain/chaff metaphor paying off. The causal chain is clean: storm → trails → convergence → woman → exchange → portrait shift. Single continuous scene with one motivated transition (return journey). Drive lens reads Causal with minor Accumulative texture; the exchange narrows his artistic approach with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal causeway, retreating tide, and western bluffs create spatial pressure that constrains access and discovery timing. The convergence of petrified roots and corroded drone chassis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and dramatizes the post-war world through objects rather than exposition. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "salt-crusted memories," "warm against his skin despite the cool air," "slick mud." The amber brooch as portable setting-object recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshing meaning from experience) is signaled early and tightened through the exchange decision, which forecloses the option of keeping a valuable object. The woman's arrival and Elias's choice to trade the brooch for story constitute one meaningful reversal that narrows his options under pressure. Cost is legible: he gives up a material relic and returns with only narrative, yet the insomnia persists—Earned Stasis with visible price. Agency is renunciation with consequence, fitting the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grain/chaff metaphor seeds early, recurs under pressure, and pays off in the final line ("holding the grain, not the chaff") without restating theme. The convergence of eras (amber, wood, steel) and the exchange structure embody the theme of meaning-making through encounter rather than possession. The portrait shift—from landscape to face—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the woman's initial suspicion and Elias's "I don't want much," which reweights value systems on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "haggard awe," "rickety," "wryly earnest"—diction aligns with a weary, self-aware artist. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext (the woman's flat "I don't have much" versus Elias's deflection). Minor filter-verb stack in the opening ("trying to," "trying to capture") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the exchange beat. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt-crusted memories" conveys setting, tone, and backstory in three words). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the discovery and slowing at the exchange. Minor template cadence in the opening paragraph ("trying to wring," "trying to capture") and one paraphrase loop ("desperate need to translate" / "the story the object held") apply −0.3 total. No figurative muddle; metaphors (grain/chaff, predator/companion) are coherent and pay off. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The post-water-wars tidal island and the convergence of amber, petrified wood, and drone chassis offer a specific synthesis that avoids template post-apocalypse tropes. The exchange structure (object for story) transforms the familiar "artist seeks inspiration" frame through the lived-in detail of a scientist who "loved amber and believed in the sanctuary of the sea." The final portrait shift feels earned in hindsight. Minor derivative pressure: the sleepless artist and the relic-as-key tropes are present but personalized enough to avoid mid-band caps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia is signaled early, shapes his motivation (sleepless hours spent painting), and is reweighted at closure ("less a predator and more a quiet companion"). His choices—following the trail, offering the exchange—create the key turns. The character is causally active across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber brooch is discovered mid-story, handled in two distinct beats (extraction and exchange), and its meaning is reweighted in the final portrait ("eyes reflecting the fossilized light"). It enables the exchange and charges the closure image. Specificity (prehistoric fly, tarnished pin) matters. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unearthed convergence (roots, drone, brooch) is discovered on-page and directly creates the exchange opportunity. It shapes the dominant stake by literalizing Elias's search for meaning in collided histories. Present in setup (as goal), development (discovery), and payoff (woman's story). Causal pressure is strong but could be tighter if the convergence itself constrained a choice beyond triggering the exchange.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" is embodied in Elias's self-aware muttering ("A fool's errand") and his exchange offer ("I don't want much"). It constrains his speech and tone but does not visibly block or enable a high-cost action. Present across beats, but the cost connection is oblique. Mid-range for trait that colors voice without decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The exchange is the story's fulcrum: Elias trades the brooch for narrative, which redefines his artistic focus from landscape to portraiture. It is setup by his motivation, executed on-page with dialogue and gesture, and paid off in the closing sketch. Removing it collapses the closure. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Following rain trails" is signaled early, motivates the journey to the bluffs, and leads to the discovery. The method is specific (storm runoff script) and alters Elias's tactics (choosing the deepest line). Present in setup and development; its mechanics matter. Does not directly shape the ending beat, capping closure credit, but strong causal involvement in the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal island and causeway constrain access (tide timing), the western bluffs are "a place the sea rarely surrendered," and the storm's exposure of the convergence drives the plot. Setting is embodied through action (boots sinking, tide retreating) and pressures Elias's movement. Present across all three gates; the island's isolation charges the final return. Strong spatial choreography and causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The water wars provide world-context and motivate the desalination drone relic, shaping the convergence's meaning. The timeframe is signaled early and informs the woman's backstory (last ferry, failed filters). Present in setup and development; it does not tighten decisions in real-time but supplies thematic and object causality. Mid-range for backdrop that matters without live clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "thresh meaning from experience" is dramatized in his sleepless painting, the decision to follow trails, and the exchange choice. It conflicts with material survival (nutrient bar, weary world) and is reweighted at closure ("holding the grain, not the chaff"). Present across all three gates; shapes multiple choices with visible cost. Strong integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" is embodied in the opening sunrise attempt, the discovery of the convergence, and the woman's "weary patience." The tone modulates under pressure (suspicion softening to understanding) and charges the final portrait ("eyes reflecting the fossilized light of an amber brooch, a study in haggard awe"). Coherent across beats and integral to the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
