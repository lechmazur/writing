<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's restless longing is embodied through his fluid motion and pocket habit, with the scrimshaw anchoring his interior conflict. Elara's "combative tenderness" mask cracks under the object's influence, showing contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to ride the island away is motivated by established desire, though the scrimshaw's heart-unlocking power feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices. Minor: Kaelen's dancer-like grace reads slightly idealized without struggle or misstep under dock work pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric texture: scrimshaw → cove → whale call → island rise → departure. Closure is a Decisive Change (Kaelen leaves land permanently) with visible relational cost (Elara left behind, her acceptance earned). Orientation anchors quickly (docks, Kaelen, Elara, post-violence world). One meaningful tightening: Elara's plea opens the path to the ritual. Cost is legible in "he did not look back again" and her "aching acceptance."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is both named and functional: the unnaturally low tide exposes the petrified roots, enabling the detachment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (salt-crusted shed, wet earth, primeval blossoms, cascading brine). The scrimshaw's grooves and the whale's etched eye are tactile and charged. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from docks to cove to rising island. Minor: "mossy stone" appears suddenly under Kaelen's feet without prior anchoring of the island's surfacing mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kaelen's need for freedom vs. safe routine) is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: Elara's softened plea allows him to act. The cove ritual narrows options to a point of no return with visible cost—Elara's loss and his refusal to look back. Agency is clear: Kaelen pours his essence into the scrimshaw, severing the island's anchors. Minor: the scrimshaw's heart-unlocking power accelerates Elara's shift slightly ahead of her visible struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of freedom vs. safety emerges through concrete action: Kaelen's dock work, the ancestral scrimshaw, the hidden island. "The land is a cage" and "embracing one's true nature" risk overt statement, but the final image—island drifting seaward, Elara's acceptance—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The whale call and rising island charge the closure with mythic weight. Minor deduction: "combative tenderness" is named in narration rather than fully earned through scene friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds steady on Kaelen with no head-hopping; Elara's interiority is accessed only through the scrimshaw's effect and visible behavior. Diction is elevated and controlled ("fluid economy of motion," "sublittoral fringe"), fitting the lyric-mythic register. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is Kaelen's: ocean-gray eyes, restless water-gazing. Minor: "soul-shaking thrum" and "primeval blossoms" edge toward purple without full embodiment in Kaelen's prior lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure creates visual breathing. Information density is high: most lines serve character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence in the opening ("moved… flowed… watched… said") across four consecutive beats. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("fortress of practicality," "watery threshold"). "Soul-shaking thrum" and "impossible quality" edge toward abstraction in peak beats. Overall momentum is strong; the ritual sequence propels cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mythic-island premise and whale-call ritual combine familiar elements (lost Atlantis, ancestral talisman) but execute them with specificity: sublittoral fringe, petrified roots, scrimshaw as key. Kaelen's choice feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric register and the quiet, inevitable closure elevate the piece. Deduction: the core frame (restless soul seeks mythic escape) leans on template longing without a sharp counter-pressure or moral trade-off that would surprise; Elara's acceptance arrives smoothly rather than through dramatized internal cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout, pursues the island goal, makes the key choice to wade in and call the whale, and rides the island away—all on-page decisions. His grace is embodied in coiling nets and perfect balance. The final refusal to look back forecloses return. Swappability is low: a clumsy or hesitant character would break the mythic tone. Cost is visible in leaving Elara. Minor: "graceful" is a given trait rather than tested under dock-work strain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three distinct beats: Kaelen fingers it at the docks, pulls it into light to unlock Elara's heart, and holds it before him in the cove ritual as the key. It is both map and devotional object, with grooves and the whale's eye specified. It drives the middle turn (Elara's softening) and the climax (the whale call). Causally indispensable: without it, the island does not rise. Cost: Kaelen's ancestor's legacy now fulfilled, foreclosing the past.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The disappearing island (Aethelburg) is established early as Kaelen's obsession, shapes his daily longing, and becomes the literal stage for closure: it rises from the sublittoral fringe and carries him away. The concept drives all stakes and tactics. Setup (first paragraph as "story"), development (Kaelen believes it waits "tethered just beyond sight"), and payoff (it rises, he boards, it drifts) are all on-page. Removing the island collapses plot, character goal, and final image. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is attributed to the scrimshaw and demonstrated once: the glint of sun on the whale's eye causes "a strange warmth" and "unwanted crack" in Elara's practicality, leading to her plea. The attribute enables the middle turn. Setup is present (the scrimshaw's "impossible quality"), and payoff appears in Elara's final acceptance. Deduction: the unlocking mechanism is told ("it unlocks guarded hearts") rather than fully embodied through a sequence of micro-choices, and it is used only once.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Detach" is the action Kaelen seeks, names internally ("to detach the island, to sever the chains"), and executes in the cove: the roots tear free, the island rises. Setup (first third: island "tethered"), development (he wades in to perform the ritual), and payoff (the island detaches and drifts) all on-page. The action is causally indispensable and irreplaceable: no other verb captures the mechanical and emotional severance. Cost is total: he leaves land and sister. Exceptional integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"By the call of a whale from the deep" is signaled (the whale etched on the scrimshaw, Kaelen's need to "listen"), executed (he sends a silent call, the whale answers with a pressure-thrum), and shapes the climax mechanics: the vibration resonates through the tethers to free the island. Setup is cryptic but present; development shows Kaelen preparing; payoff is on-page and causal. Swappability is low: a different method (e.g., spell, lever) would not tie to the whalebone. Minor: the mechanics are compressed; we do not see Kaelen learn this ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is both named and functional: the unnaturally low tide exposes the "colossal, petrified roots" that are the island's anchors, enabling detachment. The hidden cove provides the ritual space. Setup (first third: "tethered just beyond sight in the sublittoral fringe"), development (the cove at night), and payoff (the roots visible and torn free) all on-page. The setting constrains the ritual's timing (low tide) and supplies the visible tethers. Removing it makes the mechanics illegible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" is mentioned once ("a world that had long ago outlawed the sharp edges of conflict") and colors tone, but does not constrain on-page choices or tactics. Kaelen's dock work and the ritual proceed without reference to a past era of violence or current prohibition. Setup is present as context; payoff is absent. The timeframe is swappable with "after war" or "in a peaceful age" without altering story logic. Lyric resonance: the "dull ache of routine" vs. Kaelen's mythic escape has thematic charge but is not clock-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is stated by Kaelen and dramatized: his restless ocean-gazing, the dock-work cage he escapes, and the final choice to ride the island. Setup (first paragraph: his fluid grace vs. grunting laborers, his water fixation), development (his declaration to Elara), and payoff (he boards the island, does not look back) all on-page. Cost is visible: leaving Elara and land. Minor deduction: the motivation is articulated cleanly in dialogue rather than discovered through conflicted micro-choices; friction between freedom and loss is implied more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named in narration ("her face a familiar mask of combative tenderness") and modeled in Elara's behavior: sharp-edged love, thudding practicality vs. fragile plea, final "aching acceptance." The tone modulates from her challenge to softening under the scrimshaw's influence to bittersweet closure. It charges the final image: she stands in surf, face illuminated, combativeness washed away. Setup, development, and payoff all on-page. Minor: the phrase is stated rather than emerging purely from action and dialogue rhythm.</comment>
