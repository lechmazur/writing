<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost protagonist's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded—restoring laughter through the only medium left to him. His "mournfully eager" disposition manifests in embodied action (gathering sorrow into the pull cord) rather than labels. The wife's micro-response (tear + fragile smile) earns the shift, though the son remains a background placeholder. Interior contradiction is present but thin; the ghost's desperation could have been tested more sharply against futility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the wife's fragile smile seeds healing) with felt emotional cost visible on the page. The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative lens: density builds through sensory layering (dust motes, brittle leaves, half-sung lullaby) to a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (ghost, garage, three seasons post-death). One meaningful deepening (the wife hears the tune beneath the scream) narrows emotional options and forecloses the prior stagnation with visible tears and the twitching smile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel constrains and charges the climactic beat—sound bounces to maximize reach, drawing the wife into the hallway. The garage as repository of "forgotten projects" and the pull cord as "silent promise" anchor the ghost's limited agency. Dust motes, brittle leaves, and the faded plastic housing texture the neglect without becoming a catalog. The body-as-setting (spectral fingers wrapping the cord) qualifies under the micro-setting allowance and drives a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled in paragraph two and drives every beat. Escalation proceeds through the ghost's three pull-cord attempts, each gathering more resolve, culminating in the engine's roar and the wife's recognition—a tightening that forecloses the silence with visible cost (her tears, his "sliver of peace"). Agency is renunciation and endurance wrapped in noisy communication; the ghost cannot hug or joke, only orchestrate elements. The leaf-macerating beat adds tactical specificity (shredding emblems of grief) that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (love persisting beyond death, grief vs. healing) emerges from the pull cord's resurrection and the lullaby woven into mechanical scream—no thesis statements. The final image (tear, smile, seed of healing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "How does the unspoken restore connection?" Subtext operates strongly in the wife's progression from flinching to disbelieving curiosity to recognition. The hourglass metaphor and "echo chamber tunnel" recur with shifted weight, avoiding symbolic convenience. Minor demerit: "tending to the unspoken" risks prompt echo, though it's mostly enacted rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady on the ghost with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is specific—he filters through love and mechanical memory ("a conduit for his particular brand of noisy care"). Diction remains apt ("spectral fingers, more memory than matter") without register drift. The wife's interiority in the final paragraphs (fear to curiosity to recognition) is cleanly external until the tear moment, where free indirect briefly deepens without breaking POV. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure (short fragments at the engine's catch). Minor template cadence in "He gathered… He poured…" slightly flattens momentum mid-climb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("silence so dense it felt like a physical weight," "dust motes danced," "ghost of an effort") but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two paraphrase loops: "symbols of their stagnant grief" echoes "emblems of the family's neglect" within two lines; "the sound of him" restates the lullaby idea just after "cadence of her husband's humming." Template stems ("He gathered… He poured… He began…") create minor cadence monotony in the engine-start sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and action simultaneously. No major opacity or scaffold, but the accumulation of loops and stems merits −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost-using-a-leaf-blower frame is specific and memorable, transforming the haunting trope through tactile domestic detail (pull cord, two-stroke engine, echo chamber hallway). Emotional truth (a father's helpless love channeled through the only tool left) avoids sentimentality. The lullaby-in-wind twist is fresh but borders on whimsy without full grounding—how the ghost half-sings while dead is gestured at ("phantom melody") rather than anchored in world rules. The transformation test passes: swap names/places and the arc loses its specificity. Minor proximity risk: "final grain of sand" + hourglass is stock imagery, though the "three seasons ago" detail personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ghost protagonist frames expectation early (paragraph one), drives all three pull-cord attempts (distinct beats), and his final perception of the wife's smile closes the arc. His choice to "orchestrate the elements" and "pour his whole being" into the third pull enables the climactic beat. The specific "leaf blower symphony conductor" role is irreplaceable—no other tool carries the same domestic history or acoustic range. Causal pressure is strong; without his agency, no escalation or closure occurs. The "conductor" metaphor recurs with reweighted meaning in "his performance" and "the roar of his symphony softened." Visible cost: he finds "a sliver of peace" but remains tethered and spectral, healing incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pull cord handle is introduced early (paragraph two: "hung from its cradle like a silent promise"), handled in three distinct beats (first pull, second pull with gathered sorrow, third pull pouring his whole being), and its success triggers the closure sequence. It functions as the sole conduit for the ghost's agency—his "spectral fingers" wrap it, making the constraint concrete. The object's specific mechanics (pull-start engine, cold and faded) matter; a button-start tool would eliminate the physicality and effort that embody his desperation. Not present in the final image itself, preventing a higher score, but its causal role is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is declared in paragraph three as his "delicate, desperate art" and shapes his tactics: he cannot hug or joke, only use noise to communicate. The concept constrains choices (he must rely on mechanical surrogates) and reappears at closure when "he had tended to the unspoken" and "a seed of healing" results. It structures the middle beats (macerating leaves as "symbols of their stagnant grief") and the wife's recognition of the lullaby beneath the scream. Slight demerit for being stated rather than purely enacted, but the actions (pull cord, leaf-shredding, lullaby-wind) dramatize it with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" is labeled in paragraph one and surfaces again when he "gathered his sorrow, his yearning" for the second pull. It constrains the ghost's approach (he pours emotion into mechanical action rather than detached haunting) and creates a visible tradeoff: his eagerness to connect meets the mourning reality that he remains spectral and limited. The attribute colors his perception ("helpless love," "sliver of peace") and appears implicitly in the closure's bittersweet tone. Moderate integration: the trait is more descriptive than causally decisive, and removing it would not break story logic, only soften emotional texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Macerate" (shred the brittle leaves with violent airstream) occurs mid-sequence as a tactical beat that advances his communication method and adds physical specificity to his "performance." The action is signaled early (leaves "tracked in and left to rot") and executed on the page, reweighting those leaves from passive neglect into active symbolic destruction. It shapes one distinct beat but is not load-bearing for closure—the lullaby recognition matters more. Swappable with "scatter" or "pulverize" without major loss, capping the score. The action does add visceral texture and demonstrates the ghost's rage-infused love, earning mid-band credit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method (half-sung lullabies on off-key wind) is seeded early when the ghost "used to hum while working" and "sung to his son in the cradle," then executed in the climactic beat where the wife hears "the ghost of a tune… beneath the mechanical scream." The off-key wind detail matters: it explains how a ghost's voice merges with engine noise, and the distortion ("faint, distorted by the motor's shriek") creates the recognition challenge that drives the wife's emotional turn. The mechanics are legible and irreplaceable—no other method delivers both noise and melody simultaneously. Present across three beats (setup, execution, recognition) and decisively shapes the closure by triggering the wife's smile.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "echo chamber tunnel" (long tiled hallway) is introduced early as a known feature and its acoustic properties drive the ghost's tactical choice: he guides the machine there to maximize sound's reach. The setting constrains his action (he needs a space that amplifies) and charges the final image by drawing the wife into the hallway where "the wind whipped a loose strand of hair" and she hears the lullaby. The specific geometry (floor to ceiling bounce) matters; an open room would dilute the effect. Present in setup, middle choreography, and closure, with the environment supplying the resource (echo) that enables the haunting to succeed. Irreplaceable and causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the final grain slips through the hourglass") is metaphorical rather than clock-driven: "three seasons ago" establishes elapsed grief but does not create urgency or tighten choices in the present action. The ghost's decision to act now is motivated by accumulated sorrow, not a deadline. The hourglass image recurs as a thematic anchor (mortality, finite time) but does not function as a ticking constraint that alters tactics. Lyric setup with modest closure reprise (the silence was broken), earning mid-band credit, but the timeframe is largely decorative rather than mechanically load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to restore lost laughter" is declared early ("simple and agonizing") and drives every beat: the ghost selects the leaf blower specifically because it once connected his world to theirs, pulls the cord three times with escalating emotional investment, and orchestrates the wind + lullaby to break the household's silence. The wife's fragile smile at closure directly answers the motivation, planting "a seed of healing" that is "not laughter, not yet, but a start." Cost is visible: the ghost remains spectral and achieves only partial success ("a sliver of peace"). The motivation is dramatized through choice rather than told-only, and friction between his want (full restoration) and reality (limited agency) creates authentic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone ("true haunting") is coherent and modulates purposefully: the opening silence is "dense… like a physical weight," the engine's roar is "deafening, atonal," and the lullaby is "faint, distorted." The piece teaches that this haunting is "not of malice, but of memory" early, holding that distinction through escalation (violent airstream meets tender melody). Tone charges the final image when the wife's fear gives way to disbelieving curiosity, then tears and a fragile smile—grief meeting love without sentimentality. The "echo chamber tunnel" and "mournfully eager" beats reinforce the haunting's dual nature (loud yet tender). The tone tightens pressure and delivers emotional cost without becoming static or one-note.</comment>
