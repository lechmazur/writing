<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in moments like "jealousy for the man who had that dream so overwhelming, that something inside me snapped." Internal contradiction operates well between the desire to chronicle and the impulse to escape. The progression from resenting past selves to seeing them as "points on a single, sprawling map" is earned through the waking-trance flight experience. Minor slip: the final pivot to "artistry" feels slightly pat given the prior psychic wreckage, though the cost of living with fragmentation remains visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection and memory until the flight-trance breaks the pattern and reweights the stance. Orientation anchors (mountain ranger cabin, charcoal on birch bark, post-grave timeframe) land cleanly in the opening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator moves from jealous fragmentation to integrated authorship) with visible cost—he must live within the "strange and fractured narrative" rather than escape it. The flight memory providing the breakthrough reads as motivated by accumulated nostalgia rather than convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cabin's rough-hewn walls, grimy window, and pine-needle scent are filtered through the narrator's crisis and constrain his options (no escape route except inward). The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting, anchoring the chronicling task in tactile detail. The aerial view during the flight sequence reweights the landscape ("the clearing where I'd imagined the grave might be, a patch of earth no different from any other"), charging the final return to the table. Spatial choreography during the flight is slightly abstract but serves the waking-trance logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: distill chaos into narrative to survive the chronologically confused state. The escalation is accumulative: jealousy of past selves intensifies until the flight memory triggers the waking trance, which narrows options by proving that integration is possible only through acceptance, not escape. The final turn—moving from triage to artistry—forecloses the survival-only stance with visible cost: he must chart the chaos rather than defeat it. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length; the protagonist's shift is earned by the sequence of reflection → nostalgia → breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the birch bark scroll, the imagined grave, the memory of flight. The ending image (steady hand, charcoal, "finally ready to distill it") offers a resonant answer to the question of how to live with temporal fragmentation—map it rather than fix it—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the contrast between "jaded wonder" and "strange, quiet awe." The conceptual cost is legible: he cannot erase the grave-sight or restore linear time, only reframe his relationship to all his selves. Minor thinness: "artistry" as the resolution keyword lands slightly abstract compared to the visceral earlier beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator notices knots in wood as "staring, judgmental eye[s]," filters memory through the lens of chronological confusion, and frames flight as "willed." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the jealousy spiral and expanding during the aerial view. Diction stays within a literary, introspective register consistent with a chronicler; phrases like "feral nostalgia" and "phantom ache of a future headstone" are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "obscene" (describing hope) and "artistry" feel slightly elevated compared to the earthier "scraped his knee" and "town sidewalk," but the effect is contained and does not fragment the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the flight sequence ("rushing past my face," "tore at my clothes") and slowing for reflection. Information density is high; most lines advance character state or thematic pressure. Minor loop detected: "jealousy" and "envied"/"resented" cycle across adjacent paragraphs without adding new pressure until the flight memory shifts the pattern. A few stock phrases ("thick with dust motes," "hazy but hopeful future") reduce specificity slightly. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains propulsive and imagistically clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, temporal confusion, and self-jealousy feels purposeful and less common than standard time-travel regret plots. The waking-trance flight as the solution mechanism—remembering an old dream to transcend present fragmentation—is a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the refusal of tidy resolution elevate the piece. Weakness: the "chronicler learning to see all selves as one story" arc has some proximity to workshop templates about narrative integration as healing; the specific detail (birch bark, ranger cabin, grave-date confusion) provides enough particularity to mitigate but not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; the narrator's decision to "push the scroll away" and then return to write after the flight experience creates a key turn. The choice to move from "triage" to "artistry" alters tactics at closure. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development shows the chronicler unable to summon a dreamscape, which pressures the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in the opening beat (charcoal crumbling against it), is pushed away mid-scene when frustration peaks, and returns at closure when the narrator pulls it back with a "steady hand." The scroll's material fragility mirrors the narrator's psychic state. Reweighted meaning: initially a site of failure ("my mind refused the fantasy"), finally a canvas for integration. Three beats with evolving use and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named and embodied early: "a longing so sharp and savage it felt like a physical hunger." It drives the jealousy of past selves and triggers the flight-memory sequence, shaping the middle escalation. At closure, the nostalgia is resolved ("gone, replaced by a strange, quiet awe"), which reweights the stake. Present in setup and development with clear causal pressure; closure participation is implicit (the shift away from it) rather than active reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is established early ("yesterday and next week are bleeding into one another") and mentioned as context for the grave-date mystery. It constrains the narrator's ability to trust his timeline. However, the trait does not visibly alter a specific on-page tactic or choice; it functions more as backdrop pressure than a decision lever. Functional but largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Soar" is seeded via the flight-memory description, enacted in the waking-trance beat ("I was no longer looking out the window; I was above it"), and the aerial perspective directly enables the realization that all selves are "points on a single, sprawling map." This realization drives the closure shift from jealousy to integration. Removal would eliminate the mechanism for the protagonist's breakthrough. Indispensable to the turn and ending charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is signaled early and dominates the middle section, detailing envy of the boy with the scraped knee and the young lover. The jealousy accumulates pressure until the flight memory interrupts it. The method shapes the problem and the breakthrough, though the mechanics are more thematic than procedural. Setup, development, and indirect payoff (resolved by the aerial view) present; causal role in escalation is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin anchors who and where in the opening and recurs at closure ("the man who learned to soar above his own timeline"). The porch is the launch point for the remembered flight. The cabin's isolation supports the reflective stakes but does not materially constrain a choice—hiking out is never weighed against staying. Functional setting with one reprise that charges the final image, but swappable with any isolated refuge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is present in the opening ("since I saw my own grave last autumn, or maybe it was ten years from now") and frames the chronological confusion. It recurs during the flight when the narrator sees "the clearing where I'd imagined the grave might be." The timeframe pressures the narrator's fragmentation but does not tighten decisions in real time—no urgency or countdown. Setup and thematic callback present; closure participation oblique.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is the stated task in the opening line and the explicit motivation. It is tested when the narrator's "mind refused the fantasy" and he pushes the scroll away. At closure, the motivation shifts from survival ("triage") to artistry, which forecloses the purely defensive stance with visible cost. Setup, middle friction, and payoff all present; the shift reweights the dominant stake and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" appears explicitly ("My motivation had once been discovery, a sense of jaded wonder") and modulates by the end to "strange, quiet awe" and "wonder was no longer jaded." The tone coheres through reflection and emotional turns, and the shift charges the closure. Present in setup, developed through the jealousy beats, and reweighted at the ending. The explicit labeling of the tone shift slightly reduces its integration compared to pure dramatization, but the progression is legible and purposeful.</comment>
