<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's emotional numbness is embodied through flat affect and focused perception, and his drive to feel again threads consistently through the vivify attempt. The "slices through pretense" attribute works functionally when he reads Jin's fear. However, the interior relies heavily on elevated abstraction ("dissolution," "phantom limb of an emotion") that distances rather than grounds, and the final beat's "terrifying sense of responsibility" arrives as a label rather than a contradictory impulse enacted in scene. The micro-choice to proceed despite Jin's protest is present but the embodied cost remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Kael, floating dojo, post-ego-death present) land within the first paragraph. The vivify sequence provides one meaningful tightening: Kael's choice to channel opposites sparks the brain into independent thought, and the story closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—responsibility cracks the numbness without full resolution, options are reconfigured, and the cost (new dependency, vulnerability) is legible in "terrifying" and the thought *Query: What is this place?* The clone custody battle as dramatic scaffolding feels thin on the page (Jin's protest is brief, resolved by act rather than negotiation), slightly weakening mid-escalation, but closure coheres and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and temporal static sky anchor setting early and contribute atmosphere. The shoji screen and wooden stand provide tactile micro-setting. However, these elements remain largely decorative: the dojo's isolation and the rewriting sky do not constrain Kael's choice or alter tactics. The jar sits on a stand but is not handled with physical specificity (temperature, weight, resistance). Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not charge the closure image or pressure a key turn, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat numbness by creating new feeling—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael ignores Jin and proceeds with the vivify, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off (risk of failure, Jin's opposition, drain of self). The cost is partially legible: "a pulling sensation" and the final responsibility, though the latter trends toward label. Jin's interference adds situational pressure but deflates quickly. The story reaches strong mid-band execution with visible agency and a foreclosed path, yet the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally enacted, preventing entry to 8.0+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—creation from wreckage, the cost of reanimation, responsibility as a crack in numbness—emerges organically from the vivify act and the brain's first query. The "complementary opposites" method and the fire/void pairing offer non-literal answers to the void. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a profound and terrifying sense of responsibility," "the numbness had not been defeated, but…had a crack") rather than trusting the image of the glowing brain and the thought-brush. The piece invites reflection but does not fully escape its own explanation, and "clone custody battle" as prompt language weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dust motes," "temporal static," "phantom limb of an emotion") but trends toward a uniform literary register that flattens under peak pressure rather than sharpening. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Jin's lines carry goal (stop the act) but minimal subtext. The perceptual signature—Kael's detached observation, honed by numbness—is present but not deeply particular. Free indirect style is clean. The prose remains legible and controlled but does not achieve a distinct rhythmic signature or voice modulation at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies moderately; sentence openings show some diversity. Clarity is high and information density is good in the vivify sequence. However, several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "fear of the unknown, fear of a consciousness unbound" is paraphrase within a line; "It was not a resurrection of his old self, but the birth of another" restates the prior "newborn" image without added pressure; "not joy, not peace, but…" is a stock negation structure. Elevated diction ("coalescing," "nascent," "convulsed") holds but does not vary under stress. Filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") cluster in the climax. These patterns dull immediacy and prevent high-band entry; apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating dojo, temporal static, and brain-in-jar premise offer surface freshness, but the ego-death-survivor-seeks-feeling template and "creation through opposites" mysticism are familiar genre beats. The clone custody battle as framing feels thin and under-dramatized, reading more as prompt echo than organic conflict. The specific detail (shoji screen, glass jar, blue pulse) grounds the scene, and the final image (brain's query, crack in numbness) earns modest resonance. Transformation of tropes is partial: the vivify act is executed cleanly but the emotional arc follows a predictable template. Mid-band placement reflects competent synthesis without bold ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (ego death survivor) is present throughout, his numbness shapes perception, and his choice to proceed with the vivify despite Jin's protest is a key turn. The attribute "slices through pretense" enables him to read Jin's fear, affecting tactics. He appears in the closure unit (the responsibility crack). However, his agency in the middle is more endurance than decision—he meditates and channels but does not adapt or wrestle with a mid-scene complication. Two beats (reading Jin, executing vivify) plus closure participation place him solidly in the 6–7 range; the lack of a second adaptive choice caps him at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brain in a jar (labeled DUPLICATE) is introduced early (setup), handled at the climax (Kael places hands on jar, feeds it opposites), and its transformation (blue light, neural activity, independent thought) shapes the closure. Three beats: introduction, vivify act, and closure query. The jar is irreplaceable—remove it and the story collapses. However, the handling is somewhat abstract (hands on sides, energy coalescing) rather than tactile (temperature, resistance, weight). Strong causal role and closure linkage, but the physical specificity gap and slight swappability (could be another vessel) cap it at 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is named explicitly and frames Jin's demand to hand over the jar. Setup is present. However, the "battle" is resolved in a single exchange with no negotiation, escalation, or cost—Jin stops and watches, awestruck, without further resistance. The concept does not constrain middle choices or return at closure with reweighted meaning. It reads as ornamental scaffolding rather than a driver of on-page pressure. Functional presence but highly replaceable; 3.2 reflects minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is signaled early ("his gaze, honed by his condition, sliced through pretense") and enables one key beat: Kael reads Jin's fear rather than accepting the stated concern, which informs his decision to act. Setup and middle development are present. However, the trait does not return at closure or shape the vivify act itself; it is used once and then dormant. The cost (Jin's mask cracks, but no consequence for Kael) is minimal. One beat plus early signal place it in mid-band; lack of closure linkage and single use cap it at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivify is the story's central action: setup (Kael's plan), development (the channeling of opposites, hands on jar, energy pulse), and payoff (brain sparks to life, independent thought, responsibility emerges). The act is irreplaceable—remove it and no closure exists. It drives two major beats (the attempt, the success) and shapes the ending directly. Visible cost (drain, pulling sensation, responsibility) is present. The specificity of the method (fire/void pairing, blue light pulse) makes it non-swappable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; slight abstraction in the execution (energy rather than tactile resistance) keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Complementary opposites is introduced as "core tenet" early, signaled in Kael's meditation prep, and enacted at the climax (fire/void, presence/absence, hot/cold pairing). Setup and development are present; it shapes the vivify attempt and thus the closure. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—Kael "feeds" opposites without clear on-page friction or tradeoff within the method itself. The method is thematically charged but not irreplaceable (another mystical technique could substitute with minor edits). Two beats plus closure participation place it in the 6–7 range; the abstraction and swappability cap it at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is introduced early (setup) and provides atmosphere (clouds below, temporal static). The shoji screen and wooden stand add micro-setting detail. However, the setting does not constrain Kael's choice or alter tactics—he could perform the vivify anywhere. Jin enters through the shoji, but the door is decorative rather than a barrier. The dojo's isolation and the rewriting sky do not pressure the ending. Setup is present, but middle development and closure participation are absent. Functional presence without causal work; 4.8 reflects replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself for the seventh time that cycle" and "the sky flickered…as the world's timeline convulsed again" are present as atmospheric texture. Setup is clear. However, the timeframe does not tighten Kael's decision, create urgency, or shape tactics—he proceeds at his own pace without reference to the rewriting cycles. The convulsion occurs during the vivify but as backdrop, not constraint. Middle development and closure participation are absent. Ornamental use with no causal pressure; 3.6 reflects presence without integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation (defeat emotional numbness, feel again) is introduced early, dramatized in Kael's meditation and the vivify attempt, and reappears at closure ("the numbness had not been defeated, but…had a crack"). The desire drives the central choice (proceed despite Jin). Three beats: setup (stated drive), vivify act (pursuit), closure (partial success). The cost (responsibility, vulnerability to new attachment) is legible. However, the motivation is more told than shown in contradictory action—Kael does not wrestle with competing impulses on the page, and the "crack" is labeled rather than enacted. Strong presence and closure linkage; the lack of dramatized internal friction caps it at 7.3.</comment>
