<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to preserve wonder is rooted and dramatized through the matchbox-riddle choice rather than mere declaration. His affliction (involuntary truthfulness) constrains his options on the page—he cannot lie, so he chooses indirection—with visible cost to efficiency. Lena's exhaustion and shift from weary to intent are embodied and purposeful. The interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains concrete, though the final exchange ("Thank you, Silas") lands slightly too tidy for the complexity built prior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena walks away transformed from inspector to advocate, the lacquer box remains closed, and Silas's purpose is crystallized with felt cost (he has planted a seed but relinquished control of its outcome). The inferred lens is Hybrid-Causal-to-Accumulative: the riddle functions causally (narrows Lena's options and forces engagement), and the final image reweights prior material through the unopened box and the tower's lightning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena solves the riddle and grasps the bio-mechanical truth, narrowing her options from blame-hunting to cultural restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is concretely rendered and constrains the scene's spatial logic; Silas's tollbooth and the tower's managed arcs frame the closure image. Sensory details—ozone, pollen, syrupy dusk—are filtered through Silas's priorities and modulate from opening urgency to closure calm. The lacquer box functions as micro-setting, charged at the end when it remains closed. The tower charges the final image (lightning arcing against purple sky), meeting the 9+ gate test; however, the bio-mechanical drones are summarized rather than shown as environmental actors, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Silas's desire to reintroduce wonder versus sterile efficiency—is signaled early and drives the riddle choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena solves the riddle and her understanding shifts from glitch-hunt to cultural restoration, narrowing her path and foreclosing the pragmatic option. The cost is legible: Silas gives up certainty of outcome and Lena accepts the burden of reawakening a city. However, the escalation is more thematic than pressure-driven; the riddle itself is solved off-page in a single beat without visible struggle, and coincidence (Lena coming to Silas) sets up the conflict rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme—wonder versus sterile routine as life's necessity—emerges from the bio-mechanical drones' demise and Silas's riddle, not declaration. The final image (unopened box, lightning, Silas settling back) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: preservation of mystery as an act of care. Subtext operates in the riddle's poetry and Lena's shift from inspector to advocate. Minor slip: "The method to open it is in here" and the riddle's reveal lean slightly expository, and the phrase "cascading software glitch" as a lie is told rather than dramatized through contradictory evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV (Silas) is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Lena's worn-thin voice, Silas's flat factual tone—and carries subtext (she knows his affliction, he knows her purpose). The perceptual signature is selective: Silas notices "syrupy, nectar dusk" and the lacquer box's swirl, filtering through his desire for wonder. Minor slip: "involuntary truthfulness" and "affliction" are label-heavy in the opening exchange, and the phrase "quiet, stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine" edges toward expository interiority rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Opening line ("The air at the base…thick and sweet, tasting of ozone") anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Minor loop: "the truth" appears three times in close succession ("That holds the truth," "The truth about the blackout?"). Figurative language ("syrupy, nectar dusk," "heart had stopped") is coherent and voice-motivated, but "drone-bees" and "bio-mechanical life" in the riddle-reveal paragraph edge toward expository summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bio-mechanical drones needing cultural vibrancy is a fresh synthesis of sf and theme, and the riddle-as-pedagogy reframes the reveal as a lesson rather than an info-dump. The lacquer box remaining closed at the end is a bold, anti-expository choice. However, the core setup—afflicted truth-teller, inspector seeking hidden cause, city blackout—relies on familiar genre scaffolding, and the emotional arc (inspector learns deeper truth, leaves transformed) follows a well-worn template. The specificity of "nectar dusk" and "wings are sun-spun glass" elevates texture, but the transformation is thematic more than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas's choice to give Lena the matchbox (rather than simply stating the truth) creates the key turn and drives the riddle-solve beat. His affliction constrains him on the page: he cannot lie, so he chooses indirection with visible cost (efficiency versus pedagogy). He appears in the opening, middle, and final image, and his motivation shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lacquer box is handled in three beats: Lena notices it, Silas describes it ("That holds the truth"), and it remains closed at the end, recharging the theme of preserved mystery. However, its mechanics are static—it is never opened, and no attempt is dramatized—so its physical properties (ornate, black-and-gold swirl) do not constrain choice. The closure linkage is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is the inciting event and shapes the dominant stake (city needs power, Silas seeks to restore wonder). The riddle directly references it ("My wings are sun-spun glass"), and Lena's realization ("The drone-bees weren't just machines") is the key turn. However, the failure itself is summarized backstory; no on-page action involves a drone or hive, and the bio-mechanical life is explained rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Silas's involuntary truthfulness constrains his choice on the page: he cannot lie about the glitch, so he must use the riddle to convey truth indirectly. The trait is dramatized in dialogue ("That is a lie") and Lena's recognition ("she knew of his affliction"). Cost is visible: he sacrifices efficiency and clarity. However, the trait is labeled ("affliction, involuntary truthfulness") rather than purely shown, and it does not complicate the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reveal (Silas giving Lena the matchbox, Lena solving the riddle, understanding the drones' need for wonder) is the story's major turn. It shifts Lena's goal from glitch-hunt to cultural restoration and forecloses Silas's option to explain directly. The riddle-solve is the closure beat. However, the reveal is partially summarized ("The reveal settled") rather than fully dramatized in real-time action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle is signaled early (Silas slides it across), its mechanics matter (Lena shakes it, opens it, reads aloud), and it drives the riddle-solve beat that creates the key turn. The method shapes Silas's tactic (indirection) and Lena's engagement (forced to think rather than receive). It appears in three beats: introduction, riddle-read, and Lena pocketing it. High irreplaceability: any other delivery (file, datum) would undercut the theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is present in all three thirds: opening description, riddle reference ("I drink the storm…weave the light for north and south"), and final image ("tower's managed lightning began to arc against the purple sky"). It supplies the city's rationed electricity (resource) and charges the closure image. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice—Silas and Lena's actions would proceed identically in any setting—and its mechanics are described rather than used.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The blackout is the inciting event and frames the timeframe (Silas watches "the last rays of sun," citizens come for rationed electricity). However, no live clock tightens decisions: the conversation proceeds without time pressure, and the blackout's duration or urgency does not alter tactics. The timeframe is setup-only; it does not constrain middle choices or participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to preserve wonder is dramatized through the matchbox-riddle choice, voiced in interiority ("a quiet, stubborn desire"), and tested on the page: he sacrifices efficiency and control to force Lena's engagement. The friction between his desire (pedagogy) and the cost (uncertainty of outcome) is visible. The motivation drives the key turn and shapes the final image (lacquer box closed, Silas settled, "that was enough"). Minor label-heaviness ("preserve wonder in routine") slightly lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "nectar dusk" tone is coherent through the opening ("syrupy, nectar dusk that painted…faces in hues of gold and amber") and modulates to the ending ("purple sky"). The sweet-ozone atmosphere supports the theme of bio-mechanical life needing cultural richness. However, the tone is largely static mood-setting rather than a force that charges pressure; it does not tighten under stress or reweight the final image beyond color description.</comment>
