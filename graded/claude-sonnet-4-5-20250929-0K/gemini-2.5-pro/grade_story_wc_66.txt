<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's devotion is embodied through precise physical choices (pen selection, ink concealment, practiced tuning), and his motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" drives clear on-page actions with visible risk. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between his "clenching fear" and his calm execution, though the piece leans toward reverential steadiness rather than simultaneous emotional conflict in peak moments. The final choice to deliver the score is consistent but feels like continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost—he will simply repeat the cycle. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract framing of his interior state ("thistled calm," "singular quiet focus") where more embodied particulars would sharpen agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal lens: Elias transcribes forbidden lyrics in luminous ink, then verifies the words under shortwave glow, preparing to smuggle them into the symphony archive. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elias places the score with the stack, the cycle will continue, and the cost is the ongoing isolation and fear he accepts. The final image of "dust" learning stories provides conceptual repricing that reweights the opening devotion, though the lack of a live on-page pressure point or reversal slightly limits the felt immediacy of cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, shortwave dial glow, vellum, and luminous ink function as micro-setting that directly constrains and enables Elias's choices: the glow reveals the hidden words, the alcove is his sanctuary, the ink's wavelength-specific visibility drives his verification ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through his POV (jade light painting his frown, mist as accomplice) and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The final image of dust in the radio beam charges the thematic closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment/object shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forbidden stories against state erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the broadcast resolves and Elias must verify the luminous words, confirming success before delivery. Agency is present (he chooses to transcribe, verify, smuggle), but the piece lacks a live reversal or complication that narrows options under pressure; the process unfolds smoothly without a moment where failure looms or a tactical choice alters the plan. Cost is conceptual (ongoing risk, isolation) rather than a visible trade-off paid on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: the luminous ink, the clocksmith tale nested in music, the "revolution" practiced unknowingly by musicians. The final image—dust learning stories—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without moralizing, reweighting the opening devotion as a long-game defiance. The piece resists tidy binaries (state vs. individual) and earns its wisdom through the specific mechanics of concealment. Minor deduction for the line "teach dust to tell stories" bordering on abstraction, though the image itself is concrete enough to sustain thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization through Elias's perceptual signature (he notices the dial glow, the mist, the pen's flow). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a distinct lyric texture ("thistled calm," "phantom signal," "ghost made of light"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, though the narrative distance remains somewhat elevated throughout rather than tightening further at the verification beat. Psychic distance and perceptual selectivity are character-specific and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong sentence-level propulsion and high information density; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. The opening and closing images are vivid and earned. Minor loop detected: "the story famine" and "enforced silence" restate the same contextual fact in close proximity, and "singular, quiet focus" / "deep quiet" echo without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled but approaches density in the final paragraph ("constellations," "internal fire," "ghost made of light," "motes...vessels...whisper") without fully obscuring sense. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Overall craft is strong with minor textural redundancy that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of pirate broadcast, luminous ink chemistry, and musical smuggling offers a specific, non-obvious angle on resistance-under-censorship material. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with earned particulars (wavelength-specific glow, orchestra archive as Trojan horse). The core concept avoids template plot beats, though the broader frame—lone archivist preserving forbidden knowledge—is familiar territory. Risk-taking in the lyric closure (dust as vessel) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting modest bonus consideration within band. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's occupation as copyist is causally essential: his official role grants archive access (delivery beat), his skill enables precise transcription, and the contrast between state marches and forbidden stories sharpens his choices. Present in setup, middle (transcription work), and closure (delivery preparation). The role could not be swapped without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shortwave dial glow appears in setup (tuning), middle (painting his frown jade), and crucially at closure when Elias angles the score to reveal the luminous words—the glow's specific wavelength is the mechanism that completes his verification. Used in three distinct beats with evolving function, directly enabling the peak action. Removal would eliminate the verification payoff and the thematic charge of the final dust image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is the story's engine: it provides the forbidden content, shapes Elias's nightly ritual (tuning, transcription), and defines the stakes (illegal signal, state opposition). Present across all three acts and inseparable from the dominant conflict. The broadcast's mechanics (song lyrics as code) drive tactics on the page. Without it, no core narrative remains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The luminous ink is indispensable: its invisibility enables smuggling, its wavelength-specific revelation under shortwave glow is the verification mechanism, and its chemical properties (found in a charred book) anchor world logic. Appears in setup (ink pot introduction), middle (transcription), and closure (words blazing under glow). Drives the central tactic with visible cost (risk of discovery if the ink formula or verification ritual fails). No substitute mechanic works without rewriting the premise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cloaking the narrative "beneath the curve of a whole note or along the stem of a quaver" is the core action that bridges listening and delivery. Present in setup (method described), middle (active transcription), and closure (stack of cloaked scores ready for archive). Shapes two key beats and enables the smuggling tactic. Swappable only with another steganographic method, but the musical notation specificity ties to Elias's copyist role and raises irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method of hiding stories "via elusive song lyrics" is signaled early, drives the transcription beat (Elias separates tale from tune), and structures the broadcast's evasion of censors. Mechanics matter: casual listeners hear folk song, initiates decode narrative. Present across setup and middle; implicit in closure when the score joins others. Functional in two beats with clear causal pressure, though the lyric-decoding step itself is summarized rather than dramatized in granular choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove provides sanctuary and spatial anchor (carved from stone, with windowpane for mist). It frames the opening and closing images and the mist functions as "silent accomplice" at closure. The nook's isolation enables the illegal work, but the setting does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could perform the same actions in any private space. Lyric reprise charges the final image modestly but the alcove itself remains backdrop. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with thematic resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "story famine" timeframe establishes motive (libraries burned, poets outlawed) and explains why Elias's preservation work matters. Present in setup exposition and implicit throughout. It does not tighten a live choice or create a countdown that alters tactics on the page; the past crisis is context, not active pressure. The piece could function with minor edits if set during rather than after the famine. Lyric setup–closure nod ("after" → ongoing endurance) provides modest thematic weight but limited causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is voiced in the final third and dramatized through the luminous-word verification and the closing image of motes as vessels. It explains why Elias endures risk and isolation, shaping his long-game strategy (smuggling into archives for future discovery). Present in middle reflection and closure image with felt cost (ongoing fear, isolation). Slightly late first articulation and partial reliance on telling lower the score, but the dust-as-vessel image concretizes the desire and charges closure meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thistled calm is embodied in the opening posture ("devotion, spine straight") and sustained through "singular, quiet focus" and "deep quiet" at closure. The tone modulates subtly—opening reverence, middle intensity (pen flying, jade light), closing steadiness—without breaking coherence. The "sharp thistle of purpose" recurs at closure, reweighting the opening calm with the undercurrent of fear and defiance. Tone charges the final image and reflects pressure without static monotony. Strong integration across all three acts with purposeful modulation under stress.</comment>
