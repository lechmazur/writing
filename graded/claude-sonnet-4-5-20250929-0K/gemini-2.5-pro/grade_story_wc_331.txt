<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies throughout, his "sanely eccentric habits" embodied in the precise arrangement of books and the scarf ritual. Internal experience differs meaningfully from external calm—the "tremor in his hands" and "breathtaking moment" land with embodied specificity. The choice to continue ("his shift was far from over") reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (patience, solitude, incremental progress), though the stakes remain somewhat abstract. Minor slip: the vision itself ("a woman's laugh") arrives as declarative memory rather than contradictory impulse under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the ritual's escalation (chart consultation, scarf draping, geometric alignment), culminating in the vision that reweights the dominant stake ("he had touched it...proven the path"). Closure is Charged Poise—the moment of contact dissolves but reconfigures his project with felt cost (patience, incremental proof vs. capture). One tightening is sufficient for this length and lens; causality holds throughout the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Athenaeum is vividly particular ("cathedral of shelved paradoxes where equations rhymed"), and the scarf itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its tension and embroidery guide the geometric path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: ozone, nightshade, the "chromatic shimmer" all charge the climactic beat. The object (scarf) materially shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for this category. Spatial choreography of books, desk, and patrons remains clear; the setting pressures the protagonist's solitary method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to find the place where stories live") is signaled early and drives all action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scarf arrangement shifts from preparation to manifestation—the vision flickers, then dissolves, narrowing options to "proven the path" rather than capture. Agency is clear: Elias's meticulous choices (book placement, scarf tension) enable the contact. The cost is legible on the page: he has not captured the story, only touched it, committing him to further patient work. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the non-Euclidean geometry of memory, the scarf as vessel, the library as manifold. The final image—folding the scarf, settling back with a "quiet smile"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (where stories live) without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution; Elias proves method, not capture, embracing patience as cost. Subtext operates in the "analog memories" and the woman's laugh, which suggest personal history without exposition. The ending reweights prior material (all the preparation) as incremental, ongoing pilgrimage rather than one-shot discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; psychic distance stays controlled, with narration reflecting Elias's perceptual filter ("a man of sanely eccentric habits," "impossible curves"). Diction is elevated but consistent with the librarian's scholarly idiom ("topological anomaly," "geodesic path"). No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: measured in setup, then compressing during the ritual ("thrum," "shimmer"), breathing out in closure. Filter verbs appear sparingly and feel voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—geometry, memory, pattern—is character-specific and consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; information density is high (nearly every sentence advances ritual or stakes). Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm accelerates during the climactic beat without sluggishness. Minor deduction: "a figure of observed solitude, content in the silent space" and "a man alone with a universe of secrets" echo each other structurally across the arc, creating a subtle paraphrase loop (−0.2). Figurative language ("cathedral of shelved paradoxes," "saddle-shaped space") remains coherent and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Propulsion is consistent; no scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog memories, and library ritual feels specific and non-obvious; the scarf as geometric instrument rather than mere keepsake transforms a familiar trope. The premise (librarian seeking story-source) gains freshness through the mathematical method and the quiet, patient stance at closure. Emotional truth (solitary obsession, incremental proof) grounds the speculative frame. The transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would lose the mathematical specificity and the library's "cathedral of shelved paradoxes" texture. Risk-taking (non-Euclidean mechanics, no conventional antagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, justifying a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices create all key turns: retrieving the scarf, consulting Lobachevsky, arranging the books, draping the scarf with precise tension. His decision to fold the scarf and wait after the vision dissolves drives the closure (Charged Poise). Present in setup, middle ritual, and ending reflection. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is implicit in the ritual sequence. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Swappability low—remove the librarian role and the access to books, geometric texts, and patient method collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scarf appears in at least three beats: retrieval from the box, draping/tensioning during the ritual, and folding at closure. It is handled on the page with evolving function—first as "vessel of potent analog memories," then as geometric instrument ("miniature, two-dimensional representation"), finally as window to the vision. Closure participation strong: the scarf's folding bookends the arc and charges the final image. Specificity high: "deep crimson faded to the color of a drying wound," embroidered threads aligning with geometric lines. Cost tied to the scarf: it enables contact but not capture, imposing the price of patience.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analog memories shape the stakes (find where stories live) and prime the scarf's function as memory vessel. The concept changes options: the vision (rain-slicked street, woman's laugh) is analog memory reawakening, altering Elias's knowledge from theory to proof. Present in setup ("analog memories from a life he suspected was once his own") and payoff (the vision). Missing explicit middle beat where memory constrains a tactical choice during the ritual. Two-of-three gates; causal role in one major beat. Swappability moderate—"memories" alone could replace "analog" with minor edits, though the texture (scent, embroidery) reinforces the analog frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is labeled in the opening and demonstrated through the book arrangement and scarf ritual, but no on-page moment shows the trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. The trait colors voice and explains method but does not fork a decision. Present by implication throughout but not causally active. Label-only mention −0.3; no cost connection. Swappability high—"methodical" or "obsessive" could replace with similar effect. Below two-gate threshold; setup only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is signaled early ("analog memory...had begun to reawaken") and drives the story's major turn: the vision flickers, memory awakens briefly, then dissolves. This action redefines options from capture to proof. Present in setup (his belief that memory can be accessed), ritual climax (the vision scene), and closure (proven the path, not captured). All three gates met. Causal pressure strong; closure linkage direct. Specificity moderate—"reawaken" is thematically apt but near-synonyms ("revive," "activate") could substitute with minor edits. Cost visible: reawakening occurs but does not complete, imposing patience as price.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("practical application of hyperbolic geometry...mathematics of infinite, saddle-shaped space") and shapes middle tactics: Elias consults Lobachevsky, traces "impossible curves," and uses the scarf to represent a higher-dimensional curve. The method enables the vision, making it causally active. Present in setup, middle ritual, and implicit at closure (the method proved viable). All three gates met. Specificity strong—remove hyperbolic geometry and the library-as-manifold logic collapses. Minor deduction: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; no on-page moment shows geometry constraining a failed attempt or forcing a tactical adjustment (−0.4 for limited causal friction).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "scientific poetry library" (Athenaeum) frames the opening and supplies resources (books on celestial mechanics, quantum entanglement, Mandelbrot, Lobachevsky) essential to the method. Setting enables access and solitude, constraining Elias's approach to solo ritual during off-hours. Present in setup, implicit throughout the middle ritual (books as coordinates), and at closure (returns to his desk). All three gates met. Causal pressure moderate: the library provides materials but does not impose a tactical obstacle. Specificity high—"cathedral of shelved paradoxes where equations rhymed" is memorable and irreplaceable. Closure linkage weak: the setting recedes during the vision and does not charge the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Patrons browsing is mentioned in the opening ("two patrons drifted through the stacks") and once during the ritual ("The patrons browsed on, blissfully unaware"), with the elderly woman's brief pause near the climax. Time does not tighten decisions; no clock or patron movement constrains Elias's ritual. The timeframe establishes tone (liminal hours, observation) but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Setup present, closure absent. Swappability high—"during a quiet evening" or "alone after hours" would serve equally. Ornamental use −0.5; no cost connection −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to find the place where stories live" is stated early, drives the entire ritual sequence, and is dramatized through the vision and its dissolution. Friction between want (capture the story) and cost (only proof, patience required) lands clearly at closure. Present in setup ("his motivation was simple, yet impossibly vast"), middle (the ritual pursuit), and ending ("he had not captured the story, but he had proven the path"). All three gates met. Causal pressure strong: the motivation forecloses capture and imposes waiting as the visible price. Specificity moderate—"stories" could be "knowledge" or "memory" with minor thematic shift, but "place where stories live" is central to the piece's logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is established in the opening ("a figure of observed solitude, content in the silent space") and modulates with pressure: calm during setup, intensifying during the ritual ("breathtaking moment," "tremor in his hands"), then settling into "quiet smile" at closure. Tone charges the final image—solitude is not broken but deepened, reweighted from loneliness to patient pilgrimage. Present in setup, implicit during middle beats (the patrons remain unaware, Elias works alone), and explicit at closure ("a man alone with a universe of secrets"). All three gates met. Coherence strong; modulation purposeful. Minor deduction: "observed" as lens (who observes?) is somewhat ambiguous—does it mean self-aware solitude, or the narrator observing him? (−0.3 for slight conceptual fuzz).</comment>
