<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kenji's grief is embodied through rituals (shears, tracing lace) and his motivation is clear, but interiority leans toward abstract poetic register ("search for the color of unspoken apologies") rather than character-particular contradiction. The final shift—guilt softening, diffusing—is told through metaphor ("shard… began to soften") without a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path with cost. Emotional progression reads as smooth transformation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and pattern accumulate toward a final RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the compass ritual and lace instructions pay off in the granite-bluff beat. Closure lands on the page—the compass steadies, guilt diffuses, Kenji returns altered—but the cost is atmospheric (warmth, diffusion) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off. Orientation is clear early; the structure is a two-shard sequence (cottage interior → bluff → cottage return) within one window, meeting scope defaults.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Islet setting is vivid and selective: windswept juniper, granite bluff, scent of salt and damp earth. The compass in Kenji's hands and the bluff's stone constrain the ritual beat, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves (desk → bluff → desk). Sensory hierarchy reflects Kenji's priorities (lace pattern, compass needle) without tourist-catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating sorrow—is signaled early and tightens once when Kenji deciphers the lace and carries the compass to the bluff. The ritual beat narrows his emotional options (diffusion vs. crystalline shard), but the resolution is atmospheric rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens this is sufficient escalation, though the cost remains implicit in the final image rather than dramatized through a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as dispersal rather than erasure—emerges from the lace-knot instructions and compass ritual without overt statement. The final image (compass fading, shears in hand, "shape not just branches, but the silence") offers a resonant answer to the opening question. "Color of unspoken apologies" shifts from search-object to felt glow, reweighting the premise. One minor slip: "posthumous act of kindness" briefly names theme mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Kenji notices ritual details (needle spacing, knot spirals) and filters setting through grief. Voice is stable, slightly elevated ("cerulean regret," "melancholic blue") but remains within the focalizer's contemplative register. No head-hopping. The single line of whispered dialogue ("When the tide turns…") advances plot by cueing the ritual. Psychic distance holds steady throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two frictions: "tides of remembrance" and "color of unspoken apologies" appear in adjacent paragraphs as conceptual restatements (paraphrase loop). Stock phrase "the day of the severance" recurs without adding pressure. The compass-glow beat is vivid, but elevated diction ("vast canvas of cerulean regret") in a peak moment slightly distances rather than sharpens. No grammar or continuity errors; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lace-as-map premise and ghost-compass mechanics offer a fresh synthesis, avoiding generic grief templates. The turn—misunderstanding the search as literal rather than felt—grows from prior material. However, the setup (inherited compass "points to what you had lost," lace as instructions) leans on convenient symbolic properties introduced for closure rather than emergent from earned character history. Specificity in bonsai work and islet life anchors universals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Kenji is present throughout but functions more as contemplative observer than tutor; no tutoring action appears, and "slow-spoken" is not dramatized. His choices (deciphering lace, carrying compass) drive beats, but the tutor attribute remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compass is handled in three beats: inherited context (first third), ritual preparation (middle), and bluff climax (ending). Its needle behavior (erratic → steady) constrains the ritual's timing and charges the final image with the blue glow. Removing it breaks the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is introduced early, recurs as metaphor, and the literal tide-against-wind condition triggers the compass ritual, altering Kenji's emotional state. The concept shapes both tactics (waiting for tide-wind convergence) and the diffusion payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" appears twice (opening, ending) to describe Kenji's movements. The trait constrains his method—patience and ritual—but no visible cost or tradeoff is tied to this specific quality. It colors tone more than enabling or blocking action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Diffuse" is the action named in the lace instructions and enacted at the bluff: guilt "began to diffuse, losing their brutal concentration." The compass ritual exists to perform this diffusion, which redefines Kenji's emotional state and closes the arc. Swapping it would require rewriting the lace instructions and climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lace-pattern instructions are introduced in the second paragraph, deciphered across months (middle reflection), and their directive ("when the tide turns…") triggers the bluff ritual. The method's mechanics—knots as words, spaces as breaths—matter on the page and shape Kenji's timing and understanding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Islet setting is established early (windswept juniper, salt air) and the granite bluff provides the ritual stage. The breezy, post-rain atmosphere reflects tone and the tide-wind convergence enables the compass to steady. Removing the islet would require a different ritual location, but any isolated, tidal site could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames the two-year span and signals Kenji's ongoing grief. The timeframe establishes emotional distance from the fight but does not create a ticking clock or narrow tactics. It anchors the backstory without pressuring the present scene's decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to "find the color of unspoken apologies" is introduced early, pursued through lace decipherment, and reframed at closure (not finding but feeling it as glow). The shift from search-object to felt state is the story's pivot. Cost is implicit: months spent deciphering, acceptance of irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" names the sky color and emotional texture, appearing in the bluff beat and charging the final image (memories "part of the vast, melancholic blue"). Tone modulates from sharp crystalline guilt to soft forgiving glow, coherent across turns and embodied in the compass light.</comment>
