<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clearly stated ("to spark a silent revolution") and his interior reflects his disciplined mask over true allegiance, but internal contradiction never surfaces—he experiences no genuine tension or cost in this moment. The "tremor in his own veins" is mentioned but immediately overridden by "practiced casualness," flattening the embodied struggle. His final smile reads as satisfaction without visible forfeit; the revolution succeeds off-page through signals to unnamed conspirators, rendering his agency more orchestrator than protagonist under pressure. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under immediate personal cost are present but muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors—vigilant sentinel, luminous fort, blackout—land cleanly within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Causal: Kael's bronze-quill-holder unlock sends signals that trigger off-page allies to act, a because/therefore chain. Closure is a Decisive Change (the fort's control shifts to conspirators) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: the old guard shouts "unaware their authority had just been dismantled." One meaningful tightening occurs when the chime resonates and the light-pattern shifts. However, the cost remains largely told rather than felt—Kael smiles in satisfaction with no on-page forfeit or visible personal price, and the revolution's success unfolds via summary rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort's phosphorescent algae walls and glowing moss-slicked stone create a vivid micro-setting, and the half-painted sundial anchors the climactic unlock. The bronze quill holder constrains Kael's method (he must turn it against coded numerals), satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that shapes choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's vigilant stance. Spatial choreography is clean: main gate → central courtyard → sundial. The setting does not evolve causally after the unlock; the change is described in summary ("dozens of windows… began to flicker"), limiting the environment's live pressure on subsequent action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seizing fort control during the blackout—is signaled early and Kael's unlock creates one meaningful tightening when the light nodes flicker in unified cadence. Agency is present: Kael's decision to use the quill holder drives the turn. Yet escalation is thin; the unlock succeeds without complication, and the off-page allies' subsequent actions are recounted in summary without visible friction or cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but the lack of a second on-page reversal or visible trade-off (Kael experiences no loss, no tactical adjustment under resistance) keeps pressure from deepening into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—silent revolution via hidden infrastructure rather than overt violence—emerges clearly through the quill-holder unlock and light-signal network. The half-painted sundial's dual state (beautification folly / revolutionary fulcrum) offers a purposeful image that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in Kael's "mask of disciplined obedience" and the "quiet, efficient transfer of control." However, the final paragraph's "A slow, satisfied smile touched Kael's lips" and "a silent promise kept" drift toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The ending avoids overt moralizing but edges close to stating rather than embodying the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and Kael's perceptual signature—"winking hush and secrets," vigilant scan, practiced casualness—is distinct. Diction is controlled: "bronze quill holder, tarnished from years of handling," "cradle of sparks," "nutrient flows." No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Kael kneels and executes the unlock. However, register occasionally elevates beyond soldier idiom: "fulcrum of his intrigue," "dormant, secondary network woven into the fort's very soul" reads slightly literary for a sentinel's interior under blackout stress. Dialogue is absent; no test applies there. Voice remains character-particular without major slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor cleanly. Information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He was unlocking the cradle of sparks, a dormant, secondary network woven into the fort's very soul" repeats the concept of hidden infrastructure already established. Template cadence surfaces in the final third: "The chief engineer would see… The quartermaster would see… The captain… would see" stacks identical stems across three sentences (−0.5). "Winking hush," "luminous fort," "cradle of sparks" recur as ornamental phrases without evolving pressure. Figurative density ("island of soft, pearlescent light," "ink-black backdrop," "gentle life of their own," "steady heartbeat") clusters in the opening without clear payoff, though it does not obscure causality. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—lock-sentinel protagonist uses a bronze quill holder as geometric key to trigger silent coup via light signals—offers a fresh synthesis of heist, low-tech network intrigue, and bioluminescent fort. Specificity (coded sundial angles, phosphorescent algae) grounds the concept. Yet the emotional arc is thin: Kael executes his plan without meaningful friction, and the final satisfaction reads as a payoff without visible cost or second-guess. The "half-painted sundial" as revolutionary fulcrum is inventive, but the conspiracy's off-page resolution and the parade of allied roles in the penultimate paragraph ("chief engineer… quartermaster… captain") drift toward checklist rather than lived consequence. The transformation test is middling; swapping names and setting would leave the plot largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael ("vigilant lock sentinel") is present throughout, makes the key decision to use the quill holder, and his disciplined mask / true-allegiance duality drives his method. Setup: opening line. Development: he shifts weight, moves to the courtyard, executes the unlock. Payoff: the final image shows him observing the light patterns and smiling. His choices create the story's lone turn (chime → signal cascade). Causal pressure is strong; specificity is high (no generic sentinel could replace him). Cost is conceptual (old guard loses control) but not visibly felt by Kael himself, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in three beats: Kael closes his fingers around it at his belt, presses and turns it against the sundial's gnomon (the unlock), and slips it back into his tunic. Setup: first third. Development: the unlock is the story's hinge. Payoff: its removal signals completion. The object's "complex geometric key" property is irreplaceable and drives causality. Specificity is high ("tarnished from years of handling but heavy with purpose"). Cost linkage is present but indirect—the holder enables the revolution without personal forfeit to Kael. No single-beat static mention; all three touches are functional.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" is Kael's internal label for the "dormant, secondary network" embedded in the fort's luminous foundations. Setup: mid-story. Development: the unlock activates it. Payoff: the light nodes flicker in the ending. The concept shapes stakes (control of the fort's infrastructure) and tactics (Kael must use the sundial to access it). However, "cradle of sparks" as a phrase is largely ornamental—the network itself is the causal agent, and the metaphor does not constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning. The concept is functional but the poetic label is swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is stated in paragraph two ("His mind always calmly inventive under a mask of disciplined obedience"). The trait is demonstrated when Kael devises and executes the sundial unlock with "practiced casualness that defied the tremor in his own veins." Setup: early. Development: the unlock sequence embodies inventive calm under blackout chaos. Payoff: his unreadable mask in the final image. However, the trait is largely label-plus-illustration rather than generating visible trade-off—calm does not cost him speed or force a second adjustment. Causal work is present but the attribute's cost is conceptual, not on-page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is Kael's stated method ("the fulcrum of his intrigue") and the story's spine: covert manipulation of infrastructure signals to overthrow the Warden without overt violence. Setup: early in Kael's interior ("man of winking hush and secrets"). Development: the sundial unlock and signal cascade are intrigue in action. Payoff: "revolution would have no grand proclamations… only the quiet, efficient transfer of control." The action is irreplaceable—open combat would break the premise. Yet the intrigue succeeds without complication; a second beat testing or complicating the covert method would tighten necessity. Strong causal role, minor swappability for "subterfuge" or "conspiracy" at the lexical level.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial with coded Roman-numeral angles (IV, VII, II) is the mechanical hinge of the plot. Setup: "half-forgotten in a bed of pale flora… a useless folly… To Kael, it was the fulcrum." Development: Kael turns the quill holder against the numerals to send the unlock command. Payoff: the chime and light-pattern shift originate from this method. The sundial's dual state (beautification project / revolutionary key) and specific angles make it irreplaceable. Mechanics are signaled and matter causally. Cost linkage: using the sundial at this moment during the blackout enables the coup. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff; the method is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" is established in the opening line and sustained throughout: phosphorescent algae walls, glowing moss, twilight backdrop, ink-black city below. Setup: immediate. Development: the fort's bioluminescent infrastructure houses the hidden signal network; Kael moves from main gate to central courtyard. Payoff: the window-panes flicker in unified cadence, visible because the fort glows. The setting's luminosity is irreplaceable—signal coordination depends on visible light nodes. The fort pressures choices by isolating Kael's allies (barracks, armory, communications tower are named but not deeply felt). Twilight is static; no causal evolution of light level during the scene. Strong micro-setting via recurring glow, moderate spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is the catalyst for Kael's action ("For the panicked captains… a crisis. For Kael… a cue"). Setup: opening paragraph. Development: the blackout creates cover ("thick with tension, a perfect cover") and urgency (captains panic, creating opportunity). Payoff: Kael watches "the panicked city" in the final image. The blackout tightens the decision window and supplies chaos as tactical advantage. However, elapsed time is untracked; no clock or countdown presses Kael's moves. The blackout is functional but not deeply felt as a live constraint—Kael completes his task without time pressure or threat of restoration. Gate participation is present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is Kael's explicit motivation, stated in paragraph two and dramatized through the sundial unlock and signal cascade. Setup: early ("His true allegiance was not to the iron fist… but to the idea of a world without it"). Development: the unlock is the revolutionary spark. Payoff: "revolution would have no grand proclamations… only the quiet, efficient transfer of control." The motivation drives all major choices and is irreplaceable. Friction is conceptual—Kael's mask hides his allegiance—but he experiences no on-page moment of doubt or competing want. Cost is told (conspirators will act) rather than personally felt by Kael. Strong causal role; minor deficit in embodied conflict over the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Winking hush" recurs as description of Kael's manner and the story's mood: "man of winking hush and secrets," "soft chime, no louder than a falling leaf," "silent language of light," "quietly secure," "without a single sword being drawn," "silent promise." Setup: paragraph two. Development: the tone modulates from vigilant tension (opening) to covert satisfaction (ending). Payoff: the final smile and "winking" light patterns charge the closure image with the promised hush. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the intrigue premise. However, "winking hush" as exact phrase appears once; subsequent "quiet" and "silent" are synonyms rather than charged reprises. Tone shapes atmosphere and aligns with stakes; specificity and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>
