<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction—pride versus safety—drives the arc and is embodied through the platinum labyrinth gestures. His breakthrough comes through concrete decoding rather than abstract epiphany, and the final acceptance of his flaw feels earned. The prince's ghost supplies sufficient pressure, though the uncle's political game remains abstract. Minor deduction: the milkmaid and blacksmith serve as atmosphere rather than applying direct relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (wisdom to begin the next game) with visible cost (the aching relief of truce, not triumph). The causal chain—memory → tapestry study → cipher decoding → labyrinth solution → hush unraveling—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when he identifies the frayed border as cipher. Orientation anchors (Elias, fountain, Stillwater, frozen time) arrive within the first ~80 words. Cost is felt: he gains forgiveness but cannot erase the move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The petrified fountain, frozen milkmaid, and suspended hammer establish the time-locked village vividly. The tapestry's frayed border constrains the decoding choice and charges the final image when the hush unravels. Sensory detail—cool platinum weight, gut-shaking thunder, cleansing rain—filters through Elias's chess-tutor perception. The setting functions as more than backdrop; it supplies the cipher that unlocks his absolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signals early and tightens through a single meaningful reversal: the realization that the simple defensive move was right, not cowardly. The protagonist's agency—his mental winnowing and acceptance of his flaw—drives the resolution; the labyrinth click and hush unraveling follow his insight, not coincidence. The visible cost is the prince's irretrievable life and Elias's permanent knowledge of his pride. One coherent escalation path suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as beginning the next game, not erasing the bad move) emerges from concrete action—decoding threads, aligning moves, accepting the dismissed defensive choice—without authorial intrusion. The final image (solved labyrinth, cleansing rain, quiet relief) offers a resonant answer to the central question. The tapestry's chaotic border mirroring his mental state operates as purposeful motif rather than token symbolism. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the final paragraph; the wisdom is earned through specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Elias; perceptual signature (chess metaphors, slender fingers on labyrinth, prideful self-diagnosis) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within an educated, reflective register appropriate to an exiled tutor. Minor deduction: phrases like "fierce repose he had cultivated" and "suffocating guilt" edge toward slightly elevated literary diction in a couple of beats, though they remain legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the decoding sequence. Information density is high; most lines advance character insight or escalation. Minor deductions: "a ghost that followed him even here" is a stock metaphor; "the woven hush unraveled with a sound like a million held breaths being released" leans slightly overwritten for the closure beat. Paraphrase check: "He had to succeed by decoding the frayed threads" and the preceding clause "His breakthrough came...from the messy, chaotic tangle of its frayed border" restate similar content, triggering a −0.2 penalty. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor guilt, time-frozen village, labyrinth puzzle, and tapestry cipher feels organic rather than checklist-driven. The transformation of the "defensive move as cowardly" into "right" reverses the typical brilliance-over-safety trope with specific stakes (a prince's life). The frayed-border-as-cipher detail supplies a fresh inflection. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. The core premise (frozen village, redemption puzzle) is familiar, but the chess-tutor particularization and the labyrinth/tapestry pairing offer enough specificity to avoid template feel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices—months studying the tapestry, focusing on the frayed border, mentally winnowing threads, accepting his flaw—create the key turn at closure. His decision to seek absolution in Stillwater frames the entire arc, and his final acceptance (not erasure) drives the resolution. The exiled-tutor identity supplies the chess lens and prideful flaw that constrain his path. Present early, active in middle beats, and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears in four beats: initial description (comfort in palm), method of thought (twist and turn as moves), alignment of rings with decoded threads, and final click at closure. Its mechanics—interlocking rings that mirror his mental process—matter causally; the solved sphere coincides with the hush unraveling. Removing it would break the tactile method and the closure image. High irreplaceability and closure linkage; strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The woven hush defines the setting stakes and supplies the constraint (frozen time grants him space to confront his moment). It unravels at closure, marking the resolution. However, the hush itself is more situational container than active choice-shaper; Elias does not negotiate with it or adjust tactics because of it—he decodes the tapestry, which happens to be the hush's source. Present early, returns at closure, but middling causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is embodied on the page: his fingers twist the labyrinth not from idle nervousness but as a method of thought, mirroring his mental winnowing. The trait enables the parallel decoding (tapestry threads → labyrinth rings) and constrains his approach (slow, deliberate). It appears in two beats and contributes to closure when the rings click into harmony. Swappability is low; the productive aspect differentiates it from mere nervous habit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Winnow" structures the central sequence: he must winnow truth from guilt, separate threads of pride from duty, isolate what happened from what he told himself. The verb recurs three times and defines the method of his breakthrough. The major turn—identifying the simple defensive move—traces directly to this sifting action. Removing "winnow" would require rewriting the core decoding logic; it is not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decoding the frayed threads is signaled early ("His breakthrough came...from the messy, chaotic tangle of its frayed border") and its mechanics matter: each thread corresponds to a move in the fateful game. The method shapes two beats—studying the border, then aligning threads with his labyrinth—and drives the resolution when he isolates the dismissed defensive move. The specificity (frayed border as cipher, not the serene center) is irreplaceable and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village provides vivid atmosphere (petrified fountain, frozen milkmaid, suspended hammer) and frames the absolution quest. The tapestry in the alderman's hall supplies the cipher resource. However, the village functions more as symbolic container than tactical pressure; Elias could decode his guilt in any isolated setting. The village's unraveling at closure adds resonance but is consequence rather than constraint. Present early, returns at closure, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" bookends the story (opening peal, final break overhead) and grants him subjective time ("seemed to stretch, granting him time"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the lull is permissive rather than pressuring. The thunder's arrival at closure marks resolution but does not force the move. Lyric reprise with modest causal weight; no mid-scene urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph one ("only in a place where time had no meaning could he confront the single moment that had ruined his") and dramatized through the decoding quest. Internal friction is concrete: pride demanded brilliance, safety required the simple move; he ignored the prince's fearful glance. The final acceptance—"forgiveness...was not the erasure of a bad move, but the wisdom to begin the next game"—closes the arc with visible cost (aching relief, not triumph). Desire drives every choice; friction is embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named once ("the fierce repose he had cultivated") and implied through "slow, deliberate" movements and "eyes tracing" during the climactic decoding. The tone modulates appropriately: stillness dominates until the hush unravels with "deafening clang" and "cleansing rain." The final image—eyes closed, quiet aching relief—returns to repose charged by the prior intensity. Coherent through turns and present at closure, though the label feels slightly imposed rather than fully woven into rhythm and diction throughout.</comment>
