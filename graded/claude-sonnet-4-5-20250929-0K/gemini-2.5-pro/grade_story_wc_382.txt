<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to learn building language is embodied through concrete actions—palm against wallpaper, feeling pulses—and her progression from comfortable illusion to demanding truth drives the final rooftop confrontation. Elias functions well as tutor-echo with distinct mannerisms ("patiently nimble," voice like dry leaves), though his interiority remains appropriately opaque given his nature. The final choice to become "librarian of whispers" feels earned by the tutorial arc, with visible cost in surrendering the agreed-upon lies. Minor slip: the transition from weekly tea comfort to "need for truth" could show one more micro-choice illustrating the curdle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the sugar-borrowing beat. The accumulative-textural lens coheres: tutorial sessions deepen Clara's fluency until the seal amplifies whispers and forces confrontation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Clara presses the seal into dirt, accepting custodianship with the cost of losing the comfortable fiction made explicit on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when curiosity "curdles into need," narrowing options and driving the rooftop scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Althea breathes through specific sensory anchors: groaning pipes, peeling wallpaper pulse, chipped plaster arguments, sun-bleached cat spot. The rooftop garden supplies the open-sky pressure that makes secrets feel lighter, and the terracotta planter receives the seal's spiral impression—micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: calm tutorial details (dust, dried lavender) versus the urgent meteor-streaked darkness. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Clara's need to understand building language and Elias's true nature—signals early and tightens when the seal makes whispers "louder, more distinct." The rooftop invitation is a calculated escalation: she "knew he would not answer direct questions within the confines of his apartment," forcing the confrontation into open space. The cost is legible: she trades the "silent sanctuary of denial" for truth, and Elias's revelation that "the lies had been a necessary fiction" reweights their entire relationship. Agency is decision-driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, accumulation, and the price of knowing—emerges through the spiral seal ("impressions are how a building remembers"), meteors as arriving/ending stories, and Clara's final custodianship. The "agreed upon lies" concept charges the thematic question without didacticism: truth is "a far more beautiful and intricate story" than the comfortable fiction. The seal pressed into dirt offers a resonant, non-literal answer—a promise to preserve rather than extract. No overt moralizing; the building-as-archive metaphor deepens through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Clara with a lyric register ("grammar of groaning pipes," "wreathed in the scent of dust") that matches her obsession. Elias's dialogue carries distinct idiom: "You are listening for the rhythm, not the noise." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during tactile learning moments, wider during the rooftop revelation. Minor diction slip: "curdle into a need for truth" edges toward elevated metaphor slightly outside Clara's established texture, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well ("She believed every brick held a whisper, every floorboard a memory" versus short declaratives at closure). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs. Two minor loop issues: "the comfortable illusion" / "silent sanctuary of denial" restate within two paragraphs, and "patiently nimble" appears twice as a descriptor without evolving meaning (−0.4 paraphrase/template). Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent; no filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost-as-building-memory premise transforms the standard haunted-apartment trope through specific architectural obsession and the seal as key/lock mechanism. The "agreed upon lies" frame and the rooftop confrontation setting offer fresh angles. Emotional truth—the necessary fiction as bridge to fluency—grounds the fantastical elements. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would collapse the building-language spine. Minor reservation: the tutor-student structure follows a familiar arc, elevated by specificity but not radically reimagined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias Vance (dead language tutor) is present from the sugar-borrowing beat, teaches Clara tactile fluency across multiple tutorial sessions, and delivers the rooftop revelation that he is "the building's accumulated memory." His decision to gift the seal and his final explanation redefine Clara's stakes and enable her custodianship choice. His non-departure and cold teacups seed the mystery early. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable given his dual function as character and building essence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears when gifted by Elias (setup), amplifies whispers and triggers Clara's need for truth (middle development), and is pressed into the planter dirt at closure as a promise (payoff). Its spiral face ("fossilized galaxy") and Elias's explanation ("impressions are how a building remembers") give it unique properties. Two distinct beats with clear causal pressure; the final act reweights it from tool to covenant. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core concept "agreed upon lies" is named on the page ("Their relationship was built on a foundation of agreed upon lies") and structures the entire narrative: weekly tea sessions avoid acknowledging Elias's nature, Clara must force truth by leaving the apartment's "silent sanctuary of denial," and the rooftop revelation dismantles the fiction with visible cost. It shapes Clara's tactics (the note, the rooftop venue) and charges the ending when "the lies were gone, but the truth was a far more beautiful…story." Present in all three gates with strong thematic and tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attribute "patiently nimble" appears twice as a descriptor for Elias: once when introduced as tutor, once as "a patiently nimble statue" during the rooftop scene. It colors his teaching style but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait reads as characterization rather than a lever that alters tactics. Setup present; middle and closure participation minimal. Functional but closer to label than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The action "interrogate" drives the major turn: Clara's decision that "she had to interrogate the source" motivates the rooftop invitation and the direct questions ("What is this, really? And what are you?"). The verb choice signals her shift from passive learning to active confrontation. The rooftop scene exists to execute this interrogation, and Elias's answers provide the closure revelation. Strong middle development and payoff; could score higher with earlier signal of interrogative intent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions" is the inciting method: Clara's shortage prompts the knock, Elias passes sugar "without a word," and this "simple act…somehow, inexplicably, turned into weekly tea sessions." The method establishes their relationship structure and the "agreed upon lies" that Clara later disrupts. Present in setup and middle (the sessions are referenced as ongoing context), and the ending explicitly marks their end ("the lies were gone"). Solid setup and thematic payoff; middle development is contextual rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Perseids supplies the climactic setting: Clara chooses it as "a place of open sky where secrets might not feel so heavy," and the meteor shower provides the backdrop for revelation ("The stars are falling, Elias"). The terracotta planter receives the seal's final impression. The setting enables the confrontation that the apartment would not permit and charges the closure image with celestial scale. Strong middle and payoff participation; setup minimal (not mentioned until needed).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clara's motivation "to learn the language of old buildings" is established in the opening lines ("Clara's obsession was with the language…"), drives her search for a teacher, structures the tutorial arc (palm against wallpaper, draft stories), and reappears at closure when she becomes "the new librarian of whispers." The motivation creates friction when curiosity "curdles into a need for truth," forcing the rooftop confrontation. Desire is dramatized through embodied learning and visible cost (trading comfort for knowledge). Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" as tone is established through the "slow, contented sigh" of The Althea, Elias's dust-and-lavender presence, and the "agreed upon lies" that neither party names. The tone modulates under pressure: comfortable illusion shifts to "need for truth," and the rooftop scene layers mystery (meteor-streaked twilight, silhouette from twilight) with the revelation's clarity. The final paragraph reweights the tone: "mysterious familiarity she'd always felt wasn't just with him, but with the collective soul of the place." Coherent across beats and charged at closure.</comment>
