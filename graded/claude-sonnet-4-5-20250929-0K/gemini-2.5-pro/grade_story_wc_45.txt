<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is strongly characterized through his bone-setting profession as metaphor for worldview, and his interior contradiction—rational skeptic who dismissed his wife's beliefs now confronting evidence—drives authentic choices. The yearning for Elara's faith he "could not share but now desperately needed" embodies genuine internal conflict. Minor slips: "shrewdly innocent gaze" reads label-only without demonstrating how this trait shapes his perception in scene, and the tear moment edges toward sentiment. The final constellation-drawing choice is earned by prior causality and forecloses his old certainty with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, one scene in the garden with brief opening contextualization; orientation anchors cleanly. Causal lens holds: the discovery of the tooth forces acknowledgment of a reality he dismissed, which drives the constellation-drawing closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where he maps his "beautiful, terrifying mistake" and accepts the fracture with conceptual cost (loss of his rational worldview). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth's "impossible" physicality forces the "clean break" his wife predicted. Cost is legible in "forgiving himself...would be the work of a lifetime" and the irreparable cleft in certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret garden setting is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (wilting moon-petal roses, rowan wood box, hedge maze walls). The trowel and digging action provide tactile micro-setting that leads to discovery. The box's location beneath the roses subtly mirrors Elara's world hidden under his rational surface. However, the garden itself does not meaningfully constrain Elias's choice at closure—the tooth could have been discovered elsewhere—which keeps the score below the 9-band gate despite vivid execution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias must reconcile his dismissal of the supernatural with mounting evidence. The tooth discovery provides one decisive tightening that narrows options—he "could no longer deny the grate of this new reality." Agency is present: his choice to chart the constellation is renunciation (of old certainty) with visible cost. The escalation reads smoothly under the causal lens. No second reversal is required at this length, but the single pressure point is meaningful and protagonist-driven, with cost legible in his acceptance of a "lifetime" of self-forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bone-setting/fracture metaphor system: accepting breaks to enable healing applies to both his craft and his worldview rupture. The constellation act offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question without stating a moral—he honors the fracture by naming it among the stars. "Nostalgic innovation" crystallizes the backward-looking grief fused with forward acceptance. Minor overstatement: "cartography of his own failures" and "compound fracture of the soul" edge toward declaring theme rather than embodying it, but the final image reweights prior material with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (bone-setter's tactile focus, rational idiom under pressure). Distance control is clean with free indirect style. However, some diction drifts into elevated register not fully earned by Elias's voice: "beautiful fiction," "nostalgic innovation," "cartography of his own failures" read slightly authorial rather than character-specific. The final paragraph's rhythm supports the meditative closure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Overall voice is purposeful but not fully distinct under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening sensory anchors are strong. Information density is high in the discovery beat. However, patterned scaffold appears: "He had spoken...his voice a balm" / "he had always considered" / "His life's work had been" / "His biggest mistake...was" form repetitive stems across the opening section. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraph two restates his regret about dismissing folklore in slightly varied terms. Figurative density ("cobweb in morning mist," "compound fracture of the soul," "chasm," "cleft") clusters without full pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull momentum in the first half. Apply −0.8 for combined scaffold and density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The changeling/substitute body premise is genre-familiar, but the bone-setting metaphor as organizing logic provides a specific transformation: physical healing craft becomes epistemological stance. The constellation gesture—turning error into pattern—is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure is traditional single-scene discovery. Elias's "forgiving skeptic" angle (publicly dismissing, privately doubting) adds nuance to the rationalist-confronts-magic template. Strong within its frame but not boldly unconventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias as "forgiving skeptic" frames the opening (he explained away the villagers' fears), drives the middle choice (yearning for faith he dismissed), and shapes closure (forgiving himself will take a lifetime). Present in all three gates. His skepticism narrows to acceptance via the tooth's physical proof, and the constellation act is his decision with cost. The trait constrains his prior dismissal of Elara and enables the final mapping gesture. Causal across beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in three functional beats: discovery (trowel strike, excavation), examination (pearlescent glow, thorn-curve, ancient vitality), and closure (placed at the heart of his new constellation). Early setup via the substitute body reference primes expectation. The tooth's impossible physicality is the causal lever that forces his worldview fracture. It charges the final image by becoming the constellation's first star. Irreplaceable specificity (curved like a thorn, glowing) and strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named on-page ("deep, irreparable cleft in certainty opened within him") and embodied through the discovery sequence. The concept shapes stakes: Elias must accept the fracture between known/unknown worlds. It alters tactics by forcing him to abandon rational dismissal and engage Elara's star charts. Present in setup (his communal grief-setting ignored the "truer, stranger fracture"), middle (the tooth as physical proof), and closure (mapping the fracture as constellation). Strong thematic and tactical integration, though the exact phrase risks meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is mentioned once ("his shrewdly innocent gaze that saw the facts but hoped for kindness") but not dramatized through distinct on-page choices where both shrewdness and innocence constrain action simultaneously. The trait gestures toward his dual posture—rational yet hopeful—but does not shape a specific beat with visible cost. The yearning and forgiveness gestures relate loosely but are not clearly enabled or blocked by this exact pairing. Present in setup, weak development, no clear closure tie. Swappable with "skeptical yet compassionate."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Yearn" drives the middle emotional turn ("he had begun to yearn for her unwavering belief") and connects to the closure reconfiguration (honoring "the woman he had loved and the truth he was just beginning to understand"). The action is internal but consequential: yearning motivates his shift from dismissal to engagement with Elara's world. Present across setup (missing Elara), development (yearning for her faith), and payoff (the constellation honors her). Causal but quieter than kinetic action; could theoretically be replaced with "mourn" or "seek," lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bone-setting appears in three beats: exposition ("His life's work had been bone setting"), metaphor ("accepting the fracture to begin the healing"), and closure analogy ("Bone setting required accepting the break's reality"). The method's mechanics—feeling jagged edges, forcing alignment, the "clean, satisfying snap"—directly inform his approach to the epistemic fracture. Elara's note ("for when a clean break is needed") ties the professional method to the supernatural evidence. The method is irreplaceable: its tactile, brutal honesty defines his worldview shift. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced early (hedge maze, "heart," moon-petal roses) and serves as the discovery site. Elara's "world" is spatially embodied here, and the garden's hiddenness mirrors the truth he dismissed. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's final choice—he could draw the constellation anywhere—and no environmental feature actively shapes tactics. The garden functions primarily as symbol and discovery locus. Present in setup and middle, weak closure linkage. Two-gate participation with lyric reprise (her world/his world) allows mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the substitute body is found" anchors the opening ("It had been weeks since the bundle of twigs and river-smooth stones...had shattered their quiet world") and explains the communal grief Elias set while ignoring the fracture. The timeframe tightens his present urgency—Elara is gone, the evidence hidden, and he's alone with doubt. The weeks-long delay has compounded his regret. Present in setup, implicit pressure throughout (he's operating in aftermath/isolation), and the closure is his response to this timeframe's accumulated weight. The frame enables rather than drives, but it's causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is stated explicitly and enacted at closure: "He was charting his own beautiful, terrifying mistake, giving it a name and a place among the old, familiar lights." The motivation drives the final beat and is prepared by his regret over dismissing Elara. However, the desire is more told than dramatized in conflicted choices—he wants to transform error, and he does so without meaningful friction in the constellation scene. Present across setup (regret), development (yearning to honor her), and payoff (the mapping act). Strong closure tie but limited internal friction lowers score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is embodied throughout: Elias looks backward to Elara's world (nostalgia) while creating a new constellation pattern (innovation). The tone is coherent—elegiac yet forward-moving—and modulates appropriately (reflective in the garden, mournful at discovery, resolute at closure). The phrase itself appears on-page ("a nostalgic innovation that honored the woman he had loved"), risking label-speak, but the tonal execution supports it. The final image (old familiar lights + new star) crystallizes the tone with purpose. Consistent and closure-charging, though slightly declared rather than purely emergent.</comment>
