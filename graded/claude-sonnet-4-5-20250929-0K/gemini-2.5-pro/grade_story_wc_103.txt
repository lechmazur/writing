<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is concrete and his internal contradiction—ambition driving him into memory dissolution—operates throughout. The final erasure is earned by prior causality with visible cost: he loses all identity to sever the fragment's hold. Interiority remains specific ("sandpaper, grinding him down to dust"), though the peak choice feels slightly externalized by the maze's geometry rather than a final interior micro-decision. Embodied emotion is strong ("frantic heartbeat," "trembling leaves"), and the protagonist's flawed obsession compounds inevitably.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias severs the fragment's hold at visible cost—total memory loss—and the final image reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what) and the because/therefore chain holds: discovery → consumption → desperate geometrical gambit → disintegration → erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when he aligns the fragment with the maze's paradoxical angles, narrowing options to a single irreversible act. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The maze's hyperbolic geometry and the yew clearing function as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice: Elias uses "the maze's distorting logic" and "paradoxical geometry" to break the artifact's hold. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glossy leaves," "green scent," "thick with the ghosts"), filtered through his disintegrating perception. The living bridge and verdant arch anchor early and return at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across curved passages and the impossible center.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop memory dissolution—is signaled early and escalates causally: each step deeper unravels more memories, forcing the desperate alignment gambit. Agency is clear: Elias's choice to use the maze's geometry drives the climax and forecloses all paths with total erasure as visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he reaches the center and realizes the fragment must be broken now or he will dissolve entirely. The price is unmistakable: "no memories, no past, no name."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—the texture and cost of time—emerges from concrete action: the fragment literally grinds him down, and his answer arrives as embodied sensation ("sandpaper"). The final image offers a non-literal answer: seeking to grasp time erases the self that sought it, leaving only present immediacy. No moralizing; the clearing and "paths... waiting to be walked for the very first time" resonate without stating a thesis. The halo fragment and fading photographs constrain choice and accumulate pressure, avoiding token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct ("sepia tone... already ghosting," "wash of static"). Diction fits the cerebral, obsessive focalizer ("monastic," "texture of time," "chronology"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the climax ("The fragment did not shatter; it simply ceased to be solid") supports urgency without obscuring clarity. Minor density in figurative language ("symphony," "cacophony," "silken threads") stays within voice and does not muddle peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("fading photographs projected onto a living screen," "sandpaper, grinding him down to dust"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines restating memory dissolution without added detail, and one template stem cluster ("There was... There was..."). These do not obscure causality but prevent entry to the high 8s. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, retrocognitive dissolution, and a fragment that consumes rather than reveals time feels specific and non-obvious. The turn—that feeling time's texture erases the feeler—is earned in hindsight and avoids platitude. Risk-taking in the abstract premise (non-Euclidean maze as psychological prison) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The emotional arc would survive transplant less well than surface details suggest, anchoring originality in the maze-as-mind metaphor and the fragment's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: established in opening line. Development: his ambition to discover time's texture drives the fragment's use and the maze's design; his choices to dig, hold the fragment, and finally align it with the maze's geometry create all key turns. Payoff: the climactic alignment choice is his alone and causally decisive. Two distinct beats (discovery and alignment) and closure linkage are present. Cost is visible: total erasure. Highly irreplaceable; no other profession would yield this exact chain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at story's ~30% mark ("digging deep... shard of crystallized light"). Development: handled in two beats—initial discovery/first hold, and the climactic alignment—with distinct causal pressure each time (consumption of memories, then disintegration into chronology). Payoff: the fragment's disintegration is the story's turning point and drives the final erasure. Specificity high: its property of consuming time rather than revealing it is irreplaceable. Visible cost tied directly to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "fading photographs" appear early as the visible symptom of memory dissolution ("like fading photographs projected onto a living screen"). Development: recurs in the clearing as swirling images, shaping Elias's urgency and the decision to align the fragment. Payoff: "The images... burned bright... Then, they all vanished at once" charges the closure image and reweights prior material. Two beats, closure linkage present. Cost connected. Swappable with "dissolving memories" or similar metaphor with modest edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "retrocognitively trapped" is stated early and dramatized immediately (memory unraveling as he walks). Development: constrains every move—each step deeper pulls more threads—and enables the final gambit (only hyperbolic space can counter the trap). Payoff: the state's resolution (total erasure) is the story's closure. Causal pressure across multiple beats, cost visible. The label itself is somewhat abstract, but the constraint is embodied and irreplaceable to the plot's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: seeded obliquely in "actively unravelling" and the fragment's consuming nature. Development: the threat of disintegration escalates pressure and narrows options to the alignment attempt. Payoff: "began to disintegrate... into pure chronology" is the story's decisive turning point; removing this action would break the closure entirely. Causal across all major beats, highly specific, and visible cost. The exact verb and its result (releasing "raw, untethered moments") are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: hyperbolic geometry introduced early ("sprawling impossibility... where parallel paths diverged into infinity"). Development: shapes the maze's design and Elias's hope that warping perception could warp the fragment's power. Payoff: "focused the entirety of the maze's paradoxical geometry onto the tiny object" is the mechanism of the climactic act. Two beats (construction and use), causal pressure, closure linkage. Specificity moderate: "non-Euclidean angles" could be swapped for other exotic geometries with minor edits, but the impossible-center logic is tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "living bridge" and "verdant arch" anchor the opening line. Development: the maze and yew clearing supply the resources (hyperbolic structure, origin point) that enable the final alignment. Payoff: "the living bridge arching silently behind him" returns in the final image, recharging prior material. Two beats, closure linkage, cost connected. The bridge and garden function more as backdrop than active constraint; the maze's geometry does the work, and "garden" could be replaced with "labyrinth" with modest loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: stated in opening paragraph ("to discover the texture of time"). Development: dramatized through the fragment's discovery and his refusal to relinquish it despite memory loss; friction between desire and cost drives the alignment choice. Payoff: "he had his answer: it felt like sandpaper, grinding him down to dust" delivers the motivation's fulfillment with undeniable cost. Causal across beats, closure linkage strong, visible price. Could be swapped for "understand time" with minor edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "quaking reverie" named early and established through "cacophony of collapsing moments" and "frayed pathways of his recall." Development: tone modulates with pressure—dreamy at the bridge, urgent at the clearing, cataclysmic at disintegration, then eerily still at closure. Payoff: the final paragraph's quiet ("The air was still") contrasts and reweights prior quaking, charging the ending. Coherent across turns, closure linkage present. Specificity high; the oscillation between quaking and stillness is integral to the emotional arc.</comment>
