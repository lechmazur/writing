<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—turning questions into destinations—but his choices unfold without internal contradiction or struggle. The mechanical arm is described beautifully yet functions as aesthetic detail rather than a constraint that complicates his actions. The final "proof" via fencing reads more as a puzzle solution than a character-driven choice with visible cost; we see skill but not a hierarchy of values tested under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through coded detail (sundial, needle card, shadow) and lands a Decisive Change when the compartment opens, revealing the scroll. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure reweights the waiting into a starting point with felt cost (the wait is over, the real journey begins), though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—Kaelen's tactics shift but no path is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium, sundial, and gnomon's shadow constrain Kaelen's tactical sequence beat by beat; the brook provides ambient percussion. The mechanical arm's "faint whirring of its internal chronometers" and the Danish tin catching light are vivid, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography (circling, lunging at marked angles) is coherent and the setting charges the final image when the pedestal opens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: navigate Elara's philosophical challenge to reach the next stage of their duel. The pressure tightens as the shadow shortens and Kaelen's sequence must match the coded angles in real time. The final thrust at the seam when the shadow touches the marker is a meaningful turn driven by protagonist agency. Cost is felt (the wait consumed, the gambit accepted) but remains more intellectual than visceral—no live option is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sundial's half-painted state (predetermined vs. unmarked future) and Kaelen's act of "turning questions into destinations." The scroll as map rather than written reply reweights the overture concretely. However, the philosophical duel feels more asserted than dramatized—labels like "dueling philosopher" and "physical meditation" lean toward telling. The final image offers resonance but stops short of a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices gears, angles, light refractions, and coded correspondences in a way that feels specific to his discipline. Diction remains controlled ("whirlwind of dignified chaos," "fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel") and matches the elevated register without jarring slips. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The prose texture is consistent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the fencing sequence; most lines advance action or atmosphere. Minor overwriting: "whirlwind of dignified chaos," "fluid syllogism executed in tempered steel," and "the question of their duel now answered with a map" stack metaphor and abstraction in quick succession, risking coherence. A paraphrase micro-loop appears: "his response had to be diplomatically fierce" closely echoes the prompt attribute without embodied dramatization. No template cadence or scaffolding loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of dueling philosopher, mechanical arm, and coded sundial choreography is fresh and specific. The needle-card-as-key and the fencing-as-proof concept feel novel. However, the "half-painted sundial = fate debate" symbolism reads somewhat on-the-nose, and the philosophical duel frame leans on labels more than lived friction. Transformation test: swap names and the emotional arc changes little. No proximity echoes or template tropes, but the piece plays it safe by keeping Kaelen competent and unopposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and his final thrust at the seam is a key decision that opens the compartment. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development shows tactical execution but not a choice that alters his approach. The mechanical arm is described vividly but does not constrain a beat or force a trade-off. Swappable with a two-armed philosopher with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Danish tin needle card appears early, is used in the middle beat (casting reflections to decode the sundial), and the smallest needle dictates the final target. Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all present. Specificity is high—this exact tool matters. Cost is conceptual (the waiting and decoding labor) rather than a visible forfeiture, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is signaled early (Elara's question "etched into the very structure") and shapes the entire sequence: Kaelen must decode and perform the overture to advance. It frames stakes and tactics clearly. Middle development shows him executing the coded moves; closure reveals the scroll as the next stage. Causal role across all three gates, though the concept remains more thematic frame than a constraint with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is stated once in narration ("his response had to be diplomatically fierce") but never embodied in a choice with visible trade-off. The fencing sequence is graceful and precise, not visibly torn between diplomacy and aggression. Present as a label, missing middle development and closure linkage. Swappable with "controlled intensity" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fencing is the central action from the middle beat through closure. The lunges, parries, and final disengage are the means by which Kaelen navigates the coded angles and triggers the compartment. Setup (rapier drawn), development (the entire sequence), and payoff (blade strikes the seam) all hinge on this action. Removing it would break the story's logic. Cost is the consumed waiting and the physical/intellectual labor, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" is signaled in paragraph two, decoded via the needle card in paragraph three, and executed beat by beat in the fencing sequence. The mechanics (angles, shadow positions, the seam at the base) matter throughout and dictate the final thrust. Strong causal pressure, three-gate presence, and closure linkage. Specificity and irreplaceability are high—this exact method drives the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The glass atrium and quiet brook are anchored early and provide ambient atmosphere ("the brook the only percussion," light filtering through glass). The sundial is the tactical anchor, but the atrium itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is a container, not an active pressure. Present in setup and throughout, but ornamental in function. Lyric continuity (brook's "endless, gentle argument" → "quiet babble") reweights tone but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"While waiting" frames the entire piece; Kaelen's opening stance is defined by waiting, and the closure marks "His wait was over." The gnomon's shadow shortening as the sun climbs provides a live clock that shapes the final beat (blade strikes "at the exact instant the shadow's edge touched the final painted marker"). Setup, development (shadow approaching the line), and payoff all involve time. Cost is the consumed waiting, felt but not visceral.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations" is stated in paragraph one and echoed at closure ("her query into a physical journey"). The motivation frames the entire sequence but is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice. Kaelen executes his plan without friction between competing wants or visible cost tied to this desire. Present and coherent, but label-only; no on-page moment where this drive forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is invoked explicitly ("a whirlwind of dignified chaos contained within the atrium's serene walls") and the tone holds: graceful fencing in a quiet space, urgency within formality. The brook's "endless, gentle argument" and the "low click" at closure maintain the blend. Tone modulates slightly (rising tempo in the fencing sequence, quiet resolution at the end) and supports the final image. Coherent but somewhat static; no sharp tonal shift that reweights pressure.</comment>
