<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear and drives the plot, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—"bleak exhilaration" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Dr. Chen functions primarily as a plot device to validate Amira's theory rather than applying independent pressure. The final choice (transmitting data) lacks visible cost on the page; security arrives but no trade-off is dramatized, weakening the sense of foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Amira plans, accesses the scanner during the cooling window, discovers the pooled potential, and transmits the data before security arrives. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (data scattered, awakening begun), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt—no on-page consequence or trade-off materializes in the final beat, only a smile and declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory is established early and its elevation matters to the premise (boundary thinner). The geode is handled across multiple beats, grounding the abstract concept. Spatial choreography remains clear (scanner interface, observation deck windows). The setting constrains the window of opportunity (cooling cycle) and provides the quantum field tools, elevating it beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove and reclaim the pooled potential. The cooling-cycle window provides urgency, and the alarm creates a tightening. However, the protagonist's final act (transmitting data) faces no visible obstacle or trade-off in the closure beat—security "burst through" but Amira simply smiles, deflating the promised cost. The escalation is declared rather than dramatized at the moment it matters most.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming stolen futures emerges through the geode and quantum signatures. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final exchange ("We don't harness it, we return it"), which edges toward thesis statement. The closing image—"a geode that remembered how to hope"—aims for resonance but arrives as metaphor-first rather than concrete payoff, soft-landing the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited. Amira's perceptual filter (grief, scientific knowledge) colors the narration. Dialogue between Amira and Chen is functional and goal-driven, distinguishing their stakes ("They'll destroy this research" / "Let them"). Psychic distance holds, though peak-beat interiority leans abstract ("bleak exhilaration" asserted) rather than rendered through perception under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no obvious template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high in the quantum-science passages. Minor overwriting in the middle third: "not with light but with possibility itself" and "pools of unused potential" recur without added specificity. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("The unfiltered awakening had begun. Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers.") where a single concrete image would land harder, but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The core conceit—quantum fields recording violent death's unused potential—offers a fresh angle on grief and speculative physics. The floating observatory and geode provide specific grounding. However, the closing gesture (data scattered to servers, inevitable awakening) resolves tension through convenience rather than earned transformation, and the emotional arc (hunt to smile) lacks the friction or ambiguity that would deepen the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira is the POV throughout; her survivor status motivates the hunt, frames the scanner work, and charges the geode's significance. Her choice to transmit the data drives the ending. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The geode appears in the opening line, is pressed to the scanner (middle beat), and returns in the final image ("a geode that remembered how to hope"). Its molecular recording function is essential to the discovery. Removing it would break the story's mechanism and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named in the final third and functions as the thematic payoff, but it does not constrain earlier tactics or shape on-page choices. It remains a conceptual label rather than an active stake that narrows options during the scanner sequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is used once in the middle to describe the presence Amira hunts. The phrase colors a beat but does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost; it functions as descriptive texture rather than a driver of choices or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire plot: Amira came to the observatory for this, planned for months, accesses the scanner during the cooling window, and finds the reservoir. Major turns (discovery, data transmission) trace directly to this action. Swapping "hunt" for "search" would not alter the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is mentioned early ("perturbation readings are spiking") and Amira's study of it is established in backstory. The method shapes her approach to the scanner and the discovery of the probability clouds. It appears across setup and middle beats, though the mechanics remain abstract rather than constraining specific tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory's elevation makes "the boundary thinner," directly enabling the discovery. The circuit-breaker cooling window creates the tactical opportunity. Setting details (quantum scanner, observation deck) are used across beats and the final image references Earth's curvature below. The environment actively pressures the plan and provides the tools.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forty-minute cooling cycle is established early and the alarm signals its end, forcing the climax. The timeframe tightens Amira's window and drives urgency in the scanner sequence. Security's imminent arrival raises stakes, though the final beat does not dramatize a race against the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Amira's desire to find the pooled potential is stated early and drives her months of planning and the scanner access. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (pressing the geode, adjusting frequency) and her exchange with Chen. Friction between the scientific goal and the emotional cost could be sharper, but the want shapes choices across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named once in the middle and the tone does combine grief with discovery's charge. The ending smile and declarations lean more toward triumph than bleakness, softening the tonal coherence. The tone is present but does not consistently modulate with pressure or charge the final image with the promised darkness.</comment>
