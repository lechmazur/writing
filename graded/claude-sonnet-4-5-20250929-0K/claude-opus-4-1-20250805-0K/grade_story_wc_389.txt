<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marlowe's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory choices under pressure. The "variant allegiance" concept remains abstract label-speak ("loyalty to the possibility of transformation rather than its vessel") without on-page friction or cost. Interiority leans heavily on elevated prophetic declarations ("Day 2,555: The shadows are teaching the sunrise new colors") that feel performed rather than lived. No meaningful internal conflict or renunciation with visible cost emerges by closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear on-page closure unit with felt cost. The ending declares the Prophet's emergence and Marlowe's satisfaction ("knowing her work was nearly complete") without dramatizing a before/after change or visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive reasonably early, but the seven-year tracking timeline and "Day 2,555" remain abstract counters disconnected from present pressure. The final broadcast feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico and storm-lit observatory provide vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Marlowe's broadcast work and charges several beats. Sensory specificity is strong ("rain slash across her face," "cerulean shadows that bent impossibly"), though some details drift into ornamental register ("history's lungs," "tomorrow tastes like copper"). The portico's resonance at lightning strike opens the piece and its "dawn song" closes it, creating a purposeful frame. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preparing the way for the Prophet—is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, choice, or renunciation alters Marlowe's options; she broadcasts, listens, and succeeds without friction or visible cost. The storm provides atmospheric pressure but does not force tactical shifts or trade-offs. Agency is absent; Marlowe observes and documents rather than making decisions that foreclose paths or narrow options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from images (static/starlight, cobalt glass, fragmented frequencies) rather than stated thesis, and the concept of "variant allegiance" adds resonance. However, the ending lapses into direct thematic statement: "The old world ends not with apocalypse but with harmonics. Listen for the new song" tells rather than shows through image. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic payoff ("midwifed a new age through static and storm") instead of letting the cobalt glass dawn song carry implicit weight. The piece resists easy moralism but undercuts its own accumulative design with exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-prophetic register with strong perceptual signature ("listening to tomorrow's prophecies crackling through yesterday's ghosts"). Distance control is stable; no head-hopping. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("reality's origami creases," "frequencies of dead civilizations") that reads interchangeable rather than character-specific. Rhythm modulates purposefully with storm intensity. Purposeful compression and patterned prophetic fragments are taught early and held throughout, meeting experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern payoff, especially in peak beats: "smoke through history's lungs," "electric veils," "reality's origami creases" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence appears in the storm sequence with repeated "The X verbed" stems. Paraphrase loops emerge around "broadcasting" and "frequencies" across adjacent paragraphs. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("She pressed," "She began," "She smiled") add little. Propulsion slows in the middle third with summary rather than scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio frequencies, ancient prophecy, and cobalt glass creates a specific, non-generic frame. The lonely visionary preparing the way for an absent prophet offers a fresh angle on messianic tropes. However, the execution leans on familiar atmospheric moves (storm as catalyst, isolated observatory, fragments coalescing into revelation) without a sharp inflection at closure. The ending's declaration of success feels inevitable rather than earned through prior reversals. Transformation is present but insufficient to escape the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marlowe is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or options. She observes, documents, and broadcasts without friction, functioning as a conduit rather than an agent. The "lonely" attribute is asserted but not tested by choices under pressure. Her satisfaction at closure is told, not dramatized through a visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico opens the story (singing when lightning strikes), recurs mid-scene (Marlowe cranks it open to let rain slash her equipment), and closes it (singing its dawn song). It constrains her broadcast method and charges the final image with shifting light. However, its function remains primarily atmospheric; no choice hinges on its specific properties. Removing it would weaken tone but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is explained in exposition ("loyalty to the possibility of transformation rather than its vessel") but never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. It labels Marlowe's stance without shaping on-page tactics or altering options. The concept remains thematic rather than causal, appearing as abstract philosophy instead of lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "lyrically prophetic" trait saturates the narrative voice and audio log entries ("The shadows are teaching the sunrise new colors"), establishing a consistent perceptual filter. However, it functions as style rather than constraint; no choice or cost arises from this mode of perception. The trait is ornamental, coloring narration without enabling or foreclosing action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears as verb, image, and thematic anchor (world unfolding, reality's origami creases, future unfolding). It structures the progression from fragments to emergence. However, no major turn traces directly to an act of unfolding with causal weight; the concept remains metaphorical rather than plot-driving. Swappable with "reveal" or "emerge" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are introduced immediately, recur in every beat (AM bleeding into shortwave, pirate station, dead channel 107.3 FM, morse code sequences), and shape Marlowe's broadcast method throughout. The mechanics matter: her salvaged array, modified ham console, and response patterns (truckers, ships, children) all trace to this method. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism. However, no choice hinges on overcoming a limitation of this method; it succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds grounds every beat, providing access (portico, telescope mount, radio array), weather pressure (lightning triggers glass resonance, rain threatens equipment), and isolation that justifies Marlowe's seven-year vigil. The setting enables her broadcast work and charges the dawn closure image. However, no tactical choice arises from a constraint or resource the setting imposes; it supports rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The seven-year tracking span and "Day 2,555" establish duration, and the overnight storm sequence provides immediacy. However, time remains abstract; no tightening clock alters Marlowe's tactics or creates urgency. The "rise of a prophet" timeframe is backdrop rather than driver. The Prophet's emergence happens off-page without visible cost or trade-off tied to timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early and recurs (gathering ghost frequencies, electromagnetic echoes of extinct stars, ancient shadows as tools). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Marlowe succeeds without friction between wants and obstacles. The motivation labels her project but does not constrain or test her on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Tone mixes lyric prophecy with technical detail (salvaged radio array, ham console, Fibonacci morse code) but "gritty" remains absent—no dirt, failure, blood, or bodily cost appears. "Whimsy" flickers in odd juxtapositions (truckers and throat singing, hurricanes named after gods) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the ending. The tone is atmospheric-mystical rather than the requested gritty-whimsical synthesis.</comment>
