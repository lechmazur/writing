<comment>Mei's interiority is consistently rendered through craft metaphors ("grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love"), and her emotional progression from raw grief to transformed acceptance is causally linked through her work. However, the micro-choices feel predetermined by the therapeutic framework rather than genuinely conflicted—she never resists the process or experiences setbacks that would reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to incorporating dream-gems into lanterns arrives without visible struggle or foreclosed alternative, reducing the felt cost of her transformation. Supporting characters (Master Shen, other parents) apply thematic pressure but remain functionally generic.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors (workshop, tea garden, three months post-loss) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mei's grief transforms from paralyzing loss into generative memorial practice, with the final lantern-making representing Earned Stasis—she accepts Lin's absence while preserving love's luminous form. The accumulative lens (grief work → crystallization → integration → public offering) holds consistently through closure. However, the escalation is largely internal and processual; no external pressure tests Mei's commitment, and the discovery of "possibility" in the gem feels convenient rather than causally earned from prior polishing technique. The closure lands with thematic resonance but minimal visible cost—we don't see what Mei sacrifices or what competing path she forecloses.</comment>

<comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and dream-gem workshop create a coherent fantasy setting with purposeful verticality ("ascending descent") that mirrors the thematic movement. Sensory detail is selective and craft-focused: "colored glass that threw rainbows," "crystal notes carrying across the isle," "bridges of woven moonlight." The setting constrains choice minimally—Mei could perform this grief work anywhere—but the basilica's lantern-hanging function charges the final image by providing a public venue that transforms private memorial into communal guide. Spatial choreography between garden, basilica, and workshop remains clear throughout.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into sustainable memorial—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mei discovers "possibility" (Lin's unlived futures) in the gems, shifting from pure preservation to acceptance of loss. However, this deepening arrives through epiphany rather than pressure; no external force tests Mei's commitment, and the craft work proceeds without meaningful setback or complication. The final lantern-making represents agency (creating public memorial rather than private shrine), but the choice feels overdetermined by the therapeutic arc rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost. The accumulative lens supports gentle intensification, but the lack of reversal or genuine resistance flattens the pressure curve.</comment>

<comment>The theme—grief transformed through craft, love persisting as light beyond loss—emerges organically from Mei's lantern-making without overt statement until the final paragraph's "ascending descent toward peace" (which borders on explicating the controlling metaphor). The dream-gem/lantern synthesis elegantly unites preservation and release, and the shift from "one thousand brings a wish" to "one thousand cranes of grief" reweights the origami motif with earned complexity. The "luminous torment" oxymoron threads through without mechanical repetition. However, the final paragraph's thematic summary ("even the craftiest hands cannot rebuild what is lost, only transform it") explicates rather than trusts the image, and Master Shen's observations occasionally function as theme delivery rather than dramatic pressure.</comment>

<comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, filtering setting and craft through Mei's lantern-maker perception ("bending glass and wire into impossible shapes," "capturing light, holding it in forms"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous torment," "constellation of sorrow") that reads more authorial than character-specific, particularly during emotional peaks where Mei's interior voice should be most embodied. Master Shen's dialogue carries subtext but feels interchangeable with generic mentor-speak. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately between craft-focus and emotional reflection, and the perceptual signature (light, glass, folding, capturing) remains consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high, with many lines serving dual purposes (advancing both craft process and emotional arc). However, several passages exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She captured Lin's first steps... She preserved the sound of Lin singing" mechanically parallels structure, and "perfect and untouchable" / "untouchable" within two sentences is redundant. The metaphor system occasionally strains coherence—"shadow-plague" that "detaches" operates differently from "grief itself" being folded like paper, and "ascending descent" is repeated rather than developed. The final paragraph over-explains the transformation with abstract summary ("transform grief not by destroying it, but by giving it new shape") where the lantern image should carry the work. Minor register drift into therapeutic language ("acceptance," "transformation") in peak beats. Overall propulsion is good, but line-level polish shows seams.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis of lantern-making craft with ritualized grief work offers a specific angle, and the floating-island fantasy setting provides fresh sensory texture. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: bereaved parent → therapeutic craft practice → acceptance → public memorial. The "dream recording" concept and shadow-plague inciting incident generate surface novelty but don't fundamentally transform the grief-processing structure—remove those fantasy elements and substitute bereavement counseling or pottery therapy, and the emotional beats remain identical. The "possibility" epiphany (seeing unlived futures brings peace rather than deeper pain) inverts expectation briefly but resolves to conventional acceptance. Master Shen and the tea garden setting are competently executed genre furniture without distinctive voice or world logic that would make this sanctuary irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mei's craftiness appears in setup (lantern-making expertise, "impossible shapes") and middle beats (applying craft precision to gem polishing). The final lantern-shrine creation represents her decisive integration choice, though the move feels more inevitable progression than turning point. Her craft skill enables the transformation but doesn't constrain or complicate it—another parent with different expertise could achieve parallel memorial work. Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure but high swappability.</comment>

<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The basilica is visually present throughout (looming above garden, transparent walls, workshop visible inside, bells at sunset) and houses the final lantern display, providing spatial anchor and public venue for closure. However, it functions primarily as backdrop—Mei doesn't interact with its structure, and its glass/transparency properties don't meaningfully constrain or enable her choices. It returns in the ending with modest reweighting (private grief becomes public guide) but the building itself is architecturally static. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dream recording is the central mechanism: Mei captures memories in crystallized form, discovers possibilities within them, and ultimately incorporates gems into lanterns. The concept shapes tactics throughout (polishing technique, what memories to preserve, how to handle "possibility") and defines the stakes (preserving love versus being consumed by grief). The mechanics alter her approach when she finds Lin's unlived futures. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure, though the concept's rules feel somewhat convenient (why do possibilities appear? why now?).</comment>

<comment>"Descends while ascending" is explained via gem-polishing motion ("Down into the stone, up into light") and recurs thematically ("ascending even as they descended into memory," "ascending descent toward peace"). It operates more as thematic refrain than action constraint—the paradox describes emotional movement but doesn't force specific trade-offs or costs on the page. The attribute is woven through setup and closure with lyric resonance but minimal tactical pressure. Present in setup and closure; weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Transformation drives every major beat: Mei transforms raw grief into dream-gems, grief into "one thousand cranes," private memorial into public lanterns, and ultimately helps other parents transform their losses. The action is irreplaceable—substitute "preserve" or "contain" and the thematic engine breaks. The final lantern synthesis represents the culminating transformation that redefines the stakes from personal coping to communal healing. Present in all three gates with strong causal linkage and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Gem polishing appears early (setup: Mei polishing the dream-gem, learning "down into the stone, up into light"), structures middle beats ("She polished dreams... ground memories"), and produces the discovery of "possibility" that shifts her approach. The mechanics matter moderately—the physical action of polishing/grinding embodies the emotional work—but the technique could be substituted with another craft method (painting, weaving) without major structural loss. Present in all three gates with moderate causal role but middling irreplaceability.</comment>

<comment>The floating tea garden provides spatial grounding and houses the grief-work community, with evocative details (pavilions, moonlight bridges, clouds concealing below, eternal spring). It supplies resources (Master Shen's teaching, proximity to other mourning parents, the basilica for display) but doesn't pressure Mei's choices—the setting facilitates rather than complicates her transformation. Present in setup and closure; the garden's specific properties (floating, between heaven and earth) charge the final image with verticality metaphor but don't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"After the shadow detaches" frames the entire narrative—three months post-loss establishes the timeframe, and "that terrible morning" anchors the inciting incident. However, time doesn't tighten or pressure Mei's process; weeks pass without deadline urgency, and the thousand-crane completion arrives without visible clock constraint. The temporal frame is present in setup and shapes the emotional starting point (not raw immediate grief, but unprocessed loss) but doesn't escalate or force choices. Setup gate strong; development and payoff gates weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The origami-crane metaphor appears early ("One thousand brings a wish") and is explicitly reinterpreted at closure ("one thousand cranes of grief... toward acceptance"), with the final gem described as "the thousandth crane." Mei's desire to fold grief into manageable form drives her engagement with dream-recording and gem-polishing. The motivation is dramatized through craft action and the shift from Lin's belief to Mei's understanding, though the internal conflict is mild—she never resists the folding process or struggles with whether to preserve versus release. Present in setup and closure with lyric reprise; moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Luminous torment" is named in the story and embodied throughout: beauty and agony coexist in the dream-recording work ("beautiful to behold yet agonizing to create"), the lanterns cast shadows that dance "like daughters who once were," and the final image of light guiding others through shadow-touched journeys. The tone remains coherent through turns—grief never becomes purely redemptive or wholly devastating. The oxymoron charges the final image by making Mei's creation simultaneously painful and generative. Tone modulates appropriately with escalation and supports the accumulative lens without flattening into single-register mood.</comment>
