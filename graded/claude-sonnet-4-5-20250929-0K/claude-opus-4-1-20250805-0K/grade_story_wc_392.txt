<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Margot's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("unfinished business," "spiritual death," "souls") rather than embodied contradiction. The lantern-memory mechanism bypasses her direct choice-making; she passively receives visions rather than pursuing goals under friction. Jerome exists entirely in flashback with no on-page pressure. The resignation choice arrives suddenly without prior micro-choices testing her commitment, and the final paragraph's therapy-speak ("wall between observer and participant") flattens what should be visceral transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Margot's resignation and mission shift—is triggered by passive reception of memories rather than a choice she makes under narrowing options. The closure offers a Decisive Change (investigator → conductor), but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no on-page supervisor confrontation, no pension risk shown, no immediate sacrifice. The lantern's call-to-liberation mechanic is asserted but never tested; Jerome's death remains explanatory backstory, not a present dilemma Margot solves or fails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is anchored early with vivid rain/grate acoustics and historical layering (natural caves, Underground Railroad passages). Margot handles the lantern twice (lift, set down), and the brass/glass details recur, but the tunnel never constrains a tactical choice—she exits freely at will. The fourteen-month drought bookends the piece and the rain functions symbolically, yet neither weather nor tunnel layout alters Margot's decision. Sensory hierarchy (echo, brass smoothness) reflects investigator precision, elevating description above postcard level.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Margot's professional imprisonment versus liberation—is signaled but never tested on the page. No supervisor appears, no protocol forces a live trade-off, no pension or case-file consequence materializes. Jerome's struggle is recounted memory, not present opposition. The resignation is an unopposed internal decision with no visible cost: she pulls out her phone and quits, then walks away. The piece claims transformation but provides no on-page reversal where staying or leaving narrows future options or exacts immediate price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Underground Railroad/modern-bondage parallel is clear and the lantern-as-continuity motif recurs, but the theme is stated rather than earned: "systematic oppression," "soul-crushing jobs," "observer versus participant" are declared in Margot's interiority instead of enacted through scene friction. The final image ("baptized by the storm, finally free") leans on symbolic convenience—the drought breaks exactly when Margot does—without irony or cost. The piece aspires to Conceptual Repricing (preventable death redefined as spiritual imprisonment) but the repricing is announced, not discovered through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("entangled memories," "spiritual death," "fortifying her vulnerability"), but the register drifts toward abstract essay-speak in peak moments rather than Margot's investigator idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the lantern-vision mechanics are legible, but the prose converges on thematic vocabulary ("bondage," "liberation," "souls") rather than revealing Margot's particular way of noticing under stress. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") stack in the memory sequences without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several sentences do double duty (rain as drought-break and tunnel echo, lantern as signal and memory trigger). However, the middle third cycles through paraphrase loops: "The lantern had been calling... Jerome had answered" is restated as "The lantern had shown him another way" and again as "the lantern's weight... felt like a promise." Stock metaphors cluster in the final paragraph ("wall between," "baptized by the storm"). Template cadence in the memory cascade ("She saw Jerome... saw him returning... saw a conductor") flattens momentum. No critical clarity breaks, but density suffers from synonym churn and scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Underground Railroad lantern guiding modern escapes from soul-crushing systems is a familiar symbolic frame executed without fresh inflection. Jerome's supervisor bondage is told rather than shown with specific power moves or micro-resistances. The fourteen-month drought timing and Margot's grandmother holding the same lantern feel convenient rather than inevitable. The transformation hinges on passive vision-receipt, not a risky choice Margot makes against cost. Premise and closure could swap in different names (social worker, heirloom compass) without structural loss, indicating insufficient specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Margot is present throughout and her investigator role frames the opening scene, but she makes only one decision—resigning—and that choice is unopposed and cost-free on the page. Her investigation yields observation (reading the scene, lifting the lantern) but no tactical problem-solving under friction. The role enables the premise but does not create key reversals; she could be a social worker or historian with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lantern appears in three beats: discovered with Jerome's body, lifted to trigger memories, set down before resignation. Its brass/glass details recur and its historical function (signal lamp) is central to the Underground Railroad parallel. However, it serves as a passive conduit for visions rather than a tool Margot uses to make a constrained choice. The final image mentions its weight and flicker but does not reweight prior material with new cost. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but its role is explanatory more than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The concept is named explicitly ("entangled memories") and drives the plot mechanism: Margot receives Jerome's and her grandmother's memories. However, the memories function as exposition delivery rather than a stake-altering force. No choice Margot makes is constrained by the memory-entanglement; she passively absorbs and then acts on complete information. The concept could be replaced with a diary or witness testimony without structural loss. Present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is mentioned once in the opening as a label describing Margot's investigator manner. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it create a visible trade-off (e.g., calm preventing her from fleeing, watchfulness exhausting her). The trait is asserted but never tested under pressure. Ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears twice: memories reverberate through the tunnel, and later the walls themselves remember. The action functions thematically (echoing the rain's echo in the opening) and charges the atmosphere, but it does not create a key turn. Margot's resignation and mission shift would occur without the reverberating-walls image. The action enriches texture and supports the closure's symbolic layer (past guiding present) but is not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is named once in the middle: "The empirical observation she'd built her career on told her Jerome had died of cardiac arrest, but these entangled memories revealed a deeper truth." The method is present but immediately superseded by the supernatural memory mechanism, which does the actual investigative work. Empirical observation does not shape Margot's tactics or choices on the page. Mentioned but not developed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is established early with rain acoustics, historical detail (natural caves, Underground Railroad passages), and spatial anchors (street grates above, maintenance passages). Margot crouches, lifts objects, and climbs back to the surface, so the space is inhabited. However, the tunnel does not constrain her choices—no blocked exits, no supervisor arrival, no tool she must find there. It provides historical resonance and atmosphere but does not alter tactics. Present across all three gates but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the drought ends" is signaled in the opening (first rain in fourteen months) and returns in the final image (drought broken above ground, something broken in Margot). The fourteen-month detail is specific, but the timing does not tighten Margot's decisions or create urgency. The rain functions symbolically (rebirth, cleansing) rather than as a live clock altering moves. Setup and closure reprise present, but no middle beat where the rain or drought-end pressures a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to break free from a controlling influence" is explicit: Jerome's supervisor bondage, Margot's protocol imprisonment, and the historical escapes from slavery. The desire is declared in interiority and drives the thematic arc. However, the controlling influence is never dramatized—no supervisor appears, no protocol forces a live choice, no trade-off scene. The motivation shapes Margot's final decision to resign but is told rather than tested with friction. Present in setup (implied by investigator role), middle (revealed via memory), and closure (resignation), but lacks on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone attempts "fortified vulnerability" through phrases like "her vulnerability" and "their courage fortifying" in the penultimate paragraph, and the opening's "watchfully calm" suggests controlled exposure. The rain/baptism image at closure and the lantern-weight metaphor support the tone. However, the prose often tilts toward declarative confidence ("she knew what she had to do") without embodying the vulnerability. The tone is named and gestured toward but does not modulate consistently under pressure or charge the final beat with contradictory feeling. Present but not fully integrated.</comment>
