<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interior life is rendered through concrete particulars—her hand on the compass, her sketching with purpose—but her emotional journey toward becoming "home for others" arrives too cleanly without contradictory impulses in scene. The temporal stretching as curse-turned-compass is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Her grandmother's voice and the family custom anchor motivation, yet the transition from isolation to lighthouse feels more declared than earned through on-page struggle. Minor: "blessed pariah" functions as a label rather than an embodied state with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Kira, observation deck, post-shutdown) land by the second paragraph. The story accumulates pressure through layered images—the vanished stars, the gilded compass, the sketched constellation—and closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kira becomes the fixed point as crewmates begin to appear, her sketching a continuous act that reweights isolation into navigation. Cost is conceptual and felt (she transforms her pariah status into a permanent beacon role), though the final image could make the foreclosed path more explicit. The lens holds; the ending reconfigures prior material without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observation deck as void-space and the gilded compass rose as tactile anchor constrain Kira's role and charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "crystalline walls reflecting nothing but the void," "light that no longer existed," "hot, then cold, then something beyond temperature." The micro-setting (her hand on the compass, the rice paper) functions as setting and shapes her final act of sketching-as-navigation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The transparent walls through which crewmates appear complete the setting's role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: navigating the station's broken chronology for the scattered crew. Pressure accumulates through Kira's realization that her temporal stretching is a compass, not a curse, and tightens when she begins sketching the station-as-constellation. The turn is internal and textural—confusion reweighted as exploration—with visible cost: she becomes the fixed point, foreclosing her own mobility. Agency is clear in her decision to sketch and press the drawing to the compass. One quibble: the crewmates' arrival in the final paragraph arrives as result rather than complication, softening the escalation curve slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (navigation through disorientation, isolation as lighthouse) emerges organically from the grandmother's lesson, the family sketching custom, and Kira's final act. "True north isn't a direction…it's the fixed point your heart returns to" is stated early but then enacted through the sketched constellation and the compass rose's light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes home for others by mapping time itself. Subtext operates in the gilded compass "remembering photons from before the shutdown" and the rice paper as last Earth artifact. Minor: "Sometimes the only way home was to become home for others" edges toward direct thematic statement but is integrated enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person close; psychic distance and tense are stable. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kira notices temporal flow, the compass's warmth, her grandmother's voice in recycled air—and the prose modulates under emotional pressure ("The blessed pariah smiled, understanding at last"). Diction is controlled and apt for a station navigator with a lyrical bent. No dialogue on the page; all pressure is interiorized and externalized through action. Filter verbs ("she heard them," "she glimpsed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or theme without padding. Minor scaffold: "After the shutdown, when the experimental drives had torn reality into ribbons, the station's thousand souls had scattered" compresses backstory efficiently, but "the echoed silence deepened as she worked" repeats the title phrase without adding new pressure. A few figurative constructions ("temporally stretched, their moments pulled thin like taffy") are vivid but cluster in exposition rather than peak beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal dilation, family navigation custom, and the compass rose as inherited artifact feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of isolation into lighthouse via sketching-as-cartography is fresh. Risk-taking is moderate: the quiet, lyric ending commits fully to its accumulative design without retreating into action beats. However, the "blessed pariah who alone can glimpse true time" and "becoming home for others" motifs have echoes in genre templates; specificity (the rice paper, Cassiopeia, the gilded compass) lifts the execution above derivative. The emotional truth—navigation as returning to a fixed point—feels earned rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira (blessed pariah) is present throughout and her choice to sketch the station-as-constellation and press it to the compass drives the ending. Setup is immediate; middle development shows her realization that temporal stretching is a compass; closure participation is clear as she continues sketching and crewmates appear. However, her decisions feel more like enactments of insight than choices under competing pressure. Cost is conceptual (she becomes the fixed point) but not deeply embodied in conflict. Two beats: realization, then sketching.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in four beats: Kira touches it and feels its warmth/pulse (opening), it is contextualized as her grandmother's gift that "remembers photons," she presses the drawing against it and it transforms ("hot, then cold, then something beyond temperature"), and it pulses steadily in the final line as "a heartbeat for a station learning to live again." Early signal, causal pressure (it enables the light that guides crewmates), closure linkage (final heartbeat image), and specificity (gilded, from an ancient Earth ship) all present. The object constrains and enables the ending with visible effect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"True north" is introduced explicitly via the grandmother's lesson ("the fixed point your heart returns to") and shapes the ending: Kira becomes the fixed point/Polaris for the scattered crew. It appears in setup (grandmother's teaching), middle (Kira reimagines the observation deck as Polaris), and closure (crewmates move "toward true north"). However, it functions more as thematic gloss than an on-page constraint that alters tactics. The concept is stated and then illustrated rather than tested under competing pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is introduced early ("everyone she touched became temporally stretched") and reappears at closure ("her crewmates, temporally stretched but no longer lost"). However, it functions primarily as label and atmospheric descriptor rather than a constraint that shapes on-page action with visible cost. Kira's ability to "glimpse the true flow of time" enables her role but is not tested or traded off in the sketch-and-press sequence. Two-gate presence (setup, closure mention) but minimal causal pressure in middle beats. Swappable with similar temporal-anomaly traits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears in the blessed-pariah framing ("she alone could still glimpse the true flow of time") and in the middle beat where Kira "glimpsed them beginning to appear." The action enables her unique ability and the ending's effect, but the major turn (sketching the constellation and pressing it to the compass) is not labeled as glimpsing—it is doing. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is label-only. The verb is more atmospheric marker than hinge action. Functional but not indispensable to the sketch-press-light sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The family custom (sketching the night sky on anniversaries) is introduced in the grandmother flashback, contextualized as three generations mapping constellations while sharing navigation stories, and enacted at closure when Kira uses the last sheet of rice paper to sketch the station-as-constellation. Setup by the second third, middle development via memory that primes her solution, and closure participation where the method becomes the map. Causal pressure: the custom provides the tool (rice paper, the practice of marking stars) that she transforms into temporal navigation. Specificity (rice paper from Earth, grandmother's precision) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is the story's sole location and anchors every beat. It is introduced immediately ("observation deck hung suspended between moments"), contextualized as the place where her grandmother's voice lingers and the compass was welded, and serves as Polaris in the final constellation-map. The setting constrains Kira's role (she remains here while others scatter) and charges the ending (transparent walls allow her to glimpse crewmates appearing). Setup, middle, and closure participation all present. However, the deck's time-dilation properties are stated more than dramatized as tactical pressure. Micro-setting (compass, rice paper, transparent walls) does more causal work than the macro-space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the timeframe in the opening paragraph and recurs throughout ("before the shutdown," "since the shutdown"). It establishes the inciting condition (reality torn into ribbons, stars vanished, crew scattered) and the present crisis (broken chronology). However, the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten tactics in real time; it is a static "after" state rather than a dynamic countdown. One-gate presence: setup as historical marker. Closure does not revisit the shutdown as a turning point. Functional context but replaceable with similar disaster framings.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is stated explicitly ("confusion could become exploration, if given the right tools") and dramatized in Kira's final act: she sketches a map to guide the lost crew. Setup is early (she hears their "confusion raw and desperate"), middle development shows her realization that temporal stretching is navigational, and closure enacts the transformation as crewmates follow her paths. Causal pressure: the desire drives the sketching and the pressed-drawing sequence. However, the motivation is not conflicted—Kira does not weigh competing desires or pay a visible personal cost for choosing to guide others. Two beats, closure linkage, but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the title and three times in the text: "echoed silence of the observation dome," "The echoed silence deepened as she worked," and "In the echoed silence of the observation deck, she continued sketching." The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—initial isolation, deepening as she works, then charged with purpose in the final paragraph. It supports the atmosphere of temporal suspension and guides the ending image (quiet determination). However, the phrase functions more as repeated descriptor than a tonal shift that reweights stakes. Lyric reprise with thematic coherence but limited causal pressure. Setup, middle recurrence, closure presence all met.</comment>
