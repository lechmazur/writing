<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silas moves through abstract interior states without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His motivation—striding through boundaries—is declared and performed but never tested by a competing impulse or cost that forces him to choose between incompatible goods. The arrival of other poets in the final third feels externally triggered rather than earned by his prior agency, and no visible forfeiture occurs on the page. Interiority relies on lyric assertion ("tremor of certainty," "aesthetically driven") rather than concrete perception that degrades or sharpens under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece seeds images (quartz hum, frozen lake, shadow-writing) and returns to them in the final paragraph. Closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—boundaries revealed as permeable—but the cost is conceptual only, announced rather than felt; no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters Silas's options. Orientation anchors who/where by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The ban-lifting premise sets up potential tension, but Silas encounters no resistance, so the tightening required under any lens never materializes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (blue light, perpetual chill, scripture-carved ice). The humming colonnade constrains Silas's movement and charges the final image when it "sang again, but now with a thousand voices." Spatial choreography remains clear, and the setting's permeability to shadow-poetry connects directly to the thematic question. However, the atrium functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint; no environmental feature forces a choice or alters his approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—striding through once-sacred boundaries—is signaled early but never pressured by resistance, cost, or a competing desire. Silas's dance proceeds unimpeded; the lake cracks "not with violence, but with... lantern-moth hush," erasing tension rather than escalating it. The arrival of fellow poets deepens the image but does not constitute a turn driven by Silas's agency. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off; the resolution feels declared rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries as permeable, transformation over destruction—emerges from the colonnade's response and the ice cracking along hidden lines. The final image of "a thousand voices" and "fluid beauty beneath the ice" offers a resonant answer to the premise. However, the piece leans on overt thematic statements ("They never understood that the poets simply paraphrased what already existed") and the final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("all boundaries are meant to be crossed"). The tremor-of-certainty concept remains abstract, never grounded in a specific micro-choice that makes the cost legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("calligraphy," "lantern-moth hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Silas notices vibration, shadow, light—but the register occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("aesthetically driven transformation," "paraphrase reality itself"). The single line of dialogue feels voice-appropriate. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the reliance on conceptual labels in peak beats ("tremor of certainty that preceded every great revision") flattens immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm and sentence variety support the lyric mode, and many lines do double work (image + character state). However, paraphrase loops appear: the final paragraph restates the transformation thesis in three overlapping formulations ("not destroying but transforming, not conquering but conversing"; "not of destruction, but of revealing"). Template cadence runs through the middle ("This was cloud-shadow poetry... It started in his chest... The frozen lake began..."). Filter-verb stacks ("felt it building," "felt") and stock metaphors ("living calligraphy," "body became ink") accumulate across high-pressure beats. The Text Artifact Screen applies: −0.8 for loops and template stems that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet premise and boundary-dissolution frame are conceptually coherent but feel derived from familiar tropes (artist-rebel, sacred-space transgression, frozen-truth-melts motif). The lantern-moth hush and quartz colonnade offer specific texture, yet the emotional arc and thematic resolution follow a predictable template: ban lifts, poet enters, boundaries dissolve without friction, collective triumph. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus transforms the premise. The piece commits fully to its lyric register but does not surprise in hindsight; swap "shadow poet" for "heretic scholar" and the structure holds intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet is present throughout and frames the conflict, but Silas's choices do not create key turns. His dance unfolds without impediment; the lake cracks in response to his motion, not because he chooses one path over another with visible cost. The arrival of other poets is externally triggered. The role is functional but does not drive causal pressure or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears in the opening, middle (hum shifts pitch, reaches crescendo, stops), and ending (sings with a thousand voices). It constrains Silas's movement through its frequency response and charges the closure image. However, its use remains largely atmospheric; no specific property of the quartz forces a tactical choice or alters his approach. The evolving hum tracks emotional beats but does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Tremor of certainty" is named twice ("that tremor of certainty that preceded every great revision") but remains abstract. It does not shape a visible on-page choice or tactical shift; instead it functions as thematic echo. The concept is present but ornamental, a label for the transformation rather than a mechanic that constrains or enables action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" appears as a descriptor ("aesthetically driven transformation," "aesthetically driven purpose") but does not constrain or enable a specific action with trade-off. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through a moment where aesthetic priority costs Silas something else he values. It reads as label-only, supporting theme but not pressuring choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" is named ("paraphrase reality itself," "paraphrased what already existed") and thematically central, but the action itself—Silas's dance—could be described as "rewrite," "translate," or "transform" without altering the plot. The major turns (lake cracking, poets arriving) trace to his motion generally, not to paraphrasing as a distinct mechanic with unique constraints. Mid-band: functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dissolving boundaries" is signaled early (each step "dissolved another boundary"), demonstrated in the middle (shadows "writing verses," ice separating), and named at closure ("dissolving the boundaries between what was and what could be"). The method shapes the imagery and frames the thematic question. However, the mechanics remain vague; no specific cost or limit to boundary-dissolution emerges to complicate his attempt. One key turn (ice cracking) connects to the method, placing it in the 5–6 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake anchor the scene throughout, provide vivid sensory detail, and charge the closure image (lake as "mirror of infinite possibilities"). The glass wall and colonnade constrain spatial movement. However, the setting does not pressure a tactical choice; Silas moves freely without environmental resistance. The setting enriches atmosphere and supports theme but does not alter his options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" is stated in the second sentence ("yesterday, everything changed") and frames the inciting premise. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Silas has unlimited time to complete his work, and no clock pressures his choices. The lifting is backdrop rather than live constraint. Functional but replaceable with "after exile ended" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is stated explicitly and drives Silas's entry and dance. The desire is on the page and motivates his movement through the atrium. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no competing want or cost tests his commitment. He strides without friction, so the dramatized tension between desire and obstacle remains low. One key beat (entering the atrium) connects to the motivation, lifting it into the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" appears twice, framing the tone of transformation ("quiet, inevitable, beautiful" and "In the lantern-moth hush of this new world"). The phrase is purposeful and voice-specific, charging the closure image. However, tone remains static—uniformly reverent and lyric—without modulation under pressure. A single purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the dominant stake qualifies for the low-to-mid 5s under the Lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
