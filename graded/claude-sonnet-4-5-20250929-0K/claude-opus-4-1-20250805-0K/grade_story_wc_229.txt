<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to bring Thomas back is established, but her agency operates primarily through ritualized actions (releasing scent, climbing stairs, speaking forgiveness) rather than choices under pressure that reveal internal contradiction. The "purified intentions" arc is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Thomas's guilt-prison and her three-year vigil provide setup, but the moment of forgiveness feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final reunion lacks felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no renunciation made.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: jasmine scent spirals, intentions purify, shimmer gains substance through repeated lighthouse-beam rotations. Orientation is clean (Mara, lighthouse, dawn, post-heat-wave). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Thomas solidifying, but the cost is unclear—Mara pulls him forward "not fully human, perhaps never again" without dramatizing what she or he forfeits. The "new way of being" is asserted in summary rather than shown through a final image that reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs (shimmer to solid shadow), but the Accumulative lens requires the final cadence to charge closure with undeniable pressure; here it diffuses into abstraction ("gentle violence of refusing to let go").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and lamp room constrain Mara's movements and frame the vigil effectively. The jasmine scent functions as micro-setting, spiraling up stairs and charging the reunion beat. Sensory detail is selective (salt air, cool stone pulse, static electricity) and filtered through Mara's focus. The lighthouse beam's rotation participates in closure, catching "a solid shadow" at the turn. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Professional detail (assistant keeper) is mentioned but does not shape a choice, fitting this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bring Thomas back from the in-between. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara shifts from beckoning to absolving his guilt, which allows the shimmer to solidify. However, escalation is driven by Mara's ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under pressure—she releases the vial, climbs, speaks forgiveness in sequence without a visible trade-off or narrowing of options. Thomas's materialization feels granted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path. No credible loss (time, stamina, social cost) alters tactics on the page. The final image of "two shadows" offers poetic closure but lacks legible cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—love as a force that transcends death, purified intention versus guilt—emerges through the lighthouse vigil, jasmine scent, and Thomas's guilt-prison. The cork as vessel for "purified intentions" and the phrase "screaming tenderness" gesture toward emotional complexity. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "purified into something beyond death or life—a new way of being, born from screaming tenderness and the gentle violence of refusing to let go." This thematic echo states the thesis rather than allowing the final image to answer the central question non-literally. The townspeople's dismissal ("grief had driven her mad") is setup but not paid off in her stance at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited on Mara, is stable. Perceptual signature is present (cool stone pulse, jasmine "that shouldn't exist here," shimmer "that hurt to look at directly") and voice modulates with emotional intensity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "vibrations of intent so pure they could manifest memory into molecules," "dimensions on frequencies only the heart could hear." These phrases read more authorial than character-bound, especially for an assistant lighthouse keeper. Psychic distance tightens effectively during the lamp-room encounter. No dialogue from Thomas until the final beat, where his line ("I heard you. Every night, I heard your whispers across the void") carries appropriate otherworldly cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is generally strong. However, figurative density clusters in high-pressure beats without clear payoff: "vibrations of intent so pure they could manifest memory into molecules," "screaming tenderness, that particular ache of loving someone you cannot touch," "gentle violence of refusing to let go." Mixed metaphor in "screaming tenderness" (oxymoron serving theme) versus "gentle violence" (near-synonym churn). The phrase "beckon across dimensions" appears twice (once as infinitive, once as verb). Final paragraph over-explains closure with abstraction rather than landing on image. Minor paraphrase loop: "Come back to me" / "Come back...to be saved."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ghost-reunion and lighthouse-vigil are familiar templates; the "purified intentions manifest across dimensions" frame adds a metaphysical angle but leans on abstraction. The cork as vessel and jasmine as medium are specific touches, yet the emotional arc (three-year vigil, forgiveness speech, solidification) follows predictable beats. "Screaming tenderness" and "gentle violence" offer fresh phrasing but risk decorative oxymoron. The story commits to its premise but does not transform the reunion trope through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that makes the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural risk; the single-scene vigil is competently executed but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (assistant keeper) frames the story, tends the lighthouse, releases the vial, climbs stairs, and speaks forgiveness—all active choices. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure). Her decision to absolve Thomas's guilt enables the solidification. However, her choices feel ritualized rather than pressure-tested; no competing option is dramatically foreclosed. Present across beats and essential to closure, but agency is more ceremonial than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cork appears in the first third ("uncorked the vial," "cork rolled across her palm, warm as a living thing") and returns once in the lamp room ("held up the cork, such a simple thing") before it "fell from her hand, no longer needed" at closure. Two beats, early signal, and closure reprise satisfy the gate model. However, the cork's function is symbolic (sealing purified intention) rather than causal—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Swappable with another vessel. Lyric reprise without middle development caps at ~6.3, and the cork's passivity (falling, no longer needed) reduces causal pressure further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" appears in the opening third ("vibrations of intent so pure they could manifest memory into molecules") and is restated as "purified intentions" throughout, shaping the stakes (Mara must purify her own intentions to free Thomas). It participates in closure when "their intentions had merged, purified into something beyond death or life." Present in setup and closure, but the mechanics remain abstract—how does one purify intention on the page? No middle beat shows Mara constraining her anger or desire through a dramatized choice. The concept is thematic rather than tactical, limiting causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is tied to Mara's three-year process ("she'd learned to purify her intentions, to strip away anger and desperation until only love remained") and enables the reunion at closure. However, the purification is recounted in summary rather than shown through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. The trait labels Mara's arc but does not constrain or enable a specific action we witness. Present in setup and closure, functional for the premise, but replaceable with another catalyst (e.g., ritual completion, forgiveness alone) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Beckon" appears as Mara's sustained action ("kept vigil," "beckon across dimensions") and peaks in the lamp room: "Come back, she beckoned, not with her hand but with every atom of her being aligned toward a single purpose." This active beckoning, combined with absolving guilt, enables Thomas to solidify. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives the final turn. The specificity of beckoning "not with her hand but with every atom" and its link to the prompt motivation ("whispers travel farther than shouts") elevate integration. Essential to closure and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The jasmine scent ("scent of night-blooming jasmine that shouldn't exist here, miles from any garden") is released in the first third, spirals up the lighthouse stairs in the middle, and "exploded into a garden of sensation" at closure when Mara and Thomas touch. Present in all three gates, it functions as the medium that carries Mara's message and charges the reunion. The method shapes attempts (Mara releases and follows the scent) and participates in the final image. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—why jasmine specifically, and how does scent manifest across dimensions? Specificity and causal pressure are present but not deeply grounded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors the entire story. Setup: "cobalt lighthouse stood against the dawn sky," paint peeling, cool stone pulse. Middle: Mara climbs the spiral stairs to the lamp room. Closure: the lighthouse beam catches Thomas's solid shadow, and "the lighthouse beam swept out once more across the calming sea" as the final image. The beam's rotation participates causally (catches the shimmer, enables solidification) and the lamp room is the site of reunion. The setting constrains movement (stairs, lamp room) and the dawn light charges the final moment. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" is signaled in the opening: "The heat wave had finally broken in the night, leaving the air crisp with salt and possibility." The broken heat wave creates the favorable condition (reality no longer thin from heat-shimmer) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Mara's actions unfold at dawn without time pressure. The timeframe is present in setup and frames the story's freshness, but it does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes. Functional but replaceable with another temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is reflected in Mara's whisper in the lamp room: "her whisper carried farther than any shout could have, vibrating through dimensions on frequencies only the heart could hear." The motivation is present in setup (three-year vigil, "Please...come back to me") and closure (the whisper that brings Thomas forward). However, the motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Mara's desire faces no visible friction or cost that we see her navigate on the page. No moment where she must choose between shouting (urgency) and whispering (patience). Present and thematically consistent, but the friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears explicitly: "her voice breaking with screaming tenderness, that particular ache of loving someone you cannot touch." The tone—urgent yet gentle, anguished yet hopeful—modulates through the piece: cool dawn calm, trembling fingers, whispered plea, voice breaking at the encounter, and the "gentle violence of refusing to let go" at closure. The oxymoron charges key beats and recurs in the final image. Coherent and purposeful, though the final paragraph over-explains the tone rather than letting the image speak. Tone shapes the ending but is somewhat diluted by abstraction.</comment>
