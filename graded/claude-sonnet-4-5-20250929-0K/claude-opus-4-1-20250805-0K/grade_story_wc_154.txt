<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority shows concrete particulars—tracing script with morphine-loosened honesty, recognizing the child from the blast—and her final gift of the coral carries weight. However, the "lotus-hearted ache…not quite grief, not quite guilt" reads as label-speak rather than embodied contradiction, and the closing epiphany ("why she'd survived") arrives too cleanly without prior on-page struggle against that question. The child's shrewdly innocent gaze is named but not demonstrated through contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (hospital atrium, post-blast recovery). The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to the present cast-writing ceremony, deepening Maya's stance from isolated survivor to collaborative healer. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maya relinquishes sole ownership of survival meaning by gifting the coral and sitting in shared silence, foreclosing her prior isolation with visible cost (the relic she salvaged becomes the child's anchor). One persistent weakness: the epiphany "understood then why she'd survived" is stated rather than earned through a final image that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atrium's mist, twilight glass, and automated rain anchor the scene and modulate with emotional beats (misters activate as darkness claims the space). The coral fragment acts as micro-setting, constraining Maya's final choice—she must decide whether to keep or release this salvaged anchor—and its ridges echo her scars, tying body to object. Spatial choreography is clean (patients wander, child approaches, others gather). One slip: "mist-dampened glass" in the coral moment slightly repeats the opening mist without adding new pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Maya can transform her survivor's isolation into shared healing. The child's request initiates pressure; Maya's translations accumulate collaborative meaning on the cast, narrowing her options from solitary mourning to communal witness. The gift of the coral is a tightening choice with visible cost—she relinquishes her private relic. However, the escalation is primarily additive (more people join) rather than a causal reversal that tests Maya's commitment, and the resolution feels cooperative rather than earned through protagonist friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through shared language emerges from concrete particulars: smudged prayers, invented butterfly symbols, the collaborative cast-art. The coral's shift from personal salvage to communal gift resonates without overt statement. The closing image—"two survivors writing new alphabets of healing on the borders of their scars"—reweights prior material with non-literal grace. One weakness: "Old wounds grow new wings" and the final phrase veer close to articulated thesis rather than letting the image alone carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature is consistent—she notices script, pattern, neural pathways in coral convolutions—and the morphine justifies her "loose and honest" tongue. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the child's "My mama used to dance" lands with subtext. Free indirect style is clean throughout. One minor slip: "lotus-hearted ache…not quite grief, not quite guilt" drifts toward poetic abstraction that slightly exceeds Maya's established diction under morphine, though it remains within plausible range for a practiced translator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is controlled (coral as neural map, butterflies as transformation language). Information is layered efficiently—backstory anchors to present stimuli without stalling. Two frictions: "that lotus-hearted ache she'd carried…not quite grief, not quite guilt, but something that bloomed between them" is a mild paraphrase loop (the negations circle the same space), and "its convolutions suddenly resembling a map of neural pathways, or perhaps the branching routes of human connection" stacks two vehicles without adding pressure. Neither touches closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—translator finds new purpose through a child's cast—synthesizes familiar recovery-arc material with the specific detail of Pacific conflict zones and multilingual prayers. The coral fragment as both geological relic and metaphor for endurance feels earned rather than ornamental. However, the arc (isolated survivor → collaborative healer via atrium ceremony) follows a well-worn template, and the closing wisdom ("communication transcends language when hearts speak the same dialect") articulates the thesis rather than trusting image alone. The piece is competent and humane but does not take structural or tonal risks that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as translator frames the story and drives the key turn—she decrypts the cast, enabling collaborative meaning-making. Her final choice (gifting the coral) alters her stance from solitary keeper to communal participant. Setup clear, middle beat (translating prayers) shapes the ceremony, payoff present (she relinquishes the relic). However, her occupation could be swapped for any linguistically skilled survivor without breaking the arc; the specificity of Pacific conflict-zone work is mentioned but not causally essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coral appears in the opening (cradled in Maya's hand, ridges matching scars), returns midpoint (catches sunlight, resembles neural pathways), and is gifted in the final beat, foreclosing Maya's private claim with visible cost. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (its ancient survival models endurance); closure linkage strong (the gift enacts transformation). Irreplaceability high—removing this object would require a different anchor for Maya's shift. One friction: the neural-pathways metaphor in the midpoint beat adds texture but not choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties are named in the opening ("hanging in the humid air like unspoken prayers") and embodied in the gathered patients who contribute to the cast. The concept shapes the collaborative ceremony—multiple voices grafting meaning—and the ending's "shared dialect of loss and renewal" ties back. Setup clear, middle development present (the gathering), payoff legible. However, the anxiety remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a choice-constraint; Maya's decision to gift the coral is driven by recognition of transformation, not by active management of shared fear. The concept frames theme more than it narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed to the child's gaze in the opening but not demonstrated through contradictory on-page behavior—she asks directly, listens, and accepts. The trait is label-only; we see the cast and the request but not the shrewd calculation beneath innocence that the phrase promises. No visible tradeoff tied to this specific quality. Late setup (second paragraph), no middle beat where the trait alters outcome, cameo mention at closure when she "understood perfectly." Cap at 4.6 for missing setup in the first third; further limited by ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears twice: Maya "unknot[s] the tangled languages, decrypting each smudged note" and the story opens with her need to translate/untangle meaning. The action enables the key middle beat (collaborative interpretation) and is echoed in the final "writing new alphabets" image. Two beats; causal role (her skill permits the ceremony); closure linkage indirect but present (unknotting past scripts models future co-creation). Swappability moderate—"translate" or "decipher" would serve similarly, though "unknot" adds tactile specificity. Early signal, purposeful recurrence, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast—is signaled early (child points, Maya reads) and structures the middle ceremony beat. It enables the turn from isolation to collaboration: without the cast as shared text, the gathering and grafting wouldn't cohere. Setup in first third, middle beat (interpreting Chamorro, Tagalog, butterfly symbols), payoff when Maya adds her own line and others contribute. Mechanics matter (smudged multilingual script requires her skill). However, the method could be replaced with translating any collaborative document; the cast is the irreplaceable element, not the act of decrypting per se.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors the entire scene, and the automated misters activate at closure, veiling the group in "manufactured rain" that underscores the artificiality and care of the hospital sanctuary. Setup immediate (opening line), middle pressure (humid air holds shared anxieties, glass ceiling filters sun onto coral), payoff strong (misters as closing image). The setting constrains movement (patients wander the conservatory) and the twilight progression tightens time. Irreplaceability high—removing atrium/twilight would require a different spatial metaphor for liminal healing. Two frictions: the mist is somewhat static (present throughout without evolving) and the "greenhouse" label in the penultimate paragraph slightly repeats "conservatory" and "atrium" without new information.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe—after anesthetic kicks in—is signaled in the opening line ("morphine drip had finally quieted") and justifies Maya's "loose and honest" tongue. It frames her perceptual state (floating, hazy recognition of neural pathways) and permits the reflective mode. However, the anesthetic effect remains static; there's no tightening (wearing off, deepening) that alters her choices. Setup clear, middle relevance weak (the haze colors perception but doesn't force decisions), no payoff escalation. The frame is functional but replaceable—any post-trauma recovery window would serve.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire to graft new meaning onto old wounds is dramatized through her choice to interpret the cast, add her own bridge phrase, and ultimately gift the coral—three on-page moves. Setup indirect but legible (she cradles coral from the blast site, carries "lotus-hearted ache"), middle beat clear (collaborative meaning-making on cast), payoff strong (coral gift enacts grafting by releasing private relic into shared symbol). Friction between past isolation and present communion generates the central turn. One weakness: the penultimate paragraph states the motivation overtly ("she understood then why she'd survived…for this"), converting dramatized desire into exposition and slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: opening melancholy (morphine mist, scars), middle tenderness (child's whisper, nurses' prayers), closing poignancy (manufactured rain, shared silence). "Lotus-hearted ache" is named once and enacted through layered sorrow and blooming connection; the morphine haze softens edges without erasing cost. The final image—two survivors in misted twilight—charges the tone with quiet, earned weight. Setup strong (first paragraph), modulation across beats evident, payoff resonant. One friction: the overt phrase "not quite grief, not quite guilt, but something that bloomed between them" slightly over-articulates the ache rather than letting gesture and image alone carry it, nudging tone toward the sentimental edge without crossing.</comment>
