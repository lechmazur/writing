<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority is concrete and character-specific: her knife finds the wood's heart "with hauntingly practical precision," embodying years of watching Thomas. The motivation to carve something other than Thomas's planned lion—choosing a clock face without hands—demonstrates internal contradiction made visible through action. The transformation from believing love was temporary to recognizing it "crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence" is earned through specific discovered objects (notes in margins, wrapped paintings). Minor slip: the final reflection on "moving with" rather than "moving on" edges toward articulate self-awareness, though it's anchored in the present act of holding the carving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Margaret, loft studio, rain, workbench) within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through interwoven time scales (kettle countdown, three years since death, carving process) that converge in the final image. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the roughed-out clock face "that would never tell time, only hold it" crystallizes the stake (how to contain love after loss) with felt cost (she will teach workshops, sharing what she's learned, transforming private grief into public practice). One meaningful deepening occurs as the kettle's countdown intersects with her understanding that "presence persists in the spaces it once filled."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges both atmosphere and the final image: "casting shifting shadows across her hands" early, then "late sun broke through, painting everything in rust-hued peace" at closure. The ash wood's "sharp, clean scent" mixing with kettle steam creates sensory layering. The loft as shared workspace—"her botanical illustrations spread across one wall, his carvings crowding the shelves"—establishes spatial hierarchy that mirrors emotional stakes. The kettle on the hotplate serves as both timekeeper and tactile anchor, its whistle marking the carving's completion. Environment directly constrains the opening action: "perhaps four minutes before it whistled—enough time to make the first cuts."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: how to process Thomas's death and unfinished projects after three years. One meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle countdown intersects with Margaret's accelerating carving: "The kettle's whistle began as a whisper. Margaret carved faster now, not rushed but purposeful." The piece operates under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through deepening understanding rather than external antagonist. Agency manifests in the decision to carve "something else entirely" and the choice to begin teaching workshops, both foreclosing paths with visible cost (transforming private materials into public practice). The final act of sitting "with this roughed-out clock face that would never tell time, only hold it" reweights the opening question with cost made visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the clock face without hands, Thomas's lesson that "the tree remembers its shape," the progression from believing love was "here and gone like smoke" to recognizing it "crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence." The final image—a clock that will "never tell time, only hold it"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how presence persists after loss. Subtext operates in the contrast between "rings" (circus, wedding, the carved outer ring) that "contain a life." Minor slip: "hauntingly practical" as a descriptor edges toward authorial summary rather than pure emergence, though it's anchored in specific actions (knife finding wood's heart, silencing the kettle at peak whistle).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; distance is consistent and apt. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Margaret notices wood grain, Thomas's "sawdust in his beard," the way rain beads "like tears that wouldn't fall." Vocabulary stays within her plausible lexicon (carver/illustrator observing texture, light, scent). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during carving action, slightly wider during reflection on the three-year arc. Minor slip: some reflective passages ("Love wasn't temporary just because life was. It crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence") edge toward elevated articulation, though the thought remains anchored in concrete discoveries (notes, wrapped paintings, zoo visit).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short urgent beats during carving ("The knife steadied in her grip") alternate with longer reflective passages. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or atmosphere without padding. Sentence openings vary effectively. Two friction points: "hauntingly practical" recurs as a stock phrase in different contexts without fresh specificity; the phrase "here and gone" appears multiple times as a structural echo that borders on template. The simile "like tears that wouldn't fall" and "here and gone like smoke" function cleanly. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains imagistically clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of elements (widow carving dead husband's wood, kettle countdown, clock without hands) feels organic rather than checklist-driven. The widow-as-artist premise is familiar but transformed through specific occupational detail (botanical illustrations, carving technique, "the tree remembers its shape") and the non-obvious choice to carve a timeless clock rather than the planned lion. The three-year gap and decision to teach workshops add genuine complication. The "crystallized time" concept integrates thematically without gimmickry. Minor constraint: the emotional arc (denial → acceptance → transformation into teaching) follows a recognizable grief-processing template, though the specific carving action and workshop decision add fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret as lion tamer's widow is established in the opening paragraph and shapes the entire arc. Her identity drives the choice to open Thomas's unfinished projects box after three years, to carve something other than his planned lion (a decision that creates the story's central action), and to begin teaching workshops. The widow status appears in setup, constrains the middle choice (what to carve), and charges the ending (transforming private grief into public practice). The specific detail that Thomas "died in the ring" when "the tiger turned wrong" adds occupational specificity. Her transformation of his lesson ("the tree remembers its shape") into her own practice demonstrates causal pressure tied to this exact character background.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ash wood blank appears in the opening paragraph as Thomas's "last purchase, ordered the morning before the tiger turned wrong" and is handled across multiple beats: placing it on the workbench, making first cuts, carving the outer ring and center, adding numerals, setting it down, picking it up again at the end. Its transformation from blank to "roughed-out clock face" tracks the emotional arc. The wood's "sharp, clean scent" and grain provide tactile specificity. The final image—Margaret holding the emerging shape while planning to teach—charges the object with accumulated meaning. It's indispensable: remove the carving action and the story's closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Here and gone" appears explicitly in multiple contexts: love "here and gone like smoke," steam "here and gone, but the warmth remained." The concept shapes the central stake (how to process Thomas's absence) and the thematic resolution (presence persists through influence and transformation). However, it functions more as thematic architecture than tactical constraint—Margaret doesn't make a specific mid-scene choice because of this concept's pressure. The clock without hands embodies the concept (holding time rather than marking its passage), which strengthens integration. The concept is signaled early and returns in the closure image, meeting two gates, but its causal pressure on moment-to-moment choices remains oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" describes Margaret's knife precision in the opening and later frames her approach to each day after loss. The attribute enables the carving action (her ability to make first cuts in four minutes, to carve faster as the kettle whistles) with visible cost—the practical precision comes from "years of watching Thomas work," marking her grief-driven education. It appears in setup and constrains middle action (the efficient carving sequence). However, the phrase itself edges toward label-only territory in places; when it describes her "approach to each day," it summarizes rather than dramatizes a specific choice. The trait is meaningful but its integration is more thematic than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Contain" operates literally (the clock's outer ring, "the circles that contain a life") and thematically (how to contain love after loss, the lesson "harvested from loss"). Margaret's carving action physically contains the wood's emerging form. The kettle contains water/steam; Margaret's decision to silence it demonstrates control. The workshop plan will contain/share Thomas's lessons. The verb shapes the resolution: sitting with the clock face "that would never tell time, only hold it" directly enacts containment as answer. Remove this action and the thematic architecture weakens significantly. It appears in setup metaphorically, drives middle beats through carving action, and charges the ending image. The specificity of "contain" versus generic "hold" or "preserve" adds irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears in the central reflection: "love exists in crystallized time, perfect and complete even after its subject vanishes" and echoes in "It crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence." The method shapes the story's conceptual architecture—the clock without hands embodies it—and frames Margaret's understanding that presence persists. However, as a method it remains more metaphorical than mechanical; the story doesn't teach us how crystallization works as a process that Margaret enacts. The concept is signaled by the second third, shapes the thematic resolution, and appears in the closure unit (the timeless clock), meeting setup and payoff gates. Its integration is strong thematically but the "method" framing is looser than if it were a dramatized technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors every beat: rain drums in the opening, casts "shifting shadows across her hands" during carving, softens as "late sun broke through, painting everything in rust-hued peace" at closure. The shared workspace (her illustrations, his carvings) supplies both the emotional resource (unfinished projects box) and the physical resource (workbench, tools). The hotplate corner and kettle provide the time constraint. Steam rises "toward the rain-beaded skylight" in the penultimate paragraph, linking ground-level action to atmospheric framing. The loft will become the teaching space, transforming private into public. The setting is indispensable: remove the skylight imagery and the closure's visual charge collapses; remove the shared workspace and the emotional stakes lose specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kettle timeframe is established immediately: "perhaps four minutes before it whistled—enough time to make the first cuts." Time pressure escalates: "Two minutes, maybe less," then "The kettle's whistle began as a whisper. Margaret carved faster now." The constraint drives tactical choices (accelerating carving pace, selecting which details to add). Margaret silences the kettle "as the whistle reached its peak," then returns to the bench "while her tea cooled," shifting to a calmer timeframe. The live clock shapes three distinct beats and creates visible urgency. Minor constraint: the "tomorrow she would begin teaching" flash-forward briefly loosens the present frame, though it's brief and returns quickly to "today."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to harvest lessons from loss" is dramatized through specific choices: opening the box after three years, carving a clock face instead of Thomas's planned lion, deciding to teach workshops. The phrase appears explicitly ("This was the lesson she was harvesting from loss") but is anchored in concrete realizations (his influence in her transformed hands, notes in margins, wrapped paintings). Internal friction appears in the progression from believing love was temporary to recognizing it persists. The motivation drives setup (opening the box), middle action (carving with purpose), and ending (the teaching decision). Cost is visible: transforming private grief materials into public practice forecloses keeping them solely hers. The motivation could be more conflicted in the moment—her resolve reads relatively steady—but the cost and choices are clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears explicitly in the closure: "late sun broke through, painting everything in rust-hued peace." Tone builds toward this through accumulation: the amber afternoon light in the opening, the "sharp, clean scent" of wood, the rising kettle pitch, the softening rain. The tone modulates from elegiac grief (Thomas's death, three-year gap) to purposeful action (carving) to quiet resolution (sitting with tea and roughed-out carving). The rust/amber color field unifies atmospheric beats. The tone charges the final image effectively, though "rust-hued peace" as a phrase carries slight ornamental weight. The coherence across turns is strong; the tone never contradicts the accumulative pressure or tips into sentimentality.</comment>
