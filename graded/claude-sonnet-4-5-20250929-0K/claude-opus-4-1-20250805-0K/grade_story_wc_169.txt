<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("methodical observation," "logical mind," "patient determination") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother relationship exists primarily as exposition; no genuine internal conflict surfaces—Marina moves smoothly from discovery to understanding without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "smile" and acceptance feel unmotivated by prior struggle; no foreclosed path with visible cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres: the piece offers discovery-summary rather than tightening pressure. Orientation is delayed—who Marina is and why she's in the grotto remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. No on-page closure: the grandmother's dissolution into light and Marina's plan to "begin teaching others" constitute off-page intent, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The "understanding" arrives as assertion, not dramatized shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto's tide-polished spirals and phosphorescent lanterns supply vivid sensory anchors. The gauge functions as micro-setting, appearing in multiple beats and charging the final image when the needle spins to infinity. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—Marina's body and the lanterns' physical arrangement never constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure, limiting the setting's causal role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revitalizing grandmother's work—is declared but never tested with visible cost. Marina releases lanterns, watches visions, and documents formulas without opposition, reversal, or price. The "dimensional confluence" and grandmother's appearance happen to Marina rather than being earned by her agency. No tightening or deepening narrows options; the resolution (teaching others tomorrow) lies entirely off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of hope-as-equation and dimensional transcendence is stated repeatedly ("hope wasn't a destination but a perpetual ascent") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final image—grandmother dispersing into light, "woven into the mathematics of hope itself"—risks sentimentality and overt symbolism. The piece gestures toward complexity (parallel timelines, methodical observation) but resolves into tidy uplift without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice carries a distinct speculative-lyric texture ("serene upheaval," "amplitude: the measurement of possibility waves") but frequently slips into expository summary ("Marina had discovered," "She'd become a detective"). Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. POV remains stable, but psychic distance flattens under pressure rather than modulating purposefully. Dialogue is absent; no test of voice distinction applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "trial balloons," "hope equation," and "altitude gauge" recur as label-only anchors without new pressure. Template cadence appears in expository blocks ("She'd mapped," "She'd become," "She would"). Stock metaphors—"woven into the mathematics," "constellation of lights"—appear in the closure beat without fresh specificity. Figurative language ("hope's quantum signature," "possibility waves") often substitutes for concrete action. Apply −0.8 for loops and register drift touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The parallel-timelines premise and dimensional-travel motif are familiar from speculative fiction; the piece does not transform them through character-specific stakes or non-obvious choices. Emotional beats (Marina's "smile," grandmother's "approval") follow predictable arcs. The altitude-gauge-as-dimensional-compass and equations-for-hope conceit remain ornamental rather than driving genuine risk or synthesis. The "teaching others tomorrow" ending avoids any bold closure move.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina observes, documents, and releases lanterns but makes no decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Her "logical dreamer" trait is told rather than enacted; her actions (releasing lanterns, studying the gauge) feel passive and uncontested. Present in setup and ending, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gauge appears in the opening, recurs at the dimensional confluence, and returns when the needle spins to infinity at closure, reweighting its meaning from altitude to proximity to amplitude. It enables Marina's visions and frames the grandmother's message. However, Marina never handles it under pressure or uses it to constrain a choice; its function remains observational. Three-gate presence with lyric reprise, but limited causal work caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" frames Marina's lantern-release method and recurs across beats as both literal action and thematic echo. The concept shapes her tactics (Fibonacci spirals, phosphorescent ink) and connects to the grandmother's original disappearance. However, the balloons never face resistance or impose cost; their success is assured. Setup, development, and closure presence, but swappable (candles, messages) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears as a label in one phrase ("lucidly watchful through the gauge's lens") describing the grandmother in an alternate timeline. It does not constrain or enable Marina's on-page actions, nor does it create visible tradeoff. Label-only, no beat involvement, no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Revitalize" names Marina's goal and recurs in the closure paragraph ("revitalize her grandmother's work"). It anchors her motive for releasing lanterns and studying timelines. However, the action itself is told rather than dramatized—Marina's intent to "complete the journey" lies off-page. Setup and closure linkage, but no middle beat where revitalization narrows options or imposes cost. Swappable with "continue" or "honor."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marina's decoration method—paper lanterns with mathematical symbols in Fibonacci spirals—is signaled early, developed through the 49-lantern configuration, and shapes the dimensional confluence. The patterns' mechanics (interference fields, resonance) are explained and tied to her grandmother's breadcrumb strategy. However, the method succeeds without friction; no failed attempt or adaptation appears. Setup, development, closure, but no visible cost or obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The grotto's tide-polished spirals, wave-carved limestone, and tidal rhythm supply atmosphere and anchor the dimensional-thinning premise. The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image. However, the grotto never constrains Marina's choices or alters her tactics—she could release lanterns anywhere. Setup and closure presence, purposeful detail, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Parallel timelines (Alpha-3, Beta-7, "seventeen distinct timelines") provide the story's conceptual scaffold and enable Marina's visions of alternate selves. The timeframe recurs and links to the gauge's readings. However, the timelines function as backdrop rather than tightening constraint—no countdown, no cost to timeline-navigation, no choice forced by temporal pressure. Present throughout but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Marina's desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated explicitly and motivates her lantern releases, formula documentation, and study of dimensional passages. The motivation recurs and connects to the grandmother's legacy. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible sacrifice. No on-page friction between the puzzle and another need or fear appears. Setup and closure, but no development beat where the motive creates cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named early and modulates slightly (the "quiet" reorganization, the "tingle" of confluence, the "smile" at closure). Tone remains consistently calm-yet-transformative, avoiding dramatic rupture. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new weight—it sustains one register throughout. Coherent but static; no cadence break or reweighting at closure.</comment>
