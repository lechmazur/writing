<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is concrete and specific—her belief that silence has frequencies shows through action rather than declaration. The grandmother's diary motivation feels genuine, though the protagonist's emotional arc from frustration to epiphany moves too smoothly without internal contradiction or visible struggle during the peak beat. The final realization about empathy and listening arrives without prior resistance or cost that would make the shift feel earned through dramatic pressure rather than thematic inevitability. Body language and embodied emotion are present but lean toward poeticized description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through cascading silences and mechanical details until the clasp's opening creates a pattern break that reweights Mara's project. Orientation anchors clearly by the first two paragraphs (who: Mara; where: workshop; when: New Year's Eve). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara gains access to the diary and shifts her understanding of silence-cataloging from technical to empathic—with conceptual cost legible in the line "some locks open not with force but with patience." The single meaningful deepening (frequency hunt → clasp opens → grandmother's philosophy revealed) provides sufficient tightening for this length, though the final beat leans explanatory rather than letting the image alone carry the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The workshop is vivid and purposeful: tin roof, copper dials, military radios, singing bowls, and Victorian music boxes all constrain Mara's method and charge the final orchestral moment when the clasp sings. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"dense quiet of snow at midnight, the hollow pause before thunder"—reflecting Mara's professional obsession. The fireworks' whistle and pause function as micro-setting that times and pressures the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the diary on the workbench, the open door, and the cascading sensory catalog create a lived-in technical space that directly enables the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: open the grandmother's diary to recover what it has "stolen." Pressure accumulates through Mara's months of scanner-building and tightens in real time as she hunts the frequency while the city counts down to midnight. The tightening is modest—one meaningful adjustment cycle that narrows to "one final decimal point"—but it forecloses her mechanical-lock approach and forces her into the resonance method, which fits the Accumulative lens. The cost at closure is conceptual: patience over force, empathy over technical mastery. However, the protagonist's agency in the climactic beat feels automated; the scanner does the work once tuned, and Mara's final choice is more reception than decision, which limits the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as tuning into unspoken frequencies—emerges organically from Mara's technical practice and her grandmother's war-correspondent philosophy. The recurring image of silence-as-frequency shifts meaning from technical catalog to emotional bridge by the ending. Subtext operates in the grandmother's recorded meditations on ceasefire quiet and field-hospital gestures, which implicitly challenge Mara's initial mechanical approach. The final line "each one a recovered transmission from a woman who'd found peace in the pauses of war" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "The path to empathy is paved with listening to what isn't said" is quoted as the grandmother's wisdom, but it edges close to thematic statement rather than remaining implicit in image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara throughout; perceptual signature is strong—her ear for "the dense quiet of snow" and "hollow pause before thunder" colors all description. Diction stays consistent and purposeful, though phrases like "theatrical timing" and "theatrical stillness" repeat the same modifier without variation. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the frequency hunt. The grandmother's diary voice, when quoted, carries distinct idiom. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("called herself," "suspected") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly through the climactic scanner sequence, then breathes in the reflective ending without tonal whiplash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most lines advance either the technical process, Mara's interior catalog, or the grandmother's philosophy. Clarity remains strong throughout; causal sequence is legible. Stock metaphor appears once: "paved with listening" in the grandmother's diary quote, but it's attributed text rather than narrator voice, so register drift is minimal. The line "responded to neither picks nor pleas" is a light alliteration that fits voice. Figurative density is controlled; no mixed metaphors or overwriting that obscures sense. Minor redundancy: "catalogue" and "cataloging" appear multiple times across paragraphs, creating slight lexical echo but not a loop. Propulsion is steady; no scaffolding or exposition dumps stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—resonance lock requiring frequency-tuning—offers a fresh angle on inherited-secret plots, and the pacifist-as-frequency-warrior frame is specific. The synthesis of Victorian music boxes, military radios, and Tibetan bowls into one sonic toolkit feels particular to Mara's character. Emotional specificity in the grandmother's war-correspondent focus on "spaces between" gunshots avoids generic wisdom. However, the template of "protagonist opens mysterious family heirloom at a symbolically timed moment (New Year's Eve) and gains insight into their own practice" is widely used; transformation here is moderate rather than radical. The resonance-lock mechanism and the grandmother's philosophy integrate well, but the arc's emotional beats follow a recognizable structure without bold risk that would elevate originality into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is identified as an "eclectic pacifist" early, and her method—frequency scanning rather than mechanical force—reflects that identity. The trait shapes her choice at the closure beat (patience over force), which is a causal turn. However, the pacifism itself is more label than dramatized constraint; we do not see her refuse a violent or forceful option under pressure. The eclecticism is shown through her collection and method, so the trait is functional but not irreplaceable—calling her a "technical archivist" or "sonic researcher" would serve the same plot beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diary clasp is introduced in paragraph two ("brass clasp remained stubbornly sealed"), reappears in the scanner sequence ("rhythmic clicking that matched the diary clasp's delicate mechanism"), and is the hinge of the climactic beat ("The clasp sang—actually sang"). Its specific property—resonance lock—enables the plot and constrains Mara's method. The clasp's opening is causally tied to Mara's frequency adjustment and theatrically timed to the fireworks, charging the ending. Removing this exact object would break the story's central mechanism. The object participates in three distinct beats (refusal, detection, opening) and its mechanical uniqueness is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The concept "the path to empathy" is named explicitly in the grandmother's diary quote and echoed in the final paragraph's thematic summary. It shapes the ending's realization but does not constrain Mara's on-page choices during the frequency-hunting sequence. The protagonist's goal is to open the diary, not to practice empathy; the empathy theme emerges as thematic payload rather than a dramatized pressure that alters tactics. The concept is present and thematically coherent, but it functions as interpretive lens rather than on-page stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is demonstrated through Mara's catalog of silences—"dense quiet of snow at midnight, hollow pause before thunder, weighted hush of a hospital corridor"—and her ability to identify "the particular frequency of anticipation." The trait enables her method (frequency scanning) and is shown rather than merely labeled. However, it does not create a visible tradeoff or cost; her intuition is consistently correct and does not lead to a mistake or force a choice between competing interpretations. The trait is functional and supports the closure but lacks the friction that would elevate it into the high integration bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Recover" is signaled in the opening paragraph ("she needed to recover what the diary's locked clasp had stolen from her"), drives the entire middle sequence (frequency scanning to unlock the clasp), and is completed at the closure beat when the diary opens and Mara begins transcribing. The action is causally irreplaceable—swapping "recover" for "decode" or "access" would require only minor edits, but the emotional stakes of recovering something stolen (her grandmother's wisdom and her own inherited mission) are specific. The action shapes at least three beats (problem setup, scanning attempt, success) and the final image directly depicts recovery in progress ("transcribing her grandmother's words").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method "by tuning frequencies" is introduced early ("building this frequency scanner"), demonstrated in the middle beats ("adjusted the amplitude," "fine-tuned the frequency with surgeon's precision"), and completes the goal at closure ("adjusted the frequency one final decimal point"). The mechanics matter: Mara cycles through octaves, identifies a rhythmic clicking, and makes incremental adjustments. The method is not ornamental; it is the causal means by which the clasp opens. However, the scanning process feels automated once the right frequency is found—Mara's agency is tuning rather than solving a puzzle with multiple decision points—so the method is functional and well-integrated but not maximally charged with cost or risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is anchored early ("tin roof caught starlight") and sustained throughout (workshop walls, workbench, open door). The setting supplies the tools (scanner, radios, music boxes, singing bowls) that enable Mara's method and orchestrate the climactic moment when "every piece of salvaged equipment" contributes to the clasp's opening. The starlight frame returns at the ending via the fireworks' gold and green light painting the workshop. The setting constrains choice (Mara must use what she has built) and charges the final image, though the "under stars" element is more atmospheric than mechanically necessary—the scene could occur indoors at any time with minimal plot impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the final stillness before fireworks ignite" is signaled in the opening ("Tonight was New Year's Eve, and in twenty minutes the city would explode") and sustained through the middle ("thousands of people watching clocks, champagne bottles poised"). The countdown creates live urgency that tightens Mara's scanning attempts. The fireworks' launch punctuates the closure beat ("the first firework launched... the explosion painted her workshop"), making the timing causally active rather than decorative. The temporal pressure is real and shapes pacing, though Mara's success does not depend on beating the clock—the fireworks arrive as resonant coincidence rather than deadline with consequence if missed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to catalog the varieties of silence" is introduced in paragraph three ("Her workshop walls displayed her catalog") and is Mara's sustained project. It drives her months of scanner-building and her goal to identify "the particular frequency of anticipation." At closure, the motivation deepens when she realizes her grandmother was cataloging silence too, "but of a different variety—the kind that builds bridges rather than walls." The motivation is dramatized through action (scanner use, wall display) and shifts meaning by the end. However, there is minimal friction between this want and a competing cost—Mara does not sacrifice or refuse anything to pursue her cataloging—so the motivation is coherent and purposeful but not maximally pressurized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is sustained in diction throughout: "theatrical stillness before celebration," "theatrical timing," and the earnest tone of Mara's mission. The tone modulates appropriately—technical focus during the scanning sequence, reflective wonder at the clasp's opening, reverent reception of the grandmother's words. The fireworks' "distinctive pause before detonation" and the diary's pages that "fluttered in the breeze" carry theatrical staging without irony. The sincerity charges the final image ("each one a recovered transmission"). However, the tone is relatively static; there is no moment where sincerity is tested by cynicism or doubt, so it functions as coherent atmosphere rather than dynamic pressure that shifts under stress.</comment>
