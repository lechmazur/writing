<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cassia's revolutionary past anchors her motivation and shapes her reading of the Venusian ruins, but the internal contradiction between defeat and new purpose is told more than dramatized in pivotal beats. The shard-handling moment where she sees ghosts is embodied and specific, yet her emotional progression from prison poet to archaeological advocate relies heavily on reflection rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure. Huang remains functional but one-note; his nervous glove adjustment and curiosity shift serve the plot without applying genuine counter-pressure. The final turn—"we'll give them a resurrection"—arrives as declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a visible option with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear archaeological dispute stake and delivers orientation (baroque asteroid, temporal streams visible post-Revelation) within the first third. The escalation from ownership claim to civilization-resurrection proposal follows a causal arc, and the closure—Cassia committing to translate Venusian whispers into verse—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her poetic skill and revolutionary empathy converge. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt: we do not see what Cassia risks by defying Institute protocols or what immediate consequence her plan will trigger. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture (temporal imagery, mirror motifs), held cleanly to the end, but the price legibility at closure is more implied than undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful: gilded cherubs, silk-draped mirrors, visible timestreams create a sensory surround that charges the final act. The shard functions as micro-setting, catching temporal light and summoning ghosts, directly enabling the story's central revelation. Spatial choreography (table, windows, mirrors) remains clear, and the temporal storm gathering outside tracks causally with the escalation. The mirrors' symbolic role (showing possibilities during storms) is explained rather than demonstrated in action, slightly weakening the constraint test, but the environment unmistakably shapes Cassia's proof and Huang's shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—control of the Venusian collection versus reimagining a civilization—is signaled early and tightens when Cassia angles the shard to reveal ghosts, a reversal that shifts Huang from dismissal to curiosity. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff: Cassia proposes resurrection without dramatizing what she forfeits (her exile status, Institute standing, or immediate consequence). The story delivers one meaningful pressure point (the ghost-summoning) but the final commitment feels more like a manifesto than a choice that forecloses a live option with on-page cost. Agency is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—failed revolution as lens for recognizing preservation through memory—emerges organically from Cassia's arc and the Venusian shard without overt thesis statements. The final image ("some defeats were simply preparations for unimaginable victories") risks moralizing but is anchored in the shard's warmth and Cassia's shift from exile to translator. The mirrors-as-possibility motif recurs with purpose, and the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the resurrection unstarted. One friction: "sorrow remained, burnished bright" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward aesthetic abstraction rather than a lived particular, slightly diluting the thematic punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Cassia's poet-revolutionary lens, with diction like "cadence of the poems she'd written in prison" establishing voice. However, register drifts occur: "temporal Revelation," "crystalline matrices," and "reimagine, reconstructed from their own memories" read more like concept-speak than Cassia's idiom under pressure. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext; Huang's lines serve exposition ("the protocols are clear") without pursuing a competing goal. The final paragraph's syntax—"beautiful and terrible and absolutely real," "unimaginable victories"—smooths into aesthetic summary rather than maintaining the concrete texture of earlier beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening line anchors voice effectively, but several patterns recur: "She had spent twenty years…," "The shard pulsed…," "Together, she and the Venusians…" template similar syntactic stems. The penultimate paragraph stacks abstract phrases ("burnished bright," "lens through which she could finally see clearly") where concrete image would sharpen closure. Figurative language is dense—"frozen tears," "rivers of light," "liquid history"—without always doing double work; "impossible colors" and "ghosts within recognized a kindred spirit" blur into ornament. No major loops or causality breaks, but momentum sags in the final third under metaphoric overlay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—visible time, baroque asteroid, crystallized civilization memories, defeated revolutionary as translator—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The Venusian ruins as memory maps rather than art offers a fresh angle, and linking Cassia's poetic skill to decoding alien whispers integrates character with concept. However, the "failed revolutionary finds redemption through archaeology" arc and the mirrors-showing-possibilities device echo familiar genre moves without fully transforming them. Risk-taking in the temporal-storm imagery and the ghost-summoning beat elevates the piece, but the ending's turn toward verse-as-resurrection feels more asserted than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cassia's revolutionary past frames her motivation and enables her unique reading of the Venusian ruins (setup and development gates met). Her defeat-as-lens insight drives the ghost-summoning choice and the final resurrection proposal (closure participation). However, the key turn—recognizing preservation through defeat—is more reflective realization than a decision that alters tactics with visible cost; her choice to translate in verse is declared rather than shown constraining an alternative path. Strong thematic integration and causal presence across beats, but the cost legibility at closure is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shard appears in four distinct beats: initial light-catching, table placement during dispute, ghost-summoning angling, and final reverent setting before the verse translation begins. Its memory-map etchings are discovered on the page and drive the central proof. The shard's warmth at the end signals Venusian recognition, reweighting its role from artifact to active participant. Highly integrated with closure, though the final beat ("set the shard down gently") is more symbolic than a choice that depends on the shard's unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (ownership versus reimagination) is the surface conflict and shapes the initial stakes. The dispute enables the ghost-summoning demonstration and Huang's shift from protocol to curiosity (middle development). However, by the ending the dispute is resolved off-page ("The Institute will need proof") and the story pivots to Cassia's internal mission without dramatizing how the dispute constrains her resurrection plan. Present across beats but becomes more thematic frame than active pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cassia's poetic inclination is mentioned twice: "cadence of the poems she'd written in prison" and the final commitment to "speak in verse." It enables the closure choice (translating whispers into words the Institute can't ignore) but this enabling is told rather than shown constraining an alternative method. The trait does not create visible friction or cost in earlier beats; we never see her poetic lens alter a tactical choice before the ending. Functional closure linkage but minimal beat involvement and no dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the final line of dialogue ("already devising the plan that would change everything") and frames Cassia's shift from claim to mission. The action is more declaration than on-page execution; we do not see the devising constrain her next move or force a tradeoff. It participates in closure by naming her new stance but could be swapped for "imagine" or "plan" without structural loss. Present at closure with thematic resonance but lacking the specificity and causal necessity for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The covered mirrors are described early ("draped these during temporal storms") and explained thematically (they show possibilities, not faces). However, the mirrors are never uncovered, handled, or used to alter a choice; they remain narrative set-dressing. The explanation serves Cassia's metaphor about the Venusians preserving souls but does not create pressure or enable tactics. Setup gate met, but no middle development or closure participation; the method is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is introduced early and its details—gilded cherubs, mirrors, windows showing timestreams, ornate table—shape the scene's spatial logic and atmospheric pressure. The setting enables the ghost-summoning (shard catches temporal light through windows) and the temporal storm gathering charges the final image. The "mad billionaire's Versailles" premise is specific and irreplaceable, adding thematic weight (preservation, absurd grandeur) that resonates with the Venusian story. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe—three years post-Temporal Revelation—is established early and the visible timestreams function as setting detail throughout (amber ribbons, temporal storms). However, the "after time becomes visible" premise does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the story's escalation depends on the shard and dispute, not the temporal visibility itself. The storm gathering at the end adds atmosphere but does not alter Cassia's choice. Present and consistent but not a live pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desire to reimagine the Venusian civilization is announced midway ("stop treating them like artifacts") and drives the final proposal ("we'll give them a resurrection"). The motivation is dramatized through the ghost-summoning and Cassia's kinship claim ("someone who knew that the most profound revolutions happen… in the imagination"). However, the friction between this want and counterpressure is minimal; Huang offers protocol objections but no genuine obstacle that forces Cassia to trade one value for another. Strong closure linkage but limited on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone—elegiac, reflective, layered with loss—is consistent and modulates purposefully: the opening's "frozen tears" and "old revolutionary songs," the mid-scene "rough with unshed tears," the ending's "sorrow remained, burnished bright." The tone charges the final image by framing defeat as preparation. However, "burnished sorrow" as a label appears only in reflection, not embodied in sentence rhythm or perception under pressure; the prose sometimes smooths into aesthetic summary ("beautiful and terrible and absolutely real") rather than maintaining tonal specificity through concrete image. Coherent and thematically integrated but not always enacted at the line level.</comment>
