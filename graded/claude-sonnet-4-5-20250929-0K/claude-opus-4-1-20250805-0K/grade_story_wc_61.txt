<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Keeper is positioned as an observer-custodian across billions of years, but her choices on the page are purely contemplative—she measures, travels, remembers, but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "troubling serenity" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "peace with it" arrives without prior on-page struggle or renunciation that would earn the shift. Interiority remains abstract and declarative ("she would continue") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece cycles through vignettes (dying star, protostar nursery) with no because/therefore linkage narrowing options. Orientation anchors (who, translucent form; where, nebula garden; when, seven billion years tenure) arrive early. The closure attempt—"she had made peace with it"—lacks on-page cost; the final paragraph recapitulates prior exposition without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights the opening. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat registers a felt or conceptual price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden, red giant photosphere, and stellar nursery are vivid and sensory-specific ("clouds of hydrogen and helium," "crimson light pulsing"). The calculating machine gear is handled twice (measure the red giant, catch virgin starlight), giving it tactile presence. However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she moves freely, the garden remains static decoration. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to share light without using fire"—is a philosophical motive, never tested by opposition or scarcity on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the Keeper drifts from one observation to the next without a moment where options narrow or cost escalates. The final paragraph declares "peace" without prior conflict or trade-off. The piece follows an accumulative lens but supplies no meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The paradox "to share light without using fire" and the meditation on infinity through repetition emerge organically from the Keeper's actions and the gear's symbolism. The troubling serenity and solitary witness theme cohere. However, the ending articulates the thesis directly ("she would remember them all—every generation, every pattern") rather than letting a final image carry non-literal resonance. The calculating gear "turning, turning, turning" in the penultimate paragraph offers a stronger thematic beat than the summary that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance and diction remain consistent. The narrative voice carries a lyric, elegiac texture ("dew on spider silk," "the quiet sigh of falling petals") that fits the Keeper's timescale and solitude. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—any eternal observer might notice these details. Filter verbs ("she paused," "she felt") are frequent but voice-motivated. The final paragraph's summary mode ("she would continue") deflates the prior momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid without overwriting most beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The pattern would continue, approximating infinity through repetition, each cycle a verse in an endless poem" restates prior content without added pressure. The final paragraph recycles exposition ("tending," "watching them bloom and fade," "sharing the light of dying stars") in template cadence. Clarity is high, but information density drops in the closing third. No major artifacts obscure causality, so deductions remain within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cosmic gardener premise and the calculating machine gear offer fresh imagery, and the light-without-fire paradox is a strong conceptual hook. Yet the emotional arc—eternal solitude, troubling serenity, acceptance—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious inflection. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and the arc holds unchanged. The lyric voice and setting particulars lift the piece above generic, but no bold risk or synthesis heightens stakes in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "otherworldly sentimentalist" trait is present in her mourning and celebrating cycles and her singular purpose, but these feelings do not drive a key turn or decision—she observes, remembers, accepts without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup is clear; middle development is observational; closure involvement is thematic but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear appears in two distinct beats: measuring the red giant's remaining heartbeats and catching virgin starlight at the protostar nursery. Its symbolic meaning evolves from computation to meditation. However, it does not constrain a choice or solve a problem; its presence is purposeful but not causally indispensable. Setup early, middle use, closure reprise present but closure linkage is lyric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Generational patterns structure the entire narrative: birth, brilliance, decay, falling petals recur across stellar lifespans and frame the Keeper's role. The concept shapes her purpose and the story's architecture. It does not narrow options in a single beat but accumulates through repetition to charge the final reflection. Setup immediate, middle involvement pervasive, closure linkage strong as the piece ends on "every generation, every pattern."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" is thematically present—the gear's "endless mechanical iterations," the Keeper's eons of witnessing, the cycle described as "approximating infinity through repetition"—but it remains a descriptive label rather than a constraint or enabler of action. No on-page cost or tactical consequence is tied to this attribute. Setup mid-story, middle involvement as metaphor, no closure causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Transit appears three times: initiating transit to the next cluster, moving "between space's folds," and the implicit continuation in the final paragraph. It enables observation and sets up each vignette, making it structurally essential. However, the act of transit itself does not create a turn—she could walk, teleport, or remain stationary with similar results. Setup early, middle involvement as connector, closure presence implied but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sonar pinging (gravitational ripples mapping geometries) is described in one paragraph; the method reveals protostar and white dwarf locations but does not shape a choice or solve a problem the story raised. It functions as world-detail rather than plot lever. Setup mid-story, no middle constraint, no closure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden frames the entire story and provides the red giant, protostar nursery, and clouds as physical anchors for the Keeper's actions. Setting enables her purpose (tending cosmic blooms) but does not pressure a choice—she moves freely, resources are infinite. Setup immediate, middle involvement consistent, closure reprise present but the garden remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is poetic but vague; seven billion years of tenure is stated, three to four thousand years predicted for the red giant, ten billion for the newborn star, but none of these spans create urgency or constrain a decision on the page. Time functions as scale rather than pressure. Setup early as context, no middle tightening, closure invokes eternal continuation without a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated as the Keeper's singular purpose and dramatized through her harvesting photons in quantum bottles and extending herself around the protostar. The paradox (light gives without taking, fire consumes) defines her existence. However, this motive is never tested by scarcity, opposition, or internal conflict—she enacts it without friction. Setup clear, middle enactment present, no closure cost tied to want versus obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Troubling serenity is named early ("The troubling serenity of it all had begun to weigh on her") and returns at closure ("The troubling serenity remained, but she had made peace with it"). The tone—elegiac, meditative, tinged with solitary burden—is coherent throughout and modulates subtly as the Keeper moves from measurement to acceptance. However, the tonal arc is static; the piece begins serene and ends serene without a meaningful shift under pressure.</comment>
