<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's gift is established but remains largely abstract—"read the spaces between languages" and "elusively tangible sense" function as labels rather than embodied constraints that force choices. The grandmother backstory anchors motivation, but the present-tense action (scraping paint, discovering coordinates) lacks internal conflict or competing impulses; Mira moves through discovery without visible cost or hesitation. The acceptance of the knife and the decision to project stories are frictionless, reducing agency to observation rather than renunciation or endurance. Competence is high but struggle is minimal, weakening the felt price of her final commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (alchemist's market, Mira's POV, present confrontation at Valdric's stall). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the painting's layers unfold through sensory detail and pattern (pentimento shadows, color-coded coordinates, constellation map), and the closure reconfigures Mira's childhood learning into present purpose. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—stories dancing in fog—reweights the opening gift and crystallizes the mission with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One deduction: the middle beats (scraping, translating, understanding) accumulate density without a meaningful tightening or complication that narrows options; the discovery unfolds smoothly without resistance, reducing escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market (rope bridges, chimney stacks, bubbling vials) is vivid and purposeful, grounding the scene in a specific vertical cityscape. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional focus: pentimento shadows, mercury-silver preservation spells, indigo stains on hands. The palette knife functions as a micro-setting tool that enables the central discovery, constraining her method and charging the action. The lighthouse fragment's hidden location (foundation stone, painted constellation) shapes her next choice and charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering and honoring the erased seafaring peoples' histories—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the keeper's daughter was also a between-worlds translator, which reweights her mission as legacy continuance. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is limited: no complication, resistance, or cost intervenes during the paint-scraping or discovery; Mira's acceptance of the knife and her plan to project stories are frictionless. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned by a tightening choice or visible trade-off, weakening the pressure required to enter the 8.0+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of marginalized histories through translation and light—emerges organically from the pentimento layering, the refracted-light encoding, and the keeper's daughter's protective acts. The grandmother's line ("Some things are too precious for museums, child. They belong to the spaces between, where translation lives") articulates the thesis but is framed as inherited wisdom rather than authorial moralizing, and the image of stories dancing in fog offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the indigo stains (mark of sacred practice), the painted constellation (resistance cartography), and the lens fragment as both tool and symbol. One slip: "eternal instant" and "between-worlds" recur as labels without sufficient grounding in contradictory particulars, trending toward abstraction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Mira's perceptual signature: she notices pentimento, color-coded spells, and hand-signs, filtering the market through her translator's lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, slightly distant for backstory anchoring). Valdric's dialogue ("You see it," "Unfasten what time has bound") carries purpose and subtext, advancing plot without exposition. One deduction: diction in reflective beats trends elevated ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," "eternal instant") in ways that occasionally drift from embodied interiority toward thematic labeling, reducing voice specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail (pentimento shadows, mercury-silver, cobalt blue). Information density is high in the discovery beats, with each paint layer revealing new narrative content. However, template cadence and synonym churn appear in reflective passages: "elusively tangible sense," "eternal instant," "suspended market," "eternal commerce" recur as thematic markers without varied embodiment. The phrase "eternal instant" appears twice without functional pressure difference, and "between-worlds translator" is repeated across beats as a label rather than dramatized through distinct actions. These patterns reduce propulsion in non-action beats and trigger −0.6 for template cadence and stock metaphor strings, plus minor filter-verb stacking ("seemed to fade," "thought of") that dulls immediacy in one high-density paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—histories encoded in refracted light, protected through painted layers—offers a fresh synthesis of art conservation and linguistic erasure. The detail of a painted constellation that exists "only in art, never in the actual sky" is specific and non-obvious. However, the between-worlds translator archetype and the wise grandmother mentor trend familiar, and the frictionless discovery (no false leads, no resistance from paint or world) reduces risk. The alchemist's market vertical setting and the pentimento method provide fresh texture, but the emotional arc (uncover, understand, commit) follows a template path without transformation through failure or complication. Mid-band: functional synthesis with specific world-building, but the turn lacks the non-obvious calculus or earned-in-hindsight surprise required for high originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (between-worlds translator) is present throughout and her gift frames expectation early. She makes one key choice—accepting the palette knife and beginning to scrape—but the decision is frictionless and does not narrow options or impose visible cost. Her role as observer (reading pentimento, translating light-patterns) dominates; the final commitment to project stories is stated intent rather than on-page action with consequence. Two beats (accepting knife, planning fog projection) with early setup and closure linkage place her in mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment appears early (glint in the painting's topmost window) and is named as a translator tool. It reappears in Valdric's exposition and Mira's plan to project stories in fog. However, it is never handled, used, or constrained on the page; all action centers on the painting, not the fragment itself. It resolves a problem (how to make histories visible) it did not help create in the middle beats. Two touches (setup, closure mention) without causal involvement or visible cost, plus late problem-solving role, cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Anchors of intuition are invoked as the method by which Mira follows the paint removal ("following the anchors of intuition"). The phrase appears once in the middle beat, shaping her immediate tactic (where to scrape), satisfying setup and development gates. However, the concept remains label-only; no specific contradiction, cost, or constraint tied to intuition versus another method is dramatized. It does not return or shape the closure image. Functional but replaceable with "instinct" or "training," trending mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elusively tangible is used twice as a descriptor of Mira's gift ("elusively tangible sense," "anchors of intuition that had always guided her"). It functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables a specific on-page action with cost. No scene demonstrates the elusive quality creating friction, error, or trade-off. Present and thematically consistent, but ornamental; swappable with "intuitive" or "ineffable" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unfasten (via paint removal with the palette knife) drives the central discovery beat: each flake reveals coordinates, spells, and testimonies, unlocking the fragment's location. The action is setup early (Valdric offers the knife), executed in the middle (Mira scrapes), and its outcome shapes the closure (knowledge enables the fog projection plan). The verb "unfasten" also echoes in the thematic line ("permission to unfasten the past from its painted prison"), charging the final image. Three gates met with causal involvement and closure linkage, but no visible cost or complication during the unfastening itself prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Through hidden details in paintings is signaled early (pentimento shadows beneath paint) and its mechanics matter: Mira must scrape specific layers to read light-patterns, color-coded coordinates, and the painted constellation. The method constrains her tactic (palette knife, careful lifting) and enables the central discovery across multiple beats. It reappears in the closure as the source of the map she now carries. Essential across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure; irreplaceability is high since the painted layers are the unique encoding medium. Minor cap: the method itself encounters no resistance or false layer, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market (rope bridges, chimney stacks, bubbling vials, suspended above rooftops) is established early and provides vivid atmosphere. Spatial detail (market crowd flows around them, rope ladders for descent) is present. However, the setting does not pressure Mira's choices or alter tactics; the discovery could occur in any painter's stall. The vertical height and the descent at the end supply closure resonance (leaving the elevated market to retrieve the fragment below), satisfying one causal touch and closure linkage. Two gates (setup, payoff) with mild causal involvement place it mid-band, but lack of middle constraint or resource-driven choice prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe (between childhood learning hand-signs and now, twenty years later) is anchored early and brackets the discovery: Mira's childhood training becomes the key to reading the painting. The temporal span tightens the thematic resonance (she is the "someone" her grandmother said "would need them someday") and charges the closure by fulfilling the generational handoff. However, no live clock or urgency tied to the twenty-year gap alters present tactics; the timeframe is backstory context rather than a pressure mechanism. Two gates (setup via backstory, payoff via legacy fulfillment) with thematic reweighting but no tactical constraint yield mid-band score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To honor overlooked histories is stated explicitly ("honor the overlooked histories") and dramatized through Mira's choices: accepting the knife, scraping the paint, planning the fog projection. The motivation is seeded in the grandmother's teaching and tested in the present action. However, no internal conflict or friction between this desire and a competing want (safety, personal gain, doubt) appears on the page; the motivation is pursued without visible cost or renunciation. Three gates (setup, development, closure mention) with some choice involvement but minimal friction cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eternal instant appears as a thematic phrase ("the moment stretching into something infinite," "eternal instant expanded," "eternal instant of recognition") three times, framing the timeless quality of translation and discovery. The tone modulates subtly: the opening is grounded and observational, the middle beat slows into meditative reflection, and the closure crystallizes future action while retaining lyric resonance. However, the phrase itself is repetitive and label-driven rather than embodied through rhythm or syntax shifts under pressure. Coherent through turns with closure charge, but static repetition of the label and minor register drift reduce control under pressure, landing mid-band.</comment>
