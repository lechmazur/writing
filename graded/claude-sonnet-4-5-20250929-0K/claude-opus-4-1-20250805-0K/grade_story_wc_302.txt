<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains largely observational throughout; her "choices" are passive documentation rather than decisions that narrow options under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through the library in a state of wonder without conflicting impulses. The final unveiling reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost, and the claim that she "had always been both the seeker and the keeper" arrives as assertion rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (veiled dreamer, marble steps, library), satisfying the test. However, closure relies on conceptual assertion ("she had always been both") rather than a dramatized shift with felt cost. The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens through the propagation-delay motif, but the ending dissolves into abstraction—"infinite potential of the pause before speech"—without a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The second letter's arrival is convenient rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing library, mist, and amber light create vivid atmosphere. The confidence man's watch serves as a recurring object that shifts function (stealing time → revealing cipher), meeting the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the second half as "countless other libraries" appear without clear mechanics, and the library's physical constraints never force a tactical choice—she moves freely through without navigation cost or resource limitation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never truly tested. The protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles; the librarian appears to approve and guide rather than oppose. The watch's backward tick and the propagation-delay insight arrive without cost or tradeoff. The piece lacks a tightening turn where options narrow or a price must be paid; instead, revelations cascade without friction, and the second letter materializes as reward rather than consequence of her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken words and silence-as-power emerges clearly through the propagation-delay motif and the library's function. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly—"some words remain unspoken not because they cannot be said, but because their power lies in the infinite potential of the pause before speech"—rather than letting the image resonate. The watch's symbols aligning into "What remains unspoken speaks loudest in the pause" reads as thematic echo, approaching −0.4 territory but mitigated slightly by being mid-story rather than the closing beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register—"coiled," "luminous maze," "origami being undone"—that suits the dreamlike atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic fantasy-quest rather than character-particular; the veiled dreamer's way of noticing (frequencies, mathematical sequences) feels assigned by the premise rather than rooted in a distinct psychology. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "noticed") cluster in exposition-heavy beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "The cipher had fully unfolded, revealing that she had always been both" immediately followed by "she understood...that her documentation would become part of the library itself" restates revelation without advancing pressure. The phrase "cautious exuberance" appears twice as a label without embodied demonstration. Figurative density—"mist coiled," "trapped constellations," "consciousness folding through time like origami," "ink rising from deep water"—accumulates in every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff, trending toward overwriting (−0.5 within Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a library accessible between two letters, documenting dreams to unlock a cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar quest and archive tropes. The propagation-delay mechanic adds conceptual specificity. However, the emotional arc (seeker discovers she was always the keeper) follows a well-worn template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The confidence man's watch, veiled dreamer, and mist-shrouded library feel assembled from genre stock without sharp particularity that would make them irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout and her documentation action drives plot mentions, but her role is largely observational. She makes no on-page decision that narrows options or incurs visible cost—she documents, the librarian approves, insights arrive, and the second letter materializes. Lifting her veil at the end is symbolic rather than a choice with stakes. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but without causal pressure or meaningful trade-off, placing her in the functional-but-replaceable band with slight uplift for presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch appears in the opening beat (wrapped with the first letter), ticks backward to trigger the "cyclically reversed" sensation in the middle, grows warm and aligns symbols mid-story, and ticks forward again near the end. It touches four distinct beats and enables the propagation-delay insight, meeting the development gate. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff—it reveals rather than costs. Its return at closure is functional (ticking forward) but does not reweight prior material with charged specificity, capping the score below 7.0 despite multi-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is seeded early ("The cipher unfolds only for those who document their dreams"), developed through the propagation-delay observations, and referenced at closure ("The cipher had fully unfolded"). It shapes the protagonist's tactics (documenting delays) and serves as the conceptual spine. However, the cipher's mechanics remain abstract—what exactly unfolds and how it changes options on the page is never concretely dramatized. It functions as thematic frame rather than a puzzle with visible cost, placing it in the one-key-turn band with recognition for presence across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed appears once as a sensation when the watch ticks backward: "she felt the familiar sensation of being cyclically reversed, her consciousness folding through time like origami being undone and refolded." This beat reveals the watch's purpose but does not constrain an action or force a visible tradeoff. The trait is ornamental metaphor rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Single-beat presence without causal pressure or cost connection caps the score near the functional-but-replaceable floor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Documentation is seeded in the first letter's warning, enacted on-page as she writes in her leather journal and maps propagation delays, and referenced at closure when her notes will guide future dreamers. It drives the middle revelation (the librarian's approval) and supports the ending's recursive logic. However, the act of documenting never faces friction or cost—she writes freely, and the insights arrive without struggle. The action is present across all three gates and enables key turns, but lacks visible tradeoff or specificity that would make it indispensable, placing it solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Propagation delays are introduced early as "delays between when she approached [bookshelves] and when their contents became readable," developed through her mapping of the mathematical sequence, and named by the librarian as the system itself. The concept shapes her middle-beat insight and appears in the closure logic ("waiting in the propagation delays"). However, the mechanics remain abstract; how delays constrain her navigation or alter her tactics is never concretely shown. The method is thematic rather than tactical, touching all three gates but without felt cost, placing it at the one-key-turn threshold.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist anchors every beat from the opening descent through the transparent-wall revelation to the closing pulse. It provides atmosphere and serves as the story's spatial frame. However, the library never constrains a choice—she moves freely, bookshelves hum but do not block, and the librarian materializes to assist rather than test. The setting is vivid and present across all three gates but functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure, placing it in the one-key-turn band with recognition for atmospheric contribution and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is seeded in the opening ("accessible only in the span between two fateful letters—the invitation and the farewell") and bookends the closure when the second letter appears. However, the span is never tracked or used to create urgency—no clock tightens her decisions, and the letters function as symbolic markers rather than temporal constraints. The element is present at setup and closure but absent from middle development, missing the development gate and showing no causal pressure, capping the score below 5.0 despite thematic framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unspoken words is stated in the opening exposition and referenced at closure. However, this desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She seeks, she finds, she is rewarded—no friction between the search and a competing need, no moment where pursuit demands sacrifice. The motivation is present at setup and implicit at closure but lacks middle-beat friction or trade-off, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band with slight credit for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is named twice as a label ("cautious exuberance" appears verbatim in two paragraphs) but not embodied through syntax, rhythm, or contradictory impulse. The prose maintains a single register of awed observation throughout without modulation under pressure. The tone is present as assertion but does not charge the final image or shift with escalation, trending toward ornamental mention without functional integration.</comment>
