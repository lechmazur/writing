<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's root-bound nature is established through claim rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "purposeful curiosity" is asserted repeatedly but never tests competing desires or forces a visible tradeoff. The ending choice to "sign her name in starlight" arrives without prior dramatized resistance or cost—she simply accepts her role. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("anxious elation," "intersection of dreams") rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by line 1; waived. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (symbolic accumulation via maze/scars/covenant motifs). Closure unit: Conceptual Repricing—"roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing"—attempts to reweight the root-bound premise. However, the cost is not legible on the page; Mira gains everything (covenant, understanding, identity as gardener) without forfeiting a live option or facing resistance. The middle lacks a meaningful tightening; discoveries accumulate without narrowing her path or forcing a tradeoff. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence makes a felt price undeniable at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade supplies vivid imagery ("blue grass catching...like scattered sapphires") and the maze topiary materially constrains Mira's action (she kneels, presses it, follows the spreading roots). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the glade functions primarily as stage rather than constraint—Mira encounters no environmental resistance or cost. The final image charges slightly ("cobalt glade pulsed...recognizing its gardener") but the setting does not alter her tactics or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the intersection and understand the eclipsed covenant. No meaningful tightening occurs; Mira moves from clipping to maze to intersection without resistance or price. Agency at closure is acceptance without visible cost—she simply reaches for the covenant. Coincidence facilitates rather than complicates: the topiary responds instantly, the maze reveals scars on cue, the intersection "blooms around her." No on-page reversal narrows her options or changes her knowledge in a way that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of rootedness versus transcendence emerges through the maze/scars/covenant imagery. The final line "roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing" attempts a resonant synthesis but arrives as assertion rather than earned insight from concrete struggle. Subtext in "linking through scars" and "heed the pattern" is present but abstract. The piece avoids moralizing yet the ending explains its own meaning ("recognizing its gardener at last") rather than trusting the image to resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira. Perceptual signature is present in her attention to "waxy leaves," "raised edges of healed impossibilities," sensory focus consistent with a gardener. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("root-bound," "anxious elation"). However, psychic distance flattens in the climax; elevated register ("intersection of dreams," "living light") clashes slightly with the grounded opening. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression in the final third is legible but the piece sacrifices embodied reaction for conceptual abstraction at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Figurative density is high throughout ("sapphires," "electricity through water," "cat's cradle made of light") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, approaching −0.4 territory but not crossing into full muddle. Paraphrase appears: "Everyone had forgotten the covenant...That was its nature—to be hidden" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor "fruit from impossible trees" and "starlight" at closure are minor slips. Information density is uneven; middle paragraphs loop conceptually around scars/covenant without advancing pressure. No grammar or continuity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The time-folding premise and "eclipsed covenant" offer a speculative frame, but the core beats (protagonist discovers hidden truth, accepts destined role) follow template logic without transformation. Mira's root-bound trait is claimed rather than shown through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The maze/scars imagery is vivid but does not synthesize into an inevitable synthesis; swapping "maze" for another symbolic pattern would leave the arc unchanged. Risk-taking in the temporal premise does not translate to character stakes or closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and labeled "root-bound visionary." She makes one key choice at closure (reaching for the covenant), but that decision is uncontested and creates no visible cost or tactical shift. Setup by paragraph 2; closure participation weak (acceptance without friction).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maze topiary clipping is handled in three beats: Mira presses it (para 1), presses it to earth and it grows (para 5–6), and the resulting maze guides her to the intersection (para 7–8). It causally enables the middle sequence and shapes the path to closure. Setup immediate; development and payoff present. Swappability moderate; another plant-based key could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Eclipsed covenant is named in para 3, explained in para 4, and appears at closure as "document written in living light." It frames the quest but does not constrain choices—Mira's path is linear discovery. Setup early; closure participation as goal-object; middle development absent (no tactical shift or cost tied to covenant's nature).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is claimed three times (para 2, 4, 8) but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Mira's choices are acceptance, not curiosity-driven tradeoffs. Label-only trait; no dramatized friction. Setup present; development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heed" appears in future-self's command (para 4) and Mira's action "heed the pattern" (para 6), "heed the call" (closing). The act of heeding drives her kneeling and tracing scars, shaping two middle beats and framing closure. Setup, development, payoff all present. Swappability moderate; "follow" or "obey" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced para 4 and Mira traces scars in para 6–7. The method is signaled and used twice, enabling access to the intersection. However, mechanics remain abstract—no cost or resistance tied to the linking process. Setup, development, and closure participation present but swappability high and no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glade at dusk is anchored in line 1 and recurs throughout. The glade supplies the maze roots (para 6), the scars in earth (para 7), and "pulses with anxious elation" at closure (para 9). It enables the topiary growth and provides spatial coherence. Setup, development, payoff all present. Does not constrain choice but charges the final image moderately.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Future arrives early" is established para 2 and referenced para 4 ("overlap when future and present occupied the same space"). Timeframe colors the premise but does not tighten decisions—Mira has no clock pressure. Setup present; middle development and closure participation absent as temporal logic does not alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find the intersection is declared para 3 and drives her journey to the glade. At closure she reaches for the covenant. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—no on-page friction between want and cost. Setup present; development as through-line; closure participation as goal achievement. No dramatized tradeoff lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named twice (para 5, para 9) and the tone mixes wonder with urgency throughout. Tone modulates slightly (fear in para 8, smile in para 9) and charges the final image ("cobalt glade pulsed with anxious elation"). Setup, development, and payoff present. However, tone is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory reactions under pressure, limiting upper range.</comment>
