<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is given one clear trait—engineering curiosity—but her interior life remains thin. The piece tells us she recognizes "functionally creative genius" and feels "excitement," but these are asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied stress. Her decision to "resurrect" the system faces no meaningful resistance or cost; she simply works through the night without friction, fatigue, or trade-off. The final epiphany about "hope" and "human aspiration" arrives as thesis rather than earned realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (carnival debris, Maya's notebook, spaceport terminal). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the terminal as "machine for hope"—but the cost remains abstract; Maya sits satisfied, having solved the puzzle with no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The carnival frame and sextant discovery provide setup, but the middle consists of unobstructed valve-turning without a meaningful reversal or deepening that narrows options. The final image reweights the premise thematically but lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spaceport setting is vivid early: "cracked terrazzo floors," "confetti," "carnival tickets" in the dry fountain. Spatial choreography remains clear as Maya traces pipes and opens valves. The sextant piece and fountain function as micro-setting objects that frame the closure image, and the arcing water charges the ending. However, the environment does not constrain Maya's choices—rust "flakes away" conveniently, and no tool or spatial limit alters her approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the terminal's hidden hydraulic equations—is signaled early but never escalates under pressure. Maya's professor "called it impossible," yet on the page she encounters no setback, miscalculation, or tradeoff; valves open, water flows, and the system "finds its rhythm" without complication. The carnival provides atmospheric setup but exerts no force on the present action. Coincidence (the sextant piece "wedged beneath a loosened floor panel") supplies the key without prior narrative investment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—infrastructure as carrier of human aspiration—emerges clearly but is over-articulated in the final paragraphs: "proof that infrastructure could carry dreams," "hope could be engineered," "mechanics of human intention." The sextant and fountain arc return with reweighted meaning, and the terminal-as-navigational-instrument metaphor is specific. However, the piece explains its own thesis rather than trusting image and action to resonate. The carnival's "cheap wonder" versus the terminal's "permanent enchantment" reads as false contrast that telegraphs the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Maya; no head-hopping. Diction mostly fits an engineering student's lens—"flow dynamics," "junction," "valve"—but slips into elevated register at emotional peaks: "stoic wonder," "the mechanics of human intention," "the permanent enchantment of infrastructure designed to elevate the human spirit." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Maya notices pipes and calculations without idiosyncratic bias. The prose texture is serviceable but lacks rhythmic variety under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Sentence variety is adequate, though several paragraphs open with "Maya" or "She" in runs. Paraphrase loops appear: "The terminal wasn't just abandoned; it was dormant" followed by "The terminal had been built by engineers who understood..." restates setup without added pressure. Figurative language—"hydraulic brain," "maze of intentions," "infrastructure as art"—clusters heavily in the final third without pattern-teaching, veering into abstraction. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She understood," "Maya understood," "she simply watched") dull immediacy in key beats. Information density is good early but declines into thesis in the closing paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—spaceport terminal as encoded navigational instrument—offers a fresh angle, and the sextant-as-key detail is specific. However, the emotional arc (lone engineer solves abandoned puzzle, discovers hopeful meaning) follows a familiar template without transformation. The carnival frame provides texture but does not integrate causally; it could be swapped for any previous visitor discovery without altering Maya's arc. The "hope engineered into infrastructure" thesis is interesting but delivered via summary rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maya (curious civil engineer intern) is present throughout and her engineering curiosity drives her to the terminal and through the valve work. However, her choices face no resistance; she observes, decodes, and acts without meaningful decision points that alter tactics or foreclose options. She is on the page in all three beats (discovery, resurrection, reflection) but agency remains passive—following blueprints, opening valves—without a turn driven by conflicting goals or cost. Late introduction of internship status in the final image ("She closed her notebook") does not constrain prior action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The explorer's sextant piece appears in the discovery beat, provides "missing constants" mid-action, and "catches the first sunlight" in the closing image—three beats with reweighted meaning. Its specific measurements enable the valve work, and the final reprise ties it to Maya's new role as "navigator." However, it functions primarily as a static key rather than an object that Maya handles or whose changing state alters tactics. The element is essential but not irreplaceable; any "missing constant" artifact could serve the same plot function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named explicitly ("waiting for someone to understand its maze of intentions," "navigating...through mazes both physical and intentional") and frames the terminal's design metaphor. It shapes the conceptual layer but does not constrain on-page choices or alter Maya's tactics; she follows the blueprints linearly without navigating competing paths or intentions in her own decision-making. The concept functions thematically rather than as actionable pressure, appearing primarily in thesis statements in the final third.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is label-only; Maya "recognized functionally creative genius" and the terminal is called a "functionally creative masterpiece" and "functionally creative heart" in the final paragraphs. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page tradeoffs or constraints. Maya's engineering does not show creative problem-solving under limits; she simply executes the existing design. The phrase recurs but never enables or costs a specific action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" drives the central turn: Maya "redirected the flows, opening valves," and "water began to move through channels...for twenty years." The fountain erupts, the system hums, and the terminal becomes "alive again, its resurrection complete." The action is signaled early, unfolds across the middle, and defines the closure image. However, it proceeds without setback or cost; resurrection is effort without friction, and any similar verb (restore, awaken, reactivate) could substitute with minor phrasing changes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled and executed on the page: "redirecting the flows, opening valves," "Water began to move through channels," "each stream calculating trajectories." The method matters to the plot and appears in multiple beats. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see Maya choose which valve to open or why, and the method does not impose a visible constraint or tradeoff. It is present and functional but could be swapped for "reprogramming circuits" or similar technical work without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal is vividly anchored early (confetti, cracked terrazzo, dry fountain) and drives the action: Maya traces its pipes, opens its valves, and revives its fountain in the closure. The setting's dual identity—spaceport and hydraulic calculator—is specific and irreplaceable. It supplies the puzzle and the resolution. However, it does not constrain Maya's choices; she moves through it without spatial or resource limits altering her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" provides the discovery premise (the loosened floor panel, the debris) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Maya works "hours" and stays until "dawn approached," but no deadline or time pressure alters her tactics. The carnival's departure is setup only; its timing does not recur or matter to the ending. The element is functional in establishing the initial state but replaceable (e.g., "after the demolition crew surveyed") without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early ("seeking answers to equations") and recurs in the closure ("new equations for hope"). However, it remains thesis-level rather than dramatized friction. Maya never faces a choice where hope conflicts with another want or cost; she simply decodes and succeeds. The desire is told and thematic, not tested under pressure. It frames the conceptual goal but does not drive a turn or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is coherent: Maya works methodically ("traced the pipes," "opened valves") while experiencing quiet awe ("growing excitement," "watched with stoic wonder," "sat...surrounded by precisely calculated water arcs"). The tone modulates gently from task-focus to reflective satisfaction and holds through the ending. However, it remains static rather than charged by pressure; no moment of doubt or cost disrupts the mood. The tone supports the closure image but does not intensify or shift under escalation.</comment>
