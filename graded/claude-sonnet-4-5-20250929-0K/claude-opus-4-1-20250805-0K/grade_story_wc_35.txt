<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miran's interiority shows embodied emotion through the memory-tasting gift and physical trembling under pressure. The decision to subsume the fortress's memories demonstrates agency with visible cost ("becoming a vessel for the fortress's stored sorrows"). However, the opening three years of searching feels scaffolded rather than dramatized, and the trait of being "sturdy in the way of desert things—brittle on the surface, flexible at the core" reads as therapeutic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The final transformation lacks contradiction; Miran moves through the climax without meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Miran absorbing centuries of regret and transforming it—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("her body heavy with purpose, carrying inside her the digested grief of ages"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear tightening at the climax when she chooses to subsume rather than walk away. Minor causality slip: the coral pavilion is described as "waiting" and the pools as "carefully maintained eyes," but no agent or mechanism for this maintenance is established, creating a weak anthropomorphic convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is vividly rendered with specific detail: ancient depressions, geometric ridges carved by centuries, tidal pools reflecting constellations. The rain functionally constrains the narrative by awakening the coral pavilion and enabling Miran's discovery. The micro-setting of the tidal pool becomes the locus of the climactic choice, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling, touching pools, standing). The pools as setting elements directly charge the final image when they turn "clear as glass" and reflect stars "without sorrow."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to subsume the fortress's stored remorse—is signaled clearly and escalates through accumulative pressure as Miran feels the emotional contagion spreading. The binary choice ("walk away" vs. "subsume it all") arrives with visible cost: hours pass, her body becomes heavy, she carries "digested grief of ages." However, the opposition is entirely internal; there's no external constraint testing her commitment, and the resolution proceeds without complication once she commits. The price is legible but the escalation is linear rather than tightened by reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: memories as flavor profiles, coral as calcified regret, the pavilion conducting sorrow like a tuning fork. The core concept of stored remorse integrates organically with Miran's gift rather than being stated. The final image—pools reflecting stars "without sorrow" and wind "like forgiveness"—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without moralizing. The wisdom arises from specific experience (tasting empires, absorbing grief) rather than platitude, though "sandpaper these rough memories smooth" in the opening tilts slightly toward metaphor-as-thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout with character-particular perception ("salt and sorrow, the taste of a soldier's last thought"). The perceptual signature is distinct: sensory experience filtered through culinary expertise. However, register drifts into elevated philosophical diction during peak beats: "monument to stored remorse," "emotionally contagious through touch," "metabolize it into something else" feel more like prompt-response than Miran's lived idiom. The phrase "sturdy in the way of desert things—brittle on the surface, flexible at the core" is beautifully constructed but reads as authorial commentary rather than crisis-mind syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: the fortress is "unrecognizable," memories "flood," the pavilion is a "frozen scream" and "monument," all within the opening quarter. The metaphor "sandpaper these rough memories smooth, to file down their jagged edges" is mixed (sandpaper doesn't file). Template cadence appears in the climax: "She felt them all: the garrison commander... The children... The merchants..." creates a list structure that flattens propulsion. Information density is strong in sensory detail, but paraphrase loops appear: "stored remorse" and "calcified regret" restate the same concept across adjacent paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of culinary memory-reading with geological/archaeological discovery offers a fresh angle, and the coral pavilion beneath a desert fortress is vivid and specific. However, the core emotional arc—gifted person absorbs communal trauma to heal a place—follows a recognizable template without significant transformation. The choice to subsume arrives without complication or cost that surprises; once Miran decides, the transformation proceeds as expected. The "desert wind whispered... forgiveness" ending, while poetic, echoes countless redemptive conclusions in fantasy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miran's gift shapes the inciting discovery (tasting memories through the pool), enables the climactic choice (subsuming the fortress's grief), and determines the resolution (transforming regret into acceptance through cooking). Present in setup, middle choice, and closure with clear causal pressure. The gift constrains her options: she alone can perform this transformation, and it carries embodied cost ("trembling," "scouring her from inside"). Strong integration across all three gates with specificity that would break if removed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pavilion is discovered at the story's center, described as the source of the haunting, and pulses during the climax ("conducting memories like a tuning fork"). However, it remains mostly observed rather than handled; Miran interacts with the tidal pools above it, not the pavilion itself. It appears in setup (glimpsed through the pool), is present during development (described as waiting), and persists at closure (burden lifted), but its role is largely symbolic rather than tactile. Missing the mid-development constraint; functions more as backdrop than active object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the story's engine: it explains the fortress's haunting, drives Miran's three-year search, and becomes the substance she must subsume in the climax. The concept shapes her choice directly (subsume or walk away) and determines the resolution (transformation into acceptance). Present early ("monument to stored remorse"), active in the middle (feeling the garrison's and merchants' regrets), and resolved at closure (burden lifted, water clear). The concept constrains options with visible cost and is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional contagion through touch is signaled early ("dipped her scarred fingertips into the water" triggers memory flood), enables the key discovery (spreading "like fever from her fingers up her arms"), and drives the climactic action (placing "both palms flat" to subsume). The trait constrains her method—she must touch to access memories—and carries cost ("hit her like a sandstorm, scouring her from inside"). Present in setup, active in middle development, and essential to closure execution with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subsumption is the story's decisive action: it resolves the central choice, transforms the pavilion's burden, and enables the planned feast. The action cannot be swapped; walking away or other responses would yield different outcomes. Foreshadowed by the binary choice, executed on-page with physical and temporal cost (hours pass, body heavy), and its consequences (clear water, stars without sorrow) directly create closure. The action redefines all options and is causally irreplaceable in the architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tidal pool formations are present throughout: Miran kneels beside them, they mirror constellations, their spiral pattern matches her grandmother's cookbook. However, "analyzing" is not dramatized as a method; she touches and feels rather than studies structure. The formations enable discovery (glimpsing the pavilion through their surface) and provide the mechanism for memory transfer, but the analytical component promised by "analyzing" is absent. Functional presence in setup and closure but the specific method is ornamental rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is the story's fulcrum: the rain awakens the pavilion, creates the tidal pools that enable discovery, and closes Miran's three-year search. The setting is not merely backdrop—the presence of water in pooled depressions is the mechanism that makes memory-tasting possible. Present in title-beat (first rain in seven years), active throughout (pools as eyes, formations matching recipe), and charged at closure (pools reflecting stars without sorrow). The setting constrains method, enables the climax, and provides the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the close of an unspoken dream she'd carried for three years" is signaled clearly and provides emotional weight. However, it functions more as thematic coloring than constraint; the dream's closing doesn't create urgency or alter tactics on the page. Time within the scene is vague ("hours passed, or perhaps minutes") rather than pressuring. The three-year search establishes stakes but doesn't tighten decisions in the present action. Setup present, but lacks middle pressure and closure linkage beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "sandpaper rough memories smooth, to file down their jagged edges until they could no longer cut" is stated early and explains her presence at the fortress. The desire faces a meaningful complication when the rain awakens "something deeper," forcing a choice beyond simple smoothing. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through conflicting wants; once she discovers the pavilion's burden, the original goal shifts without friction. Present in setup, influences the middle choice, and reaches resolution, but lacks embodied struggle between competing desires.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sturdy-brittle tone is explicitly named ("sturdy in the way of desert things—brittle on the surface, flexible at the core") and embodied in Miran's response: trembling hands yet decisive action, appearing fragile while possessing strength. The tone modulates appropriately from quiet discovery to crisis pressure to quiet aftermath. However, the explicit statement of the tone during the climax reads as authorial rather than organic, and the final paragraphs settle into purely contemplative lyricism that loses the brittle edge. Setup present, active at peak, but closure drifts toward softness.</comment>
