<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calla's interior is vivid and specific—her sleepwalking ritual, her transformation from poet to weaver—but her agency feels abstract. The "sewing invisible threads" remains metaphorical throughout; we never see her make a concrete choice that forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. Her optimism is stated ("haunting precisely because it grew from such barren ground") rather than tested by on-page pressure, and the ending delivers affirmation without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (tide pools, petroglyphs, illustration plate), and the nautilus-spiral discovery at the three-moon mark offers a pattern break. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, closure lacks visible cost—Calla smiles, the children dance permanently, "the world was learning to breathe again"—delivering resonance through assertion rather than an on-page reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with felt price. The final paragraph summarizes future possibility instead of crystallizing present consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded labyrinth is vivid and specific: barnacles on petroglyphs, coral breathing air, salt-crusted succulents. Spatial choreography is clear (canyon walls, tide pools below, overlapping paths), and the red sandstone functions as both setting and conceptual anchor. The illustration plate and the nautilus-spiral path pattern lightly constrain her ritual, though the environment never forces a tactical choice or alters her route.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—weaving myth from ruin—is signaled early and sustained. The three-moon discovery of the nautilus pattern offers a tightening, and her nightly walks show commitment. Yet no on-page reversal tests that commitment: the illustration plate warms and its children move as hoped, the tide pools leave treasures, drowsiness returns on cue. Escalation remains conceptual; no visible cost or trade-off narrows her options before the affirmative ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—transformation over restoration, myth from ruin—emerges clearly through image and event rather than sermon. The illustration plate's fading children, the labyrinth's scars of "broken precedents," and the succulents in salt-crusted crevices build coherent subtext. The final image of children "permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide" offers resonance. However, the closing lines tip into summary and gentle moralizing ("new hope to stitch," "solace...the color of orchids"), diluting the conceptual charge with soft declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and cleanly filtered through Calla's perceptual signature: "phantom stitches," "pigments that refused to fade," "air grew thick with possibility." Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with purposeful elevation that fits the mythic frame. Minor register drift in the final paragraph ("a story that began with ending, a precedent built from broken rules") edges toward thematic caption rather than lived perception, but remains legible and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and imagistic with high sensory density. Sentence variety supports the lyric mode, and figurative language (nautilus spiral, threads that "wouldn't exist until tomorrow") is mostly coherent. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "new threads to gather, new paths to walk, new hope to stitch" stacks parallel infinitives without added pressure. A paraphrase loop between "sewing invisible threads" and "stitching new myths" recurs across beats without development. Minor scaffold in "the world was learning to breathe again" (abstract summary) dulls momentum near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The flooded desert labyrinth where tide meets canyon is a fresh synthesis, and the overlapping sleepwalking paths forming a nautilus spiral offers a specific, non-obvious image. The "wharf weaver" and tidal sanctuary combine familiar post-apocalyptic motifs with lyric specificity. However, the emotional arc—solitary artist healing a broken world through visionary craft—follows a well-worn template, and the affirmative ending ("impossibly alive," "learning to breathe again") resolves without a bold turn or conceptual friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Calla is present throughout and her nocturnal weaving ritual frames the narrative. She makes the three-moon discovery and persists in her sleepwalking practice, but her choices are iterative rather than turning: she sews, she walks, she smiles, she will walk again. No on-page decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path. The role is functional but does not drive a key reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears in three beats: salvaged at low tide, serving as guide while she sews, warming as its children move, then slipping from her fingers as they become permanent. It reappears with reweighted meaning (ephemeral → permanent) and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain her choices or impose cost; it affirms rather than complicates. Setup, development, and payoff are present but causally light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Broken precedents are woven throughout: "the first flood that shouldn't have reached this high," "prayers carved in languages that evolved faster than stone," "the old rules had drowned." The concept shapes theme and atmosphere, informing Calla's project ("a precedent built from broken rules"). It does not, however, constrain on-page choices or force tactical trade-offs. The concept operates as thematic anchor rather than active plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is stated directly ("Her optimism was haunting precisely because it grew from such barren ground") and echoed in images (succulents blooming in salt, miracle of transformation). The trait colors tone and her stance but does not force a visible on-page cost or enable a specific action under pressure. Label-only mention trends low; no moment where optimism forecloses a safer path or incurs tangible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sewing is signaled early ("needle and thread always in hand"), performed on-page ("began to sew," "pierced the air itself," "a hundred invisible stitches"), and referenced at closure ("new hope to stitch"). The action defines her ritual and drives her nightly practice. However, the sewing remains metaphorical—she does not choose between methods, face failure, or pay a cost tied to the act itself. Essential to identity and method, but not to a causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The overlapping sleepwalking paths are introduced early ("her sleepwalking paths overlapping like silk threads"), explained at midpoint ("the same route...but each night the path shifted slightly, creating an overlap that resembled the golden spiral of a nautilus shell"), and shown to matter ("Where these paths crossed, the air grew thick with possibility"). The mechanic enables her weaving and shapes her nightly ritual. It does not, however, constrain a tactical choice or impose cost; the overlap always succeeds as hoped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The centuries-old red canyon labyrinth is anchored early and sustained: "carved into the red canyon walls," "once a pilgrimage site," now "a tidal sanctuary where ocean met desert." Its transformation (barnacles on petroglyphs, coral breathing air) provides resources (shells, algae) and shapes her ritual (maze passages that rearrange with each lunar cycle). The setting constrains her sleepwalking paths and charges the final image. It does not force a single pivotal choice but supplies persistent pressure and atmosphere integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the tide pools empty" is mentioned twice: "by the time the sun reached its zenith" and "the tide pools below were empty now, their creatures retreated." It establishes when the sewing occurs but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The clock is descriptive rather than tactical; removing this element would not alter her choices or the story's momentum.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated near midpoint and echoed in "a bridge between ruin and reverence." It names her project and colors her stance. However, the desire is affirmed rather than tested: the labyrinth cooperates, the illustration plate's children move as hoped, and she smiles at closure. No on-page friction between want and cost; the motivation is told and fulfilled without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is lyric, elegiac, and hopeful throughout: "phantom stitches," "color of dried blood and hope," "stubborn succulents," "solace...the color of orchids." It modulates subtly (morning light painted, drowsiness claimed) and coheres across beats. The final image—"impossibly alive"—charges the tone with quiet affirmation. The orchid-solace frame appears only in the last line; earlier beats sustain the tone organically without leaning on the label.</comment>
