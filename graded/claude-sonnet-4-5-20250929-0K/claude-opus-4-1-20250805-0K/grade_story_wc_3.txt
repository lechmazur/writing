<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sarah's choices trace to professional devotion, but her interiority is largely summary and abstraction ("haunted by ambitions," "kindly methodical nature"). The pivotal decision to consume the seed lacks embodied hesitation or contradictory impulses acting in scene; we get a single paragraph of reflection followed by immediate action. The priest-scientist's presence offers backstory weight, but Sarah's own emotional progression feels narrated rather than dramatized, especially at the moment she "placed the seed on her tongue."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening beat. The closure unit—Sarah consuming the seed and transforming—lands on the page with a visible state change, qualifying as Decisive Change. However, cost legibility is weak: the forfeiture of her "quiet life" and "scholarly detachment" is asserted in reflection but not dramatized through a concrete on-page price that alters tactics or forecloses a visible path. The priest's departure and Sarah's acceptance follow a because/therefore arc, but the final transformation reads more as wish-fulfillment than trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly described with "silver branches," "glowing orbs," and electromagnetic hum, and the cloud-layer ascent provides spatial specificity. The laboratory platform and the tablet in the opening anchor early setting details. The seed's warmth and thrumming energy offer tactile grounding at the closure beat. However, the arbor functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint (tool access, spatial limit, magnetic interference) shapes Sarah's final choice, capping the score below 7.0 despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bridging ancient wisdom and modern understanding. The breakthrough via lodestone analogy provides one meaningful tightening, and Sarah's arrival at the arbor deepens the mystery. Yet the final beat—consuming the seed—unfolds without visible resistance, cost negotiation, or trade-off on the page. The priest's departure and Sarah's acceptance happen in sequence without pressure testing her commitment. No on-page reversal forces a harder choice; the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under stress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness transcending time and medium—emerges through the cuneiform instructions, the magnetic arbor mechanics, and the priest's lingering spirit. The final image of Sarah becoming "both translator and text" offers a non-literal answer tied to the central question. However, the closing paragraph ("The physics of transition, she realized, is simply this…") states the theme overtly rather than trusting image and action, undercutting resonance. The haunted-ambitions motif recurs but feels asserted ("she'd been haunted by ambitions") rather than dramatized through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Sarah throughout, with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present in the opening tactile beat ("pressed her fingertips against the ancient clay tablet") and the analogical-thinking breakthrough. Diction remains appropriate for an academic narrator. However, lexical specificity is uneven: "kindly methodical nature" and "haunted by ambitions" are generic labels, and the priest's "desperate need to preserve knowledge" tells rather than showing his stance through distinct idiom. No dialogue on the page to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is mostly maintained, but several artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "haunted by ambitions" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She'd been haunted…," "She'd always maintained…," "She felt…," "She saw…" across multiple beats. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance, through any medium, transcending time itself") that read as thesis rather than image. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she understood," "she recognized") in peak beats dulls immediacy. Deductions total approximately −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence, and summary in the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—ancient Sumerian electromagnetics enabling consciousness transfer—offers speculative novelty, and the cuneiform-translation frame provides grounding detail. However, the emotional arc (lone scholar's lifelong quest rewarded with mystical transformation) follows a recognizable template without a sharp inflection. The priest-as-spirit-guide, knowledge-fruit-as-data-structure, and "inheritor must choose" beats are familiar genre moves. The analogical-thinking method is mentioned but not dramatized with friction or false starts. Specificity in the magnetic-arbor mechanics elevates slightly, but the closure offers fulfillment rather than a non-obvious cost or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sarah (cuneiform translator) frames the opening, drives the analogical breakthrough, and makes the final choice to consume the seed. She appears in all three beats (setup, middle discovery, closure), meeting the gate model. However, her key decision unfolds without on-page resistance or trade-off negotiation; the narrative tells us she "understood" and "recognized" rather than showing her weigh competing costs. Causal pressure is present but muted; the element shapes two beats (translation breakthrough, seed consumption) but the final choice feels narrated rather than dramatically tested. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus ornamental interiority −0.5 and summary-only final choice −0.8 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The knowledge-fruit seed is introduced mid-story when Sarah plucks the fruit, returns with visions of the priest when she holds it, and drives the closure when she consumes it. Three distinct beats with escalating involvement. The seed's crystalline structure and bioluminescent patterns are specified, and its properties (imprinting consciousness onto electromagnetic fields) are unique and irreplaceable. Closure linkage is strong; the transformation hinges on this exact object. Missing early setup (arrives after ~50% mark) −0.4, but causal pressure +1.2, three beats +1.4, closure centrality +1.5, specificity +0.6 = ~7.2 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" is mentioned twice in reflection ("she'd been haunted by ambitions," "his haunted ambitions, so similar to her own") and gestures toward theme. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; Sarah's actions proceed from professional curiosity and the priest's instructions rather than a dramatized friction between ambition and cost. The concept shapes mood but remains ornamental, functioning as a thematic label rather than a live stake. Present in two beats (Sarah's reflection, priest's echo) but without causal pressure or closure participation beyond mood. Functional but replaceable: ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is asserted in the opening paragraph ("her kindly methodical nature perfect for the painstaking work") and echoed near the end ("a kindly methodical scholar"). The attribute is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates kindliness under pressure, and "methodical" describes her past work rather than constraining a present choice. The trait could be replaced with "patient" or "careful" without structural impact. Present in setup and closure mention, but ornamental and generic. Score: setup +0.5, closure cameo +0.3, minus label-only −0.6, swappability −0.5 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reestablish" (the link severed by the Bronze Age Collapse) is signaled mid-story ("waiting for someone who could read his instructions and reestablish the link"), drives Sarah's understanding of her role, and underpins the closure transformation. The action is not a single beat but a sustained goal that structures the second half. However, it is told rather than shown; we do not see Sarah perform distinct steps to reestablish the connection—she consumes the seed and the arbor responds. The element shapes two beats (priest's instruction, final transformation) and participates in closure, but the mechanics are summarized. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus summary-only −0.8, late signal −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Analogical thinking" appears in one key beat: Sarah notices the Sumerian word for "ascension" alongside lodestone descriptions and creates the electromagnetic field. This breakthrough enables the plot but is narrated in summary ("The breakthrough came through analogical thinking") rather than dramatized with trial, error, or intermediate steps. The method does not recur or shape later choices; once the platform ascends, the analogy is complete. One beat involvement +0.4, causal enabler +0.7, setup present +0.5, minus summary-only −0.6, single use −0.4, late mention −0.3 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is introduced early (second paragraph as goal, third paragraph as arrival) and provides the setting for the closure. Its properties—electromagnetic resonance, knowledge fruits, silver branches—are vividly described and unique. However, the arbor does not constrain Sarah's choice or supply a resource that alters her tactics; it functions as a stage for her transformation rather than an active pressure. The final beat mentions the arbor humming "with renewed purpose," a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning. Setup +0.6, closure reprise +0.9, specificity +0.7, minus no causal constraint −0.6, postcard-description tendency −0.4 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" is mentioned once in reflection: "After the spirit leaves, the texts had warned, the inheritor must choose quickly." The priest's presence fades "now" and Sarah acts immediately, but the timeframe does not impose a visible clock or tighten her decision on the page. The urgency is asserted ("must choose quickly") but not dramatized through countdown, decay, or lost opportunity. Single mention, closure-adjacent but not causally active. Setup mention +0.4, closure proximity +0.5, minus no live clock −0.7, summary-only −0.3 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of transition" is introduced mid-story ("Sarah understood the physics of transition now") and recurs in the final paragraph ("The physics of transition, she realized, is simply this…"). The motivation frames Sarah's arc and closure realization, but it is told through internal summary rather than tested by friction or competing wants. No on-page cost (e.g., sacrificing safety, clarity, or a relationship) is dramatized to show her prioritizing this understanding. Present in two beats with closure linkage, but label-driven. Two beats +0.9, closure +0.9, minus told-only −0.7, no friction −0.5 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Touching distance" as tone is signaled in "touching distance from mysteries that had consumed her entire adult life" and modulates the piece's register: reverent, close to revelation, yet methodical. The tone coheres through the ascent and arbor exploration, shifting slightly to wonder at the closure. However, the final paragraph's explanatory summary ("consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance") flattens the tone into exposition rather than sustaining the charged proximity. Coherent through most beats, closure modulation present but weakened by summary. Setup +0.5, modulation +0.6, closure participation +0.7, minus final-paragraph flatness −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>
