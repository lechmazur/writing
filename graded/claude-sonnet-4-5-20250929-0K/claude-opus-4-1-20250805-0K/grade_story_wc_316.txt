<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is declared (numbness, seeking to "feel") but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The sparring scene offers kinetic movement but no meaningful internal struggle—he simply "understands flooding through" without cost or friction. The duplicate remains entirely off-page, so the custody conflict never pressures Marcus's choices in scene. Therapy-speak pervades ("ego death," "remember terror," "numbness is just possibility") without grounding in specific sensation or micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (Master Chen, jar, court ruling) but the drive lens wobbles between Causal (sparring teaches thesis/antithesis) and Accumulative/Textural (meditation hall, history rewrites, floating setting accumulate atmosphere). The closure—Marcus picks up the jar and resolves to co-create—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("potential for it") rather than felt on the page. The sparring beat teaches "complementary opposite" but the leap to "birth a third consciousness" feels more announced than causally earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo, crystalline walls, and gravity generators establish a vivid SF frame early. Spatial choreography in the sparring sequence is clear (low gravity, mirrored movements, transparent floor revealing Earth). However, the setting remains largely decorative—the dojo's features don't constrain Marcus's choice; he could reach the same epiphany in a traditional dojo. The jar is handled twice (Chen lifts it, Marcus picks it up) but doesn't pressure the turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's numbness and the custody conflict—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page opposition. No reversal occurs; Chen's lecture provides the solution without Marcus resisting or testing it. The duplicate's parallel revelation is told, not shown, eliminating potential friction. The sparring mirrors the thesis but doesn't escalate pressure or foreclose an option; Marcus simply absorbs the lesson. Cost is abstract ("potential") rather than visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Numbness is just possibility waiting to be born" is a direct thematic statement in the final lines, replacing earned resonance with a lesson. The thesis/antithesis/synthesis motif is overtly labeled during sparring. The brain-jar symbolism (backup, duplicate, third consciousness) leans heavily symbolic without grounding in specific human cost. The piece gestures toward ego-death philosophy but remains in abstract terrain; the ending doesn't reweight prior material so much as state the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narration maintains stable first-person distance and Marcus's voice carries a meditative, genre-aware idiom ("hollow as the stone chambers," "history rewrites itself"). However, interiority leans toward exposition ("understanding flooding through me") and filter verbs ("I wanted to laugh," "I'd come here seeking"). Dialogue with Chen reads naturally and advances the lesson, but subtext is thin—Chen mostly explicates theme. The piece avoids head-hopping and teaches its SF frame cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Minor loops appear: "feel…feel…felt" in paragraph three, "memory of what emotion should feel like" echoes "remembers terror" from two lines prior. "Neither can feel because both are incomplete" states what the scene should embody. The sparring sequence is kinetically clear and propels, but the ending paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("understanding flooding," "architecture where feeling could live," "potential for it") that soften closure impact. No major artifacts obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The consciousness-split custody premise and floating dojo setting are fresh, but the resolution—creating a third consciousness to "complete" the split selves—arrives as a lecture rather than through dramatic discovery. The "complementary opposites birth synthesis" logic is philosophically tidy but emotionally inert; Marcus's acceptance feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The piece leans on SF furniture (floating rock, neural interfaces, history rewrites) without integrating those details into the custody stakes. The emotional truth of splitting and numbness is asserted more than lived.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus (ego-death survivor) is present throughout and his quest for feeling frames the story. He participates in sparring and picks up the jar, but these are reactive—Chen drives the revelation. The "ego death" label is mentioned but not dramatized as a choice with cost. Present in setup, middle sparring, and closure, but his agency is passive absorption rather than decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The brain-in-a-jar appears in beat one (Chen lifts it, explains duplicate brought it), is absent during sparring, and returns in the ending (Marcus picks it up). Two distinct touches with reweighted meaning (backup → potential child). Its presence charges the final image, but it doesn't constrain any on-page choice—Marcus never considers destroying it or refusing Chen's proposal. Causal role is moderate; closure linkage is clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is declared in the opening (court ruling, both legally "me," claiming daughter) and motivates Marcus's numbness, but the conflict never appears on the page. The duplicate remains off-stage; no custody tactics are tested. The resolution (co-create a third) sidesteps the battle rather than resolving it. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but missing middle development where choice would matter.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is implied in Chen's direct teaching style but never labeled or dramatized as a trait with cost. Chen's bluntness moves the plot, yet the attribute itself isn't signaled, tested, or shown to constrain his approach. Functional but ornamental—any wise mentor could deliver the same lesson without this specific quality altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vivify" is introduced mid-story (Chen reveals duplicate's plan), discussed during sparring as the solution, and becomes Marcus's resolve at closure. It shapes the ending image and offers a non-obvious answer to the numbness problem. However, it's proposed rather than enacted—Marcus decides to vivify tomorrow, so the action itself remains off-page. Present in middle and closure; causal role moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is explicitly taught during sparring ("thesis, antithesis, synthesis," mirrored strikes, "complementary opposite" label) and becomes the solution's rationale (two halves birth a third). The method is signaled early in the meditation-hall frame and structures the ending logic. Mechanics matter but are told rather than tested under pressure. Present across beats and central to closure; specificity high but demonstration thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is vividly described (carved into rock, crystalline walls, gravity generators, transparent floor) and establishes SF atmosphere. However, it never constrains a choice—the sparring and epiphany could occur in any dojo. The setting is present throughout but remains backdrop. No middle beat where low gravity or floating isolation alters Marcus's options; postcard use dominates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself" is mentioned twice (paragraph five, final paragraph) as worldbuilding texture but never pressures Marcus's decision or creates urgency. No ticking clock; the court ruled "yesterday" but no deadline looms. The timeframe adds conceptual weight (reality is negotiable) but doesn't tighten tactics. Ornamental presence without causal role; missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is the dominant stake, declared early ("I feel nothing") and resolved at closure (Marcus sees "architecture where feeling could live"). The motivation is consistent and shapes the sparring conversation. However, it's mostly told—Marcus reflects on numbness rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses (wanting to feel versus fearing what feeling will cost). Desire is present across beats but friction is thin; the goal is achieved through lecture rather than on-page struggle.</comment>
