<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marion's agency is clear—she actively constructs theories, learns film patterns, and improvises music to reshape magnetic fields—but the final reunion lacks earned cost or visible transformation. Her "strategically creative hope" manifests in concrete actions (studying reels, matching musical phrases to splices), yet the ending delivers Sophia unchanged, reducing the stakes to wish fulfillment. Internal contradiction is minimal; Marion's obsessive focus reads consistently, though the piece never dramatizes a moment where her theory might fail or demand sacrifice. The motivation is embodied through her nightly ritual, but the closure bypasses the tension between hope and delusion that the setup promises.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (station pianist, aerial terminal, compass storms anchored by paragraph two). The closure—Sophia stepping through the screen—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: the clock lurches forward one minute, yet no prior scene establishes what Marion forfeited or risked to achieve this. The piece follows a causal lens (music → harmonics → corridor through storm → return), but the final beat short-circuits earned pressure; Marion's improvisation succeeds without friction, making the reversal feel convenient. The drive holds through the climax, but the lack of on-page struggle or trade-off at the moment of breakthrough caps the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal arbor's coral bones conduct musical resonance, directly enabling the climactic corridor; the projection booth and cinema supply the film reels that constrain Marion's method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "calcified coral reaching down through cumulus layers," "silver halide emulsion," "condensation on celluloid." The broken clock functions as both micro-setting anchor and recurring object that charges the ending (11:47 → 11:48). Spatial choreography is clean (piano, projection booth, screen, terminal benches), and the setting's vertical isolation above the Pacific reinforces the stakes of being cut off from other colonies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving Sophia from temporal limbo—is signaled early and tightens once: Marion sees the hand in frame 1,847/1,848, improvises new harmonies, and compasses steady. However, the escalation bypasses on-page resistance; the corridor opens without friction, and Sophia steps through as soon as Marion plays. No reversal, trade-off, or complication tests Marion's commitment. The final image (compasses pointing to "where home waits to be built") reconfigures meaning, but the lack of visible cost at the peak moment—no risk that the music might fail, no price for bending reality—keeps the pressure from fully landing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: compasses point "to where home waits to be built," refuges exist in film frames, music creates corridors through storm. The piece resists easy moralizing, instead offering a non-literal answer to whether obsessive hope can retrieve the lost. Marion's "strategically creative" longing and the final image of "perforations in film" as possible frames avoid stated thesis. However, the ending inches toward overt articulation ("her steely longing hadn't been about finding what was lost, but about creating a refuge") rather than letting the action alone carry the weight. The Rachmaninoff prelude and anniversary motif recur with purpose, charging the closure without heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marion; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "inverted branches of some impossible tree," "divining rods for regret," "silver nitrate and coral." Perceptual signature is clear—Marion notices musical phrases, frame numbers, and harmonic resonance in ways that fit her expertise. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses as compasses steady, expanded syntax during reflective setup). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Sophia's single line carries subtext and reorients the thematic stakes. Filter verbs are used sparingly and do not dull immediacy. The final paragraph's elevated register ("perforations in film") matches the lyric mode established throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm are strong; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character state, or plot. However, two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The compasses throughout the terminal began pointing toward the screen" followed immediately by repetition of compass steadiness; and the penultimate paragraph ("her steely longing hadn't been about...") restates thematically what the prior image already conveyed. Stock metaphors appear occasionally ("horizon prepared its nightly invitation to darkness"), and one instance of register drift ("dwelling in between frames" edges toward academic phrasing for Sophia's two-year absence). Proofreading is clean, and spatial choreography tracks clearly. The opening and closing images are vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of coral-arbor stations, compass storms that point to memories, and hidden film refuges offers a fresh speculative frame. The marriage of music and magnetic fields to retrieve a lost traveler transforms familiar reunion tropes through grounded world logic. However, the piece hovers near template emotional beats: the devoted partner, the broken anniversary marker, the moment of return. The "unplanned encore" and film-as-refuge angles provide specific texture, yet the climax bypasses earned friction, reducing surprise. The conceptual premise is strong and commits fully to its implications, but the emotional arc follows a relatively predictable path once the method is established. Risk-taking in structure and metaphor elevates the work without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marion is present throughout, drives the film study and musical experiment, and her improvisation at the piano directly enables Sophia's return. She appears in setup (hired entertainment, studying reels), middle (learning patterns), and closure (playing Rachmaninoff, creating the corridor). Her choices narrow options: she could have accepted loss, but instead constructs elaborate theories and enacts them. However, the final beat bypasses on-page cost or trade-off for Marion herself; success arrives without visible sacrifice or transformation. Two gates (setup, closure) are strong; middle development is functional but not deeply pressured. Causal role is clear, but irreplaceability is moderate—another determined character could occupy the role with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clock is introduced early (stopped at 11:47, the moment Sophia vanished) and returns at closure (lurches to 11:48 as Sophia reappears). It functions as both mnemonic anchor and symbolic marker of resumed time. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter Marion's tactics; it is observed but not handled or used in a way that changes options. The reprise reweights meaning (time resumes), but the clock itself remains passive rather than instrumental. Two gates (setup, closure participation via reprise) are met, supporting mid-band placement. The specificity is strong—anniversary clock ties to the emotional stake—but swappability is moderate (another time marker could serve similar symbolic work).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Compasses appear in setup (spinning wildly, pointing to memories), shape middle tactics (Marion matches music to make them pause), and are causally active at closure (steadying to create the corridor, then pointing to "where home waits to be built"). The concept defines the world's logic and the central problem: navigation is broken, Sophia is lost in temporal currents. Marion's entire method is designed to manipulate compass behavior, and the final image reweights their meaning from loss to possibility. All three gates are met with strong causal pressure. The concept is irreplaceable—remove it and the plot dissolves. Visible cost is tied to the concept (two years of isolation, closed terminals), and specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is applied to Marion's hope in one paragraph and manifests as her theory-building from accident report inconsistencies. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it describes her approach rather than forcing a choice between creative risk and another value. The attribute is mentioned but not dramatized as a tradeoff (e.g., creativity leading to a dangerous gamble that almost fails). Setup gate is met; middle development and closure linkage are weak. The trait is more label than lever, and swappability is high—"obsessive," "ingenious," or "desperate" could replace it with minimal edits. No moment where strategic creativity costs her something or saves her from a different mistake.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Refuge" is introduced explicitly mid-story ("The films were refuges, she realized") and drives Marion's entire project: she creates a musical-harmonic refuge to retrieve Sophia. The concept is thematically central and the final paragraph extends it ("creating a refuge where the lost could find their way back"). However, the word and concept arrive after setup; Marion's earlier months of study are described as pattern-reading, not refuge-building. Middle development is strong (the nightly ritual of playing specific compositions), and closure links directly (Sophia steps through, Marion realizes the purpose). Causal role is solid, but late first appearance (~40% mark) and moderate swappability ("haven," "portal," "passage") lower the score. Two-and-a-half gates met; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (projection booth, spliced film sections with timestamps), shapes middle tactics (Marion studies frame by frame, matches music to splice rhythm), and is causally active at closure (she projects the altered reel, sees the hand in frames 1,847/1,848, Sophia steps through the screen). All three gates are met. The method's mechanics matter—silver halide emulsion as temporal pocket, spliced frames as refuges, projection combined with music to open the corridor. Irreplaceability is high; the specificity of black-and-white film, frame numbers, and celluloid condensation is integral. Visible cost is indirect (months of study, nightly ritual), but the method drives the resolution and could not be swapped for a generic "magic portal" without losing narrative logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is introduced in the opening line, its coral bones serve as the resonance medium for Marion's music, and the vertical isolation above the Pacific contextualizes the closure of terminals and Marion's solitude. Setup and middle development are strong; the setting provides the piano, projection booth, and coral structure necessary for the climax. At closure, the arbor is present but not foregrounded—the focus shifts to the screen and compass needle. The setting constrains choices (Marion remains because she can use the arbor's acoustics) and supplies resources (coral bones conduct harmonics). However, it does not charge the final image directly; stars and film perforations dominate the last beat. Two-and-a-half gates, solid causal pressure, moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("until the horizon invites night") is mentioned and the piece tracks evening progression (sun arcs toward evening, setting sun, night settles). Marion plays "each evening," and tonight's attempt coincides with a stronger magnetic disturbance. However, the deadline does not tighten tactics or create a live clock—Marion's improvisation succeeds on first attempt without time pressure forcing a choice. The timeframe provides atmospheric coherence but does not escalate stakes or constrain action. Setup is present (evening established early), middle mentions sunset, closure notes night's arrival. One-and-a-half gates; functional but replaceable. Swappability is high—the story could occur at dawn or midday with minor edits and no structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marion's desire "to surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated late (page two, during the climax: "this was her unplanned encore, a surprise for fate itself"). The motivation is dramatized through her improvisation—playing beyond the written score, creating new harmonies—and the final reunion is framed as the realization of this intent. However, the phrasing arrives at the moment of enactment rather than shaping prior choices, weakening setup. Middle development is implicit (months of learning, nightly playing), but the specific "surprise fate" framing does not constrain earlier tactics. Closure linkage is strong; the improvisation is the unplanned encore. One-and-a-half gates, moderate causal pressure, late signal. Swappability is moderate—"defy fate," "rewrite loss" could replace with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent from the opening ("yellowed keys," "empty benches," "Everyone assumed Sophia was dead") through the ending ("stars emerged like perforations in film"). Longing is embodied in Marion's nightly ritual, her study of inconsistencies, and her refusal to accept loss. "Steely" manifests in the unyielding two-year vigil and the disciplined pattern-matching required to learn the film mechanics. The tone modulates appropriately: reflective during setup, intensifying during the improvisation ("her fingers finding harmonies that weren't written"), and softening into quiet wonder at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt articulation ("steely longing hadn't been about finding what was lost") rather than letting action alone carry the tone. All three gates met; tone charges the final image and supports pressure throughout.</comment>
