<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's character remains consistent but lacks internal contradiction under pressure; her arc proceeds smoothly without genuine friction between competing impulses. The "weaves truth carefully" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she simply transcribes what appears. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("salvage artist of impossible things") rather than embodied, moment-specific perception. The chemist ghost materializes but serves exposition rather than applying relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the shrine visit deepens Marina's understanding through layered revelation (snow globe → formula → twelve more globes). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—Marina's role reweights from diver to "salvage artist" with a mission—but the cost remains abstract; no specific path is foreclosed on the page. The turn from "one wreck" to "twelve more" adds scope but doesn't narrow present options with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: candles carving rivulets, ice walls blooming with visions, candlelight refracting formulas. The melted snow globe's warped plastic edges are felt through diving gloves, anchoring tactile detail. The setting charges the closure by providing the constellation map, meeting the 9+ test for constraint. Minor deduction: the shrine's perpetual candles and Marina's fifteen-year career are told rather than shown affecting present tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake emerges: decoding the antidote formula to fulfill the Cassandra passengers' purpose. The stakes deepen when twelve more globes are revealed, but this expansion occurs via exposition without on-page cost—Marina simply accepts the larger mission. No live option is foreclosed; she climbs toward the surface with resolve intact. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but the tightening is conceptual rather than tactical, and no trade-off alters her immediate path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection across death, salvage from wreckage, truth woven carefully into the living world. The melted snow globe as dream architecture and the "borrowed starlight" motif recur with shifting resonance. However, the final paragraph risks didacticism: "someone who understood that the most precious cargo often came disguised as wreckage" edges toward thesis statement. The chemist's "We knew someone would come" and Marina's self-identification as "salvage artist" feel designed to articulate theme rather than letting image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a lyric register: "breath on glass," "borrowed starlight," "windows of connection." Perceptual signature is distinct—Marina reads frost patterns and dream architecture—though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("collective unconscious," "cameo appearances") without clear motivation from her wreck-diver background. The chemist's dialogue is functional but generic. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Strong rhythmic control in descriptive passages but some syntactic repetition in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with vivid imagery ("warmth carving tiny rivulets," "whispered through rusted portholes"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "melted snow globe" recurs five times in opening paragraphs without variation; "woven/weaves/weaving" cycles through adjacent beats. Template cadence visible in exposition blocks: "She had learned... She placed... She had spent..." The filter-verb stack "had pulled," "had learned," "had been carrying," "had been" clusters in early paragraphs, dulling immediacy. Stock metaphor "breath on glass" and "borrowed starlight" repeated without fresh inflection. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer premise is fresh, and the melted snow globe as encoded formula shows ingenuity. However, the "chosen one who can see what others can't" frame and the "there are twelve more" setup echo familiar quest templates without transformation. Emotional specificity is limited—Marina's fifteen-year journey and the passengers' sacrifice remain abstracted. The transformation test fails: swap names and the arc remains unchanged. Risk-taking in lyric tone elevates slightly, but the piece retreats to explanation rather than trusting image at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina appears throughout but her choices don't create key turns—she observes, transcribes, and accepts revelation. The chemist reveals the twelve globes; Marina doesn't decide, she acknowledges. Her role is reactive vessel rather than active agent whose decisions alter trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe is handled in the opening (pulled from wreck, pressed to chest), placed on altar, and its formula transcribed—three distinct beats. It returns in the final paragraph as cargo carried to surface. The warped plastic and fused city are specific. It enables the formula discovery and shapes the ending image, though its reweighting is more instrumental than resonant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named explicitly and demonstrated through frost patterns and dream cameos. It shapes Marina's method—reading visions in ice walls—but doesn't constrain tactics or force a difficult choice. The concept operates as theme and descriptor rather than pressure mechanism that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated twice but never demonstrated with on-page cost or constraint. Marina transcribes without friction, never forced to choose between competing truths or pay a price for careful versus hasty weaving. The trait is label-only; removing it wouldn't alter any scene action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Expose" appears in the ghosts' method (exposing truth through dreams) and Marina's transcription work, but the action is more revelation than exposure-as-conflict. No major turn traces to a risky act of exposing; information is given rather than wrestled from resistance. The term fits thematically but doesn't drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dream analysis is signaled early (businessman in Tokyo, child in Morocco) and explained as the ghosts' communication method. It shapes Marina's understanding—she reads what the dead are trying to expose—and appears again when she maps wreck locations from candle-constellations. Present in setup and closure but doesn't constrain a middle choice; the mechanics unfold via exposition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is present throughout: candles carving ice, walls as projection surface, altar catching light, ceiling creating constellation maps. It enables the formula reveal and provides the wreck map, directly shaping closure. The environment supplies resources (candlelight angles, reflective ice) that make Marina's discovery possible. Specific and indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Salvage something pure" is stated in the prompt element and echoed in the final paragraph. Marina's fifteen-year progression toward this moment is told in summary. The motivation is present and consistent but never dramatized through a conflicted choice—she doesn't weigh salvage against another want or confront friction between purity and compromise on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears three times: altar catches "borrowed starlight," candles create constellations, Marina carries "borrowed starlight" at closure. The tone is lyric, elegiac, consistent across pressure beats. It charges the final image by literalizing the metaphor (candle-constellations as navigation tools). Coherent and purposeful, though the direct repetition in the closing line risks over-emphasis.</comment>
