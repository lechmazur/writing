<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's interior is well-anchored in the opening climb and at key turns, with embodied detail ("key weighed cold") and purposeful repetition of "quietly deliberate." However, her final transformation reads largely told: "she understood her true inheritance" and "learning not what runes could do" announce insight without deeper contradiction or visible internal cost. The protagonist's agency at the closure—tracing runes to seal gaps—feels more executed than wrestled-with, missing the friction required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (shadows, relearning motif). The piece moves through clear because/therefore beats: Lyra inserts key → automaton reverses → she grasps the inverted sealing pattern → traces runes → loops close. Closure is a Decisive Change (she seals gaps) with a shift in role (guardian). However, the conceptual cost—"learning not what runes could do"—is mostly asserted in reflection rather than tested on the page, and the ending cost feels more thematic than felt. Orientation anchors are strong (floating isle, observatory, automaton).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating isle, observatory machinery (brass gears, crystal lenses, silver threads), and the automaton are vividly drawn and purposefully used. The automaton's exposed clockwork heart and reversed writing directly shape Lyra's choices. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs → dome → center). Small friction: the observatory's function could have been cued earlier; it arrives as a revelation rather than a constraint shaping tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping reality loops before they spiral—is signaled clearly. Lyra's insertion of the key and recognition of the inverted sealing rune form a meaningful tightening. Yet the escalation is smooth and intellectual rather than pressured by a live decision; the automaton's reversal and her tracing of runes feel sequential discoveries more than escalating trade-offs. No on-page loss or visible cost that alters tactics; the ending lands as task completion rather than a narrowed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—guardianship of sealed knowledge, reality's self-correction—emerges clearly from the automaton's reversal and shadow coordinates. The final image of "learning not what runes could do, but what they must never be allowed to do again" offers resonance. However, the thematic answer is stated rather than embodied in a choice or image that reweights prior material; the last paragraph leans into summary ("began her real education") instead of letting the runes and shadows charge the ending without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "quietly deliberate," "shadows that fell upward at noon." The narrative voice blends Lyra's perceptual signature (runic training, scholarly caution) with lyric phrasing. Small slips: "sealed awakenings, those moments when ordinary objects briefly remembered they were something more" and "the universe's dreams from becoming nightmares" edge toward thematic summary rather than internal processing. No dialogue; narration remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong; rhythm varies, imagery is specific ("shadows that fell upward at noon," "brass secretary that had written down every astronomical observation"). Information density is high across beats. Minor scaffold: "Three months had passed since the Spoon Convergence—that terrible dawn when kitchen drawers worldwide erupted..." front-loads exposition in apposition rather than weaving through present action. The final two paragraphs drift into summarized consequence rather than live image, lowering closure charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—sealed awakenings, bent-spoon reality scars, shadows fleeing noon—feels fresh and tightly integrated. The inverted sealing rune as prison mechanism is a strong, non-obvious turn. However, the "Spoon Convergence" veers toward quirk-for-novelty without full causal grounding in the world's logic, and the ending's shift to guardian-role reads somewhat familiar (apprentice inherits mentor's secret burden). The automaton writing backwards is a vivid, earned image that elevates the piece.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout, notices the shadow pattern, inserts the key, interprets the automaton's reversal, and traces sealing runes. Her choices drive two beats (key insertion, rune tracing) and shape the closure. Setup is immediate; development constrains her tactics (she must relearn her training); payoff is clear. However, her arc is more discovery than decision under pressure; she executes rather than wrestles with a trade-off. Strong integration but lacks visible cost tied specifically to her scholar identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The key is introduced early (paragraph 1), handled twice (wrapped in note, inserted into automaton), and its turn triggers the automaton's reversal and Lyra's realization. It shapes two beats and contributes directly to closure ("The clockwork key turned one final time, and the loops closed"). Specificity is high: "for the automaton" and "for the entire observatory." Only friction: the key's dual function (automaton + observatory) is revealed late, nudging swappability slightly. Otherwise indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings frame the world-state (Spoon Convergence aftermath) and recur in Lyra's final role ("guardian of sealed awakenings"). The concept shapes stakes—reality is trying to close loops—and reappears at closure. However, it functions more as atmospheric premise than tactical constraint; Lyra does not struggle against an awakening on the page. Setup is immediate, payoff present, but middle development is thematic rather than causal pressure. Mid-band for presence across arc without beat-level teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is used three times: opening climb, key insertion, rune tracing. It colors Lyra's actions and recurs at the closure beat, lending consistency. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it describes her manner without forcing a trade-off (e.g., slowness under time pressure). Setup and payoff present; causal pressure absent. Mid-band for purposeful recurrence without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Relearn" anchors the automaton's reversal ("relearn its purpose in reverse") and Lyra's realization ("She had to relearn everything now"). It drives two beats: the automaton's backwards writing reveals the inverted sealing rune, and Lyra reinterprets her training. Present in the final third and contributes to closure framing. However, the action is conceptual rather than physical; it could be replaced with "reinterpret" or "understand anew" with minor edits. Strong thematic integration but moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is seeded in the mentor's note ("the loops must close"), demonstrated through the automaton's reversed sealing, and executed at closure when Lyra traces runes "sealing another gap" and "the loops closed with a whisper." It shapes tactics (tracing inverted runes) and the final image. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Small friction: the mechanics of loop-closing are asserted more than shown in detail; we see Lyra tracing but not the exact cost or friction of each seal. High integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vivid and purposefully detailed (brass gears, crystal lenses, constellation maps). It supplies the automaton and tools Lyra needs. The floating isle trembles at noon, creating environmental pressure. Setup is immediate; the setting constrains access (spiral climb) and provides resources (telescopes, machinery). However, the "floating isle tethered to nothing but starlight" functions more as atmospheric anchor than tactical constraint; the location could be a mountaintop with similar effect. Strong presence, moderate necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is established early ("Three months had passed since the Spoon Convergence") and recurs ("as noon approached somewhere below," "when noon came again"). It provides narrative anchor and world context. However, the "after" does not tighten present decisions; Lyra's task is not time-pressured by the Convergence's aftermath. The noon shadows create a recurring image but do not impose a live deadline. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle pressure weak. Mid-band for presence without tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—to find where shadows go at noon—is stated early ("she hoped the observatory's ancient telescopes might reveal") and drives her climb and use of the key. The automaton's coordinates answer the question. Desire is clear and causally linked to two beats. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; we see her execute the search, not wrestle with competing wants or costs. Setup, development, and payoff present; friction between cost and desire is light. Solid integration.</comment>
