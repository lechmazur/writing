<comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("cables singing," dust-pattern reading), and his ghost-sight ability constrains his choices throughout. The grandmother flashback at the funeral is well-anchored and shifts his present action. However, the cluster of ghosts materializing near the end—maintenance man, building manager, actress—arrive without prior embodiment or distinct pressure, reading as convenience casting. The final choice to take evidence to reporters feels stated rather than wrestled with under contradictory impulses; we see decision but not the competing costs that would earn the 8+ band.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The story infers as Causal with Accumulative accents (dust patterns, journal discoveries, cascading evidence). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus accepts the burden his grandmother carried and commits to exposing the conspiracy, winding the spring "one final turn" as a promise to fix broken systems. Cost is legible—he inherits a dangerous, isolating vigil—and the lens holds. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when Teresa's counting stops and she points upward, narrowing Marcus's options and raising stakes. Minor deduction: the sudden materialization of multiple ghosts in the final third feels like a late escalation rather than organic accumulation, slightly softening the causal chain.</comment>

<comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly particular (cracked window, sequined ghost, dust-map floor, hidden ceiling journals) and constrains Marcus's investigation throughout. Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that drives his choices, and the mainspring barrel's warmth provides a tactile anchor. The fluorescent buzz bookends the piece, charging the final image when Marcus turns it off to see "in honest darkness." Spatial choreography is clear across moves (toolbox, counter, ceiling tile). The setting earns high marks for purposeful, pressure-driven detail that shapes both middle beats and closure.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide, exposing systemic corruption—is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. Marcus's agency is clear: he follows the trail, pries up the floorboard, climbs to retrieve the journals, and decides to take them to reporters. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost stops counting and points upward, forcing Marcus to act. The resolution is earned by his choices and his grandmother's legacy, with visible cost (inheriting a dangerous burden). However, the conspiracy's scale is declared more than tested on the page; we're told of "a web of neglect" and "hundreds of lives saved" without seeing Marcus wrestle with the personal danger or social friction that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—mechanical failure as moral failure, the weight of invisible vigilance—emerges through concrete particulars (sabotaged elevator timer, falsified records, dust-map silence) rather than statement. The mainspring barrel and "weightless burden" motif recur with reweighted meaning, and the final image (turning off the light, winding the spring) offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists neat binaries: Teresa was complicit but guilt-haunted; the grandmother saved lives in secret. Minor slip: "every broken thing could still be fixed, if someone cared enough to try" edges toward thesis statement in the final paragraph, though it's anchored in action (winding the spring) and doesn't fully collapse into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature is distinct (Marcus notices cable-song, dust patterns, sequin-light, "light that no longer existed"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("singing cables," "dying wasp trapped in glass," "yellow as old teeth"). Distance modulates cleanly from tight sensory immersion to brief reflective pulls without head-hopping. One Teresa dialogue moment ("You weren't selling tickets… You were buying silence") advances understanding through implication. Minor deduction: the phrase "analyzing dust accumulation patterns" in the early section reads slightly clinical and filter-heavy for the established voice, and "engaged with the space carefully" is a filter construction that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats ("dust motes spiral," "hollow core," "yellow as old teeth"). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several scaffold constructions slow momentum: "He had learned to be skillfully observant" tells rather than shows; "Marcus had come here to discover what ceilings hide, following a trail…" is expository summary of off-page action; "Understanding flooded through him" is a filter-verb stack that abstracts the revelation. The phrase "he would sit with the ghosts a little longer, learning their names" in the penultimate paragraph loops back to recap rather than advancing. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull propulsion in a high-pressure sequence, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ghost-seer elevator repairman, dust-forensics investigation, and inherited-vigilance inheritance is specific and non-obvious, and the mainspring-as-legacy is a fresh inflection. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with Teresa's guilt-vigil and Marcus's burden-inheritance. However, the "medium who sees ghosts at sites of mechanical failure" and "conspiracy of falsified safety records" are familiar genre templates, and the transformation relies more on atmospheric execution than on a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would make removal of any element break the logic. The story is competent and atmospheric but doesn't take structural or perspectival risks that would elevate it above strong craft.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) is present from the opening line, his ghost-sight ability shapes his investigation across multiple beats (seeing Teresa, reading her vigil, perceiving other victims), and his inherited burden charges the closure when he winds the spring and commits to exposing the conspiracy. His choices—prying up the floorboard, climbing for the journals, deciding to take them to reporters—create key turns. The element is essential across beats and ending, with visible cost (inheriting his grandmother's dangerous vigilance).</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The mainspring barrel is introduced early (grandmother's funeral flashback), carried "for weeks," grows warm when Marcus finds the journals, and is wound "one final turn" in the closure image to signal his promise. It appears in three distinct beats with evolving meaning (inheritance → warmth/recognition → commitment). However, its mechanics remain abstract—we're told it's "hollow" and from an "elevator timer" his grandmother "sabotaged," but the specific how and why are summarized rather than shown. The object is purposeful and charges the ending but lacks the irreplaceable specificity that would push it above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Cracks in the façade" is seeded early ("drawn to the cracks in the facade between working and broken") and recurs in the final paragraph ("cracks in the facade showed clearly"). It shapes Marcus's method (reading gaps, observing "the spaces between their endless routines") and constrains his tactics (he must look for hidden evidence, not surface truth). The concept charges the closure when Marcus turns off the light to see "in honest darkness, where the cracks in the façade showed clearly." However, its primary work is thematic and atmospheric rather than driving a key plot turn; it could be reworded to "hidden corruption" or "systemic neglect" without fundamentally altering the story's logic, capping it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Skillfully observant" is stated outright ("Marcus had learned to be skillfully observant of the dead") and demonstrated through his dust-pattern reading and ghost-communication method (noticing Teresa's counting slows, reading where she paces). The trait enables his key discovery (dust rectangle → floorboard → journal) and constrains his approach (patience, indirect engagement). However, the label is delivered via expository summary rather than enacted under pressure, and we don't see a visible tradeoff or cost to this observational mode (e.g., missing something urgent, overthinking, social isolation dramatized on the page). Functional across beats but the execution trends tell-heavy, capping it just above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Engage" is signaled early ("Marcus had learned to be skillfully observant… they communicated through repetition") and drives multiple beats: he engages with Teresa's counting pattern, "engaged with the space carefully" to find the rectangle, climbs to engage with the ceiling's hidden journals, and sits "with the ghosts a little longer" at the end. The action defines his investigative method and shapes the major turn (discovering the conspiracy). The element is causally active across the arc and present at closure (engaging to learn their stories), with visible cost (inheriting the burden). It's not quite indispensable—another verb like "investigate" or "uncover" could substitute with moderate edits—but it's tightly woven and specific to Marcus's ghost-mediated approach, earning the upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is shown on the page in one key beat: Marcus runs his finger along the floor, reads "thick here, thin there—a map of where she paced," and finds the undisturbed rectangle that leads to the journal. The method is character-specific (elevator repairman's eye for wear and evidence) and enables the central discovery. However, it appears in only one causal moment and is not reprised or reweighted at closure. The phrasing also trends clinical ("analyzing dust accumulation patterns") rather than enacted with sensory immediacy. Functional and purposeful, but single-beat involvement and summary-tilt prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is introduced in the opening line, provides the cracked window, dust-map floor, and ceiling-journal hiding place that drive Marcus's investigation, and charges the closure (Teresa steps through the window, Marcus turns off the fluorescent to see in "honest darkness"). The setting supplies the resources (floorboard, ceiling tile) that alter the outcome and pressures Marcus's choices (spatial choreography across toolbox, counter, ceiling). It's essential across beats and ending, with the fluorescent buzz bookending the piece. Slightly shy of indispensable because the investigative logic could transplant to another derelict site (e.g., old theater, warehouse) with moderate edits, but it's tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The overhead fluorescent buzz is present in the opening ("had been buzzing for the past hour") and bookends the story (Marcus turns it off in the penultimate paragraph), framing the investigation window. However, it functions more as atmospheric marker than as a live clock that tightens decisions. We're told "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" defines the timeframe, but on the page the buzz stops early ("suddenly—silence") without creating urgency or altering Marcus's tactics. The element is purposeful as a framing device and charges the final image ("honest darkness") but doesn't constrain choices in the middle, capping it in the mid-4s for functional-but-replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized on the page: Marcus has been "following a trail of broken elevators and failed mechanisms," pries up the floorboard, and climbs to push up the ceiling tile where "more journals tumbled down." The motivation drives his investigation across multiple beats and is literalized (hidden journals above) while also serving as metaphor (systemic cover-up). It converges with his inherited burden at closure when he gathers the journals and commits to exposure. However, we don't see Marcus struggle with competing wants (e.g., personal safety vs. truth, doubt vs. certainty) in real time; the desire is stated and pursued linearly without friction or cost visible in his internal conflict. Functional and causal, but the lack of on-page ambivalence prevents the upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Weightless burden" is seeded early (grandmother's mainspring barrel pressed into his palm "despite its hollow core" at her funeral, "carrying the weight like air, invisible but essential") and recurs at closure ("gathered the journals, feeling their weightless burden"). The tone is coherent through turns—melancholy vigilance, spectral patience, duty without spectacle—and modulates with pressure (the fluorescent's "dying wasp" urgency, the ghosts' patient vigil, Marcus's "grim" smile). The oxymoron charges the final image when he winds the spring and inherits the invisible duty. The element is woven across beats and shapes the thematic texture, though it operates more as atmospheric throughline than as a constraint that alters a key choice, keeping it in the mid-7s.</comment>
