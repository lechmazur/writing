<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to translate silence is consistent and her choice to finally accept the new form of music at closure shows earned shift. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract statements ("the familiar ache of beauty without sound") rather than embodied contradiction. The "forty years" backstory block exceeds BRR allowance without anchoring to micro-choices that alter present tactics. Chen remains underdeveloped—her "quietly charismatic" presence is asserted but never dramatized through on-page pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through mapping gestures toward a resonant reconfiguration where Maya accepts the visual symphony as valid. Closure lands cleanly: "the silence felt like a beginning rather than an end" reweights the dominant stake with felt cost (acceptance of permanent hearing loss, relinquishing the old form). Orientation anchors arrive early (harbor, Maya, camera, Chen). One structural weakness: the forty-year backstory creates a past-heavy middle that slows accumulation, but the final image recovers momentum and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harbor at night provides vivid sensory detail ("spilled mercury," "luminous," "silver paths") and the moon serves as spotlight for their performance, charging the closure image. The empty camera constrains Maya's method throughout (no film = pure ritual). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the harbor itself does not alter a choice or tactic—it serves primarily as backdrop. The camera and moonlight do the heavier lifting as micro-setting elements that shape the final visual symphony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya's attempt to translate her new silence back into shareable experience. One meaningful tightening occurs when Chen interprets Maya's map into sign language while Maya photographs, crystallizing their collaborative performance. The cost is Maya's acceptance that "no one remembers my music" and her shift to creating something that exists only in the moment—a visible forfeiture of legacy and audience. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the harbor work: memory, translation between sensory modes, and the value of ephemeral art witnessed only by moonlight. The final image ("a visual symphony that existed in the space between what was lost and what remained") offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The "joyful sorrow" tone is sustained and charges the ending. Minor slip: "someone will remember this" / "someone already does" edges toward theme statement, but the exchange is dramatized through Chen's tears and Maya's smile, keeping it anchored in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Maya. Sign-language dialogue is rendered cleanly and carries subtext. However, voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "a topography of absence," "a gravitational pull of gesture and grace." Filter verbs cluster in the opening ("pressing," "capturing," "framing") but serve texture. The perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic—Maya's way of noticing is more lyric-generic than character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong images ("spilled mercury," "space where sound should exist but didn't"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. Two issues: "joyful sorrow" is repeated as a phrase rather than embodied through contradictory action (−0.3); the backstory paragraph is somewhat scaffold-heavy with summary compression ("she'd spent decades attempting") rather than scene density (−0.2). No major loops or artifact patterns. Information density is moderate—some beats do double work, others lean decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—deaf composer mapping silence through an empty camera, collaborating with a sign-language interpreter—offers a fresh synthesis. The concept of "negative space symphony" and visual music for an audience of one is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (artist accepting new form after loss) follows a familiar template, and the "forgotten artist" frame is a stock setup. The harbor performance redeems through particularity, but the piece does not take bold structural risks; it executes a lyric accumulation competently without transforming its genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Chen appears early and her "this is music" recognition shifts Maya's understanding mid-story. Her decision to interpret the map into sign language enables the climactic performance. However, Chen does not create a key turn through her own agency—she facilitates Maya's realization rather than driving plot causality. Present in closure (interpreting, crying) but her choices do not alter options with visible cost. Functional but replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The camera is handled across multiple beats: opening (framing silence), middle (mapping timestamps), and closure (capturing Chen's final phrase). Its core property—holding no film—is essential to the story's logic: the empty shutter becomes the instrument for translating silence. Removing it would break the method. Strong integration, but the camera does not force a trade-off or narrow options; it enables rather than constrains. Specific and purposeful use throughout with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sign language is established early (Chen signing in moonlight), returns in the middle (gestures as notes), and structures the climactic performance where Chen interprets Maya's map into sign. It shapes stakes: Maya's original compositions translated sign into symphonies, and now the process reverses. The concept alters tactics on the page—they work through gesture and visual communication. Cost: the final work exists only for them, untranslatable to wider audiences. Strong causal role across beats and essential to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted in exposition ("possessed a quietly charismatic presence that drew people without sound") but never dramatized through on-page action. No moment shows Chen's charisma constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The trait remains label-only decoration. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears in dialogue ("You're disrupting the composition") and thematically in "they disrupted the boundary between sound and silence." The harbor performance could be read as disrupting the binary of music/silence. However, the action itself is not the driver—mapping and translating are the core mechanics. The word is used more as thematic echo than plot engine. Present with thematic resonance but swappable; the story would function with "transgress" or "cross" instead.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mapping silence is signaled early (timestamps, shutter clicks, positions in harbor) and the notebook of notations becomes the score Chen interprets. The method shapes the entire middle section and is essential at closure: the map is what they perform. Removing the mapping framework would collapse the story's logic. The mechanics matter—each false photograph captures a frequency, creating "a topography of absence." Causal across beats with strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The harbor is established early with vivid detail and serves as concert hall for the climactic performance. The moonlight functions as spotlight, charging the ending image ("witnessed only by moonlight and memory"). The luminosity shapes the atmosphere and makes the visual work legible. However, the harbor does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift—they could perform this work elsewhere. Strong atmospheric contribution with closure linkage, but not indispensable to the decision structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Forty years ago" and "no one remembers my music" establish the timeframe of obscurity. The forgotten status creates the dominant stake (can Maya create shareable art now?) and Chen's "I remember" provides emotional closure. However, time itself does not tighten decisions in the present scene—the urgency comes from Maya's desire, not a ticking clock or escalating amnesia. The element frames motivation but does not pressure tactics. Present across arc with thematic weight but not mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's desire to translate silence into music is dramatized from the opening (clicking the empty camera, framing silence) through the climactic performance. The motivation drives every beat: she's been "attempting to reverse her process" for decades, and tonight she finally succeeds by creating "a language that existed in the space between." Cost is visible: she accepts that this music will have no audience, no recording, no memory beyond Chen. The friction between wanting to share and accepting ephemerality charges the closure. Essential and conflicted throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is named directly in the text and sustained through contradictory emotional beats: beauty without sound, creating music no one will remember, Chen's tears paired with Maya's smile. The tone charges the final image where silence becomes "a beginning rather than an end." However, the phrase itself is repeated rather than embodied through action, and some emotional moments lean toward label ("the familiar ache") rather than contradictory impulse. Coherent and purposeful but somewhat told rather than shown under peak pressure.</comment>
