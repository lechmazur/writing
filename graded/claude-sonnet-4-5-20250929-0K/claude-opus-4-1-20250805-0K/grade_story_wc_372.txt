<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently maintained through her methodical approach to the crisis, but her emotional arc lacks embodied contradiction—she moves from duty to vow without meaningful internal friction. The protagonist's final promise feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that test competing values. Her "gently meticulous" care is told through exposition ("For three centuries, she had maintained these archives") rather than shown through contradictory impulses under the immediate pressure of the vault's collapse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: library failing → measure/preserve → discover founder's vow → make new promise. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elara's vow to begin again—lands on the page with visible cost (the library's destruction, her acceptance of survival over total preservation), though the final image's reweighting feels slightly abstracted. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the founder's slide, which reconfigures her understanding of preservation itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline spires, breath crystallizing, ice cracking underfoot), and the vault's failing magic directly constrains Elara's choices—she can save only fifty slides. The quartz hush and luminous slides create a coherent atmosphere. However, the setting's physical mechanics (how a structure "hangs suspended" in clouds, how warmth "seeps from walls like blood from stone") remain metaphorical rather than tactile, and spatial choreography within the vault is generic. The final image of the library falling "in perfect silence" charges closure effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve humanity's most sacred promises before the library collapses—is signaled immediately and tightens through the protagonist's measurement work. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Elara discovers the founder's slide, which forces a choice between completing her triage and understanding the archive's original purpose. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency (her vow to begin again) with visible cost: she accepts the library's destruction and her own survival as the seed of a new archive, foreclosing the path of total preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central question of which promises matter most and whether preservation itself can be a luminous vow. The discovery of the founder's slide—"I vow to remember them all"—provides a non-literal answer that reweights Elara's triage work. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement: "some promises transcend even their keeping" reads as authorial thesis rather than earned image. The "gentle, meticulous light" callback attempts resonance but feels decorative rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, with Elara's perceptual signature maintained through her archival lexicon ("luminous vows," "quartz hush," "frequencies of light"). Psychic distance remains consistent; her interior voice blends scholarly precision with quiet emotion. Two instances of elevated register slightly jar: "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and "defying oblivion with their gentle, meticulous light" feel more like prompt language than character thought. No dialogue appears, so subtext is carried through gesture and image effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose clarity is strong with purposeful rhythm variation, but several loops and stock phrasings accumulate. "Luminous vow(s)" appears six times, becoming decorative rather than charged. Template cadence: "She began... She moved... She could save... Her fingers..." creates mechanical progression. The metaphor "warmth seeping from walls like blood from stone" is evocative but mixed (blood doesn't seep *from* stone; stone *holds* blood). Stock phrasing: "breath crystallized instantly," "ice cracking beneath her feet." The final paragraph's "gentle, meticulous light" nearly paraphrases the opening's "gently meticulous care" without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—archivist must triage dying promises in a collapsing magical library—offers a fresh synthesis of custody and mortality. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: the protagonist discovers a transformative artifact at the crucial moment, which provides both emotional catharsis and a path forward. The founder's slide functions as a deus ex machina that solves Elara's moral dilemma (how to choose which vows matter) by redefining the task as continuation rather than selection. The emotional truth of letting go is present, but the framing feels designed to satisfy prompt elements rather than follow character logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara as orderly records chief drives the central action: her methodical triage, her decision to measure rather than randomly select, her choice to load the founder's slide into the projection alcove, and her final vow to begin again. The trait shapes at least three beats and her professional identity directly enables the plot's mechanics. However, "orderly" itself is more demonstrated through the measurement work than through a specific choice where disorder would have been an alternative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magic lantern slides anchor the story's mechanics from the opening vault description through the measurement sequence to the climactic projection of the founder's vow. They appear in at least four distinct beats: initial description, the sampling work, the discovery of the unlabeled slide, and the projection that fills the vault with warmth. The slides' dual function—as preserved vows and as objects whose physical degradation creates the time pressure—makes them structurally indispensable. Removing them would collapse both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape the story's stakes (which promises burn brightest) and tactics (Elara's frequency-sampling method). The concept generates the central moral question—how to measure the intensity of a dying promise—and recurs through the measurement sequence and the founder's meta-vow. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we never see *how* a vow's luminosity constrains a choice on the page beyond Elara's triage decisions, which feel more like sorting than genuine friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is asserted in the opening ("she had maintained these archives with gently meticulous care") and echoed in the final image ("gentle, meticulous light"), but it constrains no on-page action with visible cost. Elara's measurement work could be performed with equal efficiency by a character who is brusque or hasty. The attribute is label-only; we do not see a moment where gentleness costs her speed or meticulousness prevents a bolder choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The act of measuring—sampling frequencies, using calipers and prism—drives the middle sequence and establishes Elara's method for determining which vows to save. It creates the material for the discovery beat (the unmeasurable founder's slide) and justifies her professional authority. Two beats depend on it: the triage sequence and the moment when her instruments fail to gauge the founder's vow. However, the measurement itself could be replaced with another form of professional judgment (reading inscriptions, testing magical resonance) without fundamentally altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is signaled early ("She had developed a method over the years, sampling frequencies of light") and demonstrated through the artist's 6.3 reading, the father's 7.1, the child's 9.7. The method's mechanics—calipers, prism, numeric scale—shape Elara's triage work and create the payoff when the founder's slide exceeds measurement. However, the method is more a flavor detail than a constraint; no beat turns on the *specific* mechanics of frequency sampling versus another form of magical assessment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen library supplies both the time pressure (failing magic, warmth seeping in, ice cracking) and the resource constraint (only fifty slides can be saved). Its physical state—groaning structure, fading cold—directly tightens the protagonist's window for action. The library's descent through clouds charges the final image and the setting's unique properties (suspended above clouds, sustained by cold) are indispensable to the plot. Removing this exact setting would require fundamental rewrites to stakes and mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "while illusions fade to memory" is signaled in the opening ("Already, the older slides at the vault's edges flickered, their captured vows dissolving as warmth crept in") and recurs as Elara works ("Hours dissolved as she worked, the library groaning around her"). The degradation creates urgency and tightens her triage window. However, the time pressure is more atmospheric than tactical—no beat shows her forced to abandon a task mid-action because a slide faded, and "hours dissolved" abstracts the clock rather than making it felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is presented as the founder's original vow and adopted by Elara in her final promise to "begin again." It frames the thematic question but is not dramatized through conflicting desires on the page—Elara never considers abandoning the archive or saving herself without the slides. The phrase itself appears verbatim ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") as prompt language rather than earned character thought, reducing its integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" appears three times: opening description ("the quartz hush that filled every corner"), Elara's whisper ("into the quartz hush"), and the final image ("a quartz hush that would echo in Elara's dreams forever"). The tone is coherent—crystalline, silent, reverent—and modulates slightly under pressure (the founder's projection disrupts it with warmth and light). The recurring phrase charges the ending by recalling the opening, though the exact meaning of "quartz hush" remains more evocative than specific. The tone does not constrain a choice but does color the closure image meaningfully.</comment>
