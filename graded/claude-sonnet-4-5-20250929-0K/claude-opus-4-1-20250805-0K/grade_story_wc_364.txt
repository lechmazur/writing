<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Korin's interior texture is present but abstract—"meekness wasn't weakness but a form of listening" names rather than dramatizes the contradiction. His motivations (returning bartered consciousness) arrive through summary rather than conflicted micro-choices. The merchant's recognition floods in without prior dramatization of his emptiness, making the closure beat feel stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the silk's revelation, the descent, and the forging sequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the merchant's recognition, but cost remains abstract—"memories of dreams he'd sold" is told rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The silk guides descent conveniently without prior constraint. Orientation anchors early; one meaningful deepening occurs in the chamber, but the final beat relies on exposition rather than image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating arches and orchard planet provide a vivid frame; cherry blossoms falling upward charges the final image. The mine shafts supply access but their mechanics ("reality grew thin") remain vague. Spatial choreography is clean. The anvil of floating stone participates in the forging beat, and the twin suns are noticed. The setting pressures one choice (descent) and recurs at closure, meeting the 9+ test partially, but the world rules lack specificity when they matter most.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (forging a blade from the silk to restore bartered awakenings). One meaningful tightening occurs when Korin discovers the silk's true nature in the chamber. However, escalation is largely internal summary—"Hours passed, or perhaps days"—and the forging sequence avoids concrete obstacles. The merchant's trembling recognition provides a reversal, but it occurs without prior friction or cost legible on the page. Agency reads as intention rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (bartered awakenings, resilience from loss) emerges from the silk's backstory and the final exchange. The closing image—cherry blossoms falling upward—offers a non-literal answer to defying gravity and reclaiming what was traded. However, the merchant's epiphany is stated ("Recognition flooded his face") rather than shown through a concrete micro-choice. "This world teaches us that falling isn't failure" borders on thematic summary. The blade as metaphor for liberation is purposeful but resolved too tidily without lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Korin; perceptual signature is present in "metal remembered everything" and selective attention to the silk's shimmer. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Cut only what binds. Never what connects"). Psychic distance is controlled. However, elevated diction ("azure defiance," "bartered awakenings") recurs in narration where it reads more as thematic overlay than Korin's internal lexicon. Filter verbs ("recognized," "knew") are present but not excessive. Rhythm modulates with pressure in the descent sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong; sentence openings vary. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "between understanding and confusion" appears twice as both setting detail and abstraction; "bartered awakenings" recurs as label without added texture. "Deliberate precision," "deliberate reconstruction," "deliberate redemptions" form a template cadence across beats (−0.5). Figurative density is high ("colors that shouldn't exist," "silk defied reason," "blade sang with azure defiance") without pattern-teaching, blurring peak moments (−0.4). "Cherry blossoms fell upward" is a strong closing image. Information density is adequate but hampered by scaffold phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating stone arches and the concept of woven-dream silk offer fresh specificity. The transformation of exhaustion into a blade of awakening is a purposeful synthesis. However, the core arc—humble craftsman restores what was lost—follows a familiar template without sharp moral calculus or counter-readings. The merchant's instant recognition and Korin's effortless mastery avoid genuine struggle. "Azure defiance" and "bartered awakenings" read as prompt-adjacent labels rather than emerged particulars. Risk-taking is moderate; the story commits to its premise but retreats from complicating Korin's meekness with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Korin is present throughout and makes two choices: accepting the silk and descending to forge. However, both decisions feel inevitable rather than conflicted; no on-page moment shows him weighing a cost or trading off a competing value. His meekness is labeled rather than demonstrated through a tactical constraint. He drives the forging sequence but does not face a reversal that tests his commitment. Present in closure via the exchange with the merchant, but his role there is instructional rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The silk appears in three beats: arrival/recognition, descent guidance, and transformation into the blade's core. Its mechanics (woven from forgotten dreams) reweight meaning across the arc. It enables the descent and forging, shaping tactics. Present in closure as the blade's essence, charging the merchant's recognition. Early signal, mid-scene use, and closure linkage all present. Causal pressure is moderate—it guides rather than constrains. Swappability is low; another material would lack the dream-thread specificity. Cost connection is implied (exhaustion made tangible) but not dramatized through a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" frames the premise (consciousness traded for power) and recurs as thematic label. It shapes the dominant stake (restoring what was traded) and appears in the title-like final paragraph. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page scene shows someone bartering sleep or Korin grappling with the mechanics of reversal. The concept anchors theme but does not constrain a tactical choice or create visible friction. Present in closure as explanation, but the blade's effect on the merchant is asserted, not shown through a micro-choice that costs him something on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" is present as label ("meek," "quiet determination") and surfaces in Korin's measured hammer strikes and patient work. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—his meekness never forces him to choose between speaking up and staying silent, or between aggression and patience under pressure. The trait is described rather than tested. It colors tone but does not drive a key turn. Mid-range at best for label-only presence without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Deliberate" recurs as descriptive tag ("deliberate precision," "deliberate reconstruction," "deliberate redemptions") across the forging and closure. It characterizes Korin's method and modulates tone. However, no single action is named "deliberate" that redefines options or creates a reversal—it functions as adverbial flavor rather than a distinct plot move. The forging sequence is deliberate in manner but could be described as "careful" or "purposeful" with minor edits. Early presence, thematic coherence, but swappability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mine shafts are signaled early ("abandoned mine shafts beneath his forge"), enable the descent and forging in the chamber where reality grows thin, and supply the world's memory-ore backstory. They provide access and atmosphere, shaping one key turn (the decision to descend). Present in setup, middle, and implicit in closure (the work done there). However, their mechanics remain vague—why must he go down? No on-page obstacle (cave-in, lost tool, rival) tests the method. Causal role is functional but replaceable with another hidden workshop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and orchard planet appear in opening, middle (twin suns, mine shafts carved for levitation ore), and closing image (cherry blossoms falling upward). The setting supplies the silk's impossible properties and the world's defiance of gravity, anchoring the theme. Micro-setting (the anvil of floating stone) participates in forging. However, the arches do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—they frame action rather than pressure it. Closure linkage is strong (final image), but causal pressure is atmospheric rather than mechanical. Early signal, thematic coherence, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" appears as both the story's temporal anchor (a moment of possibility) and a recurring phrase. However, it names a psychological state rather than a ticking clock or deadline that alters tactics. "Hours passed, or perhaps days" explicitly suspends time rather than tightening it. The merchant's arrival at dawn and return at sunset provide bookends but do not pressure Korin's choices. The timeframe is ornamental abstraction rather than a constraint that forces rushed work or a trade-off. Late clarity on its meaning, no middle involvement, vague closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To coax resilience from rubble" is stated as Korin's method and recurs in the final paragraph. It shapes the dominant stake (restoring what was lost) and is present in the forging sequence (transforming silk/exhaustion into a blade). However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page beat shows Korin failing at coaxing, weighing the cost of persistence, or choosing resilience over an easier path. The motivation colors theme but does not create friction between want and obstacle. Present in setup (implied), development (forging), and closure (summary), but without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" appears once as a descriptor for the blade's song and recurs implicitly in the upward-falling blossoms and the theme of defying traded losses. Tone reads as wonder and quiet determination rather than defiance in earlier beats; the shift to "defiance" at closure feels sudden rather than modulated. The term is ornamental and could be replaced with "quiet rebellion" or "stubborn hope" without structural change. Present in closure but absent in setup and middle development. Swappability is high; the tone label does not constrain voice or charge the final image distinctly.</comment>
