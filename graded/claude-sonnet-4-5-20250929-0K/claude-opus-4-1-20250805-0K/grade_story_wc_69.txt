<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maestro Chen's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, especially in the opening reflection on "subtracting noise" versus listening. The students arrive with clear individual motivations (Marcus's djembe, Yuki's shamisen, Dmitri's accordion), though their on-page choices after arrival feel more like cooperative execution than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation—wrapping the zither but leaving the rosette exposed—is earned by the evening's proof, though the cost feels more symbolic than visceral. Emotional embodiment is strong in the opening third but thins during the group session, where the prose tells us they "found all five modes" rather than dramatizing the friction of that search.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the gathering of students and instruments builds density toward a pattern-break realization that the art continues through them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Chen accepts retirement and storage but recognizes continuation, forecloses institutional hope, and the final image of dispersing students "humming five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized" reweights the opening premise with felt cost. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The cost—retirement, program dissolution, zither into storage—is stated and felt, though the actual search for the missing modes is compressed into summary ("By evening, they had found all five modes") rather than on-page friction, which slightly softens the escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet library is rendered with selective, purposeful detail: sound absorption, lamplight, the security guard's arrival. The zither's mother-of-pearl rosette with five cranes is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (traced, played, wrapped), and charges the final image when left exposed. The autumn setting recurs as a metaphor anchored in concrete perception ("autumn leaves absorb rain," "autumn air holds the memory of summer") and the timeframe (nine PM closing) subtly tightens the session. Spatial choreography is clear: students enter, set down instruments, and later pack up. The micro-setting (rosette, instruments, library acoustics) constrains and enables choices, particularly the final decision to pass the zither between them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the vanishing art and Chen's teaching legacy—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when the students arrive to learn the modes. The accumulative gathering (one by one, diverse instruments) deepens pressure through density, and the turn comes when they find all five modes together, reweighting Chen's assumption that she alone held the knowledge. The final choice (give them the zither, let it denote continuation) forecloses institutional preservation in favor of living practice, with visible cost: retirement, storage, program end. The "finding all five modes" moment is told rather than shown with friction, which slightly lowers escalation legibility, but the cost at closure is unmistakable and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—arts vanish when people stop gathering, not when institutions abandon them—emerges organically from the accumulative evening and avoids didactic summary until the final reflection, which earns its brief statement through prior scene work. The zither rosette recurs with shifting meaning: grandfather's tradition, five lost modes, then a symbol of continuation when left exposed. The "by subtracting noise" method is demonstrated through teaching (listening first, adding only what serves) and connects to the unlearning-hatred arc, though the forty-year backstory compresses a lot into reflection. The final image—students humming five modes that "somehow, impossibly, harmonized"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries: the music is not authentic Chinese but something new, transformed, and that complexity is acknowledged on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Chen; no head-hopping. The opening sentence ("The velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain, and Maestro Chen sat expectantly resigned") establishes a distinct voice: lyric compression, metaphor rooted in naturalism, syntactic control. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during Chen's tracing of the rosette, slightly wider during the group session to accommodate the ensemble. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Marcus's "We came to learn the five modes" and Yuki's "We'll find the others together" carry goal-driven intent and advance plot. The prose occasionally drifts toward summary ("They were not recreating authentic Chinese music. Chen knew this.") where a more immediate perception would tighten voice, but the perceptual signature—selective, weighted toward sound and heritage—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: the opening long compound gives way to shorter beats during the students' arrival. Information density is high in the first third (zither history, teaching method, program closure compressed efficiently), though the middle section summarizes key action ("By evening, they had found all five modes") rather than showing friction. One paraphrase-loop touch: "They were not recreating authentic Chinese music. Chen knew this. They were creating something new from something vanishing..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). The metaphoric throughline (autumn, absorption, transformation) is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding mixed vehicles. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final image—"humming five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized"—lands cleanly and charges prior material, though "impossibly" slightly over-signals the effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—last gathering before a program ends, students preserve a vanishing art by transforming it—is familiar but executed with specific grounding: the five-crane rosette, the "subtracting noise" pedagogy, the forty-year unlearning-hatred arc. The choice to have students find the missing modes together rather than Chen teaching them is a fresh inflection that grows from her method. The piece avoids the safety middle: Chen gives away the zither, accepts institutional defeat, and the music is explicitly not authentic. The autumn-as-transformation metaphor recurs throughout and feels organic rather than imposed. The emotional truth—grief at closure tempered by proof of continuation—reads as specific rather than generic, though the students' quick success in finding all five modes by evening feels slightly convenient and undercuts the "vanishing" premise's difficulty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maestro Chen is present throughout and makes the key closure choice (give them the zither, let it denote continuation), which alters tactics from preservation-through-storage to continuation-through-practice. Setup is early (paragraph one); she demonstrates modes, teaches listening, and at the end wraps the zither but leaves the rosette exposed. The choice forecloses institutional hope with visible cost (retirement, storage). However, the middle section compresses her teaching into summary ("Chen demonstrated the first mode..."), and the students' rapid success in finding all five modes reduces friction. The character drives closure but the escalation beats feel more cooperative than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in paragraph two (early setup), is traced physically, described with specificity (mother-of-pearl, five cranes, five modes), played across the session, and returns at closure when Chen wraps the zither but leaves the rosette exposed to "denote not what was lost, but what continues." The rosette's five cranes directly enable the plot (finding the five modes) and charge the final image. It appears in at least three distinct beats: opening reflection, the playing session, the wrapping decision. The object is causally indispensable: without the five-mode structure, the students' search has no goal and the closure image loses specificity. The rosette is irreplaceable and its reweighted meaning (loss → continuation) anchors the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is signaled in paragraph one ("The vanishing arts...vanish by subtracting noise until only silence remains") and shapes the dominant stake: preserving the five modes before the program ends. The concept constrains Chen's choices (teach now or lose the knowledge) and reappears at closure when the piece redefines vanishing: "the arts vanish not when institutions abandon them, but when people stop gathering to practice them." The middle demonstrates the concept through action (diverse instruments braiding into harmony), though the ease of finding all five modes by evening slightly undercuts the "vanishing" difficulty. The concept drives two beats (opening reflection, closure realization) and is essential to the thematic turn, but the mechanics of vanishing—why these modes were hard to find—remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears in the opening sentence and recurs near the end ("expectantly resigned but no longer bitter"). The trait constrains Chen's opening posture—she traces the zither knowing it will go into storage, not fighting the closure—and enables the final acceptance with visible cost. However, the trait is more label-summary than embodied contradiction: we are told she is resigned and expectant, but on-page actions during the session (demonstrating modes, teaching) do not show the trait under pressure. The attribute frames the arc but does not visibly constrain a middle choice or create tradeoff friction. It appears in two beats (opening, pre-closure reflection) and supports closure tonally, but the mechanics of how expectancy and resignation act simultaneously are not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The action "denote" is seeded early (the rosette "denoting" five modes), becomes explicit method in the middle ("Each student who arrived brought another thread"), and pivots the closure: Chen tells them to let the zither "denote not what was lost, but what continues." The verb shapes the thematic turn—from static symbol to living practice—and charges the final image. The action is irreplaceable: swapping "denote" for "represent" or "symbolize" would flatten the specificity of the rosette's five cranes and the students' search. It appears in at least three beats (rosette description, teaching method, final instruction) and the closure image depends on the reweighted meaning. The cost is conceptual but legible: institutional preservation is foreclosed in favor of dispersed continuation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method "by subtracting noise" is introduced in paragraph one, defined in paragraph four ("removing the static of prejudice, fear, and assumption"), demonstrated during the session ("Chen taught them to listen first, add only what served the whole"), and implicitly present at closure when the students harmonize. The method shapes the teaching approach and enables the group's success in finding the modes. However, the mechanics are more told than shown: we do not see on-page friction where noise is identified and subtracted, only the summary result. The method appears in three beats (opening, teaching explanation, session summary) and is causally necessary to the premise, but the execution compresses demonstration into summary, reducing its pressure-shaping visibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library is anchored early (paragraph one) with specific detail (sound absorption, velvet, reading room, security guard arrival at nine). Autumn appears as metaphor and seasonal marker throughout. The setting enables the gathering (a closing space, a final session) and the nine PM deadline subtly tightens the session's end. The library's acoustics ("absorbed sound," "velvet library returned to its traveled stillness") charge the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics under pressure; it provides atmosphere and a closing clock but remains primarily backdrop. The setting appears in four beats (opening, middle, security guard, closure) and supports tone and closure resonance, but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across unlearning hatred" is compressed into a single reflective sentence in paragraph four ("across decades of unlearning hatred—first her grandfather's...then her own...then her students'"). The forty-year span is mentioned but not dramatized; the on-page session spans one autumn afternoon to nine PM. The backstory primes Chen's teaching philosophy (subtracting noise = removing prejudice) and implicitly justifies her method, but the unlearning itself is told, not shown in present choices. The timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions during the session; the security guard's arrival provides the only live deadline. The element appears in two beats (backstory reflection, implicit in closure philosophy) and supports theme, but does not constrain present action or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is signaled in paragraph two ("braiding diverse voices into harmony"), demonstrated through the teaching method (listen first, add what serves), and fulfilled at closure when the students harmonize five modes. The desire drives Chen's forty-year career, her decision to hold this final gathering, and her choice to give them the zither so they can continue. The motivation faces friction: the program is ending, the modes are incomplete, and she doubts her own knowledge ("I can only play three of them"). The cost is visible—retirement, storage, institutional defeat—but the success comes quickly (by evening, all five modes found), slightly reducing the want-versus-obstacle tension. The motivation shapes three beats (opening reflection, session teaching, closure choice) and is essential to the arc, with felt cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone "traveled stillness" appears explicitly twice ("velvet library became something unprecedented" disrupts stillness mid-session, then "returned to its traveled stillness" at closure) and is evoked throughout via sound absorption, accumulated journeys (instruments "traveled through cultures"), and the quiet accumulation of voices. The tone modulates purposefully: stillness at opening (Chen alone), disruption during the session (music fills the space), return to stillness at closure (library empty, students dispersing). The final image—students humming in harmony as they disperse—sustains the tone's stillness-within-motion paradox. The tone is voice-consistent, charges the closure image, and reflects the thematic arc (preservation through dispersal). It does not constrain a choice but defines the emotional texture and supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
