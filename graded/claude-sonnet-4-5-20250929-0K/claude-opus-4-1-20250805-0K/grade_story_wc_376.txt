<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's gift – trembling hands, blurred vision, ink refusal near dishonesty – is concrete and embodied, driving her isolation and her decision to transcribe all the crystallized messages despite knowing it will "dissolve" the city's peace. The final choice to deliver every truth carries visible cost (watching the greenhouse city's peace wilt) and is earned by the grandmother's letter revelation. Minor slip: the attribute "wilts near dishonesty" appears only as a label in the final paragraph without prior on-page demonstration of this specific metaphor, though the physical symptoms are well-established earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: zinc fragment → map reconstruction → junction seven → crystallized messages → grandmother's letter → decision to transcribe and deliver all truths. Orientation anchors (Vera, workshop, greenhouse city, post-oasis) land within the first 100 words. Closure is Decisive Change: Vera moves from solitary truth-teller to active distributor of suppressed truths, with visible cost ("watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve"). The water-diversion revelation reweights the entire premise and her grandmother's suicide, charging the final image with conceptual and social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky, breathing leaves as communication medium, maintenance tunnel "sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret," and crystallized messages in the dead zones create a coherent micro-ecology that constrains every choice. The ventilation system and temperature differential at the toxic barrier are not mere backdrop but enable the story's central mechanism (trapped sound crystallizing). The breathing leaves return at closure, anchoring Vera's transcription work and charging the final image with the wilting/truth trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding grandmother's letter and learning why it never arrived) is signaled early and tightens through the map reconstruction, junction discovery, and water-diversion revelation. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Vera chooses to follow the map despite danger, then chooses to transcribe and deliver all suppressed truths despite knowing the social cost. The water conspiracy revelation narrows options from personal mystery to civic reckoning, and the final decision to deliver every message forecloses the path of complicit silence with on-page cost ("watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: truth as dangerous water that "always finds its way," the dead zones between safety and poison as repositories of honesty, filtered truths versus breathing leaves. The grandmother's crystallized letter reweights the oasis's disappearance from natural disaster to engineered inequality, and Vera's final choice ("some truths were worth wilting for") answers the thematic question through action rather than statement. The breathing-leaf motif accumulates meaning: living tissue for truth-telling, then the wilting metaphor charging the closure without becoming a sermon. Minor: "dead zones... had always been where the most important words went to wait" edges toward thesis statement but remains grounded in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; Vera's perceptual signature (gold-tipped brush, truth-sensing embodiment, calligrapher's lens) filters all details consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during fragment examination, slightly wider during backstory about the oasis). Minor slips: "the most trusted calligrapher in New Arborem, but also the loneliest" tells rather than shows the isolation cost; "peculiar" is generic characterization. The phrase "people preferred their truths filtered, softened, made palatable" reads slightly elevated for in-scene thought but stays within a literate calligrapher's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density and momentum through most beats. Figurative language is purposeful ("morning condensation on glass," "dead zones between safety and poison"). Minor artifact cluster in final paragraph: "carefully maintained peace dissolve like morning condensation on glass" and "dead zones... had always been where the most important words went to wait" both lean slightly abstract-philosophical in a high-pressure closure beat, diluting immediacy by ~−0.3. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence variety supports rhythm without sluggishness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of truth-detection gift, living-leaf communication, and crystallized sound waves in dead zones is specific and non-obvious. The water-conspiracy revelation transforms the oasis premise from climate disaster to political suppression, adding moral calculus. The ending commits fully to its premise (delivering all truths despite social cost) without hedging. Slight familiarity: truth-teller in corrupt society and greenhouse-dystopia elements are well-worn; transformation comes through the crystallized-sound mechanism and the breathing-leaf/wilting synthesis, which feel fresh enough to avoid derivative penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices drive all major turns: reconstructing the map, following it to junction seven, and deciding to transcribe and deliver all crystallized messages. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (map reconstruction and journey), and payoff (transcription decision at closure). Her calligrapher identity and truth-sensing gift shape tactics throughout and charge the final image with the wilting/truth trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in beat one (discovery), beat two (reconstruction revealing cartographic map and confessions), and is causally active at closure (the map leads to grandmother's letter, which triggers the final decision). Its specific properties (metal's resistance to decay, etching style) enable the entire plot. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is embodied in the crystallized messages ("Where did you hide her letters?" at junction seven) and drives the grandmother's confession. The concept shapes Vera's stakes (finding suppressed truths) and tactics (following the map to dead zones). Present in development (fragments of conversations marked at junctions) and payoff (transcribing every "moment of candor"), though not signaled as the dominant frame in setup. The final image reweights it: small truths accumulated have civic-scale consequences.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attribute "wilts near dishonesty" appears only as a label in the final paragraph ("some truths were worth wilting for") without prior on-page demonstration of Vera or the leaves wilting. The established trait is hands trembling, vision blurring, and ink refusing to flow near lies, which does constrain her work and establish her isolation, but the wilting metaphor itself is introduced late and not causally tested. Mid-band for partial integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rereading occurs in three distinct beats: Vera rereads recovered phrases "three times" (her gift confirming authenticity), she reads the grandmother's crystallized letter, and she begins transcribing every message (implicitly re-reading to copy). The action enables the major turn (water-diversion revelation) and shapes the closure decision. Specificity matters: her truth-sensing gift requires multiple readings, making this action irreplaceable rather than generic examination.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Piecing together shredded fragments is signaled early (second paragraph: "dozens of pieces, deliberately shredded"), drives the middle beat ("spent the night piecing them together"), and its result (the ventilation-system map with timestamps and confessions) enables the entire journey to junction seven and the grandmother's letter discovery. The method's mechanics matter: metal fragments resist decay, and the cartographic style is recognizable. Removing this exact method would require a different inciting mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky constrains every move: breathing masks required in maintenance tunnels, living leaves as sole communication medium (paper too precious), pneumatic tubes abandoned when electronics failed, temperature differential at the toxic barrier enabling crystallization. Setting is present in setup (glass domes, breathing leaves), development (ventilation system, maintenance tunnel), and payoff (Vera's workshop with breathing leaves, the dead zones metaphor charging the closure). The toxic-sky boundary is causally active, not decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the oasis dries" is established in paragraph three ("the oasis dried three months ago") and tightens stakes: old postal routes are gone, runners lost, water scarcity drives social tension. The grandmother's revelation that the oasis was diverted (not dried) reweights the timeframe's meaning at closure. Present in setup and payoff, with some development pressure (Vera's search for the final letter that never arrived). Not a live ticking clock, but a state change that enables the suppressed-message premise and charges the water-diversion reveal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to find where lost conversations go is signaled early (searching for grandmother's final letter), drives the middle journey (following the map to junction seven to find "thousands of crystallized messages"), and is answered and transformed at closure (she will deliver them all, making lost conversations found). Friction between want (personal letter) and discovered cost (civic unrest from mass truth-delivery) is on-page in the final paragraph. The motivation is dramatized through choices, not merely told.</comment>
