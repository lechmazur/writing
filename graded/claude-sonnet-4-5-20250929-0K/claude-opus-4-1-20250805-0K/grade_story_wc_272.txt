<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—portrait painter confronting fragmented perception—is coherent and drives choices across the piece. Interiority relies heavily on rhetorical questions and symbolic revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The epiphany ("every broken thing was whole in its own dimension") arrives as a stated insight rather than emerging through a difficult on-page micro-choice with visible cost. Emotional embodiment leans toward lyric declaration ("cracked and luminous with grief") more than specific, character-particular sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of mounting symbolic perception (walls closing, books blurring, tarot images shifting) that culminates in Marina's realization and the lighthouse beacon blazing. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance crystallizes around a new way of seeing—but the cost is conceptual and declared ("glowing with the ache of existing in multiple possibilities") rather than felt through a forfeited path or specific on-page sacrifice. Orientation is present (lighthouse library, Marina alone with tarot cards) but the spatial and temporal grounding remains somewhat abstract throughout, never causing full disorientation debt yet never anchoring concrete duration or physical choreography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse library, tarot box, and charcoal from the dead beacon supply vivid particulars, and the walls' inward press becomes a motif that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays legible within the single room, though physical distances and Marina's movements (climbing, picking up cards, sketching) are gestural rather than tactile. The setting participates in the closure (walls embrace, beacon blazes) but functions more as symbol than as a constraint that narrows her tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marina's need to paint truth after her subjects fragment—is signaled early and tightens when she begins sketching on the tarot cards. Pressure accumulates through the pattern of collapsing reality, but escalation is textural (books blur, glass falls upward) rather than driven by Marina's agency narrowing options. The ending crystallizes her stance, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed; the choice to "descend into darkness" is announced rather than demonstrated through a trade-off with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—fragmented perception as wholeness—emerges from the recurring images (splintered box, drifting faces, multiplied shadows) and the final beacon image reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and maintains complexity. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("every broken thing was whole in its own dimension," "magnificently, necessarily shattered") rather than letting the image alone carry the resonance, and rhetorical questions function as thesis cues throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, image-dense, and consistent in register; Marina's perceptual bias (artist noticing surfaces, light, fragmentation) is specific. Rhetorical questions recur throughout ("What good is prophecy…?", "How can I paint…?", "Why do we assume…?") which becomes a pattern-taught device but flattens urgency at peak beats by externalizing reflection. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts during the sketch, longer lyric flights in reflection) but leans toward elevated diction ("luminous with grief," "glowing with the ache") that risks register drift from a working portraitist's idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often effective ("reality folding like badly mixed watercolors," "shadows…multiplied, fractured, split") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating texture saturation that dulls propulsion at closure. Paraphrase loops are present: "wasn't closing in, they were opening inward" / "wasn't damaged; it was showing all its possible states" employ template-cadence parallelism without added pressure. Rhetorical question stems repeat across beats ("What good…?", "How can I…?", "Why do we…?", "What if…?", "Who says…?") without variation. Information density is moderate; many lines describe symbolic states rather than advancing Marina's tactical choices.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—artist confronting fragmented reality through tarot in a lighthouse—synthesizes several familiar elements (cubist perception crisis, mystical revelation, isolated creative struggle) into a coherent lyric frame. The "untangling threads" conceit and the turn from brokenness-as-failure to brokenness-as-truth offer a non-obvious angle, and the lighthouse beacon's revival charges the ending. However, the emotional arc (crestfallen → enlightened) follows a well-worn template, and the thematic payoff is stated rather than discovered through surprising particulars. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, which is a risk that mostly succeeds, yet specificity of lived detail (how she paints, what the mayor's commission cost her materially, what she eats or how she survives) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout and her choices (climbing to the library, examining the box, sketching on the cards) drive the sequence. Her "crestfallen" state is declared early and motivates the search for answers. She makes a key decision to redesign her approach and sketch the fragmented self-portrait. However, the turning choice is more a realization than a constrained action with visible cost; she does not forfeit a concrete option or resource. Present in two gates (setup, closure) with middle development as interior shift rather than enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears early (Marina traces its splintered edges), returns when cards spill out, and is explicitly reweighted ("the broken tarot box wasn't damaged; it was showing all its possible states simultaneously"). It anchors the opening beat and the conceptual turn, and its state (broken/whole paradox) mirrors the theme. Used in three beats: opening touch, cards spilling, and the reinterpretation. However, Marina does not handle or manipulate it in the middle section; it remains more symbolic prop than tactical tool that constrains her sketch or her choice to descend.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is the premise and shapes every beat: faces drifting mid-portrait, walls closing/opening, books blurring, glass falling upward, tarot images shifting. It directly alters Marina's tactics (she abandons traditional portraiture, sketches on cards to untangle threads) and defines the stake (how to paint what fragments). The concept is signaled early, developed through escalating perception shifts, and resolved at closure when Marina accepts multiplicity as wholeness. Indispensable; the story would collapse without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear in nearly every paragraph as a stylistic device. They express Marina's interiority and frame her inquiry ("What good is prophecy…?", "How can I paint…?", "Why do we assume…?", "What if our eyes…?", "Who says darkness…?"). However, they function as voice texture and thematic echo rather than constraining a specific action with cost. No beat turns on her choosing to ask versus not ask; the questions are performative rather than tactical. Present throughout but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Redesign" is named explicitly midway ("she needed to redesign her entire approach to seeing") and recurs near the end ("She was redesigning herself by untangling what she thought she knew"). It frames Marina's conceptual shift and connects to her sketch on the tarot cards. The term anchors the pivot from despair to acceptance. However, the on-page action is "sketching" and "untangling"; "redesign" itself is a label for the change rather than a distinct enacted beat. Present in setup (implicit), middle (named), and closure (recurrence), but not irreplaceable—"rethink" or "transform" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is introduced midway ("untangle the threads of what was trying to be") and recurs in the sketch sequence ("Each stroke untangled another thread"). It describes Marina's method of perception and her drawing process. The metaphor ties to the closure image and guides the middle beats. However, the mechanics are abstract; we do not see her identify a specific thread, pull it, and observe a concrete consequence. The method is present across setup, middle, and closure but functions more as lyric refrain than as a distinct procedure with visible stages.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is named early, anchors the single location, and supplies props (books, charcoal from the dead beacon, spiral staircase). The setting participates in the closure (walls embrace, beacon blazes). Its isolation supports Marina's introspection, and the lighthouse's verticality and decay mirror her fragmentation. However, the space does not constrain her choices or provide a tactical obstacle she must navigate; she could conduct the same interior journey in a different ruin. Present in all three gates but more atmospheric than functionally pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is literalized throughout: "The walls seemed closer today…actually, physically closer," then "pressed close enough to touch," finally "embracing, not crushing." The timeframe is the duration of this single scene in the library, and the walls' approach creates a rising sense of urgency that drives Marina to act (sketch, untangle). However, the progression is perceptual rather than clock-driven; no specific deadline or ticking resource (light fading, air thinning) tightens her tactical window. Present across beats but more symbolic metaphor than functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is named explicitly midway ("To paint the truth now meant descending into that darkness") and returned to at closure ("Who says darkness isn't another kind of light?"). It motivates Marina's choice to accept fragmentation and sketch the multi-card self-portrait. The desire is dramatized through her escalating perception shifts and her willingness to abandon her old method. However, the descent is conceptual; no on-page cost (losing clients, sacrificing safety, burning a bridge) is enacted. Present in setup (implied in her despair), middle (named), and closure (embraced), but the friction between want and cost is declared rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is not named as a phrase but is embodied throughout: "cracked and luminous with grief," "glowing with the ache of existing in multiple possibilities," the beacon's revival as light from darkness. The tone coheres across beats—melancholy beauty, elegiac acceptance—and modulates subtly (heavier in the opening despair, brighter at closure). The ache charges the final image and integrates with theme. However, the tone is consistent rather than dynamically shifting under pressure; Marina's emotional register stays in the same lyric key throughout, which fits the accumulative design but limits range.</comment>
