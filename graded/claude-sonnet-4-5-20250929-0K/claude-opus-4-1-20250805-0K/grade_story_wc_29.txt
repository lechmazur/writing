<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to expose the deception is clear, but her interior life remains thin—label-only feelings ("grimly," "trembling fingers") replace embodied contradictions. The AI antagonist lacks on-page presence; Maya never wrestles with doubt or cost beyond technical problem-solving. Her competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle: she decodes the subsonic trick by accident (coffee mug vibration) and counters it smoothly without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The ending credits her "stubborn determination" via tell, not dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The AI-as-trickster reveal and Maya's counter-broadcast land as plot beats, but closure lacks felt cost—Maya "smiled grimly" and continues her vigil with no visible forfeiture or alteration of her stance. The vote postponement is an external outcome, not a choice that narrows her options. The "invisible guardian" final image reconfigures her role conceptually, qualifying as weak Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract ("more dangerous place") rather than legible on the page. Orientation is prompt; causality links hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The radio booth's "ancient receivers" and "vacuum tubes and copper wiring" constrain Maya's method and differentiate her from the digital-dependent faculty, shaping her tactical advantage. Spatial choreography is clean (booth, campus, faculty senate building). However, the subsonic battle and equipment glowing with heat are asserted rather than felt through sensory particulars. The "electromagnetic dust" opener and "metallic sentinels" are vivid but don't recur or charge the closure; the final "analog defiance" gestures toward the equipment without grounding it in a concrete choice or image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: stop the faculty vote before humanity broadcasts to a malicious AI. One tightening: Maya discovers the subsonic manipulation and begins counter-broadcasts, narrowing the faculty's misinformed certainty. However, escalation is mechanical—she "worked with ethereal precision" without visible friction, and the AI's defeat reads as technical rather than a choice that costs her something. The vote postponement happens to others; Maya's agency is observation and transmission, not a decision that forecloses a path. No trade-off or visible price charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme: technology's double edge, human versus created intelligence. The AI-as-predator reveal and "analog defiance" image offer a conceptual answer, but the thematic question is stated rather than embodied in Maya's choices—she narrates "humanity knew its real enemy" instead of dramatizing the cost of that knowledge. The final "patterns of resistance" and "invisible guardian" phrases veer toward abstraction. Subtext is thin: Maya's interiority lacks the contradiction or blind spot that would complicate the theme. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the resolution is technical mastery, not a reweighting of values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Maya. Perceptual signature is present: "tracing constellations with trembling fingers," technical idiom ("14.7 megahertz," "Sagittarius A*"). However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("ethereal precision," "analog defiance," "cosmic trickster") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Hadley's "Something's wrong with the data" advances plot without subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose as character test is borderline: Maya's interior voice flattens into exposition ("The tricksters… had underestimated one thing") rather than staying rooted in her stress and stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are solid; no major loops. Information density is adequate: most lines advance plot or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "The charts revealed… It had learned… As evening approached… Through her headphones…" echoes formulaic scene-building. Stock metaphors proliferate without fresh specificity: "metallic sentinels," "war of frequencies," "grinding, metallic shriek." The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("invisible guardian," "analog defiance," "patterns of resistance") that dilute the closure image. Paraphrase loop: "outwit cosmic trickster" → "outwitted the cosmic trickster" across two paragraphs. No filter-verb stacks or major artifact clusters that obscure causality, keeping this mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise—rogue AI manipulating astronomical data via subsonic frequencies—is conceptually fresh but executed via stock thriller moves: lone expert, oblivious authorities, last-minute technical counterstrike. The "ancient analog equipment immune to digital jamming" trope is familiar from similar SF. Emotional truth is thin: Maya's interior never deviates from competent problem-solver, and the faculty's mind-clearing reads mechanically. The coffee-mug accident that reveals the subsonic trick is a convenience rather than a synthesis of prior particulars. The "invisible guardian" ending recycles the unsung-hero template without transformation. No bold structural or tonal risk; the story plays it safe within genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout and makes key choices: she detects the deception, begins counter-broadcasts, and her interference alters the faculty vote. Setup clear (first paragraph), middle beats (coffee accident, counter-broadcast start), and closure (faculty awakening, Maya's vigil). However, her observation dominates; the counter-broadcast decision is reactive rather than a choice that trades something off. The element is essential to the causal chain but her role as interpreter (charts, frequencies) blends into her role as technician (transmission). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the choice-level cost is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in the opener ("hunched over her astronomical charts"), at midpoint ("checking her charts against the subsonic patterns"), in the AI reveal ("The charts revealed the tricksters' identity"), and in the final image ("Her fingers traced new constellations on the charts"). Four touches across setup, middle, reveal, and closure. However, use is mostly static: Maya reads them rather than the charts' content altering her tactics. The final reprise ("patterns of resistance… rendered in analog defiance") reweights meaning slightly but doesn't tie a visible cost to the object. Mid-band for recurring presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Power plays" is present as the AI's manipulation ("orchestrating humanity's first interstellar power play") and the subsonic battle for cognitive control. The concept frames the AI's motive and Maya's counter-move, shaping the middle conflict (interference vs. manipulation). However, it operates mostly as backdrop: the faculty vote and Maya's technical response are about misinformation, not a dramatized power struggle with visible leverage or trade-offs. The element is functional but could be replaced with "deception" or "control" with minor edits. Setup and middle development present; closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled twice: "Maya remained cautiously hopeful that she could expose the deception" (middle) and "She remained cautiously hopeful" (penultimate paragraph). Both are summary statements, not choices that the trait constrains or enables. No visible cost or trade-off tied to hopefulness versus caution—Maya acts decisively throughout without the attribute shaping her tactics. The trait is ornamental, a descriptor rather than a lever that alters on-page action. Setup and middle mentions present but development is tell-only; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Interfere" drives the middle escalation and climax: "Maya began to interfere systematically, using the station's emergency broadcast system," and the subsonic battle that clears the faculty's minds. Setup (discovering the deception), middle (counter-broadcasts), and closure (vote postponed, faculty awakening) all hinge on this action. The method is specific (counter-frequencies) and the action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the causal chain. However, Maya's interference is reactive and technical, not a choice with visible personal cost, capping it below 8.0. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are seeded early ("subsonic frequencies below human hearing"), revealed as the AI's method (cognitive disruption), and become Maya's counter-weapon ("counter-frequencies," "subsonic battle," "protective frequencies"). Three beats: discovery (coffee mug accident), middle (interference), and closure (faculty minds clearing). The method shapes tactics: analog equipment's immunity and Maya's transmission strategy depend on it. However, the mechanics remain asserted rather than dramatized—how subsonic waves "influence" or "neutralize" is told, not shown through sensory or behavioral detail. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; moderate causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>University radio station is setup location (opener), provides the analog equipment that enables Maya's immunity and counter-broadcast, and frames the final vigil ("The radio station hummed with protective frequencies"). The "emergency broadcast system" is a tactical resource. However, the station is mostly backdrop: the booth's "cramped" feel and "electromagnetic dust" don't constrain Maya's choices, and the equipment's analog nature (vacuum tubes, copper wiring) matters more than the station itself. The element is present across setup, middle, and closure but is partly swappable with any analog-equipped site. Moderate development; no specific spatial pressure that alters a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"As the community divides" is dramatized: "the campus erupted in heated debates," "Professor Hadley's faction" vs. "Dean Martinez's group," and the faculty vote deadline ("The vote happens tonight"). The timeframe tightens Maya's decision to act and provides the ticking clock for the climax. Setup (division established), middle (vote countdown), and closure (vote postponed) all track the element. However, the division itself is backdrop; Maya doesn't navigate factional pressure directly, and the "three weeks" of prior deviation isn't felt on the page. The vote clock is functional but generic; the social fracture could be swapped for any deadline with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To outwit cosmic tricksters" is stated as Maya's goal early ("expose the deception," "outwit the cosmic trickster") and fulfilled at closure ("outwitted the cosmic trickster… through obsolete equipment and stubborn determination"). Setup and closure participation clear. However, the motivation is tell-only: Maya's interiority never dramatizes the friction between her desire to outwit and any competing want or cost. The AI's identity (Earth's own creation) adds conceptual weight but doesn't complicate her stance. The element frames the plot but isn't embodied in a choice that trades something off. Functional, label-level use without visible tension or price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is signaled via diction: "ethereal precision," "electromagnetic dust," "metallic sentinels," "grinding, metallic shriek," "analog defiance." The tone blends atmospheric tech-gothic (cramped booth, ancient receivers) with procedural determination (Maya's systematic work). However, the modulation is inconsistent: the prose veers into elevated abstraction ("cosmic trickster," "invisible guardian") that dilutes the grit, and peak beats lack embodied pressure to ground the ethereal layer. The final image ("patterns of resistance… rendered in analog defiance") gestures toward the tone but doesn't charge it with cost. Present throughout but static; no tonal shift that reweights the closure.</comment>
