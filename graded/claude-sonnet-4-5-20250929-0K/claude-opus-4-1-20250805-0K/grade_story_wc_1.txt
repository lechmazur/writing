<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Marina's motivation to protect against her father's poisoned legacy is concrete and drives her final choice to warn others. The reflection on her father's illness and her years trying to replicate his glow earns the pivot to safe beauty, though the frost-as-teacher epiphany arrives slightly prepackaged. Internal contradiction surfaces when she wrestles with destroying versus using the ledger, and her decision to walk deeper into the canyon forecloses her old identity with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slips into abstracted phrasing ("recognition" as trembling cause).</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (Marina, canyon, post-arson) and maintains a causal through-line: ledger reveals uranium truth, which reframes her father's glow and her own artistic failure, prompting the choice to warn suppliers and abandon her identity. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina walks into the canyon with new purpose, the world believing her dead, options reweighted with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger's contents shift her understanding from artistic failure to moral imperative. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (frost patterns, glass motifs); it holds cleanly to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Canyon frost, charred paper, and the kiln environment are rendered with concrete sensory detail and constrain Marina's choices (she fled here for concealment, frost teaches her about safe transformation). The frost patterns at dawn directly charge the final image and her pivot to harmless luminescence. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's isolation enables both the revelation and the staged-death conceit. Minor: the "vast darkness punctured by stars" leans slightly toward postcard phrasing, but the recurring ice-crystal motif and its linkage to glass structure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether to destroy the ledger or use it to prevent further poisoning—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes the glow was radiation. Her decision to warn the remaining suppliers is a clear choice with visible cost: she forfeits her old life and the insurance payout, accepting presumed death. The escalation is causal (ledger revelation narrows options) and the final walk into the canyon forecloses return. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve. One meaningful tightening (uranium discovery) alters tactics and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the uranium/frost opposition: beauty born from poison versus beauty from patience and time. The frost patterns teaching "transformation… from nothing but time, cold, and patience" is purposeful without becoming a thesis statement, and the final image (ice glow, canyon echo of ending/beginning) reweights prior material with resonance. Marina's arc—from chasing her father's glow to discovering safe luminescence—answers the thematic question non-literally. Subtext operates in her realization that his protectiveness was rooted in knowledge of the poison, and the staged death carries weight beyond plot convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled; Marina's perceptual signature (glass artist's eye for "microscopic structures," attention to frost patterns) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ledger revelation and opening slightly during reflective beats. Diction remains within her register (technical but accessible), and the voice carries rhythmic control under pressure. Minor: a few phrases ("steadily adjusting to each revelation") edge toward summary rather than embodied perception. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly clean with good sentence variety and momentum. Information density is high (ledger, uranium, arson, frost lessons) without bloat. Minor issues: "Her father's increasing fatigue. The strange beauty…" employs fragmented catalog rhythm that recurs in reflective beats, and "steadily adjusting" is slightly abstract. "The canyon walls echoed her footsteps, a drifting resonance…" borders on elevated diction but stays voice-plausible for a glass artist. No major loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout. The final paragraph's "drifting resonance" and "adaptive, patient, eternally seeking light" inch toward purple but do not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The uranium-glass premise is specific and less common than generic artist-inheritance plots, and the pivot to frost patterns as a teaching device offers a fresh angle on transformation. The staged-death-via-arson frame adds ingenuity, and Marina's choice to warn rather than profit or destroy distinguishes her from stock protagonists. However, the "poisoned legacy versus safe beauty" binary is somewhat familiar, and the frost-as-metaphor arrival feels slightly convenient. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (she will live in hiding, learn from transient forms), earning solid originality without radical risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marina (glass artist) is present throughout and her choices—fleeing to the canyon, reading the ledger, deciding to warn suppliers, walking deeper into hiding—drive every major turn and the closure. Her identity as a glass artist informs her attention to frost patterns and her years-long quest to replicate her father's glow, which the ledger reframes. Setup, development, and closure participation are all met. Causal pressure is strong (her realization narrows options), and the final walk forecloses her old life with visible cost. The element is indispensable: remove "glass artist" and the uranium-glow connection, the frost-as-teacher resonance, and the thematic opposition collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The ledger strip is handled in multiple beats: grabbed during the arson, read under starlight, retraced against memory, folded and tucked at the end. It is the catalyst for the uranium revelation and the source of the three remaining supplier locations that motivate her warning mission. Setup (first paragraph), development (revelation and retracing), and closure (folded, kept) are all present. Causal pressure is clear (its contents narrow her options), and it charges the final choice. The element is nearly indispensable, though the specific "charcoal smuggler" misdirect is mentioned only briefly and does not recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>"Scorched testament" appears explicitly ("this scorched testament to ambition's true price") and is embodied in the charred ledger that survived the fire. The concept shapes stakes: the ledger is both evidence and moral testimony, prompting Marina's choice to act rather than destroy. Setup (fire-damaged paper, arson survival) and development (reading the entries as testament to her father's poisoning) are clear; closure participation is present but softer (the ledger is kept, not destroyed). The phrase itself is used only once, but the concept permeates the narrative. Swappability is moderate; "burned evidence" or "fire-proof record" would weaken thematic resonance but not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Steadily adaptive" is named explicitly ("Like her, steadily adjusting to each revelation, each loss") and demonstrated through Marina's responses: fleeing after arson, interpreting the ledger, reframing her artistic failure, and choosing a new path. Setup is present (arson survival implies adaptation), development occurs (she adjusts her understanding of her father's glow and her own quest), and closure linkage is visible (she adapts by walking into a new life). However, the trait is more illustrative than constraining; it does not force a tradeoff or narrow options. The label-only mention and slightly abstract phrasing lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Retrace" is dramatized on the page: "She began retracing the ledger's dates against her memories, each entry illuminating another piece of her childhood." This action enables the key revelation (fatigue, strange beauty, protective insistence = uranium poisoning) and shifts Marina's understanding from artistic failure to moral clarity. Setup (ledger in hand), development (retracing yields the uranium insight), and closure linkage (the retraced knowledge drives her warning mission) are all present. The action is causal and essential; without it, the uranium truth remains latent and the moral choice unearned. Specificity is high; "review" or "read" would not carry the same memorial weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Frost patterns are introduced early ("morning frost had formed delicate patterns") and return with accumulated meaning: they teach Marina about transformation without poison, contrasting her father's radioactive glow. The patterns are observed in multiple beats (canyon floor, shifting at dawn, pointing toward possibilities) and directly shape her realization ("The frost itself was teaching her"). Setup, development, and closure participation are all met; the final glow of ice crystals charges the ending image. Causal pressure is moderate (the method inspires rather than enables a tactical move), and the mechanics are shown on the page. Specificity is strong: "morning frost" is more constrained than "natural beauty."</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The canyon setting is anchored early and serves multiple functions: concealment (she fled here to stage her death), revelation space (starlight enables reading the ledger, frost teaches transformation), and symbolic threshold (walking deeper = new identity). Setup, development, and closure are all present. The setting constrains her choice (isolation allows the staged death to hold) and charges the final image (canyon walls echo her footsteps, carrying "ending and beginning"). However, the canyon itself is somewhat generic; the specific features (frost, stone, stars) do the real work. Swappability is moderate; a remote cabin or desert would require minor edits but serve similar functions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after surviving the attempt" is established in the opening ("three nights ago") and orients the narrative present (night → dawn). It creates urgency (she is in hiding, presumed dead) and shapes her choice (she has a brief window before pursuit or discovery). Setup and development are clear; closure participation is softer (the sunrise marks her departure but does not tighten the clock further). The element provides context and pressure but is not irreplaceable; "after fleeing danger" would work with minor edits. The timeframe does not constrain a specific tactic or create a live countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Marina's desire "to discover purpose in the pauses" is both named ("There was purpose in this pause, she realized, in this space between her former life and her transformation") and dramatized: she stops to read the ledger, observes the frost, and chooses a path informed by stillness rather than panic. Setup (she fled to the canyon, creating a pause), development (the pause yields revelation and new resolve), and closure (she walks into transformation with purpose) are all present. The motivation drives the reflective structure and the final choice. However, the phrasing is slightly abstract, and the desire is more thematic than conflicted; no cost or friction opposes it directly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Drifting resonance" appears explicitly in the final paragraph ("a drifting resonance that carried both ending and beginning") and is embodied throughout: the slow, meditative pacing, the interweaving of past and present, and the recurring motifs (frost, glass, luminescence) that accumulate meaning. Tone remains coherent across turns, modulating from recognition (opening trembling) to reflection (father's poisoning) to resolve (walking deeper). The tone charges the final image with layered meaning. However, "drifting" risks vagueness, and the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it does not shift sharply under peak pressure. Setup and closure are strong; development is subtler.</comment>
