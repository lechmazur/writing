<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's motivations are established (drowning in others' needs, burning bridges for her calling), but her actions remain observational throughout. The piece tells us she "severed the last thread" and "burned those bridges with surgical precision," yet we never see a micro-choice under present pressure that tests these traits. The shadows' transformation is shown, but the keeper's own internal contradiction—her careful devastation versus her tenderness—never crystallizes into a dramatized decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (doorknocker ring, scars, shadows) and the final paragraph attempts a conceptual repricing. However, orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge slowly across the first 150+ words without clear anchoring. The closure unit is present (teaching the darkness that bridges must burn to light the way forward) but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or forfeiture legibly alters the keeper's options or stance. The ending recycles the opening premise rather than reweighting it with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary is vividly rendered (charcoal pillars, absent roof, starlight) and the setting consistently pressures the keeper's work. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting when handled, and the blackened walls constrain her solitude. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (shadows "pooled in corners like wounded animals"), and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The final image uses starlight and charcoal pillars to charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching shadows to breathe—is signaled early, but escalation reads as repetition rather than tightening. The shadow with the fresh scar arrives, is taught, and departs; then "another shadow began its encroachment" in identical pattern. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost for the keeper; her methodology succeeds without friction. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("some teachers must become absence itself") but never dramatizes a moment where her severed connections create a present dilemma or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the keeper's practice: necessary endings, breathing as acceptance of emptiness, fading thresholds as invitations. The doorknocker ring and charcoal pillars accrue meaning across beats. However, the final two paragraphs edge into overt thematic summary ("some bridges must burn to light the way forward," "fading thresholds were not endings but invitations") rather than letting the image resonate without gloss. The piece earns its central question but over-articulates the answer, blunting the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction ("cauterized," "loaded emptiness," "careful devastation") anchors the keeper's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("You're not ready," "Breathing requires emptiness first") feels voice-consistent and purposeful. Syntax modulates under pressure without losing coherence. The piece sustains a singular perspective throughout, meeting the 9+ perceptual-signature test with strong rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful figurative language ("burnt fingers against the starlight," "noose disguised as an embrace"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "some bridges must burn" recurs across the opening and closing without added pressure; "fading thresholds" and "necessary endings" cycle through adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the reflection-heavy middle section with repeated "she'd [past action]" constructions. The closure beat itself remains clear, limiting the deduction under the non-closure cap, but information density sags in the reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—a keeper who tends wounded shadows in an ashen sanctuary—offers a fresh frame, and the doorknocker ring as talisman of a burned childhood home adds specificity. However, the emotional arc (learning to let go, teaching others to exhale) follows a familiar template without transformation through occupational or world logic. The shadows function as counseling clients in metaphorical dress; the keeper's "careful devastation" never encounters a case that resists her method or forces her to reckon with the cost of her severances. The piece commits to its premise but does not follow its implications into unexpected territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper is present throughout and her past choices (burning bridges, removing the doorknocker ring) frame the premise. However, her on-page actions are instructional and observational; she teaches shadows but makes no present decision that alters her own tactics or stance. She "settled into her position, ready to demonstrate again"—repetition, not choice. The keeper's trait of careful bridge-burning is told in backstory but does not constrain or enable a present beat with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in three distinct beats: opening (traced at her neck), middle reflection (remembering its removal from the burning door), and closing (grows warm as a reminder). Each mention reweights its meaning slightly, moving from talisman to memory anchor to conceptual bridge. However, the keeper never handles it to make a choice; it remains a reflective device rather than a tool that alters present options. The ring meets two gates (setup, closure participation) but lacks causal pressure in the middle, capping it near the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fading threshold is the core concept and shapes the keeper's teaching: "some thresholds must fade before new ones can form," "fading thresholds were not endings but invitations." The shadows' scars are literal thresholds between existence and void, and the keeper's method involves showing how wounds become doorways. The concept appears early, informs the keeper's tactics (teaching shadows to exhale, to accept emptiness), and charges the final image ("spaces that solid doors could never reveal"). It drives two beats and participates in closure, earning a mid-high score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Burns bridges carefully is labeled repeatedly in backstory ("severed the last thread," "each relationship cauterized at exactly the right moment") and the opening catalogs her past severances (sister, Marcus, village children). The final paragraph restates the trait: "each careful severance teaching her the architecture of necessary endings." However, no present beat shows her making a bridge-burning choice with visible cost or dramatizes a moment where careful severance constrains her tactics. The attribute is told and thematically central but not enacted on the page, capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Encroach is the verb that drives the story's present action: "one shadow encroached upon her meditation circle," "another shadow began its encroachment." The encroachment initiates both teaching sequences and structures the keeper's work. The word is specific and purposeful, signaling the shadows' determination and their need. However, the second encroachment is a near-duplicate of the first without escalation, reducing irreplaceability. The action appears early, drives two beats, and shapes the ending's iterative close, placing it in the 5.0–6.9 band with slight elevation for closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Linking through scars is introduced midway ("This was the method: linking through scars, showing the wounded how wounds could become doorways") and enacted once when the keeper places the shadow against her chest where her largest scar resides. The method is specific and constrains her approach—she uses her own scars as teaching tools—but it arrives after the first third and appears in only one beat. The method shapes a key turn (the shadow's transformation) and charges the thematic question, but late arrival and limited development cap it in the 5.0–6.9 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight is established early and remains present throughout. The blackened walls, charcoal pillars, and absent roof create a contained space that isolates the keeper and shelters the shadows. Starlight defines the shadows rather than destroying them, a constraint that matters. The far wall becomes a gathering place for graduated shadows, affecting spatial choreography. The setting pressures the keeper's solitude and supplies the resources (pooled darkness, star-defined space) that enable her teaching. It participates in all three gates and charges the final image, meeting the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>After cutting off all contact frames the premise and establishes the keeper's isolation. "Three months had passed since she'd severed the last thread" anchors the timeframe early. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or escalate pressure on the page; the keeper's work proceeds without urgency. "Tonight" and "Tomorrow, another shadow would arrive" mark passage, but no live clock alters her tactics or constrains her choices. The element is present and logically consistent but functionally replaceable, placing it in the 3.0–4.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To teach suffocating to breathe is the keeper's stated motivation and drives both teaching sequences. The keeper's own history of suffocation ("she'd drowned in others' needs, their expectations filling her lungs like water") provides causal grounding. She enacts the teaching twice, demonstrating "how to exhale everything it thought it needed." However, the motivation is told more than conflicted; no on-page friction between her want to teach and the cost of her isolation tests her commitment. The motivation appears early, drives two beats, and participates in closure, but lacks visible trade-off, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Loaded emptiness is signaled early ("the loaded emptiness between heartbeats") and sustained through "careful devastation," "ashen refuge," and "space between existence and void." The tone coheres across turns without flattening into single-note melancholy; it modulates from reflective (opening backstory) to instructional (shadow teachings) to resonant (final image). The phrase "loaded emptiness" reappears at the climactic teaching moment, charging the lesson with tonal weight. The tone is purposeful, pattern-consistent, and charges the final image, meeting the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>
