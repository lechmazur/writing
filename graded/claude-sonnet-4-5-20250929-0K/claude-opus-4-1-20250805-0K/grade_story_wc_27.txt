<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is specific and embodied—"awkwardly confident…as if she perpetually stood on the edge of falling into grace"—and her movements carry physical detail. However, her realization feels more delivered than earned: the opera/pause insight and the decision to bring others tomorrow arrive without visible cost or internal contradiction. The protagonist's shift from solitary observer to orchestrator lacks friction; no prior desire is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph 2). The piece accumulates imagery—stones, starlight, opera glasses, rebellion—and the final paragraph attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "The lull was ending. The next movement was about to begin"). Cost is asserted rather than made visceral on the page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The closure reads as thematic declaration instead of pressure crystallized into a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair bay and stone circle are vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory detail: "cathedral of rust," "textured steel," "hum…below hearing." The stones constrain Kira's movements (barefoot perimeter walk) and the opera glasses enable discovery of star-map etchings, both shaping her final stance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Setting actively charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reigniting the stalled rebellion—is signaled early. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: Kira observes, walks, understands, decides to bring others. No reversal narrows her options; the stones' hum intensifies atmospherically but does not force a choice with visible cost. The piece deepens texture without tightening pressure. Agency at closure is intention, not renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: opera's "pause before crescendo," ancient circles encoding rebellion's cyclical nature, "song that took generations to complete." The opera-glasses-as-lens motif subtly reweights perception. The final image avoids overt moralizing. However, the piece hovers near "rebellion as harmony" abstraction; the conceptual answer feels asserted rather than discovered through dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third with stable psychic distance. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "awkwardly confident," "thunderous serenity" as felt experience. Perceptual signature is clear—star maps through opera glasses, hum traveling "up through her bones." Some filter verbs ("She understood then," "She felt") dilute immediacy in peak beats, and the grandmother's opera wisdom arrives as convenient backstory rather than tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sensory detail is precise ("amber threads," "brass-rimmed lenses"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 6–7 restate "the hum intensified" and "stones pulsed," and the penultimate paragraph recycles "the lull was ending / next movement beginning" across sentences. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("The stones hummed…," "The stars above seemed…," "Kira smiled…") flattens propulsion. Deduct −0.8 for loops and stem repetition touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The rebellion-as-music metaphor and ancient-stones-as-amplifier offer a lyrical frame, but the core synthesis (stalled uprising + harmonic resonance → collective reawakening) follows a familiar mystical-catalyst template. Specific details—opera glasses, repair bay, pre-colonial markers—add texture without fundamentally transforming the arc. The piece commits to its premise but does not surprise in execution; the grandmother's wisdom and Kira's epiphany arrive predictably.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira (barefoot stargazer) is present throughout, her barefoot observation seeds the circle's hum discovery, and she decides to bring others. However, her choices do not create reversals; the arc is observational accumulation. She appears in setup, middle beats, and ending, meeting all three gates, but her decisions lack visible cost. Mid-band for presence across structure without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear in three beats: opening stargazing, studying stone etchings (enabling discovery), and pressed to chest at closure. The object enables one key turn (revealing star maps) and returns with reweighted meaning (inheritance/legacy). Setup, development, payoff all present. However, the glasses do not constrain a choice with cost; they serve discovery rather than dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lull in rebellion frames the entire piece: "three months since the uprising stalled," "in-between days," and closure announces "The lull was ending." It shapes Kira's motivation (reignite) and the story's atmospheric pressure. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending declaration. However, the lull does not narrow options on the page; it provides context rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Awkwardly confident appears twice as description ("each gesture both deliberate and slightly off-balance," "awkward confidence transformed") but does not constrain an on-page action. The trait is asserted, not dramatized through a visible cost or enablement. It colors voice but does not alter a choice under pressure. Present in setup and ending (two gates) but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Reignite is the protagonist's goal throughout: stated in paragraph 10 ("This was how to reignite it"), motivates the decision to bring others, and appears in the final line ("next movement was about to begin"). However, no on-page action enacts reignition; the story ends on intention. Present across structure but not dramatized as a completed act with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle's hum is discovered early (paragraph 4), its mechanics are explored (barefoot contact, perimeter walk intensifies resonance, stones as amplifier), and it enables Kira's plan to "amplify scattered signals." Present in setup, middle experimentation, and ending vision. The method shapes tactics (walking the circle) and the closure plan, but the amplification itself remains off-page potential rather than enacted consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors every beat: scaffolds, broken skylights, forgotten machinery that "started to resonate." The bay houses the stone circle, supplies the margin-of-daylight window, and its "vast emptiness" enables the hum's spread. The setting constrains (barefoot on textured steel) and resources the ending vision (engines coughing to life). Integral across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Margin of daylight is signaled early ("last amber threads of day," "twilight deepened," "full darkness claimed the sky") and governs Kira's discovery: "this margin…when the universe balanced…the hum intensified." The timeframe tightens her window of perception and charges the closure moment. Present in setup, middle experimentation, and ending. Time pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent but shapes when the breakthrough occurs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Discovering meaning in the mess drives Kira's arc: "scattered resistance," "mess of the failed uprising—none of it was random," understanding "older harmonies." The motivation is dramatized through her search and realized in the opera/pause insight. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending epiphany. However, the discovery lacks friction; no competing desire complicates her pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Thunderous serenity appears once as direct phrase ("thunderous serenity of understanding") and is implied in the final image (stones humming, Kira's smile, stillness before action). The tone is coherent—quiet intensity—but does not modulate under pressure; it remains static. Present at the moment of realization and closure but not woven through earlier beats to show tonal progression.</comment>
