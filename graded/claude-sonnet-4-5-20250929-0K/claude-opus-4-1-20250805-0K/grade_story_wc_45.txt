<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thomas demonstrates clear interior contradiction—shrewdly innocent bone-setting that updates tradition while yearning for connection. His micro-choices (keeping the tooth, pocketing it, pressing it back) show embodied values with visible cost. Elara's shifting features and violet/grey eyes create physicality, though her emotional arc feels more told than shown. The final humming gesture earns the stance shift, though the "shrewdly innocent precision" label in paragraph 5 edges toward diagnostic phrasing without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Thomas, secret garden, three years post-substitution) land cleanly by ~100 words. The accumulative/textural lens holds: jasmine blooms, broken nest repair, and the tooth exchange accumulate density toward the final humming image that reweights forgiveness as innovation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—Thomas's choice to return the tooth and continue his healing work forecloses the path of bitterness with felt cost (accepting Elara's departure, embracing transformation over restoration). The cost is visible in "can't…but I'll visit" and his solitary preparation of tomorrow's tools. One persistent constraint (Elara's inability to stay) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hedge maze, secret garden with jasmine/roses, moss-covered bench, and fountain with handprints create layered spatial anchors. The broken bird's nest becomes a micro-setting object that Thomas repairs with spider silk, demonstrating his philosophy and charging the closure theme. Sensory detail (dappled sunlight, twilight colors "belonging to neither day nor night") reflects POV priorities and supports tone. The garden's "both worlds could touch" function constrains Elara's presence and enables Thomas's healing work, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling loss and transformation) signals early and tightens through the tooth exchange. The reversal—Thomas returning the tooth rather than keeping it—is protagonist-driven and narrows options (accepting departure over clinging). Cost is legible: he works alone in the garden, Elara leaves, and his forgiveness becomes "a form of innovation" that forecloses resentment. The escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple turns, fitting the length, though the pressure could intensify more sharply before the exchange. "Will you stay this time?" crystallizes the want/need conflict with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (healing as transformation, not restoration; mistakes as constellations) emerges from concrete particulars: the substitute body, bone-setting practice, the repaired nest, impossible blooms. The tooth exchange offers a resonant answer without moralizing—forgiveness and letting-go become the innovation, not a cure. Mother's garden and "broken things learned to grow differently" avoid abstraction through embodied garden work. The final humming image reweights nostalgia and innovation as intertwined rather than opposed. No thematic echo or sermon; the jasmine blooming out of season serves the closure without symbolic shouting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thomas; perceptual signature (bone-setter's eye for breaks and healing) colors observations consistently. Dialogue carries subtext ("Even changelings deserve their coin") and advances the relationship without exposition. Distance control is clean, though "shrewdly innocent precision" in paragraph 5 briefly elevates register. The final paragraph's shift to present-progressive ("begins preparing") modulates distance purposefully for the closing image. Elara's dialogue ("You're different than before…less certain but more sure") risks explaining theme but stays within her character's vantage as observer of her brother's change.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (garden description establishes both setting and theme). Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language ("belief could bend like willow branches") appears frequently but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor template cadence: "She looked seventeen now…She sat on the moss-covered bench…She touched the fountain's edge" in paragraphs 8–13 shows repetitive stems. The nest repair beat demonstrates strong specificity and propulsion. No paraphrase loops, but the repeated "knew/know" in paragraphs 11–12 edges toward synonym churn without quite crossing. Final line recharges Mother's song motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The changeling-substitute premise is familiar fantasy territory, but the story transforms it through the bone-setting metaphor and Thomas's acceptance rather than rescue quest. The "mistakes as constellations" frame and garden-as-healing-ground offer a fresh synthesis. The tooth-as-fairy-coin detail and spider-silk nest repair show specificity. However, the core emotional arc (sibling accepting magical change) and secret-garden-as-threshold follow well-worn paths. The piece commits fully to its lens and avoids hedging, but the transformation of tropes relies more on thematic reframing than structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thomas (forgiving skeptic) drives the key choice to return the tooth and accept Elara's departure, altering tactics from yearning-for-restoration to healing-through-transformation. His skepticism "evolved into something more useful" is told but his micro-choices (keeping the tooth three years, examining it, returning it) show the trait in action. Present in setup, middle philosophical turns, and closure exchange. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait enables rather than sharply constrains.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in four distinct beats: opening examination, Elara's observation "You kept it," Thomas's reply about the tooth fairy, and the final exchange pressing it into her palm. Each touch advances the relationship and reweights meaning from keepsake to gift to talisman. The tooth's "pearlescent surface that caught light differently" gives it irreplaceable specificity. It shapes the closure exchange directly and carries visible cost (letting go). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is stated in paragraph 5 ("The cleft in his certainty had become a doorway") and shapes Thomas's philosophical stance, enabling his acceptance of Elara's transformation. The concept informs his bone-setting philosophy (breaks teach better weight-bearing) and the final understanding that "certainty was overrated." However, it operates more as thematic frame than on-page constraint that narrows tactical choices. Present across beats but pressure is conceptual rather than dramatized through a specific dilemma where uncertainty costs him an option.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears as a label in paragraph 5 ("shrewdly innocent precision") describing Thomas's hands. The trait colors his tooth-fairy remark and his ability to see through glamour while maintaining openness. However, it does not visibly constrain or enable a specific choice with on-page cost. The trait is asserted more than demonstrated through a moment where innocence and shrewdness create a tradeoff or tactical advantage. Present in setup and implied in closure attitude, but lacks middle beat where the attribute's duality forces a decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Yearning structures Thomas's motivation ("years of yearning for the sister he'd lost") and the "Will you stay this time?" question that forces the final choice. His three-year retention of the tooth embodies the action. The closure turn—accepting departure and returning the tooth—reverses yearning into release. Present across setup (paragraph 4), middle reflection (paragraph 11), and closure question (paragraph 14). The action shapes the emotional arc but the mechanics of bone-setting share protagonist attention, slightly diluting centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bone setting appears in Thomas's Council conflict (paragraph 9), his philosophy ("understanding why they broke apart"), the nest repair demonstration (paragraph 12), and the final preparation of tomorrow's tools. The method's mechanics (weaving grass with spider silk, "spaces between them held the real magic") shape his worldview and enable the healing-ground function. Signaled early and present at closure, but the method does not constrain a peak choice—he never faces a moment where bone-setting technique limits his options or forces a tradeoff. Thematic more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is the story's sole location, anchoring every beat. It enables both-worlds contact, supplies the bench and fountain where key exchanges occur, and houses the nest Thomas repairs. The setting's "healing ground for creatures caught between" function directly supports Thomas's work and constrains Elara's ability to stay. Jasmine blooming out of season charges the final image. Setup (paragraph 2), development (garden as meeting place and workshop), and payoff (final preparation in the garden) all present. The garden's wild growth and impossible blooms apply pressure by embodying transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Three years had passed since they found the substitute body" anchors the timeframe in paragraph 3, establishing the mourning/acceptance arc. The timeline shapes Thomas's evolved forgiveness and Elara's progression to appearing seventeen. However, the present scene unfolds in a single twilight conversation without a live clock tightening decisions—the three-year gap functions as backstory context rather than immediate pressure. Present in setup and implicit in their changed relationship at closure, but the element does not create urgency or alter tactics within the on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is Mother's saying (paragraph 13) that Thomas has internalized, shaping his bone-setting philosophy and his acceptance of Elara's changeling nature as growth rather than loss. The motivation drives his nest repair ("creating something both familiar and unprecedented") and his final understanding that forgiveness is innovation. Friction appears in the cost of accepting Elara's departure versus his wish for her to stay. The desire is dramatized through the tooth exchange and the final solitary preparation. Present across beats with visible cost, though the Mother's-wisdom framing edges toward inherited rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nostalgic innovation coheres throughout: yearning for lost Elara braided with Thomas's updated bone-setting, the garden's simultaneous-season blooms, and the final image of preparing tomorrow's tools while humming Mother's old song. Tone modulates purposefully—wistful in the opening hedge/jasmine description, warm in the tooth exchange, quietly elegiac at Elara's departure, then forward-facing in the closing preparation. The "jasmine bloomed out of season" line and "children who were exactly what they seemed, even when they weren't" charge the final image with both nostalgia and invention. The tone does not remain static and directly supports the closure's Charged Poise.</comment>
