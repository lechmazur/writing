<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's seventeen-year patience and methodical moon-tracking establish clear motivation, and her "sculpting impatience into something harder than basalt" shows interior contradiction. The midnight work with Tomás demonstrates agency through concrete choices. However, the final image leans toward abstract satisfaction ("someone was thinking their first free thought") rather than embodied cost—we don't see Kira's own sacrifice or fear, only exhaustion and a smile. The revolutionary stance feels more asserted than earned through on-page struggle with genuine doubt or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear spatial anchors (basalt columns, frozen lake, sanctuary perimeter) and a coherent accumulative/textural lens: Kira's patient preparation crystallizes into the placement of copper rods, the viaduct shifts polarity, and the final dawn image reweights the opening constraint. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the new magnetic configuration and distant confusion signal the revolution's beginning with conceptual cost (people will panic, freedom "felt like falling"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Tomás arrives and confirms the network is in position, narrowing the window to completion. Minor penalty: the seventy-three-hour polarity window and the Council's morning synchronization are told rather than tested on the page, leaving the cost somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and moonlit ice are vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "hexagonal faces glazed with ice," "magnetic pull…humming beneath centuries of volcanic rock." The copper rods placed in basalt cracks and the frozen lake's reflection guide Kira's perimeter walk, constraining her choices spatially. The moon's thirty-seven-degree position above the horizon anchors time and method. The setting charges the final image as dawn colors the frozen lake, reinforcing the quiet transformation theme. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kira's mapper focus: magnetic hum, cold stone, crystallizing breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unyoking humanity from synchronized thought—is signaled early and sustained. Kira's seventeen winters of tracking establish the patient accumulation; the polarity shift and copper-rod placement constitute one meaningful tightening that forecloses the old configuration. The arrival of Tomás and the confirmation of twelve sanctuaries raise the scope without diluting focus. However, the Council's response and the people's confusion remain off-page and abstract; we don't see a trade-off Kira must make in the moment (a relationship, a personal safety margin, a moral ambiguity) that would charge the final image with immediate, felt cost. The revolution's success feels assured rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of patient, geological-time revolution emerges organically from the basalt, frozen lake, moon-tracking, and the repeated water/ice metaphors: "revolution moved like water freezing, molecule by molecule." Kira's sculpted impatience and the final line's "patience of the moon itself" avoid explicit thesis statements. The magnetic viaduct as invisible chains and the new "song" provide subtext without sermonizing. Minor deduction: the final paragraph edges toward summary ("true revolution wasn't about sudden upheaval, but…") and the "first free thought" phrase tilts slightly abstract. The resonance is strong but not fully particular at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Kira's perceptual signature: "horizon mapper," "magnetism humming," "wildness building in her chest." Diction stays controlled and purposeful ("sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt," "unyoke humanity"). Tomás's brief dialogue ("The others are in position") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor penalties: filter verbs cluster in places ("could feel," "could already sense") without adding necessary distance, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she knew," "others would understand") edges toward helpful-narrator exposition rather than trusting the image. Psychic distance shifts are mostly intentional, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, supporting the calm-then-urgent progression: short declaratives at the opening, longer interleaved syntax during the rod placement. Information density is generally high; figurative language (basalt as organ pipes, ice as glass, revolution as freezing water) coheres without muddle. Minor deductions for adjacent near-restatements: "The revolution would not be loud. It would move like water freezing…" and "true revolution wasn't about sudden upheaval, but about the patient accumulation…" loop the same concept. The phrase "subtly vibrations only a horizon mapper could detect" may intend "subtle" (minor typo). Template stems appear in the final third ("Some would…others would…"), reducing propulsion slightly. No major scaffold, but the ending edges toward summary rather than image-driven closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of magnetic viaduct, lunar alignment, and post-rain polarity shift offers a fresh angle on resistance narratives; the geological-time patience theme transforms the trope through specific, grounded world logic. Kira's seventeen winters of moon-charting and the copper-rod circuit feel particular to this voice and setting. However, the core premise (hidden network reprogrammed to free minds) echoes familiar control-liberation templates without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived ambiguity—no cost Kira personally bears on the page, no counter-reading that complicates her rightness. The ending's "first free thought" phrase tilts generic. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, quiet closure) is present but the emotional truth remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira's role as vigilant horizon mapper appears early (tracking moon arcs with meteorite-iron instruments), constrains her method (seventeen winters of charting, detection of viaduct vibrations), and drives the peak action (perimeter walk, rod placement). Her choices create the key turn: the viaduct's polarity shift. The mapper identity is irreplaceable; a generic revolutionary could not detect the magnetic alignment or calculate the thirty-seven-degree angle. Present in all three gates (setup, middle decision, closure image as she sits on the basalt and senses distant confusion). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the smile at dawn ties back to her patient observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in paragraph one (humming beneath basalt), is explained as the Council's synchronization tool mid-story, and its polarity shift after rain drives the climactic rod placement. It returns at closure ("magnetic viaduct hummed its new tune"). Used in at least two distinct beats: initial detection and final reconfiguration. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—Kira feels the hum and places rods, but we don't see a moment where the viaduct resists or complicates her work, reducing immediate on-page friction. The rain-triggered seventy-three-hour window is told rather than tested. Strong integration overall, but one beat short of indispensable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Patient revolution is signaled early (seventeen winters, "patience of geological time"), shapes Kira's tactics (slow perimeter walk, deliberate rod placement, "sculpting impatience"), and provides the thematic spine. The concept charges the final image: "revolution had begun with the patience of the moon itself." However, it operates more as theme than as a constraint that forces an on-page trade-off—Kira never confronts impatience as a live choice that would derail the plan. The water-freezing metaphor and basalt comparisons deepen resonance but keep the concept slightly abstract. Eligible for mid-band: shapes tone and tactics, charges closure, but doesn't create a moment where patience costs her something immediate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" describes Kira's steps and the revolution's method; it appears mid-story ("steps soft but deliberate") and echoes at closure ("transformation happened softly, purposefully"). The attribute constrains her approach—she doesn't rush or shout—but the cost is implicit rather than dramatized. We don't see a moment where being soft instead of loud forecloses an option or creates friction with Tomás or another character. The trait is consistent and thematically resonant, but it trends toward label rather than embodied trade-off. Functional and present at closure, but replaceable with "careful" or "quiet" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears as the central verb mid-story ("This was how they would unyoke humanity") and frames the entire rod-placement action. The term is specific and irreplaceable—"free" or "liberate" would lack the magnetic/yoke metaphor's resonance with the viaduct's binding function. It defines the goal and reappears conceptually at closure when people discover "thoughts they'd never known they could think." Present in setup (viaduct as chains), development (unyoke as method), and payoff (minds freed). Strong causal and thematic integration. Minor deduction: the action itself (rod placement) could be described without the word "unyoke," so the verb charges meaning more than it constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Moon-path tracking is introduced early (seventeen winters, meteorite-iron instruments, charting lunar arcs), constrains Kira's entire method (the thirty-seven-degree calculation, following the moon's reflection across ice), and drives the climactic beat (placing rods at cardinal points aligned with moon position). The mechanics matter: the moon paths are "a forgotten frequency" that predates Council control. Present in all three gates and indispensable—without the lunar alignment, the polarity shift has no basis. The method shapes every tactical choice on the page. Only minor deduction: the specific mechanism (how moon angle triggers polarity shift) remains somewhat abstract, but the tracking action itself is vivid and causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary by the frozen lake is established in the opening line, supplies the hexagonal columns and cracks where Kira places rods, and the frozen lake's reflection guides her perimeter walk. The setting constrains choices spatially (cardinal points, tallest column for Tomás's entrance) and charges the final image (lake reflecting brightening sky as the viaduct hums). Micro-setting elements (cold stone, ice, breath crystals) are tactile and embodied. The location is irreplaceable: the volcanic basalt's magnetic properties and the post-freeze timing are integral to the viaduct's polarity shift. Present in setup, middle action, and closure. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake freezes over" is established early ("rain stopped three days ago…lake finished its transformation into glass") and creates the seventy-three-hour polarity window. The freeze is a necessary precondition, and the dawn approach tightens the final beat. However, the clock is not live on the page—we don't see Kira racing against the seventy-three-hour limit or the Council's morning synchronization as an immediate threat. The timeframe shapes setup and closure (dawn colors the lake) but doesn't force a mid-scene tactical shift or trade-off. Functional and thematically resonant, but the urgency is told rather than felt in real-time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is introduced mid-story as Kira "breathed slowly, purposefully, sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt." The motivation is vivid and character-particular, explaining her seventeen-winter vigil. It charges the final image ("patience of the moon itself"). However, the friction between wildness and restraint is described more than dramatized—we don't see a moment where impatience nearly derails her work or forces a costly choice. The desire is told and thematically consistent, but it trends toward label rather than embodied conflict. Present in setup (wildness building) and payoff (sculpted patience celebrated), but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is embodied early ("wildness building in her chest," "urge to run, to scream, to tear down walls" followed by slow, purposeful breathing) and modulates through the story: calm rod placement, then the viaduct's pulse, then exhausted alertness at dawn. The tone is coherent and charges the final image—Kira's smile and the "new tune" hum balance restraint and transformation. The oxymoron is lived rather than merely asserted. Present across all beats and integral to voice and pacing. Minor deduction: the tone is more atmospheric than causal—it doesn't force a choice where wildness versus restraint creates immediate cost. Strong integration overall, with rhythmic control supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
