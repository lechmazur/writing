<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Martha's motivation to understand collective grief is consistent and her meditative state grounds her carving work. The spectral grandfather's instruction creates meaningful pressure, though the device borders on convenient mentorship. Interiority remains largely reflective rather than contradictory—she moves through her task with professional competence but minimal internal friction. The final choice to read the hidden poem aloud feels earned by the established pattern but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed memorial transforms individual losses into collective strength, and the grandfather's departure marks a threshold crossed. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—density builds through layered images (monarchs, ribbon, names, poems) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when families touch the stone and Martha feels her grandfather's presence spreading. Cost is felt (grandfather's voice fades) but could be more undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse anchors every beat with vivid, purposeful detail: salmon sky, cool glass, iron bones. The milkweed and monarchs create a live environmental clock that pressures Martha's timeline. The woven ribbon and granite workbench ground tactile action. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting's constraint (monarchs departing, November approaching) drives escalation and charges the final image of words released "when the wind was right."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the memorial that honors collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through September and October as the monarchs grow restless. Martha's agency is decision and endurance under her grandfather's instruction, with the ribbon design emerging as connection rather than decoration. The families' arrival provides a meaningful test that validates the work. Cost is visible: the grandfather's presence fades with completion, and Martha continues the poem custom alone. One clear tightening as November approaches narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the butterfly migration metaphor and the ribbon's linking loops: individual losses travel together, guided by something larger. The piece avoids moralizing until the final paragraph, where Martha's explicit statement "collective grief, properly witnessed, transforms into collective strength" edges toward thematic summary. The hidden poem and the release of words southward offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates well in the ribbon design as both decoration and connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clean distance control. Narrative voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—Martha notices through the lens of her craft (grain, loops, threads). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "thundering calm," "fiercely meditative," "iron bones." The grandfather's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Register remains consistent except for one moment: "spectral presence had become her teacher once more" slightly elevates beyond Martha's established voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, several phrases edge toward stock metaphor: "iron bones black against the salmon sky," "thundering calm...like distant storms." The phrase "his voice carrying that thundering calm she remembered—powerful yet serene, like distant storms" loops the descriptor with synonym churn. Template cadence appears in the families list: "The Nguyens who lost...The Johnsons whose...The Garcias whose..." Clarity remains high throughout; no causality breaks from line-level issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral mentorship frame is familiar, but the specific synthesis—gravestone carving, pandemic memorial, monarch migration clock, woven ribbon as collective design—feels purposeful rather than derivative. The ribbon pattern as both aesthetic and structural solution offers a fresh inflection on memorial-making. The multi-family commission and the custom of trading poems at dinner add specificity. However, the wise-grandfather-teaching-from-beyond and butterflies-as-metaphor-for-souls remain close to established templates. Transformation is present but modest; the emotional arc could work with different particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Martha's carving work drives every major beat: she presses too hard (opening), enters meditative state to feel the grain, retraces practice cuts, carves through two months, and retraces each name three times at completion. Her decisions to follow her grandfather's instruction and to speak at the unveiling alter tactics. Closure hinges on her completion and the reading of the hidden poem. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ribbon is unrolled at the workbench (opening), its pattern emerges in stone as connection rather than decoration (middle carving), and it unrolls at the end to reveal the hidden poem. Three beats with escalating function. However, the ribbon's physical use during carving is summarized rather than shown—we're told the design emerges but don't see Martha handle it as reference. The final revelation of the poem charges closure. Lyric reprise with cost linkage but middle development is thin on tactile action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes every carving session: the grandfather's voice corrects her pressure, teaches her to feel grief's grain, guides her hands, and grows urgent as the deadline approaches. His presence spreading among the families at the unveiling and his fading with completion create visible stakes and cost. The concept drives Martha's learning curve and the memorial's design—she couldn't complete this work without his instruction. Present in setup, development, and closure with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is mentioned once as a state Martha cultivates, shown briefly when she closes her eyes to feel the grain. The trait enables her carving precision but doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—it functions more as professional competence than a tradeoff. Label appears; one beat shows embodiment; no friction or price tied specifically to the intensity of her focus versus other demands. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Retracing appears three times with escalating stakes: Martha retraces practice cuts to follow each family's story, works faster as urgency mounts, and retraces each name three times to ensure weight. The action directly enables the memorial's completion and validates her grandfather's lesson about feeling grief's grain. Final families touch the stone to find their names "within the pattern"—the retraced precision matters. Causal throughout; closure depends on this exact repetition ensuring proper witnessing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The poem custom is mentioned as background (passed down tradition), appears briefly when Martha reads poems from families and responds with her grandfather's verses during work months, and returns at closure when she reads his hidden poem aloud. The mechanic—trading poems at dinner—shapes Martha's solitary practice during carving but doesn't constrain a key choice. Present in three beats but largely atmospheric. The custom primes the final poem reading but could be replaced with another solitary ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse frames every scene, pressures through environmental cues (dying October light, darkening clouds, dusk), and supplies the milkweed that anchors the monarchs' timeline. Martha's workbench and the glass walls that "held the words like cupped hands" charge the closure image. The setting's ancient quality and proximity to her grandfather's workshop deepen the spectral mentorship logic. Iron bones, cool glass, and the spatial containment of families at unveiling all matter. Indispensable to tone, escalation, and final release.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The migration tightens pressure across three named months: monarchs arrive early in confusion, cluster through September-October carving, grow restless as November approaches, and lift on completion day. The timeframe creates urgency ("The migration won't wait"), shapes Martha's work pace, and synchronizes the grandfather's departure with the butterflies' journey. Clock is live and tracked; the constraint alters tactics (working faster). Time pressure charges the ending when the last monarch spirals upward.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Martha's desire to understand collective grief is stated early and dramatized through her struggle to braid seventeen families' sorrows into one pattern. Internal friction appears when her grandfather corrects her pressure—she must learn rather than execute by rote. The memorial's completion and families touching the stone provide on-page validation. Her speech about migration and collective strength makes the motivation explicit, bordering on tell. Cost is present (solitary work, grandfather's departure) but the want itself faces modest obstacle beyond learning curve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is introduced via the grandfather's voice ("powerful yet serene, like distant storms"), modulates when Martha's voice carries "his same thundering calm" at the unveiling, and returns in the final paragraph's release of words. The tone threads through quieter carving beats and the charged gathering, maintaining coherence. However, the descriptor is somewhat abstract and relies on synonym loop ("powerful yet serene") for definition. Present in setup and payoff with modest middle modulation; charges the final image but doesn't fully constrain choice under pressure.</comment>
