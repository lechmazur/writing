<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior life is established through concrete actions (tapping rhythms, checking instruments, reading the diary) and her detective-like assembly of fragments shows clear motivation. However, her grandmother functions more as a device than a pressure point—the relationship lacks emotional contradictions or cost. The decision to descend feels driven by conceptual realization rather than competing desires or genuine risk to her professional standing. The "keeper of patterns, a rememberer of what was periodically eternal" edges toward mystical abstraction without grounding in embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-teaching through the tapping motif and coral-as-town revelation. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (monitoring station, Lena, coordinates, dead reef). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Lena's descent toward the submerged town crystallizes her stance as translator/witness, and the cost is legible in her isolation and commitment to "drifting between worlds." One meaningful deepening occurs as geometric shadows become architectural patterns become the town itself, reweighting what "bleaching" means.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The monitoring station constrains Lena's initial observation and the descent mechanism becomes tactically relevant at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful: "bleached skeleton," "high and clear" glass tones, ventilation catching the atlas page. The coral formations shift from death-marker to preservation medium, and this transformation is earned through accumulated perception rather than declaration. Micro-setting via surfaces (glass, metal, plastic) generates the tapping symphony that reveals pattern, directly charging the final image of descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why Mooreton vanished and what her grandmother intended—is signaled early and tightens as shadows become geometry become streets. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena stops needing the atlas page, recognizing the coral as transcription rather than death. However, the escalation is largely perceptual; no external opposition tests her commitment, and the decision to descend carries stated isolation but minimal on-page cost (no sacrifice of position, safety protocol violation, or relational rupture dramatized in the moment). The "drifting between worlds" operates more as lyric summary than felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through coral-as-metamorphosis and the "periodically eternal" phrase, avoiding sermon. The final image—station touching water, Lena's reflection over coral city—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to transformation-versus-death without stating a moral. "Some messages take generations to deliver" lands as earned wisdom tied to the tapping rhythm and grandmother's diary. The piece resists binary death/life readings, embracing patient, alternate forms of continuation. Minor slip: "The revelation had been delayed by decades of misunderstanding" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Lena's perceptual signature (scientific measurements, tactile tapping, visual pattern-seeking). Diction stays consistent—"calcium and silence," "translated into a language of reef and bone"—with purposeful compression in the phrase "periodically eternal" that fits the grandmother's archival voice. Minor register drift: "transcribed" and "assembling itself" in quick succession feel slightly elevated for the immediacy of the moment. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, pulling back for "everyone saw death where there was patience" without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through most beats with varied sentence openings and rhythmic control. Information density is high: the atlas page, diary, tapping, and coral observations do double duty. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The coral below had been white for so long" / "The bleaching hadn't been death but metamorphosis" restates the same idea without added pressure. "Shifted states, moved between forms like water becoming ice becoming vapor" is a stock metaphor that dilutes specificity. Template cadence in "She moved through the station, tapping on every surface, building a symphony of rhythms. Each tone revealed more" slightly flattens momentum. No artifacts touch closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The coral-as-preservation and town-as-transcription premise offers a fresh synthesis of climate grief and transformation. Tapping rhythms as decoding method and the atlas page as heirloom constraint avoid stock framing. The piece commits fully to its metamorphosis logic without retreat. However, the "keeper of patterns" phrase and "periodically eternal" edge toward template mysticism without sufficient grounding in world mechanics—how does coral encode architecture beyond visual suggestion? Risk-taking in the lyric closure and rejection of simple death-narrative elevates within band, but the grandmother-as-guide trope is familiar territory executed well rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena is present as coral bleaching witness throughout, and her grandmother's diary establishes the lineage. Lena's observations (instruments, shadows, geometric patterns) drive the middle beats, and her choice to descend is directly tied to witnessing the coral's transformation. However, the grandmother remains off-page, and Lena's scientific role is more observational than decisive—she records data but doesn't face a professional or ethical dilemma that her witness-status forces her to choose between.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in three distinct beats: discovery behind diary, alignment with her view to reveal building shapes, and flutter/release when she no longer needs it. The object enables the town's geographic anchor and its release marks her transition from evidence-dependence to embodied understanding. Strong causal role and closure linkage. Minor limiter: the page could be swapped for another archival document (map, photograph) with modest edits, though its "torn" and "brittle" qualities add texture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire arc: Lena spends three months assembling fragments before understanding the coral's transformation. The concept shapes her tactics (checking instruments, tapping, aligning atlas page) and the final descent occurs only after the revelation lands. However, the revelation itself is primarily perceptual/thematic rather than altering material stakes—no external clock, rival claim, or institutional pressure tests her newfound knowledge. The delay charges the ending but doesn't narrow options with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears twice as a thematic label: once in Lena's memory ("something she'd only hinted at in her diary's margins: a keeper of patterns, a rememberer of what was periodically eternal") and once in Lena's understanding ("Lena finally understood that phrase now"). The concept enables her reframing of bleaching-as-metamorphosis, but it functions more as interpretive lens than on-page constraint. No visible cost or tactical trade-off tied to this attribute; it remains closer to theme claim than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" drives the narrative engine: Lena assembles fragments (diary, atlas, shadows, coral patterns), then assembles a symphony of tapping tones, and finally sees "the truth assembling itself" in the coral formations. The action is irreplaceable—substituting "collect" or "discover" would lose the constructive, active quality central to her methodology. Present across three beats and causally linked to closure. Strong integration, though the final "assembling itself" slightly shifts agency away from Lena at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms appear in five beats: opening glass-tapping (three short/three long/three short), console tapping as thinking aid, tapping through the station to build a symphony, emergency console tapping to lower anchors, and final echo as station touches water. The practice is mechanically specific (different surfaces = different tones) and directly enables her revelation that coral formations hold geometric/architectural patterns. Indispensable: removing tapping would collapse the decoding mechanism and the layered morse-code/grandmother connection. High irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station is present throughout, provides the floating vantage that reveals coral patterns below, supplies instruments for daily data recording, and its descent mechanism becomes the climactic choice. The station's "seventeen meters above what the torn atlas page claimed was solid ground" establishes the core spatial paradox. Environment constrains Lena's initial perspective and supplies the anchoring system she activates for closure. Surfaces (glass, metal, plastic) enable the tapping symphony. Essential and causally integrated across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" anchors the timeframe in the opening and returns in "The fossil fuel ban had come too late to save the reef as it was, but perhaps just in time to witness what it was becoming." The ban provides thematic context for delayed consequence and establishes that twenty years have passed. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten tactics or impose a clock on Lena's investigation—she's been stationed for three months with no indicated deadline. The "after" functions as setting backdrop rather than pressure mechanism. Functional but not pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is dramatized through her investigation of Mooreton's vanishing and her grandmother's cryptic diary. The desire drives her tapping, atlas alignment, and instrument-checking across multiple beats and culminates in the descent decision. However, friction between wants and costs is muted—no professional risk, competing obligation, or relational sacrifice visibly opposes her quest. The motivation is present and causal but lacks embodied resistance that would elevate it to high-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is enacted structurally and imagistically throughout: the station floats yet is anchored, Lena is stationed yet isolated, the coral is dead yet preserving, and the final image explicitly names "drifting between worlds—the floating station and the submerged town, the living and the transformed." Tone modulates from scientific observation to lyric realization without breaking coherence. The oxymoron charges the closure image ("moored here now, drifting between worlds"). Strong thematic and tonal integration with purposeful paradox that supports the metamorphosis theme.</comment>
