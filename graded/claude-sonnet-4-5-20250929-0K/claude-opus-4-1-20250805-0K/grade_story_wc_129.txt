<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's dedication is asserted but her internal contradiction never crystallizes in scene—she pursues community grafting without visible friction between want and cost until the final tableau hands her success. The ancient artist's self-exile is told rather than dramatized, and her tears arrive on cue without prior embodied resistance. The village youth remain interchangeable ciphers (Maria's translations, Javi's climbing) whose micro-choices never constrain Kira's path. The ending grants belonging without foreclosing a live option or showing what Kira relinquished to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images of weaving, tags, kinship) but the closure unit—finding the artist and "completing" the arbor—is a delivered discovery rather than a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is clean early (crater, arbor, Kira's arrival), but the seven-night search montage compresses all reversals into summary ("became ritual," "slowly revealed a pattern") and the climactic descent is communal consensus, not Kira's constrained choice. The story teaches a pattern of accretion but pays it off with a tidy reunion that resets all exile rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater lake supply vivid anchors and the marsh reeds function as Kira's tool across multiple beats, shaping her sculptures and the final collaborative act. Spatial choreography remains clear (crater edge, descent, cave behind waterfall) and the extinct languages filter through dialect without caricature. However, the setting never constrains a key choice—Kira's reed-weaving succeeds unimpeded by material limits or environmental friction—and the final image uses the arbor as symbolic backdrop rather than a resource that alters tactics or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kira grafting herself onto the community—is signaled early, but escalation occurs entirely in the village's warming acceptance (silent watchers → children gather → neighbors share theories) without a single on-page moment where Kira's agency narrows her options or pays a visible price. The search for the artist unfolds as communal ritual in summary; the discovery at the crater's bottom is geographic coincidence, not a turn driven by Kira's prior choices. The ending grants belonging and completes the arbor without dramatizing what Kira or the artist renounced to earn it, leaving pressure asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—kinship webs and the refusal to let anyone remain lost—emerges clearly from the search pattern and the arbor-as-mirror metaphor, avoiding overt thesis statements. The tag constellation and the artist's exile supply concrete particulars, and the "first thread" line offers a resonant image. However, the ending resolves into sentimental symmetry ("luminescent ache of belonging finally found") that announces the theme rather than letting the final image reweight prior cost, and the piece never dramatizes a competing pull or moral friction that would complicate the communal embrace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors to Kira with consistent psychic distance, and diction—"crystalline orchard trembled," "luminescent ache"—maintains a heightened lyric register throughout. However, voice modulation under pressure is minimal; Kira's interiority at the climax ("Then we'll find them together," "You were never outside the web") reads identically calm to her opening observations. Dialogue from Tomás and the artist is functional but lacks subtext or resistance, and the village youth remain undifferentiated in speech and perception. The prose serves clarity but never tightens rhythm or compresses syntax to reflect rising stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally clean with no major grammatical errors, but the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting and template cadence in mid-scene beats: "each translucent fruit catching fire," "luminescent ache of belonging finally found," "pillars of light," "fallen stars." Paraphrase loops appear ("stories into the black volcanic glass" / "sculpting their stories into obsidian") and the final paragraph stacks modifiers without propulsion ("dark beauty of obsidian and the golden promise of marsh reed under endless, forgiving light"). The scaffold phrase "a monument to some lost purpose" → "testament to the webs" → "mirror, reflecting back" recycles conceptual synonyms without added pressure. These artifacts cluster in the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—outsider artist discovers reclusive first artist through community search—follows a familiar redemption-and-belonging template without fresh inflection. The crystalline orchard and extinct languages supply vivid texture, but the emotional arc (exile → acceptance → completion) and the twist (tags form a path to the hidden artist) resolve predictably without a non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that redefines prior material. The piece commits fully to its lyric register but retreats from risk by granting all parties their desired outcomes without visible tradeoff, and the "first thread" revelation is foreshadowed so heavily ("lost purpose," "vanished trying to capture everything") that it arrives as confirmation rather than reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira (marsh-reed sculptor) is present throughout and her weaving anchors multiple beats (opening arbor work, gathering youth, final collaborative piece), satisfying Setup and Development gates. However, her sculpting never constrains a choice or forces a visible cost—she weaves successfully in every scene—and at closure the collaborative act with the artist is described in summary ("worked side by side, weaving reeds through obsidian") rather than shown as a decision that narrows options. The character is functional but the sculpting itself remains ornamental skill rather than causal pressure. Band guidance: two gates + functional presence → eligible ~5.0–6.0; swappability (any craft could replace reeds without altering the arc) and summary-only closure drop it to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears in the opening paragraph (Setup), serves as the physical site Kira transforms across multiple beats (Development: "weaving marsh reeds between the branches," "sculpting their stories into the black volcanic glass," children watching), and is named again at closure ("arbor stood complete at last"). However, the arbor's specific properties—its obsidian structure, the etched tag, its "lost purpose"—never constrain Kira's choices or alter tactics; it functions as a symbolic monument-to-mirror rather than a tool or obstacle with agency. The final image ("reflecting back the faces") is metaphorical rather than causal. Band guidance: all three gates + mid-level beat involvement + charged reprise → eligible ~6.0–7.0; lack of causal pressure (Kira's work proceeds unimpeded by the arbor's material limits) and swappability (any communal structure could serve) limit it to upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Webs of kinship shapes the thematic frame from the opening ("webs of kinship that bound this peculiar village together") through the search ("root systems that connected one figure to another") to the closing image ("grafted a new branch onto their ancient tree"). Setup and Payoff gates are met. However, the concept remains thematic echo rather than on-page constraint—Kira's choices are never complicated by competing kinship claims, resource scarcity, or social friction within the web. The search unfolds as consensus ritual without visible cost to any relationship. Band guidance: Setup + Payoff (no middle constraint) + lyric reprise → eligible ~5.0–6.3; thematic presence without causal pressure caps it at low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as a character label ("that boldly sympathetic certainty that had first made the villagers trust her") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Kira's sympathy is asserted in the tag line but her actual choices—gathering youth, mapping tags, helping the artist stand—read as consensus-building without friction or tradeoff. No moment dramatizes boldness creating risk or sympathy foreclosing a tactical option. Setup gate is met (attributed early), but Development and Payoff gates are absent. Band guidance: label-only mention without dramatized cost → ornamental band ~1.0–3.0; logical attribution and single-beat presence lift it to upper-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dedicate" (verb: to commit with devotion) appears explicitly in Tomás's warning ("You dedicate yourself too completely") and implicitly in Kira's sustained arbor work across months and the final collaborative act ("dedication meeting recognition"). Setup and Payoff gates are met. However, the action of dedicating is told rather than shown at key beats—Kira's "too complete" dedication is Tomás's diagnosis, not a dramatized choice where Kira sacrifices sleep, a relationship, or another goal to continue. The climactic descent is communal rather than a solo commitment with cost. Band guidance: Setup + Payoff (no middle beat where dedication narrows options) + summary-only treatment → mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shared search for the elusive street artist's tag is signaled early ("a tag, angular and defiant, that appeared throughout the village"), drives the middle action ("armed with charcoal and rice paper, they began mapping every instance of the mysterious tag"), and pays off when the tags form a path to the artist's cave. All three gates are met and the method involves two distinct beats (mapping, following the spiral). However, the search mechanics remain summary-level ("became ritual," "slowly revealed a pattern") without on-page friction or a moment where the method's limits force a tactical shift. The discovery is geographic coincidence (following moonlight) rather than a search choice with cost. Band guidance: all three gates + two beats + closure linkage → eligible ~6.0–7.5; summary-only treatment and lack of constraint lower it to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard perched at the crater's edge appears in the opening line (Setup), anchors Kira's work across the middle (Development: children gather at dawn, the arbor stands at the crater's edge), and frames the final image (Payoff: "In the crystalline orchard...the community had grafted a new branch"). All three gates are met. However, the setting functions as vivid backdrop rather than constraint—Kira's access to reeds, the arbor's stability, and the descent path are frictionless. The crater's verticality is noted (Javi climbs walls, villagers descend together) but never alters a tactic or imposes cost. Band guidance: all three gates + spaced mentions → eligible ~6.0–7.0; postcard description without causal pressure limits it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" (Timeframe) appears as an atmospheric phrase in the prompt but does not translate to a legible temporal constraint on the page. The story notes "three months ago" (Kira's arrival) and "seven nights" (search duration), but these intervals neither tighten pressure nor alter tactics—Kira's work proceeds at an unforced pace and the climactic descent occurs "on the seventh night" without deadline urgency or cost for delay. Setup gate is arguably met (temporal context established early), but Development and Payoff are absent. Band guidance: vague time without on-page constraint → ornamental band ~1.0–3.5; thematic presence and consistency lift it to low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to graft herself onto community is signaled early ("drawn by whispers of a settlement") and declared at closure ("grafted a new branch onto their ancient tree"). Setup and Payoff gates are met. The middle beats show Kira earning trust (silent watchers → children gather), but the want is never dramatized in friction—no moment where Kira's outsider status costs her a choice, resource, or relationship, and no competing desire (e.g., solitude, prior attachment) that she must renounce. The resolution grants belonging without visible sacrifice. Band guidance: Setup + Payoff + thematic consistency → eligible ~5.0–6.5; told-only desire without on-page friction caps it at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" (Tone) is present in the opening register ("translucent fruit catching fire," "whispers of a settlement") and the closing line ("luminescent ache of belonging finally found," "endless, forgiving light"). The tone remains consistently lyric and elevated across turns. Setup and Payoff gates are met. However, the tone is static—Kira's voice at peak search and at climactic reunion reads identically wistful and measured, with no modulation under pressure. The final image charges the ache by naming it directly, which announces the tone rather than embodying it through image alone. Band guidance: Setup + Payoff + coherence → eligible ~5.5–7.0; static mood and on-the-nose closure phrase limit it to low-6s.</comment>
