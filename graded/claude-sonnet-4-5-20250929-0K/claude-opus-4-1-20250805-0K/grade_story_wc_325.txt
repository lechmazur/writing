<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia is embodied ("chest tightened," "walls pressing inward") and her motivation to honor Marcus drives the descent with visible cost. The interiority remains concrete throughout, particularly in the phase-chamber confrontation where past promise collides with present fear. Minor deduction: Marcus exists only as preserved memory without contradictory impulses; Elena's internal conflict could deepen further in the peak beat where she adjusts the chamber field.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena cannot save the team but ensures they are remembered, accepting the cost of annual witness and permanent silence. The causal lens holds throughout—her descent is motivated by promise, the phase chamber discovery explains both the team's death and her extraction choice, and the final ascent commits her to perpetual return. Orientation anchors quickly (submarine station, Elena, seventeen years abandoned, Arctic). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tidal deadline pressures extraction and she must choose what to carry forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flooded station's pressure is felt viscerally ("corridors like a throat swallowing her backward"), and the phase chamber's crystalline sphere constrains her final choice—she must use its field to recover Marcus. The forty-minute tidal clock and emergency lighting create tactical pressure. The gold-flecked journal charges the final image, and the cables function as both setting infrastructure and thematic spine. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and ascent sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring the promise to remember Marcus and his team) is signaled early and tightens when the tidal deadline forces extraction priority. The phase-chamber discovery narrows options—she can retrieve the body or the encoded messages, choosing the journal as portable witness. Agency is clear: Elena's choice to adjust the chamber field and her decision to withhold explanation from the surface both foreclose paths with visible cost (annual return, permanent silence). The invisible threat contained by the team's sacrifice raises existential weight without requiring on-page confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of witness and memory emerges through concrete particulars: the gold-flecked map, the phase-transition traces, the choice to carry the journal rather than full explanation. The final image—journal pressed against chest "like a heart that no longer beat but still remembered"—reweights the premise without moralizing. The cables' hum ("ten billion conversations that would never know the price") offers Conceptual Repricing that lands with undeniable social cost. Subtext operates cleanly in Elena's refusal to explain and in the team's self-sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual signature (noticing thermal currents, tracking invisible traces, filtering environment through claustrophobic dread). Diction stays controlled and voice-consistent. Minor density issue: "suffocating weight" and similar metaphors for claustrophobia repeat without adding fresh texture in the final third. The phrase "crashing hush" appears twice ("silence that crashed," "crashing hush") with identical effect, creating slight template echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Propulsion is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm modulation. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minor loop: "Remember us. Remember what we found" followed two paragraphs later by "she would remember" creates paraphrase adjacency. Figurative language occasionally clusters without escalation—"amber preservative," "digital cancer," "neural pathways," "throat swallowing"—though most metaphors remain apt and don't obscure causality. Sentence openings vary well and clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of phase-transition science with undersea infrastructure guardianship and claustrophobic witness offers fresh specificity. The invisible electromagnetic threat and the encoded water-molecule messages transform familiar "lost expedition" material through grounded technical detail. The team's choice to sacrifice themselves by trapping the entity between states provides non-obvious moral calculus. Elena's decision to withhold explanation and commit to annual witness avoids the explain-everything ending, though the core "return to honor the dead" frame remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia shapes multiple beats (airlock descent, lab entry, chamber confrontation) and drives her choice to extract quickly with only the journal. Her trait creates visible cost—she must override fear to reach the phase chamber, and the descent/ascent through "throat-like" corridors demonstrates ongoing struggle. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (navigating by memory despite constriction), and payoff (final ascent). Causal pressure is clear: without this trait, the physical environment would lack personal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gold fleck appears first in the map Marcus sent (setup), reappears in his preserved journal visible through the phase chamber (middle), and charges the final image where the flecks "create constellations in the flooded dark" and the journal is pressed against Elena's chest as memorial heart (closure). The object is handled physically (she seals it in specimen container), and its return at the end reweights the opening—what began as decorative margin now symbolizes irreplaceable witness. Strong causal and closure linkage; the specific material (gold from grandmother's workshop) creates irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables shape the premise (tectonic shifting cracked sheaths, flooding the station), provide the discovery (electromagnetic entity growing along cable routes), create the team's sacrifice (containing the threat to protect global communications), and charge Elena's final reflection ("ten billion conversations that would never know the price"). The concept constrains Elena's choices—she protects the cables' secret by refusing explanation. Present in all three gates with strong causal and thematic integration; removing cables would collapse both plot logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's specialized sonar rig and tracking sensors enable multiple on-page actions: navigating thermal currents, detecting phase-transition traces, revealing the team's final hours as phosphorescent afterimages, and decoding Marcus's water-molecule messages. The trait constrains her choices—she can only recover what her equipment reveals, leading to the journal extraction. Present early (second paragraph), active in middle discovery beats, and essential to understanding what the team contained. Specific cost: the invisible information determines what she can carry forward.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Return" structures the entire narrative: Elena descends to fulfill a years-old promise, discovers why the team died, retrieves the journal as portable memory, and commits to annual return as perpetual witness. The action redefines all options—her initial return makes subsequent returns inevitable. Setup (opening: "someone had to return"), development (navigating station to reach chamber), closure (vow of annual tidal return). Major turns trace directly to this action; swapping it would require complete restructure. The double meaning (return once / return perpetually) deepens integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Phase transitions function as both scientific method and metaphorical spine. Setup early (Phase Lab, chamber designed to study matter states under pressure), mechanics matter in middle (team used phase field to trap entity "between states," Marcus preserved neither solid nor liquid), and payoff (Elena "adjusts the chamber's field" to recover the body, bringing Marcus "back through the phase transitions"). The method constrains attempts—she must understand the field to retrieve anything. Removing this exact mechanism would break both plot logic and thematic resonance (liminal states, memory preservation).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility provides immediate tactical pressure (flooded corridors, emergency lighting, structural decay) and resources (phase chamber still intact, tracking equipment functional). Setup (first paragraph: abandoned seventeen years), development (facility's layout forces navigation choices, Phase Lab materializes through murk), payoff (ascent through flooded station, airlock breach to surface). The setting's abandonment creates both physical danger and thematic weight—Elena becomes sole witness. Micro-setting (chamber, corridors, airlock) alters tactics throughout; removing this exact location would require major plot restructure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tidal timeframe introduced early ("The tide would turn in forty minutes. After that, the currents would make extraction impossible") and tightens decisions—Elena must choose what to retrieve within the window. The constraint forces her to prioritize the journal over fuller recovery. Payoff: "The tide was turning" triggers her ascent, and the final vow specifies "every year at this exact tide," converting deadline into ritual. The clock is tracked and shapes at least two key choices (extraction priority, ascent timing). Strong causal integration; slightly less visceral pressure than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation ("the promise she'd made") drives the descent despite claustrophobia, shapes her choice to retrieve the journal as memorial proof, and crystallizes in the final vow of annual witness. Setup (opening: "someone had to remember"), development (finding Marcus's encoded plea "Remember us. Remember what we found"), closure (standing witness with journal, keeping silence as protection). The desire shows friction—remembering requires withholding explanation, and perpetual return demands ongoing cost. Dramatized through actions (descending despite fear, sealing journal, refusing to explain) rather than merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" (oxymoric silence/noise) established in opening ("silence that crashed over her like a physical weight") and returned in closing ("In the crashing hush of the Arctic waste"). Tone modulates with pressure—wan yellow light and amber water create eerie stasis, tightening to "throat swallowing" claustrophobia at peak, then releasing to "clean emptiness" of Arctic wind. The contradictory stillness charges both the underwater discovery and the surface commitment. Coherent through all turns; the final image uses the tone to weight Elena's vow. Could integrate more distinctly in middle beats.</comment>
