<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mae's motivations are present but overly abstract—her journey toward "where unused love is stored" remains metaphysically distant rather than felt through embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is largely absent; she moves through the sequence without genuine hesitation or competing impulses. The ghost woman's appearance and the final "giving" turn lack sufficient causal groundwork in Mae's psychology, reading more like submission to mystical instruction than a choice born from her own contradictory desires. The breathing-pattern mechanic substitutes for earned agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: sparks → ghost → tear → door → offering. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Mae, viaduct, twilight, post-memory timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mae realizes she must give rather than take, constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, cost at closure is conceptual and diffuse—"empty and full simultaneously" asserts rather than dramatizes the price of releasing her photographs. The gap between stated transformation and on-page felt consequence keeps this mid-band despite structural coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct setting is vivid and specific: wisteria blooming only at twilight, arches, spatial choreography with the camera obscura. The camera itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Mae's perception and shaping her approach to the door. Sensory detail is filtered through her artist's attention (sparks, phosphorescence, "compressed starlight"). The setting meaningfully charges the final image—sparks trailing her footsteps—lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: finding the repository of unused love. One tightening occurs when Mae learns she must contribute rather than extract, narrowing her options. However, escalation is largely external and instructional—the ghost directs, Mae complies—rather than driven by Mae's agency under pressure. The photographs' dissolution represents a cost, but it unfolds without visible resistance or trade-off that would test her commitment. Coincidence (the past-life memory, the convenient vial) complicates setup but the resolution follows mystical instruction more than protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of accumulated, unclaimed affection emerges through concrete imagery (sparks, wisteria, repository door) rather than statement. The closing image—sparks trailing footsteps, carrying the secret of waiting love—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the epiphany "wasn't meant to take but to give" edges toward thematic summary, and the final paragraph's promise ("develop not what was, but what could be") states rather than shows transformation. Subtext operates in the ghost woman's smile and the door of "compressed starlight," but overall the piece leans explanatory at key turns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-third throughout. Diction carries a dreamy, elevated register appropriate to the mystical premise: "prayer written in stone," "phosphorescent trail," "copper of that ancient heartbreak." Perceptual signature reflects Mae's artist sensibility through camera-focused observation. However, elevated phrasing pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation—"foggy lucidity," "ribbons of light... like silk scarves in an underwater dance"—resulting in uniform texture that doesn't accelerate with urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Distance remains consistent but the voice doesn't tighten under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong figurative language and sentence variety. Information density is generally high. However, overwriting appears in stacked metaphors during key beats: "door... made of compressed starlight and forgotten promises," "voice like wind through bells," "moths toward flame." The opening "prayer written in stone" and "pilgrim of sparks" establish poetic register, but the density of figurative vehicles in every paragraph—especially "repository of unused love" machinery—slightly obscures immediate causality. Minor synonym loops: "sparks" recurs decoratively rather than with escalating function. Propulsion is present but textural density occasionally stalls momentum. No severe line-level artifacts, but the accumulation of lush phrasing in peak beats merits moderate penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—camera obscura as mystical tool, repository of unloved things—synthesizes familiar fantasy-quest and magical-realism elements without a sharp transformative angle. "Pilgrim of sparks" and "unused love stored" read as elegant but abstract concepts rather than lived-in world logic with friction. The ghost-woman guide and mystical-object-from-vendor follow well-worn patterns. Mae's emotional arc (solitary artist finds completion through sacrifice) is archetypal and executed competently but predictably. The piece commits fully to its premise, but the core invention doesn't surprise or challenge expectations in hindsight.</comment>
