<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"dreams had started six months ago—interrupted journeys where she'd board trains that dissolved into mist"—grounding her return in embodied experience. Her agency at the ending (kneeling, clearing soil, discovering the inscription) is earned by prior causality, and the grandmother's inscription provides both external stake and internal pressure. The piece balances her internal contradiction (fled faith twenty years ago vs. feeling "cautious enchantment") without tidy resolution. Minor deduction: the phrase "warmly curious" in "her curiosity warming despite the chill" leans toward label-speak, and the secondary character Yakov applies pressure but his motivation remains sketched rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens that holds to closure: landscape details (orchard-cemetery, roots through tombs) accumulate pressure toward Miriam's final choice to map the wandering paths. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Miriam commits to "the work of rebuilding" with visible cost: "months" of labor, accepting "faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth." The cost is legible in the inscription "Time returns all wanderers to their purpose" and her kneeling gesture. One small slip: the transition from "The earthquake changed everything" to the present tomb excavation compresses three weeks of prior village work into summary, creating minor ellipsis friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not mere backdrop: roots lifting tombs, pomegranates splitting against marble angels, and bees in the ossuary create tactile world logic that pressures Miriam's stance. The sundial base emerging "like a forgotten promise" and the grandmother's tomb with roots-as-pillars constrain her final choice to rebuild. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (excavation site, deeper grove, tomb chapel). Sensory detail is filtered through Miriam's POV bias (historian's recognition of the inscribed bronze, grandmother's role as "keeper of hours"). Gate met: environment constrains the choice to position the gnomon and charges the final image of olives ripening on branches "that had learned to grow through tombs."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Miriam's interrupted journeys and the question of why she returned. The tightening occurs when Yakov reveals the sundial gnomon and the grandmother's inscription, narrowing Miriam's options from passive observation to active commitment. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening—fitting the gnomon and discovering the names inscribed as hours—that reweights her understanding of diaspora as circular rather than linear. Cost is visible: "months" of rebuilding work and accepting a "faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth." Minor gap: the escalation is more gradual accumulation than sharp reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens but softening the pressure curve slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the marriage of death and life in the orchard-cemetery, not from abstract statement. The sundial's inscription—"Time returns all wanderers to their purpose"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Miriam's interrupted journeys without moralizing. The piece commits fully to its premise (roots embracing bones, fruit falling among the dead) and follows implications without retreat. Recurring images (sundial, roots, shadows) accumulate meaning: the shadow moving across names "marking not just hours but the slow restoration." One small deduction: the phrase "a faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth" edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than letting the image speak, though it remains grounded in Miriam's prior struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean and stable throughout; narrative distance matches Miriam's knowledge state (historian's recognition of the bronze, grandmother's role). Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—"catacomb orchard," "keeper of hours," "diaspora's circular path"—without register drift. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads landscape through ancestral memory and historical layers. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Yakov's lines ("You came back," "She knew you'd come back") carry subtext of inevitability. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the ending when Miriam's interior reflection ("something Miriam hadn't known she'd lost") modulates to the closing image. Minor deduction: the phrase "cautious enchantment" appears both as descriptor and internal state, creating slight label-echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "bees building hives in the hollow of an ancient ossuary" advances setting, tone, and world logic simultaneously). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs (shadow, sundial, bones). Minor loop detected: "interrupted journeys" in paragraph three is paraphrased as "every departure had been a return postponed" later, creating conceptual redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("bronze surface green with age," "trees twisting through gaps in the limestone") without overwriting. One small deduction for stock metaphor: "ancient olive trees twisting" edges toward familiar phrasing, though the specificity of "roots embracing skulls and femurs" rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where life grows through death offers a fresh synthesis of diaspora-return narrative and memento mori landscape. The sundial inscribed with names rather than numbers is a specific, non-obvious detail that transforms the timekeeper trope. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging—villagers harvest olives from branches through ribcages, press oil in shadow of crypts—without retreating to metaphor-only treatment. Transformation test: the emotional arc (return, recognition, commitment to rebuild) is tightly bound to this particular setting and the grandmother's sundial; generic substitution would collapse the logic. Minor deduction: the interrupted-journeys-as-dream motif (trains dissolving, stairs becoming waterfalls) is somewhat familiar in return narratives, though the integration with the sundial's circular time elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam (diaspora returnee) drives the narrative: her choice to fit the gnomon, clear more soil, and commit to "months" of rebuilding work creates the key turn and the ending's charge. She appears immediately and her agency shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial base is handled in three distinct beats: Miriam brushing soil in the opening, Yakov producing the gnomon mid-story, and together fitting it to reveal the inscribed names at the ending. Its specific property (inscribed with names, not numbers) is irreplaceable and charges the final image. Removing it would break the story's logic of circular time and the grandmother's message.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys are introduced early (dreams of trains dissolving, stairs becoming waterfalls) and the ending reweights them ("every departure had been a return postponed"). The concept shapes Miriam's motivation but does not narrow options in a middle beat; its pressure is more thematic accumulation than on-page tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears once as "her curiosity warming despite the chill," enabling her to follow Yakov deeper into the grove. The trait does not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it functions as permission for exposition rather than a driver of conflict.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rebuild is signaled early ("we've been digging for three weeks"), executed mid-story (villagers reinforcing the tomb with roots as pillars), and shapes the ending commitment ("The work of rebuilding would take months"). The action is irreplaceable—swapping for "restore" or "excavate" would soften the theme of growth through integration. It drives two beats and contributes closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named mid-story ("This was his method—purposeful wandering through the transformed landscape") and demonstrated as Yakov leads Miriam through the grove, letting her discover the tomb and sundial. The method shapes one key beat (the discovery sequence) and primes the ending's commitment to "mapping the wandering paths." It is present in closure via the phrase "wanderers to their purpose."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (tree roots snaking between bones) is introduced in paragraph two and pressures every major choice: roots lifting tombs create the excavation site, the transformed landscape forces Yakov's wandering method, and the marriage of death/life charges Miriam's final commitment. Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic, theme, and closure image. It supplies the resources (roots as pillars, olives ripening) that redefine Miriam's faith.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three weeks" of prior digging, "months" of future rebuilding) brackets the story and the afternoon sun casting "its first shadow" creates a live moment at the fitting of the gnomon. Time does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat but provides scale for the commitment's cost. The sundial's function (measuring time) thematically doubles the element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Restoring lost faith is dramatized through Miriam's progression from "faith had meant anything more than survival" to "a faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth." The motivation is conflicted (she fled faith twenty years ago, yet returns) and the ending choice (kneeling, committing to rebuild) enacts the restoration with visible cost (months of labor). It drives the arc and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cautious enchantment is established early ("cautious enchantment of the place settling into her chest") and modulates with pressure: initial trembling, warming curiosity, and final kneeling commitment. The tone charges the final image—"olives ripened on branches that had learned to grow through tombs"—without flattening into static wonder. It coheres through turns and fits the accumulative lens.</comment>
