<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shows depth through her self-narration ritual and concrete decisions to place spheres, but her motivation lacks sufficient internal contradiction—the choice to return and create feels pre-decided without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The couple's entrance provides relationship pressure, yet their interaction remains brief and illustrative rather than testing Marina's stance with cost. Embodied emotion is present in gestures with the bookmark and torch, but the therapy-adjacent language ("hearts learning to thaw," "safe vessels for unspoken questions") flattens several beats that warrant more particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Marina's installation transforms the control room and the couple's arrival crystallizes the space's new function with felt cost implicit in her years of displacement. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines (who/where/when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the couple asks "Is it safe?" and Marina's response reweights her solitary work into active service. The cost—her abandoned prestigious studio and the weight of returning—is legible but somewhat diffused across reflection rather than concentrated at the ending beat, limiting the closure's punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned control room supplies concrete constraints: dead monitors become shelves, the emergency shutdown button anchors a sphere placement, melting ice tracks seasonal time. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting of the control panel and torch workspace charges the final image by transforming authority-space into tender inquiry-space. Sensory detail (visible breath, dripping ice, blue torch flame) is selective and filtered through Marina's professional attention, avoiding catalog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating safe containers for questions about living in disaster's shadow—is signaled early and tightens when the couple arrives, forcing Marina to articulate her purpose under direct human pressure. Her response narrows the abstract goal into immediate action (handing them a sphere, offering paper). The three-year gap and abandoned studio provide backstory cost, but the on-page price at closure is muted: the couple's compliance feels convenient rather than testing Marina's installation with genuine resistance or complication that would raise visible stakes in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the control-room-as-tender-space transformation and the glass-thaw metaphor, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final exchange. However, "Safety is not given, it is crafted, one careful breath at a time" edges toward platitude, and the recurring ice/thaw/warmth imagery, while purposeful, accumulates without sharp conceptual repricing—the final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it with a non-literal answer. The bookmark motif connects past containment to present inquiry but remains illustrative rather than forcing Marina into a harder question about her father's role or her own complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Marina's perceptual signature—glassblower's attention to heat, patience, transformation—is consistent and voice-specific. The self-narration device ("First, I must clear the workspace," "The torch ignites") creates purposeful ceremonial distance but becomes repetitive across multiple beats without modulation under rising pressure. Dialogue from the couple is functional and brief; Marina's spoken line carries subtext but the phrasing "Safety is not given, it is crafted" feels writerly rather than spoken in crisis. Psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing Marina's work or the thematic frame. However, paraphrase loops appear: "each particle a former certainty" / "each sphere contained a hollow chamber" / "each one catching the last light" recycle the "each [noun] [state]" template across the piece, creating cadence monotony (−0.4). The phrase "strange comfort in the ritual" and "dangerous beauty of transformation" edge toward stock metaphor in reflective beats. Figurative language (glass as heart, thaw as emotional recovery) is consistent but dense across consecutive sentences in the middle third without variance, dulling propulsion slightly. No major causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7 per the routing rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glassblower-in-Chernobyl frame offers a fresh synthesis of craft, disaster, and emotional containment. The installation concept (spheres holding written questions) is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—solitary artist returns to poisoned land to create healing space—closely follows a redemption-through-art template without a sharp moral complication or cost that transforms the premise in the final third. The couple's immediate acceptance and Marina's untroubled authority flatten potential friction. The thaw/heart/glass metaphor system is coherent but predictable once established, and the ending confirms the premise rather than offering a disruptive inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina (contemplative glassblower) drives key turns: her decision to narrate aloud establishes the ritual frame early, her sphere placements structure the middle, and her interaction with the couple at the end shifts her solitary practice into active service. Present in all three phases (setup, development, closure). Specificity: her glassblowing knowledge shapes her perception and actions throughout (flame color, cooling patience, breath technique). Cost: her abandoned capital studio is referenced but not dramatized on the page as a present trade-off; the ending choice to hand over a sphere feels generous rather than testing her reserves or forcing a sacrifice. Two gates strong (setup, closure participation), middle involvement steady, causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cracked leather bookmark appears early (setup met), is handled in the opening third ("withdrew... placed it tenderly"), and returns in reflection mid-story ("The bookmark caught her eye"). However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource under pressure—it remains a talisman and memory anchor without altering Marina's tactics or enabling/blocking an action. Its meaning does not shift between appearances; each mention restates its memorial function (father's radiation readings, containment metaphor). Two touches across beats (early and mid), but both are descriptive rather than causal. Ornamental use (−0.6), no closure participation (cap 2.8 avoided because it appears twice, lifting slightly), swappable with any father-linked keepsake (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The thawing heart as core concept shapes the dominant stake (creating space for emotional recovery) and is woven through imagery (spring thaw, ice melting, warmth returning). It anchors Marina's narration ("just as the heart remembers warmth after the longest winter") and the ending's framing ("hearts learning to thaw"). Setup strong (ice imagery opens the piece), development present (thaw metaphor recurs in middle beats), closure linkage clear (final paragraph invokes the concept directly). However, the concept functions more as thematic resonance than on-page constraint—it does not narrow Marina's tactical options or force a choice with visible cost. The thaw is descriptive and symbolic rather than mechanically integral to plot causality. Strong thematic presence with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" as an attribute is present in Marina's self-narration ritual (thoughtful precision, ceremonial movements) and her spirited commitment to return despite danger. Setup met (early narration establishes the dual quality), middle development visible (her deliberate sphere-crafting paired with bold spatial reclamation), closure participation indirect (the tone persists in her response to the couple). However, the trait does not create a specific trade-off or constrain an action with cost—her thoughtfulness and spirit align rather than conflict, so no friction emerges. The attribute describes her manner but does not force a difficult choice where one quality must yield to the other. Label-present without on-page cost (−0.6), swappable phrasing (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandon (the action) drives Marina's backstory and present stakes: she abandoned her prestigious studio post-evacuation, and the piece hinges on her return to abandoned space. Setup strong (the furnace and plant are described as abandoned in the opening lines, her studio departure mentioned early), development clear (her work transforms the abandoned control room across the middle), closure shaped by it (the room's shift from abandonment to inhabited purpose charges the final image). Two beats: the initial decision to abandon (past) and the present reclamation. Causal pressure high—without her prior departure and the site's abandonment, the story's core tension (return to poisoned ground) collapses. Irreplaceability strong. Cost visible in her three-year gap and the couple's fear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks (the method) is signaled early and sustained: Marina narrates her workspace clearing, torch lighting, glass gathering, and sphere rotation aloud to the empty room. Setup met (first third establishes the self-narration pattern), development present (mid-story beats continue the ritual narration), closure participation indirect (she narrates softly while the couple writes, maintaining the method to the end). The method shapes her characterization and tone but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter an outcome—her narration is expressive rather than instrumental. It could be removed without breaking plot causality, though it would flatten voice. Present across beats (three touches: opening clearing, torch work, final sphere creation), but ornamental in function (−0.5). Lyric consistency partially offsets swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control room supplies the story's spatial and conceptual foundation. Setup immediate (first sentence anchors the cold furnace and control room), development strong (dead monitors become shelves, the emergency shutdown button anchors a sphere placement, the space's authority-history pressures Marina's transformation project), closure decisive (the room's conversion from containment-of-reactions to containment-of-questions charges the final image and the couple's arrival). The setting provides resources (console surfaces, broken windows for light) and constrains choices (Marina must clear debris, work amid radiation warnings). Causal pressure high: the control room's past function as a site of failed containment directly opposes and elevates Marina's present aim. Irreplaceable—any other ruin would lack the control/containment thematic charge. Cost implicit in returning to danger.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (during ice melting) is established early ("March air," "spring thaw had begun") and recurs in environmental beats ("ice continued its patient surrender," "water pooling"). Setup met, development present (ice/thaw imagery tracks across the piece), closure participation weak (the final paragraph mentions ice but does not tighten a decision via the timeframe). However, the melting does not impose a live clock or deadline that alters Marina's tactics—she works at her own pace without seasonal pressure forcing choices. The thaw functions thematically (parallel to emotional warming) more than causally. Two touches (opening and recurring mentions), lyric resonance moderate, but swappable with any spring return without breaking plot (−0.5). No felt urgency or time-cost on the page (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation (to craft safe zones for inquiry) is dramatized through her sphere-making and articulated when the couple arrives ("Write your real question... The glass will hold it until you're ready"). Setup clear (early narration explains the hollow chambers "perfectly sized to hold a question"), development strong (middle beats show her crafting and placing seventeen spheres throughout the room), closure shaped by it (handing the couple a sphere and explaining its function crystallizes the motivation under direct human pressure). The motivation drives her return and her labor. Friction mild: her goal is generous and uncontested, so no competing want complicates her choice. Cost present in her three-year displacement and the risk of returning, but the on-page moment lacks a sharp trade-off. Causal pressure solid, specificity high, irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Weighty lightness as tone is present throughout: Marina's voice balances gravity (nuclear disaster, three-year absence, radiation warnings) with gentle optimism (hope, possibility, tender transformation). Setup met (opening lines pair cold furnace with ceremonial voice), development sustained (middle beats layer memorial weight with patient craft-joy), closure participation clear (her final line about safety being crafted "one careful breath at a time" holds both registers). The tone modulates minimally—lightness does not sharpen under the couple's arrival, and weight does not deepen when confronting the shutdown button. Coherence strong, but static delivery across pressure points (−0.3). The dual register charges the final image by framing fragile possibility against disaster-history, lifting it into lyric resonance despite limited modulation.</comment>
