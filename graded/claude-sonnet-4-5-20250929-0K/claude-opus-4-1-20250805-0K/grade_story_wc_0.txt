<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's transition from neutron star research to greenhouse observation is motivated, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract parallels ("matter compressed beyond comprehension") rather than embodied contradiction. The resignation choice arrives without visible internal conflict—no scene shows her weighing career against discovery. Her colleagues are sketch figures used to contrast her stance rather than applying pressure, and the butterfly-dust epiphany feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates observations (butterfly dust patterns, mold fractals, seed sprouting) toward a final conceptual repricing where Elena reweights decay as instruction. Closure lands on the page with the final notebook entry, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no concrete path is foreclosed, no relationship severed, no material price paid. The piece teaches its accretive pattern early and holds it, but the ending reweights premise without visible sacrifice, landing as theme statement rather than resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly particularized (cracked glass, mud-caked benches, rot smell) and constrains Elena's choices by offering an alternative research site. Butterfly dust accumulation creates micro-environments that explain plant survival, directly shaping her documentation method. The damaged structure charges the final image when contractors arrive and find her notes predicting structural failures. Spatial choreography remains clear across visits, and sensory detail is purposeful rather than catalog-like.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena's pursuit of patient observation over aggressive analysis—is signaled early and tightens when she resigns, but that choice occurs off-page in summary ("submitted her resignation"). No on-page reversal dramatizes the tension between career security and greenhouse discovery; the supervisor's accusation is reported dialogue, not a scene that tests commitment. The contractors' arrival provides a late complication, but Elena's stance crystallization (remaining in her corner) is told rather than shown with visible cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—decay as instruction, patience over drama—emerges organically from butterfly dust patterns and greenhouse transformation. The final notebook entry "Decay is not drama. It is instruction" states the thesis explicitly rather than letting the image resonate, dropping the score. The piece resists tidy morals elsewhere (colleagues' "theatrical mourning" vs. Elena's quiet documentation), and the contrast between neutron star density and butterfly-wing lightness offers a non-obvious thematic synthesis. One structural strength: the theme integrates with the core concept (gradual change) without feeling imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elena with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during reflective passages ("preprocessing reality without mathematics as an intermediary," "requests for patient, humble observation") that feel more authorial than character-particular. The perceptual signature—physicist noticing gravitational lensing in dust patterns, stellar formation in mold—is specific and voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext. Purposeful compression in the resignation beat is efficient, but the final paragraph's "The butterfly dust shows us how" shifts from Elena's idiom to didactic closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, but several beats loop thematically without advancing pressure: "She'd spent years studying objects so dense…" and "Now she understood that sometimes the lightest touch…" restate the neutron-star/butterfly contrast. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "Each day revealed…" / "Each particle of wing dust became…" / "The butterflies continued their work, and she continued hers…" The final paragraph stacks three summary-reflective sentences that paraphrase the ending's meaning rather than trusting the image. No major grammar or logic errors; information density is moderate but could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—physicist finds meaning in post-flood greenhouse decay—offers a fresh juxtaposition, but the emotional arc (career-to-calling conversion) follows a recognizable template without sharp transformation. The butterfly dust as research method is specific, yet the piece telegraphs its thematic destination early and delivers it without surprise. The "academic discovers humble truth in nature" frame is familiar; the neutron-star/butterfly-wing contrast is the freshest inflection, but it's stated more than dramatized in charged action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena (neutron star researcher) is present throughout and her professional background colors perception (gravitational lensing, stellar formation). She makes one key choice—resigning—but it occurs off-page in summary. Her decision to remain in the greenhouse when contractors arrive is described rather than dramatized. The character is functional and her expertise shapes observation, but her choices do not create on-page turns with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Butterfly wing dust appears in multiple beats: first observation (catching sunlight, settling in patterns), accumulated micro-environments (trapping moisture, reflecting heat), dense corner patterns (Elena's research station), and final documentation (predicting structural failures). It enables Elena's documentation method and charges the closure when contractors study her dust-pattern notes. The object is causally active across the arc, though its specific properties could be swapped for other accumulating particles (pollen, spores) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gradual change is the story's organizing principle, shaping both stakes and structure. Mold advances in fractal patterns, seeds sprout, butterflies multiply—each beat demonstrates slow transformation. Elena's shift from "aggressive analysis" to "patient observation" mirrors the concept, and the greenhouse's six-week evolution provides the timeframe for her research method. The concept is not merely thematic but alters Elena's tactics (daily visits, meticulous documentation) and the contractors' decision (demolition postponed). Removing gradual change would require a different conflict engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears twice as a label: once in the opening section ("how to preprocess reality without mathematics") and again mid-story ("Elena had learned to preprocess reality through a different lens"). The attribute describes her shift from data-reduction to direct observation but does not constrain a specific on-page action with cost. It functions as thematic commentary rather than a trait that enables or limits a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decay is causally central: the flood's aftermath creates the ruined greenhouse, mold patterns teach Elena about natural processes, and plant death/survival demonstrates the system's self-healing blueprint. Elena's research pivots from neutron star collapse (theoretical decay) to biological decay (observable transformation). The final turn—contractors postponing demolition—depends on Elena's documentation of decay patterns predicting structural failures. Removing decay would collapse the story's logic; no easy swap exists.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are signaled early (settling in geometries, creating air-current maps) and shape Elena's middle-arc tactics (daily documentation, constructing observation stations in dense-pattern areas). The method matters at closure: her notes reveal dust patterns that predict structural failures, halting demolition. The mechanics are visible—dust accumulation creates micro-environments, maps circulation routes—and the method is irreplaceable to the story's logic. It could score higher if the dust-mapping technique were demonstrated in one on-page problem-solving beat rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is indispensable: it provides the decay substrate Elena studies, isolates her from department politics, and supplies the butterfly habitat that generates dust patterns. The structure's post-flood state creates the research opportunity (mold, seeds, survivor plants) and the threat (demolition). At closure, Elena's documentation of the greenhouse's "natural renovation" prevents its destruction. The setting constrains choices (where she works, what she observes) and directly shapes the ending's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The flood occurred three weeks before the opening, and Elena's visits span six weeks to her resignation, establishing a clear temporal progression. However, the timeframe functions more as background context than active pressure—no deadline tightens her research, and the contractors' arrival is not tied to a tracked clock. The passage of time enables gradual accumulation (butterflies multiply, mold advances) but does not force tactical choices or escalate stakes in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elena's desire to "strip needless drama" is dramatized through contrast: she avoids colleagues' "theatrical mourning" and "performative despair," choosing the greenhouse's quiet transformation. The motivation shapes her daily visits and resignation, but internal friction is minimal—no scene shows her tempted by grant sympathy or prestige. The desire is coherent and drives action, yet it reads more as settled stance than conflicted choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative and reverent throughout, modulating from clinical observation (opening physics department scene) to lyric wonder (butterfly dust catching sunlight) to quiet conviction (final notebook entry). The humility is consistent—Elena learning rather than declaring, observing rather than imposing. The tone charges the final image when her documentation halts demolition, validating patient attention. However, the tone remains relatively static; peak pressure (resignation, contractors' arrival) does not sharpen or test the contemplative register.</comment>
