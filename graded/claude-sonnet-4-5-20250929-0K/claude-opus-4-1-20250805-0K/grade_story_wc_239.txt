<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaia's motivation to witness and arbitrate remains abstract; we see her walking and understanding but never struggling with a choice that costs her something concrete. The internal contradiction promised by "spiral arbitration" never manifests as embodied conflict—she moves through realizations without resistance or error. The final smile and recursive forgetting feel like asserted wisdom rather than earned transformation. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Kaia, temple library, universe ending) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered etymologies and overlapping apocalypses until the final dictionary entry reweights the premise. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—"the question that answers itself" reconfigures the cosmic cycle—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing appears on the page. The "Continue" command gestures toward ongoing recursion but lacks the felt price that would elevate this to Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's impossible geometry and "wanderingly exact" corridors supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Kaia's trained perception. The dictionary as micro-setting object constrains her path (etymologies whisper directions) and charges the final image when it scatters like seeds. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the non-Euclidean premise. The setting pressures choice and participates directly in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the broader temple architecture remains more atmospheric than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusion—is signaled early but never tightens into a choice with competing costs. The universe's "hiccup" recurs as atmospheric detail rather than escalating pressure; Kaia's walk through the library meets no obstacle, reversal, or trade-off. The overlapping apocalypses and the dictionary's final entry arrive as revelations, not as turns earned by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; understanding simply accumulates until the conceptual repricing concludes the journey without a felt cost that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—opposition as illusion, beginnings/endings as möbius constructs—emerges organically from the spiral-walk structure and dictionary etymologies rather than assertion. The final image (blank page, "Continue") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract philosophical language ("maya," "cosmic illusion") and the protagonist articulates theme directly ("opposition itself was the illusion") in ways that approach explanatory rather than embodied demonstration. The resounding-hush motif charges several beats but remains more conceptual than grounded in specific, irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaia notices etymologies, geometries, and paradoxes in a scholar's idiom—and diction reflects her training. The prose carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture with controlled rhythm. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("This was why the Spiral Arbitrators had developed their practice") that tells rather than dramatizes, and the vocabulary at peak beats ("unraveling," "unified," "transcendent") edges toward abstract rather than concrete embodiment. Purposeful compression is present and mostly legible, but some lines ("a sound that contained all sounds and no sound") repeat conceptual framings without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (möbius strip, nautilus spiral, helix) serves theme without overwhelming clarity. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "wanderingly exact precision" echoed by "wanderingly exact path," and the concept of unified opposites restated across multiple paragraphs without new detail. Template cadence in the middle third ("She had witnessed... She had perhaps... She began...") flattens momentum. The closing image is clean, but the phrase "resounding hush" recurs four times, three as identical construction, reducing specificity. Minor filter-verb stacks ("began transforming," "started dissolving") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—librarian-arbitrator walks spiral to resolve cosmic paradox—draws heavily on familiar mystical-library and cyclical-universe templates without transforming them through specific, non-obvious choices. The "seventeen iterations" and "dictionary as instruction manual" offer surface freshness, but the emotional and plot arc (scholar realizes truth, accepts recursion, smiles) follows a well-worn enlightenment structure. The "wanderingly exact" path and overlapping apocalypses are conceptually intriguing yet remain abstract; swapping names and setting would leave the arc largely unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes beyond the premise's declarative surface.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaia is present throughout and her role as "end of history witness" frames the premise. However, her choices—walking the library, reading etymologies, placing the dictionary—are reactive and contemplative rather than decisive turns that alter tactics. She observes and understands but does not face a dilemma or pay a cost that forecloses a path. Present by setup, involved in middle (walking) and ending (placing dictionary), but does not create key pressure through decision. Caps at ~6.0 for functional but low-agency involvement; subtract −0.4 for observation-without-decision, −0.8 for no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dictionary appears in the opening beat (clutched against chest), guides the middle walk (whispered etymologies, falls open to "maya"), and returns decisively at closure (scatters like seeds, reassembles with "Continue"). Handled in at least three distinct beats, its changing state (full → scattering → blank-except-one-word) reweights meaning and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Subtract −0.3 for late-middle introduction of its instruction function (the "words... were instructions" arrives halfway through). Strong integration but falls short of indispensable; the story could substitute another repository of knowledge with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration is explained early ("walking contradictory truths until they unified"), shapes Kaia's middle tactic (walking outward while journeying inward), and the closure explicitly enacts it (unifying witness/witnessed, ending/beginning). Present in setup, development (her walk follows spiral logic), and payoff (final unification). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0 (it narrows her method), closure linkage +1.4. Subtract −0.4 for exposition-heavy delivery ("ancient practice of...") and −0.6 for swappability (another paradox-resolution metaphor could replace it). Reaches ~6.8 for shaping stakes and the ending image but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" is introduced early ("moved through the corridors with wanderingly exact precision") and echoed once more ("universe's wanderingly exact path"), but the trait functions as descriptive flourish rather than constraint. No on-page action shows a visible trade-off between wandering and exactness; the phrase labels the style without enabling or foreclosing a choice. Present in setup, mentioned in ending reflection, but no middle beat where the attribute costs her something or alters tactics. Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6, no cost −0.5. Caps at ~5.5; round to 5.1 for label-only execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unify" is spoken aloud at a pivotal beat ("she read aloud, and the word became action"), triggering the overlapping apocalypses and library transformation. The action drives the major turn and participates in closure (the final state is unified witness/witnessed). Present in middle development and ending. One key beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Subtract −0.5 for late first appearance (past midpoint) and −0.4 for swappability (another resolution verb—"reconcile," "integrate"—could substitute). Lyric reprise (early etymologies seed "unify") adds +0.3. Reaches ~6.3 for shaping the climax but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("journeying inward while walking out"), enacted in the middle walk ("walked outward... while simultaneously traveling inward"), and shapes the closure unification. The mechanics matter: her dual movement enables the spiral path and the final merging of observer/observed. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2 (it defines her tactic under stress), closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6. Subtract −0.3 for exposition framing. Reaches ~7.4 for necessity across beats and ending; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple library frames all action, its "impossible geometry" and "expanding rings" provide the spatial logic for Kaia's spiral walk, and its transformation (walls becoming transparent) participates in closure. The setting is not mere backdrop; it supplies the structure that enables her method and the final revelation. Present in all three gates. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4 (the architecture guides her path), closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7. Subtract −0.3 for some postcard description in the opening. Reaches ~7.6 for essential structural and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "universe's hiccup" and "three thousand heartbeats" establish a countdown early, but the timeframe never tightens decisions or tactics on the page. Kaia walks and reads at her own pace; no beat shows her racing the clock or sacrificing depth for speed. The hiccup recurs as atmospheric marker, not pressure. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, but no middle beat where time alters moves. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3. Subtract −0.7 for ornamental use, −0.6 for no tactical pressure, −0.4 for vague tracking. Caps at ~4.2 for declared but non-functional time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kaia's desire to unravel cosmic illusions is stated early and drives her walk through the library. The motivation explains her presence and her final acceptance of recursion. However, it remains told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no beat shows her tempted to stop, doubt the cost, or choose another path. Present in setup (she's there to arbitrate), development (her walk pursues understanding), and ending (she achieves insight). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. Subtract −0.6 for told-only delivery, −0.5 for no friction between wants and costs, −0.3 for swappability (another enlightenment goal could substitute). Reaches ~5.9 for functional but unearned motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" is introduced early as "a resounding hush that made the air itself listen," recurs at the climax ("a sound that contained all sounds and no sound, perfectly embodying the resounding hush"), and charges the final state ("that resounding hush, witness and witnessed unified"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure, though it leans heavily on paradox and abstract phrasing. Present in all three gates. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.4. Subtract −0.5 for identical phrasing across beats (reduces fresh charge), −0.4 for ornamental middle use (the laugh description), −0.3 for static mood in places. Reaches ~6.6 for purposeful recurrence that charges the final image but not transformative.</comment>
