<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation is dramatized through concrete actions (sorting seeds, building cairns, prodding the speck), but her internal process remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The arrival at "mossy delight" and "understanding" reads as asserted epiphany without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting in scene. The grandmother's legacy provides backstory motivation, but the protagonist's choices feel predetermined by the magical object rather than emerging from internal conflict. No visible cost accompanies her awakening—she gains abilities and purpose without foreclosing anything.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning (seeds, leaves, monuments, moss). Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Ashen Skyborne Arbor, seed-sorting, Mira), satisfying the early test. However, closure lacks felt cost: Mira's transformation is pure gain—silver hair, new eyes, moss signature, translator role—without on-page renunciation or price. The final image reconfigures her purpose but the "burden" mentioned is immediately reframed as "delight," undercutting any tension. The RR attempt (transformation) does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Arbor's petrified branches, cloud-drinking roots, and upward-falling leaves create a vivid, inverted ecology that remains consistent. Spatial choreography stays clear (workbench, sorting bowls, gaps in the arbor). The moonstone speck and seeds function as micro-setting objects that constrain Mira's attention and action. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere rather than shaping tactical choices—the environment enables her transformation but doesn't create obstacles or force trade-offs. The moss growth at the end charges the space but arrives after the key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the message between earth and sky—is signaled early but remains abstract. Mira faces no meaningful opposition or cost: she doesn't report the speck (no consequence shown), builds monuments (no one stops her), and awakens her gift (pure upgrade). The leaves' "warnings or promises" distinction is posed but never tested through choice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight options; here it simply accumulates description until Mira achieves understanding. No tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the trees-ascending-or-descending choice and the "tiny monuments to forgotten things" motif. The earth-to-sky conversation provides conceptual scaffolding without overt moralizing. However, the ending resolves into celebration rather than ambiguity: Mira becomes translator, the arbor creaks with "satisfaction," and her purpose is "mossy delight." The piece gestures at a choice (ascend or return to earth) but doesn't dramatize the cost of either path. The final image offers transformation but not a non-literal answer to the central tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric register throughout with distinct perceptual signature ("seeds hummed frequencies," "roots drank from clouds"). Psychic distance stays stable in close third. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with immediate perception under pressure: "euphoria of finally comprehending one's purpose" and "decoder of gravity's rebellious children" read as authorial summation rather than character-filtered thought. The prose commits to its pattern-taught style, but some passages (final paragraph especially) drift into thematic annotation. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-taught justification, creating density overload: "bridges of bone," "bell made of starlight," "fractals of emerald joy," "gravity's rebellious children." The final paragraph stacks three restatements of Mira's new role (translator/keeper/decoder) with minimal added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear ("part of her story, part of the regional folklore"; "what was and what might be" echoes "past meets prophecy"). Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She had become... She would teach... The seeds sang... This was..." Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("prodigal trees," "vertical world") undercuts immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The skyborne-arbor premise and seed-sorting occupation offer fresh texture, and the upward-falling leaves invert expectation. However, the core arc—ordinary worker discovers magical artifact, undergoes transformation, gains new purpose—follows a familiar template without complicating the emotional calculus. Mira's awakening is frictionless gain with no sacrifice or doubt. The grandmother's legacy and Windkeepers' tales provide mythic flavor but function as exposition rather than lived contradiction. Moss as "living signature of joy" is vivid but doesn't transform the stakes. Transformation test: swap seed-sorter for another archival role, moonstone for another magical object, and the emotional beats remain unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira sorts seeds (setup), builds cairns around the speck (middle choice), and prods it with a needle (key action). By the ending she has "new purpose" and teaches others. Present across beats and shapes the middle monument-building choice, but her decisions feel enabled by the moonstone's magic rather than creating key pressure or cost. Swappable with another archivist/curator role without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstone speck appears early (first-third beat), Mira prods it (middle), and it dissolves into her skin at closure, becoming "part of her story." Handled in multiple beats and returns with reweighted meaning as catalyst for transformation. However, it functions primarily as magical plot device—its specific properties (moonstone/weeping moon) are ornamental; any transformative artifact would serve the same function. Closure linkage is present but the cost tied to it is unclear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Regional folklore (Windkeepers' tales, seeds holding syllables, moon's weeping) frames the world and Mira's interpretive role. The concept shapes her understanding that "each forgotten thing held part of a larger message." Present early and echoed at closure ("part of the regional folklore that would be whispered"). However, folklore functions as thematic texture rather than constraining choices—Mira's options aren't limited by folkloric rules, and the ending adds to folklore rather than testing it. More atmosphere than stake-shaper.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is stated as a bloodline trait: "the gift of interpretation that emerged transformed always, never quite the same in each generation." This labels Mira's change but doesn't constrain action—the transformation is presented as inevitable inheritance without on-page cost or trade-off. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through choices where transformation creates friction or limits. Mentioned in one beat, no visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Prod" is the action that triggers the key turn: "She prodded the moonstone speck with her smallest sorting needle, and it rang like a bell made of starlight. The sound drew the leaves closer, and suddenly Mira understood." This single action unlocks her understanding and begins her transformation. Causally significant and shapes the middle-to-ending transition. However, it's one brief gesture; the subsequent beats rely on the speck's effects rather than further prodding. Major turn traces to it but could be replaced with "touch," "hold," or similar contact verb with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Building tiny monuments to forgotten things" appears early as grandmother's practice, Mira builds seed-cairns around the speck in the middle, and by dawn she has "built seventeen monuments, each one a translation of a leaf's message." The method is signaled, repeated across beats, and provides the frame for her work at closure. It shapes her interpretive attempts and becomes her teaching tool. The monuments' specific mechanics (stacking seeds, translating leaves) drive her transformation process. Essential to the ending's depiction of her new role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is established early with vivid details (petrified branches, cloud-roots, gaps). It provides the stage for all action and the "ancient satisfaction" response at the end. The setting's inverted physics (upward-falling leaves, roots drinking clouds) creates atmosphere and enables the magical events. However, the arbor itself doesn't pressure Mira's choices—it facilitates rather than constrains. The workbench and gaps supply spatial anchors but don't alter tactics. Present across the story and integral to the concept, but more backdrop than active force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is stated as "that twilight hour" at the opening and echoed in the final paragraph's "perpetual hush." The timeframe establishes mood and links to the arbor's whispering secrets. However, time itself doesn't tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency. "By dawn" marks passage but Mira works at her own pace without time-driven stakes. The hush functions as atmospheric bracket rather than tactical constraint. Present at opening and closing but doesn't shape the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Decoding the message in falling leaves becomes explicit when "she prodded the moonstone speck... and suddenly Mira understood what her grandmother had tried to teach her." The leaves' patterns form "warnings or promises" and "letters from the earth to its prodigal trees." This motivation drives her monument-building in the second half and her final role as translator. However, the desire is activated by the magical speck rather than arising from internal conflict. Mira's goal shifts from sorting seeds to decoding without friction or cost. Dramatized in the middle-to-end beats but the transition feels granted rather than fought for.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mossy delight is defined explicitly: "the euphoria of finally comprehending one's purpose." Moss grows on her workbench in "delicate fractals of emerald joy" and becomes her "living signature," transforming the arbor's palette. The tone aims for wonder and celebration throughout. However, the single-note joy lacks modulation—no fear, doubt, or cost tempers the delight. Under pressure (discovering the speck, understanding the leaves), the tone remains elevated and celebratory rather than intensifying or complicating. Present at closure but static rather than charged by the stakes.</comment>
