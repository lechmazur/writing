<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's professional expertise and waiting methodology are established, but her interiority remains thinly rendered—mostly assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "understanding finally that some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through summary rather than a choice under pressure. Chen provides minimal secondary pressure; he exists primarily as an exposition receiver. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost; Mira arrives at belonging without foreclosing a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates detail (burnt feather, alignment, city glow, fish patterns, jellies) toward a resonant final image, but the closure lacks felt cost—Mira's realization is declarative and her stance shift carries no visible price or foreclosed path. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The city's luminous respite unfolds as observation rather than a pressure point that narrows her options, weakening the tightening requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater research facility and Thymal ruins are vividly rendered with specific, purpose-driven details: bioluminescent algae, glass dome, bacterial light channels, embedded minerals. The burnt feather in the observation tank constrains Mira's interpretation and charges the final sequence, satisfying the 9+ gate at the micro-setting level. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (stellar alignment, luminous patterns). Spatial choreography through facility chambers and the dome is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the city's celestial mechanism—is signaled early, but escalation remains observational rather than driven by Mira's agency under pressure. The alignment happens to her; she waits and watches rather than making a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The "luminous respite" sequence provides atmospheric accumulation but no reversal or tightening that forecloses a path. The ending crystallizes her stance (inhabiting mystery) without a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of belonging-through-observation versus solving emerges from repeated waiting imagery and the final "inhabited" line, but the insight is stated rather than earned through a non-literal image or action. The burnt feather functions as a ceremonial bridge across centuries, adding specificity, yet its dissolution "by morning" is told rather than shown. Subtext operates in the fish-as-constellation choreography. The final paragraph's "understanding finally" reads as direct thematic statement rather than resonant indirection, lowering the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature: she traces constellations in condensation, watches for what machines can't measure, and filters the city through astrological metaphor. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("shadowseam wonder," "dialogue between sky and abyss"). Chen's brief dialogue serves his goal (requesting evidence) and stays distinct in register. No head-hopping or unmotivated psychic leaps. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong: varied syntax, concrete nouns, clean grammar. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Two minor issues: "She was softly ingenious in her approach" tells the trait rather than showing it through action, and the phrase "what scholars called Thymal—though its true name had dissolved into the sea" carries slight passive scaffolding. The final paragraph's "understanding finally" and "feeling the vibration" lean toward summary rather than concrete image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater-ruins-plus-astrology synthesis offers a fresh angle, and the burnt feather as ceremonial key adds specificity. However, the emotional arc (observer reaches belonging through passive witnessing) follows a familiar contemplative template without a non-obvious turn. The luminous-respite mechanism and fish-as-constellations provide vivid world detail, but Mira's path from isolation to connection lacks the risk or transformation that would elevate originality. The "mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" insight reads close to a stock epiphany for contemplative scholarly characters.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession frames her perceptual filter and enables her to interpret the burnt feather and alignment. She makes one implicit choice—to descend to the observation dome and watch rather than intervene—but this choice does not alter tactics or impose visible cost. The trait is primarily observational; her astrology shapes understanding but not a pivotal decision with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in the opening (observation tank), is interpreted midway (ceremonial wing key), and is noted to dissolve by morning in the final section—three beats. It enables Mira's recognition and bridges past to present, but its dissolution is told rather than shown on the page, and removing it would weaken but not break the luminous-respite sequence. Specificity and reweighting are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "luminous respite" is named, described through the green radiance and gathering fish, and contextually linked to ancient texts. However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a stake or tactical constraint. Mira does not pursue, activate, or risk anything to engage it; it unfolds as a scheduled celestial event she witnesses. Present and thematic but not choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The phrase "softly ingenious" appears once as narrative assertion ("She was softly ingenious in her approach, never forcing connections...") without on-page demonstration through a specific action or tradeoff. The waiting methodology it describes recurs, but the attribute itself is label-only and does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears explicitly when Mira and Chen watch the fish patterns ("rhythms that captivated them both completely") and implicitly governs the stance shift toward inhabiting mystery. The action shapes the ending's tone but does not create a turn or decision point; they are held by spectacle rather than choosing to engage it with cost. Functional but not indispensable; "mesmerized" or "transfixed" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shared exhale and fireflies (bioluminescent jellies rising at "sunrise") appear in the penultimate paragraph, marking the culmination of the luminous respite and the transition to closure. The method is signaled late (after ~85% of the text) and does not shape prior attempts or choices, but it charges the final image with specificity and ceremonial resonance. Two gates (development as atmospheric pivot, payoff in closure framing); causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The research facility and Thymal ruins supply spatial structure (tank, lower chambers, dome, city streets below), and the glass dome's proximity to the ruins enables the observation that drives the entire sequence. The facility's depth and the ruins' bioluminescent architecture constrain what Mira can study and anchor her professional role. The setting appears early, recurs across beats, and participates in closure (pressing her palm against the glass, feeling vibration). Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "until sunrise" is stated and the designated hour is mentioned, but elapsed time is vague—"three hours after sunset," "stood together...until sunrise"—and does not tighten decisions or tactics. The clock exists as ambient marker rather than a live pressure point. Functional scaffolding but replaceable with "through the night" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to learn the rhythm of belonging" is articulated explicitly late in the piece ("learning the rhythm of belonging to something infinitely larger") and again in the penultimate line ("she had found her place"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction. Her waiting methodology reflects it implicitly, but no on-page cost or competing want tests the desire. Thematic presence without choice-level conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone—awed, contemplative, layered with mystery—is coherent throughout: "dark omen," "breathing with light," "dialogue between sky and abyss," "shadowseam wonder." It modulates subtly from initial unease (burnt feather as omen) to shared wonder (fish choreography) to quiet resolution (pressing palm, eternal conversation). The final "shadowseam wonder" phrase appears as direct invocation, charging the closure image without overstatement. Tone supports pressure and reweights the ending.</comment>
