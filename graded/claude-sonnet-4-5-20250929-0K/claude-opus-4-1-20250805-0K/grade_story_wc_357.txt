<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and her quest coherent, but her interior life reads too smoothly—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The epiphany at the monument ("understood then") arrives through observation rather than costly choice; the trees' resilience is explained to her rather than earned through flawed struggle. Embodied emotion is thin: "smiled in the whirling silence" labels rather than physicalizes her state under the Inversion's pressure. The final stance feels delivered rather than forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—water flows, echoes, and monument cohere into a pattern. Orientation anchors promptly (pilot, skiff, Verdance, Inversion countdown). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: the arrow-tip monument teaches resilience as "existing outside" change. However, cost is asserted ("seeds of true understanding") rather than dramatized; no on-page forfeiture, injury, or visible trade-off accompanies the revelation. The Cost proof test fails—no exact sentence shows a price paid at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory work: "whirling silence," "water flows skyward," floating arches create a distinct micro-setting. The skiff's magnetic anchors and the Inversion's gravity flip constrain Kessa's moves and charge the grove discovery. The arrow tip—handled in soil yesterday, pressed into the monument at closure—functions as micro-setting that enables the final reveal. Spatial choreography (water split, spherical grove, monument at center) remains clear and stakes are altered by environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source for colony survival) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The Inversion provides a ticking constraint, and the grove discovery tightens options. However, escalation lacks on-page agency: Kessa observes the trees' indifference to gravity, then the monument "floods" knowledge into her—she does not wrestle a choice or pay a visible price. The resolution is handed to her by the environment rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual but not legible as forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (resilience as dancing with change rather than resisting it) emerges through image: upward water, unchanging trees, gathering echoes. The final line ("graceful defiance of expectation") risks thematic summary but is anchored in prior particulars. The monument and arrow-tip pattern offer resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the ending asserts understanding rather than dramatizing its cost—"seeds of true understanding" reads as a label for transformation we did not witness on the page. A near-miss for non-literal answer; the metaphor does most of the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance, and a distinct perceptual signature ("whirling silence," navigation by water wisdom). Diction is mostly controlled, though "graceful defiance of expectation" in the final paragraph drifts toward abstraction. No head-hopping, and interior access remains consistent. The prose modulates with the Inversion beat but does not degrade under peak stress; Kessa remains composed and articulate throughout, which flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("felt it," "understood then") dull immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, openings shift, figurative language (whirling silence, water flowing upward) is vivid and coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the monument paragraph ("The monument pulsed... pattern, a map written in metal and time") loops conceptually without advancing action, and "seeds of true understanding" plus "graceful defiance" repeat the closure assertion. Minimal scaffold or template cadence, but the ending paragraph tells rather than dramatizes the shift, reducing propulsion. No major artifacts touch clarity, but momentum softens at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Upward water flows, gravity Inversions, and echo-gathering offer a fresh synthesis of SFF tropes. The arrow-tip monument as a map and gravity-constant teacher is specific and non-obvious. Yet the orchard-pilot-discovers-secret-grove arc follows familiar quest structure without a sharp turn, and the epiphany ("resilience wasn't about enduring change but existing outside it") resolves through observation rather than flawed, costly choice. Transformation test: swap names and the emotional arc remains generic. Freshness in world-building does not fully offset predictable discovery mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kessa makes the choice to follow water upward and to press the arrow tip into the monument, both shaping turns. However, both decisions are exploratory rather than conflicted—no visible cost, no foreclosed alternative. Present in setup, middle navigation, and closure press, satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure is observational. Mid-band for presence across beats without deep stakes-altering friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arrow tip handled in soil (yesterday's accelerated growth), traced in-flight, pressed into monument socket at closure to trigger the knowledge flood. Three distinct beats, early signal, closure-active, and irreplaceable—no other object could fulfill the monument's map. Visible cost is absent (the press succeeds without trade-off), capping the score below 8.5. Strong integration with minor cost gap.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Echoes of past voices appear in the spherical grove and crescendo at the monument, adding atmosphere. However, they do not constrain Kessa's choices or alter her tactics—she listens, then proceeds. Present in middle and closure but functionally ornamental; removing them would not break plot logic. Lyric reprise without causal pressure places it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Accelerated growth demonstrated in paragraph four (seeds to saplings, collapse afterward) establishes the arrow tip's power and primes the monument discovery. The trait enables one key turn (understanding the broken arrows as "seeds" of gravitational teaching) but does not constrain a later choice with visible cost. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic payoff) and one causal link; swappable with other "ancient-tech-teaches-biology" mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Discovery drives the entire arc: Kessa seeks, finds grove, discovers monument, gains knowledge. Early signal, middle grove emergence, closure monument press. However, the discovery is passive—she follows water, arrives, observes, is given understanding. No flawed detour or costly error; the action could be "investigate" or "receive" with minimal edits. Essential to structure but not irreplaceable in method; agency gap lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Water-flow navigation is signaled in paragraph one, used at the arch split (chooses up), and implicitly present at grove arrival. Shapes two on-page choices (follow upward cascade, then choose the ascending stream). However, mechanics remain abstract—no friction, no failed read, no cost for trusting water wisdom. Present across beats but generic; "following ancient paths" would serve equally well. Mid-band for repeated use without specific constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating arches, upward rivers, and the spherical grove with intertwined roots supply navigation challenges and anchor the discovery. The grove's structure (trees on every surface, monument at center) is indispensable to the revelation. Environment pressures Kessa's skiff piloting, supplies the Inversion test, and charges the final image. Early signal, middle navigation constraint, closure-active. Strong integration; removing the specific architecture would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Seventeen-minute countdown mentioned, Inversion strikes mid-scene, and "as the Inversion ended" marks closure. However, the one-hour window does not tighten Kessa's decisions—she proceeds at observational pace, and the end is noted rather than raced. Clock present but not pressuring tactics; removing exact duration would require only minor edits. Two gates (setup, closure marker) without escalation leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation (find resilience source for failing colony crops) is stated early, pursued through navigation and grove exploration, and fulfilled at the monument. Shapes all major beats and the ending. However, want is not visibly conflicted—no cost, no competing desire, no mistake born of urgency. Dramatized through action but not through friction. Strong presence across structure; absence of on-page trade-off or flawed choice caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Whirling silence is established in paragraph two, revisited in the echo-gathering, and recurs in the final smile. Tone is coherent and atmospheric. However, it does not modulate with the Inversion's pressure or charge the closure image with new meaning—Kessa's calm persists throughout. Lyric reprise without escalation or reweighting; present but static. Two gates (setup, closure cameo) without pressure linkage.</comment>
