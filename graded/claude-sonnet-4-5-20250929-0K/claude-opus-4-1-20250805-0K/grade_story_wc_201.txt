<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's enhanced proprioception creates vivid embodied interiority ("exact angle of her spine," "seventeen facial muscles"), and her micro-choices—touching the strap, removing it with inverted motion, approaching the child at calculated distance—reveal values under pressure. The final turn toward teaching feels earned by her recorded "mathematics of pain" and the proprioceptive precision that previously trapped her. However, the therapeutic arc ("mathematics of mercy") leans toward diagnostic self-awareness at peak beats, and the child encounter, while purposeful, arrives late without prior setup, reducing felt cost in the renunciation of the strap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory precision and recurring "mathematics" imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Lyra renounces the strap and commits to teaching, foreclosing revenge or isolation with visible cost (leaving the station, kneeling at calculated distance). Orientation anchors (recovery station, ultraviolet forest, post-treaty exile) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs. The closure image—smiling with "exact pull of seventeen facial muscles" and "precision felt like freedom"—reweights prior pain-data into healing-data with undeniable pressure. One micro turn (removing the strap) tightens her stance. Cost is legible: she abandons the recovery station and the physical token of her torture, choosing pedagogical penance over solitary endurance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: UV-reactive moss in Fibonacci spirals, bioluminescent canopy visible only to enhanced eyes, and the setting's status as sanctuary for the displaced all constrain Lyra's renunciation and enable the final teaching scene. Spatial choreography is clear (recovery station → forest paths → tree where child sits). The pewter strap's forty-seven grams and the child's "safe distance" calculations ground proprioceptive detail in action. However, the forest remains largely backdrop until the final third; earlier beats could anchor choices in its alien soil or luminous patterns to deepen constraint across the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Lyra will remain trapped by her trauma or transform it into mercy. One meaningful tightening occurs when she removes the strap with "inverted motion," foreclosing revenge and isolation. Her agency—standing, walking into the forest, kneeling at calculated distance—narrows options toward teaching. The child's appearance introduces a concrete test of her new mathematics, but arrives late (final third) without prior complication, so the escalation reads as a single deepening rather than compounding pressure. Cost is visible: she leaves the strap behind and commits to a pedagogical future among the displaced, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of pain into pedagogy, "mathematics of mercy" as the inverse equation of cruelty—emerges through recurring motifs (pewter strap's precise weight, proprioceptive angles, UV forest's Fibonacci spirals) rather than statement. The final image, teaching the child to see "frequency and complement," offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "penance—not punishment but transformation" and "build a mathematics of healing from the decimals of my pain" edge toward thematic echo in the closing paragraph, slightly diluting the image's charge. The "seventeen facial muscles" callback successfully reweights earlier precision without explaining itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is tightly controlled; all perceptions filter through Lyra's enhanced sensorium (UV wavelengths, infrared heat signatures, vertebral positions). Diction matches her analytic interior voice ("inverse equation," "reciprocals," "Fibonacci spirals") without slipping into Wikipedia-voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during strap removal, slightly elevated during forest walk, intimate again at the child encounter. One brief dialogue exchange ("Every light has a frequency…") feels natural and goal-driven, teaching without exposition. No head-hopping. The phrase "gifts from the enhancement procedures that had once made her the Coalition's perfect intelligence officer" in paragraph one carries minor filter weight but is voice-motivated by her clinical self-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short declaratives in crisis beats, longer accumulative sentences during reflection). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pattern. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "She touched it, and her fingers instantly calculated…"; "She stood, each vertebra announcing…"; "She walked into the forest, her enhanced body mapping…" share identical subject-verb-participial structure across adjacent paragraphs, creating a drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). "The ultraviolet forest called to her enhanced eyes, showing paths visible only in her spectrum of perception" layers two participial phrases without clear necessity. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors touch the closure beats, so the artifacts remain mid-story momentum drags rather than closure flaws.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—proprioceptive enhancement as both torture instrument and healing tool, "mathematics of mercy" as inverse equation—feels specific and non-obvious. The UV forest as sanctuary for the sensorily displaced offers a fresh spatial metaphor. However, the core arc (trauma survivor transforms pain into teaching) follows a familiar redemptive template, and the "exact opposite motion" as symbolic release reads slightly convenient. The child's late arrival and the forest's Fibonacci moss risk decorative symbolism over earned necessity. Risk-taking in sensory specificity (UV wavelengths, exact gram measurements) elevates within the band, but the emotional calculus resolves without a morally ambiguous or costly choice that would surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra (enhanced interrogation survivor) drives all key turns: bracing triggers trauma-response data, touching the strap calculates its weaponized weight, removing it with inverted motion enacts the renunciation, and approaching the child at safe distance demonstrates the repurposed mathematics. Her choices alter tactics (from survival geometry to teaching geometry) and shape closure. Early signal (paragraph one), sustained beat involvement, causal pressure at every turn, and closure linkage (the teaching stance) establish indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in three beats: awakening with it cutting her cheekbones (paragraph one), touching it to calculate its forty-seven grams (paragraph four), and removing it with inverted motion (paragraph seven). The final reprise—"lay abandoned in the recovery station behind her, its weight finally equaled by something greater"—reweights its meaning. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactic; it functions primarily as symbol of pain and then release. The "exact mass needed to trigger specific pressure points" detail charges its presence but is not dramatized through use. Strong setup and closure participation, but limited middle development caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ultraviolet penance" frames the exile setting and her mission but does not constrain on-page choices as sharply as other elements. The UV forest enables her enhanced vision and positions the displaced community, yet the concept of "penance" is declared ("This was her penance") rather than tested through a decision that costs her something within that framework. The closing line—"she would teach others to solve for mercy"—restates the concept but does not dramatize a tactical choice it forced. Present across setup and closure, but primarily thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement enables every key action: feeling "every nerve ending, every muscle fiber," locking into "practiced terror" geometry, calculating the strap's forty-seven grams and safe approach distances, announcing each vertebra's position when standing, and maintaining "precise distance that meant safety" with the child. The trait constrains her (trauma-response lock) and enables her (repurposed calculations for teaching). Visible cost: the very precision that makes her "the perfect victim" also isolates her sensory experience. Early signal, sustained causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no other trait would generate this specific arc).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brace" appears in paragraph one ("Lyra tried to brace herself against the chair, but her body responded with practiced terror") as a trigger for trauma-response geometry, but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action is swappable—"reach," "push," or "grip" would function similarly—and no later beat traces causally to this specific attempt. It demonstrates her lack of control early but is not repurposed or returned to at closure. Functional setup, no middle development, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Remembering through trauma responses" is signaled early ("Each trauma response carried data, mathematical patterns her interrogators never knew she was recording") and shapes her middle realization ("every tremor and flinch was teaching her the mathematics she sought"). The final teaching scene enacts the method's outcome: she uses angles and distances learned through terror to approach the child safely. However, the mechanics are told more than shown—we do not witness her actively recording or retrieving a specific memory through a response on the page. Strong thematic integration and closure linkage, but the method's dramatization remains one step abstracted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies resources (UV-reactive moss in Fibonacci spirals, bioluminescent canopy) that Lyra uses to teach the child at closure, and its status as sanctuary for the enhanced positions the displaced community. The forest pressures her choice by offering a visible alternative to the recovery station. However, its middle development is thin—she walks through it but does not navigate a forest-specific obstacle or make a choice constrained by its terrain. Strong setup (paragraphs two and six) and closure participation (the child at the luminous tree, teaching frequencies), but limited middle constraint prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening ("consciousness returned, each heartbeat sending waves of awareness") and positions Lyra in the recovery station, but time does not tighten her decisions or tactics thereafter. The piece's elapsed time is vague—she stands, walks into the forest, encounters the child—with no clock pressure. The timeframe functions as a setup anchor (she is recently awake, vulnerable) but does not create urgency or alter her moves. Present at setup, absent from middle escalation and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover "the mathematics of mercy" is signaled early ("in the spaces between stimulus and response…lived formulas for something her tormentors never thought to calculate") and dramatized through her removal of the strap ("the mathematics of mercy…was in solving for their reciprocals"). It shapes her choice to teach the child ("she would teach others to solve for mercy in the equations of their suffering"). However, the phrasing risks thematic echo—"mathematics of mercy" is named repeatedly rather than embodied purely through action. Friction between the want (teach healing) and the cost (renouncing the strap, leaving the station) is legible but conceptual rather than visceral. Strong setup, middle realization, and closure linkage, but the named articulation in the final paragraph slightly reduces score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" coheres across the arc: Lyra is exiled ("dumped…after the treaty"), other survivors move "between the impossible trees," and the closing image—"impossible things grew roots"—charges the tone. The tone modulates from clinical precision under anesthesia (opening) to tentative agency (standing, walking) to pedagogical warmth (teaching the child). The final line ("the precision felt like freedom") crystallizes the tonal shift from constraint to possibility without breaking coherence. However, the tone occasionally drifts into abstraction ("penance—not punishment but transformation") that risks breaking the embodied texture. Strong closure participation and modulation under pressure, but one register slip in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
