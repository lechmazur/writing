<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers (flutter beneath ribs, heat in palms, cold at spine) that shape on-page micro-choices. Her contradictory impulses—grief versus cultivation—act simultaneously in scene rather than alternating summaries. The final endurance (returning tomorrow despite violence continuing) feels earned by prior causality and forecloses magical-thinking escape with visible cost. Minor slip: Dr. Mansour's diagnostic framework risks therapy-speak, though it remains anchored in bodily sensation rather than pure label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Amira's choice to return crystallizes her stance with visible cost: "The world would continue its violence. She would continue her planting. Both facts existed simultaneously." The arboretum motif (opening wildness → final naturalized succession) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (arboretum, cliff, Mediterranean). One meaningful deepening occurs when somatic panic gives way to practiced stillness, narrowing her options from flight to endurance. Cost is legible: she carries the burned photograph, acknowledges erasure, yet chooses persistence over resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum constrains choice throughout: untended olive trees frame abandonment, rough cedar bark becomes the "pearl of stillness," and sapling transplanting enacts her succession logic. Micro-setting (her palm against bark, dirt under fingernails) charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cliff to greenhouse to lighthouse beacon sweep. The automated beacon in the final beat functions as setting-as-argument, mirroring her withdrawal-with-function. Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma-trained attention: she distinguishes aircraft types, reads wind and wave as patient forces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she endure trauma without closure and still cultivate life? The tightening occurs when panic markers arrive and she chooses practiced stillness over flight, forecloses magical thinking. Agency is endurance with visible cost: she returns knowing violence persists, choosing alignment with growth's indifference. The jade cutting propagation and succession planting dramatize her tactics under the chosen lens (Accumulative). No explicit antagonist needed; the structural pressure is post-trauma recalibration versus erasure. Final stance crystallizes in the lighthouse parallel: guidance requiring no human presence, only structures built to last.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the cedar witnessing centuries, white orchids/phosphorus/sheets progression, naturalized succession as argument. The final image offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: "Both facts existed simultaneously, without resolution, only the quiet persistence of growth against erasure." Subtext operates in the lighthouse keeper's choice to leave, the "signature strike" investigators' logic, and her alignment with botanical indifference. No thematic echo or prompt-language thesis. The photograph's return in her pocket and dirt under nails charge closure without sentimentality. Minor note: "pearl of stillness" risks becoming a token motif, but it constrains her panic choice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; Amira's perceptual signature is selective and trauma-specific (distinguishing aircraft types, reading somatic weather signs). Diction remains within her lexicon: "signature strike" and "somatic markers" fit her post-trauma education without slipping into pure jargon. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives during panic, longer accumulative syntax during planting. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One hairline slip: "as if trauma had opened channels between her nervous system and the green world" edges toward explanatory distance, though it reads as her own working theory rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. The white orchids/phosphorus/sheets compression is exemplary propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the lighthouse motif with cost. Minor density slip: "This quiet talent had emerged after the bombing" could be shown through her pruning rather than told, though the embodied follow-up (plants curve toward light) partially recovers. One filter-verb stack in the reflection on Dr. Mansour's teaching, but it does not dull a peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—trauma survivor finding stance through botanical succession logic—transforms familiar recovery narrative through specific lived detail: somatic marker training, naturalized succession as decades-long argument, lighthouse automation as structural parallel. The arboretum as post-keeper rewilding and the "signature strike" investigators' chilling logic ("joy itself had become suspect") offer fresh angles. The ending avoids both closure and despair through specificity: dirt under nails, periodic beacon illumination, "quiet persistence of growth against erasure." Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and refusal of resolution heightens stakes. Slight deduction: the concept of botanical indifference as healing path, while executed well, echoes eco-therapeutic frameworks; transformation is strong but not fully unprecedented.</comment>
