<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to guide ships is clear and her discovery progresses logically, but her internal experience remains largely cerebral—memories surface, she "gasps" and "understands," yet contradictory impulses never collide on the page. The teaching moment with Tomás and the villagers feels competent but presents no visible friction between wants and costs. The polishing technique that unlocks the glass's power is stated rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing priorities. Grandfather's cryptic words prime the arc, but Marina's path from grief to communal guide unfolds without the self-deception or irrational layering that would charge the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Marina, grotto, dawn, three months post-lighthouse failure. The lens reads Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Marina's polishing unlocks the sea glass → grotto amplifies light → beacon guides boats → she teaches the village. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass begins to glow and she positions herself at the grotto's mouth, narrowing options from solitary search to communal solution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts that guidance can emerge from patience rather than the old lighthouse's power. Cost is conceptual and felt—she relinquishes the singular keeper role and distributes fragments—but the final paragraph's thematic summary ("pearl of stillness…tender persistence") tells more than it charges, slightly dulling the image's independent resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto with mist and limestone is vividly rendered and its acoustics amplify the light-painting moment. The sea glass functions as micro-setting: Marina handles it across multiple beats (weighing, polishing, angling to catch sun), and its properties constrain her method. Spatial choreography is clean—salt-slick steps, grotto mouth as natural amphitheater, harbor visibility. The grotto's role in the closure is present but passive; it hosts the teaching rather than forcing a harder trade-off. Sensory detail is selective ("liquid starlight," "pearl-soft illumination") and filtered through Marina's astronomer's eye, though the mist's metaphoric density borders on ornamental in the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide ships without the lighthouse—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening: the glass glows, Marina climbs to the entrance, and the beacon works immediately, altering the fleet's course. Agency is present but smooth: Marina discovers, then shares; no reversal or trade-off tests her commitment. The fishermen's instant adoption and request to learn involve no friction or cost beyond Marina's time. The resolution is earned by her polishing work and grandfather's setup, but coincidence aids (the glass "just" begins to glow; the grotto's acoustics "just" amplify). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens yet never forces a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—light can be shared without flame, guidance from patience—emerges clearly from Marina's arc and the sea glass/grotto particulars. The final paragraph, however, states the theme overtly: "pearl of stillness… not in the absence of motion… light could be shared without flame… tender persistence of starlight reflected in morning mist." This replaces scene pressure with summary, preventing the ending image from posing a resonant, non-literal question. Grandfather's cryptic line ("Stars live in more places than the sky") is a solid thematic seed, and the distribution of sea glass fragments offers a concrete closing action. Emotional honesty is present but the moralizing cadence in the last lines lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the memory sequence, wider during the teaching scene. Diction is consistent and elevated ("astronomer's lantern," "zephyr bloom of dawn," "serpentine") without breaking Marina's plausible lexicon. Tomás's single line of dialogue ("How?") is economical, and Marina's reply feels natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present: Marina notices star charts, lens-polishing motions, phosphorescence. Free indirect style is clean. The prose occasionally drifts toward lyric compression ("liquid starlight," "breaching whales") that heightens atmosphere but risks ornament. No filter-verb stacks or register mismatch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two prose artifacts lower the score: (1) The opening's metaphoric density ("liquid starlight," "serpentine," "something ethereal, almost breathing") in rapid succession reads decorative rather than propulsive. (2) The final paragraph's thematic summary loops conceptually ("pearl of stillness… quiet certainty… patience and polish rather than power and heat… brightest lights… glow softest… tender persistence") without advancing the image. No template cadence or paraphrase loops elsewhere. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports rhythm. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The clarity-momentum balance holds until the closing lines, where tell overtakes show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—grief-driven discovery of bioluminescent sea glass as alternative beacon—offers a modest twist on the "lost lighthouse" template. Marina's dual occupations (lighthouse keeper, gem polisher) integrate organically and the grotto's natural amphitheater is a specific, non-obvious setting choice. Grandfather's cryptic setup and the polishing-as-activation mechanic add ingenuity. However, the emotional arc (solitary search → communal teaching) and thevillagers' frictionless adoption are familiar beats. The story commits fully to its concept without retreat, but the final thematic articulation ("earthbound star watcher… light without flame") trends toward abstraction rather than durable particular insight. Transformation is partial: swap the sea glass for another luminescent object and the arc largely holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina (earthbound star watcher) drives the narrative: she descends to search (beat 1), polishes and discovers the glow (beat 2), positions herself to guide boats (beat 3), teaches villagers (beat 4). Her choices create all major turns. Early signal (paragraph 1), three distinct beats with causal pressure, closure participation (teaching scene), and specificity (astronomer's lantern, star charts by touch) all present. Only minor swappability (another role could discover the glass) and the villagers' passive reception slightly lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in five beats: washes ashore (backstory), Marina polishes it for weeks (setup), she weighs and holds it (beat 1), it glows and she angles it (beat 2), she distributes fragments to villagers (closure). Early signal, causal pressure (its luminescence enables the beacon), closure linkage (fragments shared), and irreplaceability (specific properties—captured light, persistent glow—matter) all strong. Cost connection is present but implied (time spent polishing). Slightly shy of indispensable because the story could substitute another luminescent object with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is stated in the final paragraph as a thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes. The concept is present throughout in the grotto's quiet, Marina's patient polishing, and the soft beacon, but it operates as atmosphere and metaphor rather than altering tactics or narrowing options. Lyric reprise (first third's "mist… stillness" → final line's "pearl of stillness") reweights meaning and carries conceptual cost (Marina accepts non-powered guidance). Setup and closure participation qualify; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Scores in the mid-5s for purposeful resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the sea glass after polishing: "its surface now reflectively vibrant with an inner light." The trait enables the beacon (beat 2) and the teaching (beat 3), constraining method—Marina must angle it to catch sun and grotto light. Early signal (implicit in polishing work), causal enablement, and closure participation (vibrant fragments distributed) present. Cost is indirect (polishing effort, shared rather than hoarded). Slightly replaceable: another luminescent descriptor would serve with minor edits. Scores solidly in the 6s for functional constraint without unique irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marina weighs the sea glass in her palm (paragraph 3), triggering the memory sequence that primes her understanding of its potential. The action is early, specific, and causally linked to the breakthrough moment. It appears in one distinct beat and does not recur or shape the closure directly. Causal pressure is moderate—other actions (polishing, angling) drive later beats more forcefully. The weighing could be swapped for another contemplative gesture (holding, examining) without major loss. Scores in the low-7s for clear setup and one causal link, but limited beat involvement and moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("her secret trade when the lighthouse work grew lean") and its mechanics matter throughout: "the same circular motions" that polished the lighthouse lens, "patient circular motions that activated the glass's luminescence," and the teaching scene where Marina demonstrates the technique. Three distinct beats (backstory, discovery, teaching), causal pressure (polishing unlocks the glow), and closure participation (she teaches the method) all strong. Irreplaceability is high—the specific technique ties Marina's dual roles and Grandfather's legacy. Cost is implied (weeks of polishing). Nears indispensable but the teaching moment is smooth rather than charged.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto in mist provides the discovery site, amplifies the light ("natural acoustics," "serpentine curves amplifying"), and hosts the teaching scene. Early signal (paragraph 1), three beats (descent, glow discovery, teaching), causal pressure (the grotto's properties enable the beacon), and closure participation (classroom for villagers) all present. The grotto's "natural amphitheater" at the mouth is a specific, irreplaceable detail that shapes the beacon's range. Cost is present but indirect (Marina must return daily, climb steps). Scores high for sustained involvement and tactical constraint, shy of indispensable because the amplification is convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" functions as a lyric timeframe during the memory sequence (paragraph 4) but does not tighten decisions elsewhere. The three-month post-lighthouse timeline anchors the setup, and "that evening" marks the teaching scene, yet no live clock pressures Marina's choices. Memories are triggered by holding the glass, not by an urgent deadline. Setup is present, middle and closure involvement are thematic rather than tactical. Scores in the low-4s for functional but ornamental use; swappable with "during a moment of reflection" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—share light without using fire—is implicit from paragraph 1 ("searching for another way to guide the ships" after the lighthouse went dark) and explicit in the closure ("light could be shared without flame"). The desire drives three beats: polishing the glass, creating the beacon, teaching villagers. Early signal, causal pressure (the motivation shapes her method), and closure participation (teaching distributes the light) all strong. Friction is present but muted: no on-page conflict between wants (share) and costs (time, effort, or risk of failure). Scores solidly in the mid-7s for clear dramatization across beats with implied rather than visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears once in paragraph 6 ("a zephyr bloom of dawn spreading across the harbor") as a descriptive flourish. Tone throughout is lyric, contemplative, and softly wondrous, consistent with the phrase's gentle, airy quality. The tone modulates slightly—wonder during the glow, confidence during the teaching—but does not sharpen pressure or charge the final image beyond the stated thematic summary. Setup (dawn description), no middle beat involvement, weak closure linkage (tone persists but does not pivot). Scores mid-5s for coherent atmosphere without tactical constraint or reweighting at the ending.</comment>
