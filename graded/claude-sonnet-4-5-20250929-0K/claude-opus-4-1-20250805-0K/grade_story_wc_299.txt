<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is concrete and grounded in embodied memory—his fingers recognizing the cloth, the B-flat hum triggering visceral recall. Internal contradiction operates well in the cataloging-as-defense mechanism versus the breakthrough moment of genuine recognition. The phone call demonstrates a meaningful shift earned by prior pressure, though the "longing not as emptiness but as space" moment skirts diagnostic abstraction. Minor: the emotional progression from shame to authority reads slightly telescoped in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Marcus commits to translating his past rather than escaping it, foreclosing the isolation path he'd been taking. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—memory fragments and sensory cues (B-flat hum, thread texture) build density until the Nashville call crystallizes his stance. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when tactile memory triggers the band connection, reweighting his expertise from failed objectivity to lived authority.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quarry office functions as micro-setting that mirrors his emotional landscape (water pools "reflected nothing back") and constrains his isolation choice. The speaker cloth as recurring object charges the closure through its shift from cataloged artifact to embodied memory vessel. Sensory hierarchy is well-filtered through his professional POV—weave pattern, weight, discoloration—then shifts to emotional register. The B-flat frequency callback effectively links past venue acoustics to present space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly Marcus's need to reconcile expertise with failure, signaled early through the expo humiliation. The cloth recognition provides one meaningful tightening that forces him to choose between continued detachment and engaged translation of his past. The Nashville call exacts visible cost—he must own the wounds that gave him authority. However, the pressure buildup could be sharper; the middle section lingers in reflection without additional complication before the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the particulars of preservation-as-performance and equipment-as-memory-vessel. The final insight—"preservation itself was a form of performance"—feels earned by the prior work with cloth texture and acoustic properties rather than stated as thesis. The speaker cloth's shift from technical specimen to communion artifact provides genuine thematic resonance. "Strangers became congregation" and similar phrasings approach prompt-language but remain tied to concrete venue experience. No overt moralizing; the ending offers reconfigured purpose through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: technical precision ("acoustically transparent polyester blend, circa 1974") layered with lyric compression ("sound became feeling, strangers became congregation"). The "confidently uncertain" phrase in paragraph two exemplifies the perceptual signature well. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Minor slip: "longing not as emptiness but as space" and "echo of what they'd all been reaching for" tilt slightly abstract for peak emotional beats, though recovery is quick. No head-hopping; all knowledge remains Marcus-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer reflective passages and shorter decisive beats. However, two paraphrase loops appear: paragraph two's "the kind of detritus that ended up in his hands" echoes the prior exile summary without adding pressure; paragraph nine's "actual music, actual crowds, actual nights" reads as emphasis churn. The "amplifier parts from an estate sale" / "dead people's dreams" construction stacks metaphorical weight. Propulsion occasionally stalls in mid-story reflection before recovering for the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The roadie-to-appraiser premise offers a fresh angle on expertise-and-loss material, and the speaker cloth as memory vessel is specific. The public humiliation setup provides non-obvious moral terrain—he was technically wrong but emotionally right. However, the core emotional arc (shamed expert reclaims authority through vulnerability) follows a recognizable template. The quarry-as-amphitheater metaphor and multiple "echo" references approach stock symbolism. Strongest originality lies in the tactile/acoustic sensory fusion and the preservation-as-performance insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's dual expertise as ex-roadie and appraiser is established early, drives the recognition beat when his fingers remember the cloth, and shapes the closure decision to validate "actual music" provenance. His roadie past creates the causal pressure—he knows this cloth from lived experience, not just catalog study. The Nashville call choice is directly enabled by this character synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The speaker cloth appears in paragraph one under the loupe, returns in paragraph six with tactile memory that triggers the tour recognition, is wrapped at the end, and its properties (thread compression from sound waves) become the basis for his provenance claim. It shifts from catalog specimen to personal relic to professional evidence. Essential across setup, middle recognition turn, and closure validation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" is invoked explicitly in paragraph three's expo failure and implicitly throughout the equipment-as-ghost-vibrations material. It shapes his isolation stakes and the ending realization that "preservation itself was a form of performance." However, it operates more as thematic frame than immediate tactical pressure; the on-page conflict centers on provenance determination rather than post-performance aftermath.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears as direct label in paragraph two describing his client voice, but the trait is not dramatized through contradictory on-page choices. His actual behavior reads as straightforwardly uncertain (cataloging as defense) until the ending confidence. The phrase colors his professional persona but does not constrain a key decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wrest meaning" is invoked in paragraph four and executed through the cataloging → memory recognition → provenance call sequence. The action shapes the middle turn when he stops cataloging and lets himself "really see." However, it could be reframed as "discover" or "authenticate" with minor edits; the wresting metaphor is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method of insulating with facts is signaled early (jeweler's loupe, ledger entries, technical terminology) and actively used in paragraphs one through five as his defense mechanism. It shapes his attempt to catalog the cloth objectively, and the breakthrough occurs when he abandons the factual barrier. The Nashville call demonstrates the method transformed—facts now serve emotional truth rather than replace it. Present in setup, dramatized in middle deflection, and reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry office is established in paragraph three with the uncle's suggestion and isolation function, returns as acoustic chamber in the penultimate paragraph, and provides the fluorescent B-flat hum that triggers memory. It mirrors his emotional state (pools reflecting nothing) and enables his isolation choice. However, it does not supply a resource or create a tactical constraint that alters outcome; it functions more as atmosphere than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Six months ago" anchors the expo failure timeline, and "November wind" places the present. The timeframe creates the shame-to-recovery arc and motivates his quarry exile. However, time does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressure shapes the Nashville call or the recognition beat. The "after failing publicly" frame is thematic setup rather than live temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to discover purpose after loss is established through the exile, dramatized in the conflict between cataloging-as-escape and memory-as-translation, and directly addressed in the closure realization. The friction between wanting to forget (cataloging dead people's dreams) and needing to honor the past creates visible cost in his isolation. The Nashville call enacts the choice to translate rather than escape.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is coherent throughout—elegiac, textured with technical precision and longing. The "echo" motif recurs (quarry walls, ghost vibrations, echo valley implicit) and modulates from hollow isolation to charged potential by the ending. The fluorescent hum, acoustic chamber metaphor, and "space waiting to be filled with new frequencies" sustain the sonic-longing register. Tone directly charges the final preservation-as-performance image, though "echo" risks becoming overly insistent.</comment>
