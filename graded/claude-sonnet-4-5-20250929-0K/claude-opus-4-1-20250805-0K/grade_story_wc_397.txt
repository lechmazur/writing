<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlene's interior world is concrete and particular—the "fold in patience" as lived experience, the parasol tip as tactile anchor. Her motivations are clear: failed euthanasia tourist learning to recognize endings. However, the trait "grips reality loosely" remains more label than embodied contradiction; her perceptions never degrade or mislead in ways that cost her tactically. The final choice to remain is announced rather than tested through a micro-decision that forecloses another path with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marlene, drift-ice marina, post-Switzerland). The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marlene chooses to remain as ice-watch, finding "transformation" rather than death, with the cost implicit in her continued vigil over beautiful disaster. Cost is conceptual and felt but not sharply dramatized—"refuse to end" is more thematic claim than a visible forfeiture that alters her next move. One meaningful deepening occurs (three AM calving reweights her understanding), meeting the length's requirement, but the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("gift Switzerland had given her, wrapped in different paper") partially tells what the image should charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "bobbing floe," "minus-forty air," "neural pathways or river deltas or the very cracks." The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its lace edges cutting her palm in the final gesture. The ice's breaking song constrains her vigil choices and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (observation post, supply tent, transport helicopter). The setting demonstrably shapes her stance and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Marlene sought death but now seeks understanding of endings. Pressure accumulates through the night vigil, the three AM calving, and Jakob's call for evacuations. One meaningful tightening: the calving reweights her understanding from expected dramatics to "quiet, a folding inward." Agency is present as endurance and attention, though the final decision to remain is more stance crystallization than a choice that visibly forecloses another live option with on-page cost. The coincidence of the calving event complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly: endings that transform rather than terminate, patience as movement. The parasol tip and ice cracks function as recurrent images that shift meaning. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("transformation—the same gift Switzerland had given her, wrapped in different paper" and "endings that refuse to end"), converting earned resonance into stated moral. The Inuit grandmother's line "We know this sound—the breathing before the break" offers wisdom that feels organically earned, but Marlene's closing interiority leans toward essay rather than image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Marlene's perceptual signature is distinct: she notices "lace pattern casting shadows that looked like neural pathways" and hears ice as symphony. Diction remains character-apt with occasional lyric elevation ("frozen cemetery," "rosary of sharper prayers"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Jakob's line and the grandmother's observation both carry subtext and advance understanding. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and observational remove.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high in sensory and thematic material. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the peculiar crease in time where waiting becomes its own form of movement" is restated as "patience can fold into itself until waiting becomes its own form of completion." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She'd come... but discovered..." then "But Marlene would remain... learning... adding..." The metaphor density in high-pressure beats (parasol as rosary, ice as cemetery/amber/symphony) occasionally stacks without clear progression. Minor −0.6 for loops and template stems in closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of failed euthanasia tourism and Arctic disaster relief is specific and non-obvious. The "fold in patience" concept offers fresh framing. However, the emotional arc of transformation-not-death and finding beauty in collapse trends toward familiar territory without sharp subversion. The parasol tip heirloom and ice-watch setting provide texture but don't drive a turn that feels inevitable only in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its premise but the final reweighting is more stated than dramatically embodied, reducing ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marlene as euthanasia tourist frames the opening and her arc. The setup is clear (Switzerland procedure), and her decision to remain at closure returns to this identity transformed. However, the "tourist" aspect is more backstory label than active choice-driver in the present action. She volunteers, watches ice, records sounds—none of these beats hinge on her having been a euthanasia tourist except thematically. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development weak. Closure linkage is thematic reconfiguration rather than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in three distinct moments: pulled from pocket (opening), resting on desk (observation post), balanced between fingers (dawn/closure). Each mention adds tactile detail and symbolic charge. However, it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic—Marlene doesn't use it, and no decision hinges on its presence. It's a recurring motif that charges the final image but remains ornamental to plot. Three touches across the arc; setup and payoff present; but swappable with any small heirloom without structural loss. Mid-band for charged reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named explicitly and shapes Marlene's understanding thematically. It reappears as "patience can fold into itself until waiting becomes its own form of completion." The concept informs her stance but doesn't visibly alter an on-page tactic or narrow a choice. It's present as interior philosophy, not as a constraint that changes her moves. Functional in tone and voice; replaceable in plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced early ("holding water in cupped palms") and returns at closure ("loose grips on reality still hold something worth feeling"). The trait is asserted but never demonstrated through perceptual error, misjudgment, or a choice complicated by unstable perception. It flavors voice but doesn't enable or constrain action. Label-only trait with thematic echo; no visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears as ongoing action: "trawling through the wreckage of abandoned homes" and implicit in her ice-watch cataloging. It shapes her role and her discovery of the ice's music. The three AM calving—a key beat—arises during this trawling. The action is present across the arc and contributes to closure (she will continue trawling/learning). However, easily substitutable with "surveying" or "monitoring" without major structural change. Strong middle development and closure presence; moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early (evacuating Arctic settlements) and structures the entire on-page action: helping the Inuit family load, ice-watch duty, recording calving for the morning team. Jakob's call and the transport helicopter anchor the method concretely. The method enables her presence at the marina and her tactical role (observation post, radio). It shapes her access and her final decision to remain with the relief teams. Present in all three gates; drives multiple beats; essential to her on-page agency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly present from the opening line, pressures the evacuation stakes, supplies the acoustic cues Marlene learns, and provides the three AM calving that reweights her understanding. The setting's fragility (ice thinning to transparency, boats trapped, sections calving) directly informs the urgency and her vigil. "Marina Seven, report status" roots her in spatial grid. The final image of the marina singing charges closure. Indispensable to stakes, action, and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" anchors the timeframe: six months post-Switzerland, present action unfolds over one night vigil (midnight to dawn). The temporal span is clear and the night structure tightens the observation sequence. However, time doesn't create tactical pressure—no deadline forces her choice, and the calving event is coincidental rather than clock-driven. Setup and middle present; closure uses dawn light but not as a causal constraint. Functional frame; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the sound of approaching endings" is named explicitly and drives her volunteer work, her ice-watch duty, and her cataloging of the symphony. It recurs at closure: "learning their music, adding her own strange harmony." The desire is dramatized through her night vigil and active listening. However, it never faces friction or cost—no competing want, no moment where learning threatens loss. The motivation is pursued without obstacle, reducing its causal charge. Strong thematic presence; weak conflict integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" as tone is coherent and sustained: quiet melancholy mixed with awe, beauty in collapse, peace in inevitable endings. The prose modulates subtly—lyric in description ("frozen cemetery," "rosary of sharper prayers"), matter-of-fact in Jakob's exchange, meditative in the final paragraph. Tone charges the closure image ("two voices learning the harmony of endings") and reflects Marlene's transformed stance. No jarring shifts; the solace is earned through accumulation rather than assertion. Tone shapes the final emotional register decisively.</comment>
