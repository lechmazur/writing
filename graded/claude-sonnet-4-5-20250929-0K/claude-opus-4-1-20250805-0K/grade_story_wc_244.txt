<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sadie's character is strongly realized through specific, embodied voice ("desperately jocular edge she'd perfected in Mozambique") and contradictory impulses (the manipulator who genuinely wants to connect people). Marcus is functional but thinner—his loneliness is stated more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final insight about "purpose tangled up with other people's purposes" feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional honesty, though the prior causality earns the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus holding the phone understands he's been catalyzed, reweighting the transaction from object-exchange to human-connection engine. The structure is a single continuous scene with clear spatial anchoring (Platform Three, ivy, pillar). One meaningful tightening occurs when Sadie reveals the satellite phone's true purpose, narrowing Marcus's options from passive collector to active node. Cost is legible—Marcus must now answer calls and engage—though the price feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-claimed station is vivid and purposeful, creating a "green cathedral of abandoned intentions" that mirrors the theme of connection/disconnection. Spatial choreography is clean (pillar, shadows, platform). The setting functions as more than backdrop—the abandoned station that "once connected six towns" directly charges the closure image of new connection forming. However, the environment does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, limiting the score's ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Sadie needs the moon rock to build her connection chain) is clear and escalates through one meaningful turn: the satellite phone trade reframes the transaction from material to relational. Marcus's agency is present but reactive—he takes the phone, understanding shifts—rather than driving the reversal. The cost is legible (Marcus must now engage monthly) but conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one solid tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete transaction: reciprocity as the "only economy that actually works" is demonstrated through the moon-rock-for-phone exchange rather than merely stated. The final image of Marcus "holding the phone, understanding finally that he'd been catalyzed" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the loneliness question. Minor deduction: "The cure for loneliness isn't company... it's purpose tangled up" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains rooted in Sadie's particular voice and the scene's specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sadie's voice is sharply distinct: "desperately jocular," specific diction ("Malaysian, actually"), and a perceptual signature that reads others' needs. POV is stable third-limited on Sadie with clean focalization. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the transaction while carrying subtext about loneliness and need. Minor slip: "polite anarchy, Sadie called it" in the final line reads slightly like authorial summary rather than fully embodied thought, though it's brief and the voice holds elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Strong lines: "that particular absence of Earth that made lunar samples unmistakable," "green cathedral of abandoned intentions." No loops or scaffolding detected. Minor deduction: "desperately jocular edge she'd perfected in Mozambique after the cyclone" front-loads backstory in a way that slightly dilutes present momentum, and "Everything worthwhile is technically illegal" skirts stock aphorism territory, though the voice modulates it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—disaster logistician who catalyzes human connection through elaborate rumor-chain trades—is fresh and specific. The ivy-station setting and moon-rock MacGuffin avoid generic choices. However, the emotional arc (lonely person finds purpose through helping) follows a familiar template, and the "rumor chain leading to connection" mechanism, while inventive, is more described than dramatically tested. The synthesis feels coherent but not quite inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sadie drives both major beats: initiating the rumor chain and executing the trade. Her elusiveness is dramatized through her exit and "professional ghost" framing. Her choices create the key turn (offering the phone instead of simple trade) and shape closure (she departs, leaving Marcus catalyzed). The logistician role is label-present but tactics are more social than logistical on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moon rock appears in three beats: Marcus produces it, Sadie explains its Myanmar use, she pockets it. Its "metallic otherness" and lunar origin provide specific texture. However, it functions primarily as MacGuffin to bring Marcus—its unique properties (catalyzing toxin neutralization) are told rather than demonstrated, and it could be swapped for another rare object with minor edits. Present in closure framing (Sadie has it) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reciprocity shapes the central transaction: moon rock for satellite phone, "not charity... partnership." The concept drives the trade structure and Sadie's explicit thematic statement. However, it is more explained than tested—we don't see reciprocity constrain a choice with visible cost. The phone's future monthly calls gesture toward ongoing reciprocity but remain off-page promise rather than on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is embodied in Sadie's opening line about raccoons and her "grin sharp enough to cut glass." The trait modulates when "her jocular mask slipped" mid-scene, showing cost (the armor she maintains). It enables her approach (disarming Marcus) and constrains authentic connection. However, the attribute is more consistent texture than a trait forcing a key trade-off with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is the story's engine: Sadie catalyzes Marcus, the moon rock catalyzes groundwater purification, connection catalyzes more connection. The phone trade is the primary catalytic act, redefining Marcus from passive to active. The action shapes both major turns and the closure image ("he'd been catalyzed"). Strong integration, though the chemistry metaphor is more described than viscerally felt in Marcus's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rumor chains are seeded early ("She'd started the rumor chain herself... Whispered to a bartender in Prague") and their mechanics matter (bartender → brother-in-law → mineralogist → forum → Marcus). The method shapes Sadie's tactics (why she engineered this meeting) and returns in closure framing ("already becoming another rumor"). However, the chain's specific steps are recounted rather than dramatized, limiting causal pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Millbrook Station is established early, vividly rendered (ivy, Platform Three, pillar), and thematically charged ("once connected six towns... now it connected nothing except this moment"). The setting mirrors the abandonment/reconnection theme and provides atmospheric pressure. It does not, however, constrain a middle choice with visible cost—Marcus and Sadie could conduct this exchange elsewhere with minor adjustments. The ivy "whispered agreements" at closure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Time is referenced ("three weeks later" when the phone will ring, Sadie's seventeen disasters) but does not create on-page pressure. The scene unfolds in a single continuous present without urgency or deadline forcing choices. "When the story changes" is thematic framing rather than a dramatized temporal constraint. Timeframe is present as story scaffolding but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sadie's motivation ("cure for loneliness") is dramatized through her actions (building connection networks) and explicit statement: "the loneliest people aren't the victims—they're the ones watching from safety." Marcus's loneliness is stated ("lonely Marcus with his desperate need to matter") but less viscerally shown. The motivation drives both Sadie's elaborate setup and the closure realization. Slight deduction: the "cure for loneliness" line is articulated rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is embodied in Sadie's transgressive-but-courteous approach ("Terribly sorry about the raccoons," "Everything worthwhile is technically illegal") and the gift-economy ethos. The tone is consistent through the exchange, modulates with pressure (mask slipping moment), and charges the final line ("the only government worth having"). The anarchic element is more described ideal than felt friction—no authority actively opposes them on the page.</comment>
