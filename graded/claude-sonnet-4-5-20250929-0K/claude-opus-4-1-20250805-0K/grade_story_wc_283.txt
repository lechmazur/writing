<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (preserving/spinning futures) is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year tenure and the revelation arrive without visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply "understood her true purpose" and continues her work. The final choice to open the jar lacks any genuine resistance or trade-off. Internal conflict is absent; she moves through epiphany to action without embodied struggle or consequences that alter her options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; we learn "hourglass turner" and "warehouse" but lack spatial grounding and clear stakes until midpoint. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing (prophecy as raw possibility), but cost is asserted, not dramatized—no visible sacrifice, forfeiture, or path foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the pattern-teaching is late and the final reweighting remains abstract. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and Cost proof test penalty (−0.6).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse provides vivid sensory anchors (amber-colored glass, light like frozen honey) and the canyon echo jar offers a tactile constraint at closure. However, spatial choreography is loose—Mara's movements through the warehouse remain vague, and the button spiral's physical assembly lacks grounding. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve/transform prophecy) is signaled late and remains abstract. Mara faces no meaningful tightening or trade-off; the buttons glow, she arranges them, and the hourglass refills without opposition or visible cost. Agency is present (opening the jar) but no option is foreclosed and no price paid. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost—here the pattern is taught too late and cost is declared, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme (endings contain infinite beginnings) emerges from the hourglass imagery and button metaphor, which are specific and non-obvious. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "The shared wisdom she guarded wasn't about knowing the future—it was about understanding that the future was always being written..." This explicit thematic statement (−0.6) replaces earned resonance. The echo and hourglass offer concrete particulars, but the closure articulates the thesis rather than letting it emerge from image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narration drifts into essayistic register ("the shared wisdom of countless lives," "pure potential," "elegant simplicity beneath complexity's tangles") that exceeds Mara's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak—Mara's way of noticing remains generic. Diction climbs into abstraction at peak beats, and the final paragraph reads as authorial summary rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dense figurative language without pattern-teaching: "time moved sideways," "pulverized dreams," "pure potential," "infinite garden" cluster without coherent vehicle. Paraphrase loops appear ("not forward or backward, but sideways" / "unscramble themselves from chaos"; "wasn't preserving the past; she was spinning futures" / "keep them flowing, preventing them from solidifying"). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "one lost button, one turned hourglass, one captured echo at a time." Elevated diction ("concentrated into a single moment of pure potential") clashes with concrete warehouse setting. Applying overwriting density penalty (−0.5), paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.2), and template-cadence penalty (−0.5); total −1.2, plus additional clarity reduction from mixed metaphors (−0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hourglass-as-archive premise offers a fresh angle, and the canyon echo in a jar provides a striking, specific image. However, the execution retreats into familiar chosen-one revelation ("understood her true purpose") and the buttons-form-a-spiral climax echoes countless magical-object assembly scenes. The emotional arc (discovery → understanding → continued work) is generic. Transformation test: swap "hourglass" for "crystal" and "buttons" for "stones" and the emotional structure remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout but her choices are reactive rather than driving turns. She "noticed," "realized," "knew immediately," and "understood"—observation without decision pressure. The action of placing the jar and opening it occurs late and does not narrow prior options. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is weak. Swappable with any curator/guardian archetype. Applying functional-but-replaceable band (3.0–4.9) with minimal beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The canyon echo appears at the midpoint ("that morning"), is matched to the black sand hourglass, and returns at closure when Mara opens it. Two distinct beats: matching (middle) and opening (ending). The echo's unique property (compressed sound) shapes the ending image and provides sensory charge. However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options—Mara faces no cost in opening it. Early signal is missing (−0.4), but beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), and specificity (+0.5) elevate the score. Lyric reprise without mid-scene choice pressure places this in the 5.5–6.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is named repeatedly and thematically present (hourglasses contain "collected moments," "shared wisdom of countless lives"), but it does not shape on-page stakes or alter Mara's tactics. It functions as a thematic label rather than a causal force. Present in setup and ending as concept, but not as actionable constraint. Ornamental use (−0.7), label-only trait (−0.3), and swappability (could be "collective memory" or "communal knowledge" without structural change, −0.5) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears once in the phrase "Mara held it to the amber light, quietly inspired by its impossible existence." Label-only mention without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this trait. Late first appearance (second third, −0.3), ornamental use (−0.8), and label-only treatment (−0.3) place this in the 2.0–3.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is used metaphorically early ("allowing truths to unscramble themselves from the chaos") and literalized at closure ("The truth began to unravel like thread from a spool"). Two beats: early thematic statement and final revelation. However, the action is passive and metaphorical—no on-page choice traces to this verb. Mara arranges buttons and opens the jar; "unscramble" describes the effect rather than driving her decisions. Lyric reprise without causal pressure. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but swappability (−0.6, "reveal" or "clarify" would serve) and summary-only use (−0.4) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is established early ("cataloging lost buttons that arrived mysteriously each dawn"), shapes the middle discovery (buttons correspond to hourglasses, reveal prophecy fragments), and drives the climax (arranging buttons in a spiral pattern). Three distinct beats with causal pressure: the method enables Mara's realization and final action. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.2), and closure linkage (+1.0) place this solidly in the 7.0+ band. Minor swappability (could be "sorting" with edits, −0.3) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is anchored early and provides consistent atmosphere ("amber-colored glass," "frozen honey," "unearthed silence"). It appears in setup, middle (warehouse fills with whispers), and ending (amber walls pulse with light, sound spreads through cliff). The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a middle choice—Mara's actions are unimpeded by the space. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.1), but lack of constraint on choice (no pressure or resource limitation) and some postcard description prevent 8+ scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" frames the narrative but functions as thematic label rather than live clock. The timeframe is vague—"that morning" signals one event, but the unraveling occurs across an indefinite span without tightening decisions. The black sand hourglass "finally emptied" and began filling "again," but no on-page urgency or countdown alters Mara's tactics. Present as concept in setup and ending, but does not track or pressure choices. Ornamental use (−0.7), vague tracking (−0.5), and swappability (−0.5) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is Mara's stated goal once she "understood her true purpose" (late first appearance, second third). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs. She pursues this goal at closure (opening the jar, transforming prophecy), but no friction between wants and costs is present—she acts without hesitation or trade-off. Late signal (−0.4), label-only motivation (−0.5), closure linkage (+0.9), but lack of on-page conflict or price (−0.6) place this in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is established early ("worked in unearthed silence") and returns in the final line ("In the unearthed silence, everything spoke"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet observation → whispers → profound sound), supporting pressure without stasis. The final reprise reweights the opening image with paradox (silence/speech). Early signal (+0.6), coherent modulation (+0.7), lyric reprise that charges closure (+1.0), but the tone remains largely consistent rather than dynamically shifting under peak pressure. Strong lyric integration places this in the 6.0–6.5 range.</comment>
