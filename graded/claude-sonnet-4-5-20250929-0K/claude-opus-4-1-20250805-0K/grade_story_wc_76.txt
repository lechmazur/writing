<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established early and her expertise shapes her actions, but interiority remains abstract. The final transformation—"bleak exhilaration of purpose finally met"—relies on telling rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to reverse the stone's hunger is logical but lacks visible internal conflict or a hierarchy of competing values with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: Elara's grandmother's journals → yoyo mechanism → lighthouse reversal forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (stone inverts from consuming to generating light) with conceptual cost visible in "illuminating not what was ahead but what had been lost in darkness behind." The orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two), and the single meaningful tightening occurs when the stone inverts. One persistent constraint—the stone's hunger—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, rocky island, and tide anchor the scene concretely. The lens assembly and copper wire constrain Elara's reversal work, and the "backward dripping water" charges atmosphere. The yoyo as micro-setting object shapes the closure: its encoded pattern directs the final act. Sensory detail is selective and serves pressure ("darker than absence, a void that pulled at her vision").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing the hunger stone to restore the lighthouse—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening (stone inverts at climax). Agency is clear: Elara's counter-clockwise methodology drives the resolution. The cost is conceptual (the light now runs backward, calling "ships that had been lost to history") but on the page. No secondary antagonist, which is acceptable; pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the counter-clockwise clocks, yoyo mechanism, and final inversion: some souls repair the past by moving against time's current. The ending image—"a beacon for all things that refused to surrender to forward-only time"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The hunger stone's transformation from consumer to generator offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in "starving it properly" and the lighthouse's deliberate extinguishment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature ("darkness flickered," "latent radiance"). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. One dialogue line—"You were meant to illuminate"—reads slightly on-the-nose but remains character-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("latent radiance," "bleak exhilaration") but stays within a clock-maker's technical lexicon. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the inversion beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. Minor overwriting appears: "sound like time itself cracking" and "bleak exhilaration" edge toward elevated register without full payoff. One paraphrase loop: "understanding flooding through her" echoes "she understood" two sentences prior. The figurative density in the hunger-stone description ("void that pulled at her vision," "living shadow") is pattern-consistent and legible. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The counter-clockwise clock-maker premise combined with a hunger stone and yoyo-as-key offers a specific synthesis. The inversion mechanism—starving the stone properly rather than feeding it—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the backward-light concept, though the emotional resolution ("purpose finally met") leans toward familiar satisfaction. The grandmother-as-guide and destiny motifs are well-worn but executed with enough specificity (astronomical etchings, meteorite fragment) to avoid template flatness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in paragraph one, drives the midpoint dismantling, and executes the final inversion. Her counter-clockwise expertise shapes tactics (working backward from construction) and the closure turn. Two distinct beats: arrival with yoyo, reversal with copper wire. Causal pressure is strong; her choices narrow options and generate the light inversion. Closure linkage is direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunger stone is introduced by paragraph four, manipulated in two beats (lens disassembly, copper-wire winding), and inverts at closure with visible cost (light now runs backward). Its darkness "pulled at her vision" constrains her approach. The stone's transformation from consumer to generator is causally central and irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage; the ending image depends on this exact element.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Latent radiance is named in paragraph five and recurs in the reversal sequence ("latent radiance began to organize"). It frames the stone's trapped light and enables Elara's solution (releasing potential by starving hunger). Present in two beats and the closure explanation. Moderately essential but somewhat swappable with "trapped light" or similar phrasing; the concept shapes stakes but does not uniquely constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is attributed to Elara's clocks in paragraph one and echoes in "practiced precision" at the lamp room. It enables her recognition of the reversal sequence but is not tested under cost. The trait is signaled early and consistent but functions more as characterization than as a constraint that alters tactics. One beat involvement (yoyo decoding) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears explicitly in paragraph six ("She would initiate the reversal") and drives the climax: Elara begins the lens disassembly and copper winding. The action is signaled, executed, and results in the stone's inversion. Two beats (setup statement, execution) with strong causal pressure. Closure linkage is direct; removing this action would break the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The yoyo is introduced in paragraph one, decoded over "months of sleepless nights" (paragraph two), and its encoded pattern directs the copper-wire sequence at climax. Mechanics matter: "rhythm of its motion, the way it climbed back up its string against gravity's will." Two beats (discovery/decoding, application) with strong causal pressure. Essential to the reversal method; swapping it for another puzzle device would require major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse is present from the opening line, structures all action (tide pulling away, spiral stairs, lamp room), and supplies the lens assembly and stone. The rocky island isolation and backward-dripping water charge atmosphere. The setting constrains Elara's work (she must reach the apex, dismantle the lens in place) and the final image (lighthouse beam sweeping backward). Three beats with strong closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Low tide is mentioned in the opening line and paragraph nine ("As the tide continued its slow exhale"). It frames duration but does not tighten decisions or force urgent choices. The timeframe is descriptive rather than pressuring; Elara works at her own pace. Present early and at closure as atmospheric detail, but swappable with other temporal markers without altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated in the penultimate paragraph ("She'd stepped beyond fate's design by fulfilling it perfectly backward"). The desire is implicit earlier (her forty-year rebellion, the grandmother's encoded purpose) but not dramatized as conflicted choice. The phrase charges the ending reflection but arrives as summary rather than tested friction. Closure participation is present but lacks on-page cost legibility in the choice itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named explicitly in paragraph twelve and modulates appropriately: the opening's "dying breath" tide, the hunger stone's "living shadow," and Elara's "bitter and triumphant" laugh. Tone tightens at the inversion ("sound like time itself cracking") and charges the final image (backward light calling lost ships). Coherent across beats with a purposeful cadence shift at closure. Strong integration but slightly told in the final summary.</comment>
