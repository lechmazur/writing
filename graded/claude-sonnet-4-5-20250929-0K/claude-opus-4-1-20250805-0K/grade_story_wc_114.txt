<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's oracle gift is embodied through concrete choices—staying at the station, occupying margins, drawing and smudging the illustration. Her interiority shows contradictory impulses (the need to protect versus document) acting simultaneously. The final choice to smudge her signature and descend carries visible cost: she protects the truth by ensuring it remains marginal, foreclosing official recognition. Minor slip: some interior moments ("swallowed this truth during her fever, incorporated it somehow into her body's knowledge") edge toward abstract label-speak rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (fever → illustration → flowers → drawing) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final act of smudging and taping the drawing crystallizes her stance—she'll carry marginal truth down the mountain, protecting what official knowledge can't reach. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by opening paragraphs). One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees the flowers bloom under aurora light, transforming her understanding from fever-glimpse to embodied knowledge. Cost is visible: she files a false report, accepts marginality, and carries the weight "like a second, wiser heart."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station constrains choice throughout: Mira's access to magnetometer readings enables her vigil, and the window margins literally house the hidden illustrations. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (thin alpine air, altitude sickness, particular weight of darkness at elevation). The aurora's descent and the flowers' bloom are spatially choreographed and charge the final image when Mira tapes her own drawing to the window. Micro-setting (supply closet sleeping, emergency rations, pencil on outdated forms) shows her occupying margins physically, not just conceptually.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mira must understand the truth that lodged in her during fever. Pressure tightens when she discovers the pattern of hidden illustrations, then escalates when the aurora descends and she sees the impossible flowers bloom. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to draw, to smudge, to protect. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost—she'll file a false report and accept marginality rather than expose what can't survive scrutiny. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from observation to documentation to protection deepens the stake meaningfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: truths that require fever to see, margins to survive, smudging to protect. The botanical illustrations function as recurring motifs that shift meaning—from mystery to pattern to Mira's own contribution. The final image offers a non-literal answer to "what is the weight of swallowed truth?" through the aurora-light-on-petals paradox: "both nothing and everything, depending on who was doing the measuring." No thematic statements intrude; the closing metaphor of "a second, wiser heart" feels earned through the progression from illness to understanding to protection. The piece embraces ambiguity (flowers that exist and don't) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature. Voice carries a distinct texture: "prayer flags in the thin alpine air," "grief made visible," "swaying certainties." Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the aurora sequence, slightly pulled back during contextual grounding. Minor slip: occasional phrases edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds what the focalizer would plausibly formulate mid-crisis ("peripherally aware of something crucial lurking at the edges of her consciousness" reads more authorial than character-filtered). No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter sentences during the aurora sequence accelerating pressure. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Minor loop detected: "The truth of it rushed through her" / "whispered its story" / "swallowed this truth" / "carry this truth" recycles the abstraction across multiple beats without adding pressure. Figurative language (prayer flags, grief made visible, electromagnetic sorrow) is purposeful and mostly coherent, though "fault-tolerant" receives heavy conceptual load across the piece. No significant filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion remains strong through the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of oracle-gift, impossible botany, and electromagnetic conditions feels specific and non-obvious. The concept of "fault-tolerant oracle" who holds contradictions is transformed through the concrete action of documenting flowers that bloom only during magnetic storms. The smudging detail—a small, specific gesture—becomes the story's elegant solution to protecting marginal knowledge. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending, both executed cleanly. The piece avoids template weather-station isolation or oracle-as-prophet clichés by grounding everything in particular scientific instruments and botanical documentation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's oracle gift (fault-tolerant, holding contradictions) is introduced early, drives her choice to stay at the station, enables her recognition of the illustration pattern, and directly shapes the closure: she can hold the contradiction of flowers that exist/don't exist and protect them by smudging. The gift constrains her final choice—she won't expose the truth officially because her unique ability lets her preserve it marginally. Present in setup, middle development (calibrating magnetometer, understanding previous keeper's method), and payoff (drawing and smudging her own illustration).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears early (taped to window, edges curling), drives the middle beat when Mira discovers the pattern of hidden illustrations throughout the station, and is causally active at closure when she creates and smudges her own drawing to add to the constellation. It's handled physically across multiple beats: she touches it, studies previous keeper's smudged signatures, then produces her own. The illustration's specific property (smudged signature as protection) becomes the story's central mechanism. Removal would break the story's logic of how marginal truths are preserved.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is introduced early (truths "swaying like prayer flags"), shapes Mira's understanding in the middle (flowers that exist/don't exist as contradictory states), and appears in the closure unit ("swaying certainties of petals"). It constrains her oracle gift's nature and informs her final stance toward truth as multiple/contradictory. However, it functions more as thematic texture than as a constraint that alters specific tactics or forecloses options. The concept deepens atmosphere and worldview but could be softened without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is introduced early (opening paragraph: "peripherally aware of something crucial"), enables the middle beat (her peripheral consciousness catches the aurora's shimmer first), and appears at closure ("peripherally aware of the flowers closing"). The trait constrains how she perceives—catching truth at edges rather than directly—which fits her oracle gift. However, the trait's mechanical effect is largely observational; it doesn't force a trade-off or meaningfully narrow options. It's present across beats and thematically consistent but functions more as perceptual style than as a constraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Smudging appears mid-story when Mira discovers previous keeper's smudged signatures, is understood as protective mechanism ("smudged just enough to protect both artist and subject from scrutiny"), and becomes the major turn at closure when she smudges her own signature before taping the drawing. The action is irreplaceable—it's the specific method by which marginal truths survive without being erased or exposed. The smudge carries conceptual cost: Mira sacrifices attribution and certainty to preserve the knowledge. Setup, development (understanding the pattern), and payoff are all present; the action redefines her options from "report or suppress" to "protect by obscuring."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is signaled early (previous keeper hid drawings "in the margins"), demonstrated physically in the middle (Mira sleeps in supply closet, eats emergency rations, records on backs of forms), and shapes the closure when she tapes her drawing "to the window's margin." The method constrains her tactics throughout—she can't use official channels, must work outside sanctioned observation. It's causally necessary: the story's central tension is how marginal knowledge survives, and the method of occupying physical/procedural margins is the answer. Removal would break the logic of how truth is protected.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Station Seven is anchored early, provides specific tools (barometers, anemometers, magnetometer) that enable Mira's vigil, and appears at closure ("Station Seven hummed around her"). The setting's isolation and instrumentation are necessary—Mira needs the magnetometer to detect the storm, the altitude for aurora proximity, and the solitude to stay after others descend. However, many beats could occur at any mountain station; the specific "weather station" identity matters mainly for the instruments. The setting shapes attempts but isn't as irreplaceable as the illustrations or smudging. Present in setup, middle (using equipment), and ending (instruments recording/missing what matters).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is introduced in the opening sentence, frames Mira's returning clarity and oracle gift, and establishes that she glimpsed the truth during fever. The timeframe creates urgency (she stayed while others descended yesterday) and explains why her body "needed to break before it could accept this knowledge." However, once established, the fever functions more as backstory than as a live constraint—no ticking clock tightens her choices in the present action. The timeframe matters for setup and thematic resonance (truth requiring fever to see) but doesn't actively pressure her tactics during the aurora vigil or drawing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding "the weight of a swallowed truth" is Mira's stated goal early ("needed to find its weight"), drives her middle choices (reviewing logs, waiting for aurora, understanding previous keeper's method), and is answered at closure ("weight of it...exactly the weight of aurora light on mountain petals"). The motivation is dramatized through her staying alone, occupying margins, and choosing to draw rather than report officially. Friction exists between wanting to understand and the cost of protecting (she must falsify her report, accept marginality). The desire is embodied in concrete actions across all three gates; the final image directly addresses the motivating question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is established early ("something she'd glimpsed in fever dreams," "grief made visible") and charges the final image when the aurora pulses acknowledgment before retreating. The tone is coherent throughout—elegiac, precise, colored by loss and beauty. It modulates appropriately: clinical during instrument calibration, intensifying during the aurora descent ("intimate sorrow, green-gold ribbons"), quiet again at closure. The tone is not merely decorative; it shapes Mira's understanding that these flowers bloom "only in electromagnetic sorrow" and that truth requires "sorrow to understand." The emotional texture is consistent and elevates the ending's resonance without overwhelming the causal chain.</comment>
