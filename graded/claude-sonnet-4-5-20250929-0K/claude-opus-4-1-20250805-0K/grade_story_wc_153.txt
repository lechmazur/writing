<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The medium's interior motivation—protecting herself rather than Marina—emerges through reflection and is affirmed on-page ("I was protecting myself, not you"), though the confession itself lacks a dramatized micro-choice that visibly alters present tactics. Emotional embodiment is uneven: "scars healed...where unsent letters had carved themselves into her soul" reads as abstraction rather than embodied pain. The final choice to send the message through dreams arrives but the path from armor to vulnerability relies heavily on spirit-mediated revelation rather than internal contradiction acting in scene. No therapy-speak at peak beats, but interiority leans toward poetic summary over moment-by-moment embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (message sent via dreams, armor released) with felt cost: years of isolation ending, the shard crumbling, vulnerability chosen. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—spirits' songs, condensation windows, and the shard accumulate pressure until the medium shifts stance and releases the unsent words. One meaningful tightening occurs when she touches the third window and time folds backward, reweighting her original refusal. Cost is legible: "fierce tenderness of admitting she'd been wrong" and the shard crumbling. Minor causal slip: the mechanics of how the dream-message will reach Marina are asserted but not constrained by prior scene logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth—roots "like frozen screams," knee-deep water, mercury-pooled moonlight—is vivid and constrains movement (wading, circling spirits). The shard functions as micro-setting: its warmth pulses with heartbeat, it channels fear away from love, and it crumbles at closure, actively shaping the final image. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through urgency (moonlight, condensation, brackish air). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting and object together charge the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reconcile with Marina by voicing the apology that has waited three years. One on-page tightening occurs when the medium touches the third window and time folds, forcing her to confront her original evasion; the spirits' song shifts to Marina's lullaby, deepening pressure. The resolution is protagonist-driven (she chooses to speak the message) with visible cost (shard crumbles, years of armor released). The price—admitting she was wrong, ending isolation—is legible and charges the final image. No secondary reversals needed at this length; escalation and cost are clear under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—healing requires exposure, the cost of silence versus connection—emerges through the condensation windows, the shard's transformation from guardian to channel, and the spirits' songs rather than direct statement. The third window's barely visible message, "I'm sorry I taught you to be afraid of your own intuition," is specific and earned. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "no longer cryptic, finally just a mother" reweights the medium's gift from isolation tool to connection bridge. The gargoyle motif (channeling storms, then fear) constrains the closure choice and recurs with shifted meaning. Minor slip: "fierce tenderness" appears as a label in two late paragraphs, verging on thematic echo, but it is embodied earlier in the spirits' demeanor and Marina's past care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: the medium filters setting through her gift (spirits' songs, visions, the shard's pulse). Diction is elevated and lyric ("mercury between the mangroves," "pearl of truth") and remains within the established voice; no register drift into mundane corporate speak. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the window-touching moment, slightly wider during the spirits' explanation. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she heard herself say, though her lips hadn't moved") in one high-pressure beat, but it serves the mystical mode rather than obscuring immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots twisted like frozen screams," "condensation rose like morning mist"). Two paraphrase-loop moments: paragraphs describing the shard's purpose ("channeling rain...channeled something else," then later "channeled her fear away from love") restate the same metaphor without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. Stock metaphor in "eyes like broken glass" and "moonlight pooled like mercury" are present but don't muddle peak beats. Information density is high; no scaffold sentences. One simultaneous-action error: "she pressed the shard against her chest, feeling its ancient stone pulse" reads as sequential but uses participial construction. Closure beat is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—cryptic medium, gargoyle shard as conduit, condensation-window messages, mangrove spirits—is specific and purposeful, avoiding pure template. The emotional arc (silence to vulnerability) is familiar but grounded in particular images: the shard from Notre-Dame, the third window's message, Marina's lullaby. The "unsent letters" motif is well-worn in reconciliation narratives; transformation comes through the mystical frame (evocation, dream-sending) rather than fresh moral calculus or lived occupational detail. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode without hedging. Risk-taking in the layered symbolism (gargoyle as guardian, shard as channel, condensation as medium) heightens coherence, earning a modest within-band lift. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cryptic medium's choice to evoke the spirits, touch the third window, and send the message via dreams drives all major turns. Setup: present from the opening. Development: her decision to command "Show me" and then press the shard against the window are on-page actions that narrow options. Payoff: her transformation to "no longer cryptic, finally just a mother" and the choice to speak the apology appear in the closure unit. Causal pressure is strong; the medium's agency shapes the ending. Three beats of involvement (evocation, window-touching, message-sending) and closure linkage present. Cost: years of armor released, shard crumbles. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard is handled in multiple beats: pressed against chest (opening), grows warm, raised during evocation, pressed against the third window, crumbles to dust at closure. Its properties—channeling, pulsing with heartbeat, warmth—actively enable the medium's tactics. Setup: first paragraph. Development: it channels her fear and enables the condensation-window magic. Payoff: crumbles at closure, purpose fulfilled, reweighted as love-enabler rather than storm-deflector. Causal pressure, irreplaceability (its Notre-Dame origin and channeling nature matter), and closure linkage all strong. Three or more beats, cost connection (crumbles = transformation complete).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unsent letters shape the premise and stakes: the medium has withheld apology and explanation for three years, and the story's goal is to release those words. Setup: mentioned in the first few paragraphs. Development: the condensation windows are "frosted with messages she'd never sent," and the medium understands "every unsent letter she'd ever written" contributes to the shard's resonance. Payoff: "all those unsent letters lifting, transforming into hope" in the final paragraph. The concept constrains the medium's past choices and is reweighted at closure, but the letters themselves are not physically handled or sent; the message is delivered via dream. Two gates (setup, payoff) with strong thematic reprise; middle development is implicit rather than action-based. Closure linkage and thematic charge present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "heals in moonlight" is mentioned twice: "Every full moon, her scars healed—not the ones on her skin, but the deeper wounds" and "the familiar tingling that preceded healing" near closure. Setup: second paragraph. Development: implicit—the moonlight/full-moon timing sets the scene's pressure, but no on-page action shows the medium leveraging or constrained by this trait during a choice. Payoff: "moonlight mending broken things" and the medium feeling healing at dawn link the trait to closure theme. The trait colors tone and timing but does not visibly narrow tactics or force a trade-off. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff), but no middle beat where the healing ability alters a decision. Lyric-resonance case; score in the 5.5–6.3 range per the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The action "evoke" is the medium's stated goal: "Tonight, she would evoke them all" (spirits and unsent truths). Setup: early signal in paragraph two. Development: she commands the spirits "Show me," raising the shard, and they respond by breathing condensation onto invisible windows—direct dramatization of evocation. Payoff: evocation leads to the confession and the dream-message being sent. The action is irreplaceable; without evocation, the spirits do not reveal the windows or carry the message. Two beats (command, spirit response) and closure linkage. Causal pressure strong; swapping "evoke" for a generic "call" would lose the mystical specificity. Cost connection: evocation requires vulnerability, and the medium's armor must break for it to succeed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows appear mid-story as the spirits' mechanism: "condensation rose...settled on invisible windows hanging in the air—panes of possibility, each one frosted with messages she'd never sent." Setup: absent in the first third; introduced around the middle. Development: the medium touches the third window and reads its message, which triggers time-folding and her confession. Payoff: new words form in condensation ("Come to the mangroves. I'm ready to speak"), and the message mechanism enables the dream-sending closure. The method is dramatized and its mechanics (spirits breathe, condensation settles, words form) matter. Two beats (reading, writing new message) and closure linkage present. Late first appearance (mid-story) applies −0.3 penalty, but strong causal work and closure linkage lift the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits is present throughout: the medium wades through knee-deep water, roots twist, spirits circle and sing Marina's name, their songs grow louder and shift to Marina's lullaby. Setup: opening paragraphs. Development: the labyrinth's "heart" is where moonlight pools and the spirits reveal the windows; the setting provides the ritual space and the spirits as active pressure/guides. Payoff: "The medium stood alone in the mangrove labyrinth, no longer cryptic" at closure; the setting frames the transformation. The spirits' songs constrain the medium's emotional state and supply the mechanism (dream-carrying) for the ending. Three or more beats, causal pressure (spirits guide and enable), closure linkage, and micro-setting (body in water, moonlight pooling) all strong. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is interpreted as the liminal moment of decision; the medium seeks "the moment before deciding" to redo her choice. Setup: stated early ("she searched for the moment before deciding"). Development: when she touches the third window, "time folded backward. She stood again in that moment before deciding—Marina at the door." The timeframe is dramatized as a literal revisiting. Payoff: the medium chooses differently in that space, releasing the apology into the present/future. The concept shapes the mystical premise and the medium's goal. Two beats (seeking, finding/inhabiting the moment) and closure linkage. The timeframe is more metaphysical than a live ticking clock, so it does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat, but it does structure the ending's reconfiguration. Lyric-resonance case with purposeful reprise; score in upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the moment before deciding" drives the medium's journey into the labyrinth and her command to the spirits. Setup: early signal ("she searched for the moment before deciding"). Development: the spirits reveal the windows, and the medium's realization that she was "protecting myself, not you" crystallizes her need to choose differently. Payoff: she finds the moment and "chosen differently" at closure. The desire is dramatized through action (wading, raising shard, touching window) and conflicted (her armor resists vulnerability). Friction between want (redo the choice) and cost (releasing armor, admitting fault) is visible. Two beats (searching, finding/acting) and closure linkage strong. The motivation is essential but slightly abstract; it shapes the arc more than it creates moment-by-moment tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "fierce tenderness" is embodied in the spirits' demeanor ("shimmering with fierce tenderness—the same expression Marina wore when she'd bandaged her mother's hands") and recurs in the medium's realization near closure ("the fierce tenderness of admitting she'd been wrong"). Setup: mid-story introduction via spirits' description. Development: the tone colors the spirits' guidance and the medium's internal shift; it modulates from distant/cryptic early to vulnerable/connected at the end. Payoff: the phrase reappears in the penultimate section, charging the closure image with the story's emotional paradox (strength in vulnerability). Coherence across turns is strong; the tone is not static but deepens as pressure mounts. The label appears twice as a phrase, which verges on thematic echo, but it is also enacted through the spirits' behavior and the medium's transformation. Closure linkage and tonal charge present.</comment>
