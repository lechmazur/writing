<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's ghost exists primarily to deliver convenient solutions rather than face contradictory impulses; her motivation to help is stated but never tested against a competing desire or cost to herself. The families receive superficial characterization through their actions (bringing samples, tearing down fences) but no individual wrestles with doubt or pays a visible personal price for changing course. The transformation from suspicion to cooperation happens through Marina's orchestration rather than through earned struggle, and the ending's fade feels like a reward rather than a choice with foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Marina writes messages, families gather evidence, mycologist explains, network forms, blight retreats. The closure—Marina fading and the bell materializing—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: her work complete, she can rest), but the cost feels abstract rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Pomona-7, floating arches, Marina's ghost, brass bell, two hundred years). The central weakness is causality: families shift from bitter isolation to cooperation because Marina told them to look, not because any individual made a difficult choice that reweighted their stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pomona-7's floating stone arches, crimson sky, and orchard groves create a vivid micro-setting. The arches function spatially (Marina drifts among them, watches from the highest) and the networked fungi constrain the solution—only cross-property root systems cure the blight. Sensory details are selective (chalk dust, bell chime, brass butterflies catching light) and the ending image of the bell mounted at the fountain charges the final beat. The piece stays within its established world rules and the floating arches recur meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the orchards and restoring community—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Marina discovers the fungal network pattern and writes messages to guide families toward collaboration. However, escalation is largely external: the families respond to Marina's clues without on-page friction or resistance that Marina must overcome. The resolution (networked root systems, mounted bell) lands, but the protagonist's agency is observational orchestration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost to her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: isolation vs. interdependence, strangers-to-family, collective survival requiring shared vulnerability. The final chalk message—"Strangers built this world. Suspicion nearly killed it. Family saved it. Remember."—edges toward thesis statement but the prior material (tearing down fences, grafting branches, bell as unity symbol) has already dramatized the theme through action. The butterfly motif (bell engraving, Marina protecting it in life) recurs with modest charge at closure. The piece resists overt moralizing in the peak beats but the thematic arc is more resolved than resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV tracks Marina cleanly with no head-hopping. Voice remains consistent—lyrical, mournful, purposeful—and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close when Marina discovers the pattern, wider when surveying the healed orchards). Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Who's writing these?" / "Don't know, but they were right about Sector Nine"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("brambled hope took root") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered, and some beats summarize key turns (families "began tearing down fences") rather than dramatizing them in Marina's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is high. Some phrasing feels template-like: "watched them all grow old and die, watched their children inherit the groves, watched the community flourish" (anaphora that flattens rather than charges). "Brambled hope took root alongside the healing trees" stacks metaphor without embodied cost. The opening and closing images (bell chiming, butterflies dancing in light) are vivid, but mid-story beats summarize key actions (families gathering, grafting, mycologist's announcement) rather than showing them with high information density. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but momentum sags in expository passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ghost-as-helper premise is familiar but the specific synthesis—floating-arch orchard planet, fungal network requiring cross-property diversity, chalk messages at dawn—feels purposeful rather than generic. The blight-as-isolation metaphor is clear without being heavy-handed. However, the emotional arc (Marina orchestrates, families cooperate, ghost fades fulfilled) follows a predictable template: problem introduced, wise guide provides clues, community learns lesson, guide departs. The bell as unity symbol and the "strangers/family" framing are competent but not surprising. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise but does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marina's altruism is established (died protecting the bell, helps without acknowledgment) and her nightly discoveries + dawn messages drive the plot. However, her choices are observational and orchestrative rather than conflicted; she never faces a decision that tests her altruism against a competing desire or cost to herself. She appears in setup, middle (writing messages, discovering the pattern), and payoff (fading, bell materializing), meeting all three gates. Her role enables key turns but she does not wrestle with friction, so the integration is functional rather than essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brass butterfly garden watering bell is handled across multiple beats: Marina clutches it at dawn, it chimes softly as she writes, it slips from her fingers and materializes at closure, Tom finds it and the families mount it at the fountain as a unity symbol. Early signal (first paragraph), middle use (recurring motif during her messages), and strong payoff (physical transformation, new communal function). The bell's engraved butterflies catching light in the final image reweight prior material. However, the bell does not constrain a choice under pressure—it accumulates symbolic charge without altering tactics—so it lands shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nebula of respite" is Marina's internal metaphor for the scattered pockets of fungal resistance. It shapes her understanding ("pockets of resistance scattered like stars") and drives her message strategy ("Map your healthy trees together"), enabling the mycologist's discovery that cross-property networks create immunity. Present in setup (Marina's discovery), middle (her messages guide families to examine the pattern), and payoff (networked orchards resist blight). The concept is causal—no single family could see the pattern alone—but the metaphor itself ("nebula") is ornamental; the fungal-network mechanic does the structural work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" describes the families' reaction to Marina's chalk messages: "Something strangely trustworthy emanated from the careful script, as if the very chalk carried good intentions." This trait enables the families to act on the messages despite not knowing their author, a key turn. However, it is told rather than shown—we do not see a character wrestle with doubt and choose to trust—and it appears only in the middle third. The trait is functional (without it, families might ignore the messages) but not dramatized with visible cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reexamine" drives the central turn: Marina's messages prompt families to reexamine not just their trees but their assumptions about each other, leading to the gathering at the fountain and the mycologist's discovery. Early signal (implied in Marina's first message about Sector Nine), middle development (explicit in "began to reexamine"), and payoff (cooperative network heals orchards). The action is necessary—without it, families remain isolated—and it appears in dialogue ("they were right about Sector Nine") and narration. However, the reexamination is summarized rather than dramatized in a high-stakes choice, so it is essential but not irreplaceable in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chalking messages on deserted sidewalks at dawn is Marina's sole method of intervention. Established early (first third: "her bell chiming softly as she wrote messages in chalk"), it structures multiple beats (messages near the Hendersons' grove, Nakamuras' hedge, "Map your healthy trees together," final message on the thoroughfare), and the method's constraints matter—dawn timing, public visibility, one-way communication—shape the families' gradual trust and collective response. The final chalk message delivers thematic closure. The method is intrinsic to Marina's ghost mechanics and irreplaceable; no other means would preserve her anonymity and collective orchestration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pomona-7's floating rock arches and orchard groves anchor every scene. The arches provide spatial choreography (Marina drifts among them, watches from the highest, light filters through them onto the bell) and the orchards supply the stakes (blight, root systems, cross-property grafting). The planet's isolation and tight-knit families arise from the crashed colony ship backstory. Setting is present in setup, middle, and payoff, and the floating arches charge the final image ("frozen clouds"). However, the arches themselves do not constrain a choice—they are atmospheric rather than tactical—so the setting shapes mood and stakes but does not alter a key decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" is established in the opening: "Two hundred years had passed since the colony ship crashed here, transforming frightened strangers into the tight-knit orchard families." This history frames the stakes (community cohesion threatened by blight-induced suspicion) and charges the final message ("Strangers built this world... Family saved it"). The six-month recovery montage demonstrates that transformation takes time. However, the timeframe does not impose urgency or tighten a live decision; it provides context rather than a ticking clock. Present in setup and thematically reprised at closure, but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to orchestrate collective effort" drives every beat: discovering the fungal pattern, writing targeted messages, guiding families to the fountain, watching them collaborate. Established early (she writes to connect isolated knowledge), developed through her nightly observations and dawn interventions, and fulfilled at closure (her work complete, she fades). The motivation is consistent and shapes all her choices. However, it is never conflicted—Marina does not wrestle with doubt, fatigue, or a competing want—so the desire is essential but undramatized. The friction between wants and costs is told ("her work was complete") rather than shown in a moment of renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is stated explicitly ("brambled hope took root alongside the healing trees") and implicit in the tonal arc: despair (blight, suspicion) → cautious effort (families gathering samples) → gradual recovery (children playing in mixed groves). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image (bell ringing, new messages at dawn suggest continuity). However, "brambled" as a texture—prickly, tangled, difficult—is more asserted than embodied in the prose; the families' cooperation proceeds smoothly once Marina provides clues, without the visceral friction the modifier promises. Coherent and purposeful, but the brambled quality is underdramatized.</comment>
