<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margot's observant nature is embodied through concrete gestures (tracking the pen's shadow, noticing light on her father's ring) and her internal contradiction between truth-seeking and empire-protection drives the final choice. The decision to create a third false narrative shows genuine internal conflict between transparency and preservation. However, the characterization leans heavily on intellectual puzzle-solving rather than visceral emotional stakes; her "mournful and amused" laugh tells more than it shows. The renunciation of honesty carries conceptual weight but limited felt cost—we don't see what she personally loses beyond abstract "honesty."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Margot, observatory, post-journalist-call). The causal chain is tight: journalist's contradiction → Margot's investigation → realization of Geneva/telegram truth → choice to muddy waters with Tokyo lie. Closure qualifies as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (abandoning truth for misdirection) legible in the final image of the sealed letter and "goodbye kiss to honesty." The drive lens reads as Causal throughout. One micro-turn (understanding both accounts were true via proxy) deepens before the final pivot, meeting length expectations. The ending forecloses the path of revelation with visible action (sealing the letter, locking the pen).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice subtly: its isolation permits Margot's solitary decision, the brass instruments "mock the slippery nature of human truth," and the vault provides the pen's final resting place. Sensory details (copper dome, clouds below, dawn glow like burning newsprint) are filtered through Margot's observer lens and support atmosphere. The grandfather's unreported asteroid functions as thematic mirror but doesn't physically constrain the present choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (pen, paper, vault) charges the final image adequately but doesn't drive a mid-story turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect father's reputation vs. reveal truth) is signaled early and tightens through Margot's reasoning process. The realization that both accounts can be true via proxy constitutes meaningful escalation that narrows her options. The final choice—create a third impossible story—shows protagonist agency and forecloses the path of honest intervention with visible cost (truth becomes "impossible to determine"). The price is conceptual but legible: she abandons the investigative integrity her "devotedly observant nature" implies. One clear tightening and one decisive turn meet length requirements under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth's instability emerges through concrete particulars: the contradictory memoir, the grandfather's hidden asteroid, stars broadcasting "different moments in time, all arriving now." The "orbits of regret" conceit deepens from shadow-ellipses to incomplete orbits to the final image of truths "circling but never landing." The ending offers a resonant answer—some discoveries are kept "floating in the dark"—without moralizing. Margot's choice embodies the thematic question rather than stating it. The rosewood pen as truth-instrument turned sealed artifact charges the closure. Minor slip: "Let the next generation decide" edges toward explicit thematic statement but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance and Margot's perceptual signature (tracking shadows, noticing peculiar light). Diction matches an educated heiress's register ("moot," "canonized," "mournful and amused"). The prose modulates appropriately from analytical investigation to the final renunciation. Two friction points: "devotedly observant nature" is label-heavy telling in a crucial characterization moment, and the journalist's dialogue reads functional but generic ("Your father's memoir contradicts itself"). The phrase "goodbye kiss to honesty" risks purple but stays voice-consistent. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively ("That was when she understood" paragraph break creates emphasis). Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several figurative constructions in close proximity risk overwriting: "copper dome floating... like a ship unmoored," "orbits of regret," "chasing the contradiction like a comet's tail," and "clouds... glow like old newsprint held to flame" all appear within the first two-thirds. Two paraphrase loops: the "truth moved like planets" metaphor is explained twice in adjacent sentences, and "Some orbits... Some regrets..." near the end repeats the same conceptual point. The phrase "devotedly observant nature" in paragraph three reads as template characterization. No major clarity breaks, but density dips slightly in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of family legacy, journalistic truth-seeking, and astronomical metaphor feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The solution—creating a third impossible narrative rather than choosing truth or lie—offers a fresh angle on the "family secret" template. However, the core premise (heiress protecting scandalous family history) is familiar, and the transformation relies heavily on the observatory/astronomy conceit which, while specific, doesn't fully escape metaphorical convenience. The grandfather's parallel (hidden asteroid/wartime activities) adds texture but functions primarily as thematic echo. The "proof by contradiction" method is mentioned but not deeply integrated into Margot's actual reasoning process. Risk-taking is moderate; the ending commits to moral ambiguity without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Margot as newsprint heiress shapes the dominant stake (newspaper empire protection) and appears throughout. Her specific position enables access to archives and creates the central conflict between transparency and legacy. The final choice to seal the letter and protect the empire is causally driven by this identity. Present in setup (first paragraph), development (archive room memory, empire considerations), and payoff (final paragraph's "newspaper empire to protect"). Causal pressure is solid but the heiress role could be genericized to "wealthy daughter" with modest edits; the newsprint specificity matters thematically but doesn't create unique tactical constraints.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in the opening line, is used to write both the investigative notes and the final misdirection letter, and is sealed in the vault as the closing image. Three distinct beats: opening description, "began writing again, but differently now," and "goodbye kiss to honesty" / vault sealing. The pen's "shadow traced perfect ellipses" introduces the orbit metaphor. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric object and thematic carrier; any heirloom writing instrument could serve the plot beats. The vault sealing charges the closure moderately but the pen's specific properties (rosewood, antique) don't constrain Margot's choices. Present across all three gates with purposeful reprise but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" shapes the conceptual architecture: introduced through pen-shadow ellipses, developed through "truth moved like planets," crystallized in "orbits... designed never to complete." The concept directly influences Margot's final tactic—keeping truth orbital rather than letting it land. It constrains her options by suggesting circular evasion as a viable strategy and frames the ending's stakes (incomplete orbits vs. completing them). The grandfather's unreported asteroid reinforces the pattern. The concept isn't merely thematic decoration; it generates the specific form of Margot's intervention. Strong integration across setup (paragraph 3), development (planetary metaphor), and payoff (final two paragraphs). Cost is conceptual but legible: truth will circle indefinitely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "devotedly observant" trait appears as direct label in paragraph three and is demonstrated through Margot noticing the pen's shadow, the light on her father's ring in the photograph, and catching the contradiction between Geneva and the board meeting. However, the trait is more illustrative than constraining—it enables her to solve the puzzle but doesn't create meaningful friction or tradeoff. Any competent investigator could perform the same analysis. The observation leads to discovery but not to a choice where being observant costs her something else. Present in setup and development but doesn't pressure the closure choice. Functional but highly swappable; mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intervene" is the dominant action verb: Margot could "intervene before tomorrow's headlines" but chooses intervention through obfuscation rather than revelation. The action structures both the middle turn (deciding whether to expose) and the final choice (type of intervention). Present throughout: journalist's call creates intervention pressure, mid-story she considers exposing, final act is deliberate intervention via Tokyo misdirection. The specific form of intervention (muddying rather than clarifying) drives the ending's moral weight. Not easily swappable—"respond" or "act" wouldn't carry the same connotation of active disruption. Strong causal role but intervention-as-obfuscation could be slightly more embodied in tactical detail.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is mentioned explicitly ("not the denial... but a proof") and structures Margot's initial reasoning: if Geneva alibi is true, photo is fake; but photo is real, therefore Geneva story is false. However, this method is abandoned when she discovers both can be true via proxy. The Tokyo strategy isn't presented as formal contradiction proof but as absurdist misdirection. The method appears in setup (paragraph 4-5) but doesn't constrain the climactic choice or shape the closure. Mentioned and used once, then dropped for a different tactic. Functional in the investigation phase but not essential to the resolution; easily replaceable with "analysis" or "investigation." Mid-low band due to single-beat use without payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The echoing observatory above clouds provides atmospheric isolation that enables Margot's solitary decision and supplies the vault for the pen's symbolic sealing. The "echoing" quality is used once ("sound... echoed through the dome's acoustic perfection") and the "above clouds" position reinforces the family's remove from accountability. The brass instruments and great lens frame the truth-vs.-astronomy thematic parallel. However, the observatory functions primarily as symbolic container rather than tactical constraint—the decision could occur in any private study with a vault. Present in setup (opening), atmospheric throughout, and provides the vault at closure. Solid thematic integration but moderate causal necessity; any isolated family archive space would serve similar function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist calls" establishes immediate pressure ("twenty minutes ago") and the ticking clock toward "tomorrow's headline" / "morning edition." Margot's all-night deliberation ("as dawn approached") shows elapsed time constraining her window for intervention. The time pressure motivates urgency and shapes her tactic (muddy the waters before publication). However, the actual on-page duration is vague—we don't track hours or feel the compression acutely during her reasoning. Time is present in setup (journalist call), implied during development (night passing), and reaches payoff (dawn/morning edition). Functions adequately to frame stakes but doesn't create moment-to-moment tactical shifts or visible time-cost tradeoffs during the decision process.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" drives Margot's investigation in the first half: she traces the contradiction, examines the photograph, cross-references the ambassador's diary, and solves the Geneva/telegram puzzle. This motivation is embodied through concrete detective work. However, at the midpoint she pivots to actively burying truth, creating tension between stated motivation and final action. The motivation shapes setup and development strongly but is renounced rather than fulfilled at closure—which is thematically rich but means the motivation doesn't drive the ending beat. The friction between truth-seeking and truth-burying adds complexity. Present across all three gates with meaningful internal conflict, but the reversal means it's working against itself at payoff rather than through itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is embodied in specific moments: the "mournful and amused" laugh, the whimsical yet serious orbit metaphors, and the gravity of "goodbye kiss to honesty" paired with the almost game-like Tokyo misdirection. The tone balances high stakes (family empire, truth) with intellectual pleasure in the puzzle and meta-awareness of the absurdity (creating a third impossible story). The tone is consistent through turns and modulates appropriately—more solemn during the revelation, more playful in the crafting of the Tokyo lie. The final image maintains both registers: serious consequence (sealed vault, protected empire) with a hint of performance ("keep dancing between contradictions"). Strong coherence and closure charge; not merely static mood but a tonal strategy that supports the thematic complexity.</comment>
