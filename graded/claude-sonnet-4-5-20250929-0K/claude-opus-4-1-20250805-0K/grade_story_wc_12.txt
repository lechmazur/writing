<comment>Marcus is motivated by a clear philosophical stance (silence as truth-bearer) and his choices create the exorcism's arc. Interior texture is consistent—his perceptual signature favors architectural metaphor and sonic layering—but the woman's transformation lacks embodied cost; we're told she "gasped" and "remembered," not shown a micro-choice under pressure. The demon's nature (feeding on unexamined certainties) remains abstract rather than dramatized through her specific struggle. Final renunciation reads earned in concept but thin in felt consequence.</comment>

<comment>Single POV, one continuous scene in the cathedral; who/where/when anchor by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's assumption-possession dissolves, Marcus completes "transformation of stillness from prison to possibility") with conceptual cost legible on the page: she must now inhabit her own assumptions rather than be inhabited. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (loops build architecture, indigo bleeds meaning, silence decorates). One meaningful deepening: the rhetorical spiral unravels the demon. However, the seventeen-minute timeframe is declared but never tracked; the palette "trembles" and "clatters" without clear causal linkage to Marcus's loop-pedal work, creating a micro-causality gap that doesn't break closure but softens its inevitability.</comment>

<comment>The cathedral's acoustics and dimensional anchor constrain Marcus's method (loop pedal requires resonance, the exact center-point is essential). Sensory hierarchy is consistent: Marcus notices frequencies and stone tensions, the woman's stillness as vacuum. The palette and loop pedal are handled objects that shape action. Spatial choreography is clear (altar, nave's center, footfalls placed for resonance). The dimensional anchor charges the final image ("held them both steady"), fulfilling the 9+ gate, but "dimensional anchor" itself remains under-defined—its mechanics are asserted rather than shown, a minor specificity gap.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: free the woman before possession completes. Marcus's agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens: he layers loops, finds resonant frequencies, builds verbal architecture. One meaningful tightening when he names the demon's hollow core and the possession unravels. Cost is conceptual (the woman must now examine her assumptions) and visible in her gasp and first independent breath. However, the seventeen-minute clock is never felt on the page—no ticking urgency, no mid-scene adjustment when time narrows—so the timeframe stake dissolves into ornament. The demon offers no tactical resistance; it simply dissolves when illuminated, reducing friction.</comment>

<comment>Theme (examining unexamined certainties, silence as architecture) emerges from Marcus's method and the palette's indigo reveal. The final image—silence properly decorated can unravel truth—reprices the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic articulation: "every doubt was actually a doorway," "I am assumption," "silence wasn't the absence of sound but its perfect organization." These declarations, especially in the voice of the possessed woman and Marcus's internal summaries, edge toward sermonizing rather than letting scene pressure generate insight. The transformation is told more than shown; we don't witness the woman's specific assumption being tested, only the generic concept.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited on Marcus, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: architectural metaphor, sonic layering ("rooms within rooms of sacred silence"), rhetorical precision. Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-motivated for a priest-philosopher. The woman's possessed dialogue ("I am assumption... the unexamined life") shifts into abstract thesis-speak that flattens her individual texture, reading more like the story's premise voiced aloud than her interior crisis. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during loop-building, slightly wider for thematic reflection). Minor register drift when Marcus's interior turns fully expository ("Such things required patience, like teaching stone to remember it was once sand")—lovely but slightly over-written for peak pressure.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies, paragraph lengths breathe, sentence openings diversified. Information density is high in the loop-building beats. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops cluster: "The sound wasn't music—it was architecture" is then re-explained across the next paragraph; "stillness" is looped four times in two paragraphs ("motionless," "stillness so complete," "mistake stillness for death," "what is stillness except motion"); "unravel" appears three times in the final third without reweighting. Template cadence in the thematic declarations ("I am assumption," "I am the unexamined life," "I am the automatic yes") flattens voice. Mixed metaphor: "indigo of pre-dawn doubt" as paint color, then doubt as doorway, then silence as decoration—vehicles collide without synthesis. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the mid-passage without clear pattern payoff triggers density penalty (−0.5 in Q7).</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Loop-pedal exorcism is a fresh angle; dimensional anchor and silence-as-architecture offer specific texture. However, the core premise—dialogue/rhetoric defeats a demon of unexamined belief—is a standard philosophical-exorcism template (therapist-priest archetype). The transformation is conceptual rather than embodied, and the woman's specific assumption is never named or tested on the page, leaving the premise abstract. The palette with one color is an elegant image but remains ornamental; its "bleeding at the edges" doesn't constrain Marcus's choice or cost. Risk-taking in voice and structure (accumulative loops, lyric density) is present but clarity suffers under the figurative load, preventing full synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus (loop pedal priest) appears immediately, his choices drive all major beats: activates loop pedal, layers voice, finds resonant frequencies, names the demon's hollow core. His decisions alter tactics (adjusting feedback, decorating with silence) and complete the exorcism. Present in the closure image ("helped the woman to her feet"). His agency is central under the Accumulative lens; removing him breaks the story. Specific cost tied to his method: the patience required, the risk of rushing unraveling. High beat involvement (setup, loop-building, confrontation, closure) and causal pressure justify high-band score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Palette appears in beat two ("suspended in the dimensional anchor... bearing only one color"), returns in beat five ("palette trembled, its single color beginning to bleed"), and again in beat eight ("palette clattered to the floor, its indigo now revealed"). Three touches across distinct beats. Its transformation (indigo bleeds to reveal spectrum, then revealed as "color of questions finally asked") reprises the theme. However, it is not handled by Marcus or the woman—it floats, trembles, clatters on its own—so it lacks agency-driven use. Its mechanics are asserted (doubt is a doorway) rather than earned through causal action. Setup and closure participation qualify it for mid-band; lack of causal pressure and swappability (any symbolic object could carry the same thematic load) cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Unraveled stillness" frames the concept: Marcus teaches stone to remember it was sand, transforms stillness from prison to possibility, the woman's possession "began to unravel—not violently, but like a sweater with one pulled thread." The concept shapes stakes (freeing the woman by unraveling her frozen assumption) and appears in the closure line. However, it operates primarily as theme rather than a tactical constraint on the page. Marcus's actual method is loop-building and rhetoric, not stillness-manipulation per se; "unraveled stillness" labels the effect rather than driving specific choices. Early signal and closure participation earn mid-band; lack of mid-scene causal work (it doesn't narrow Marcus's options or force a tradeoff) caps it at 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Decorates with silence" is named in paragraph one ("He decorated with silence the way other priests adorned with gold leaf") and dramatized through loop-pedal layering: Marcus builds "rooms within rooms of sacred silence," adds loops "sculpting absence into presence," lets "certain phrases decay while reinforcing others." The trait constrains his method (he cannot rush; he must find resonant frequencies) and shapes his final stance ("silence, properly decorated, could unravel any truth"). Setup, middle beats (adjusting feedback, building architecture), and closure participation. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt (no visible tradeoff or forfeiture tied to choosing silence over another tool). Two-gate pass (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise; mid-scene use lifts it into low-7 eligibility, but lack of specific on-page cost caps it at 6.1.</comment>

<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Plumb" appears twice: "each footfall deliberately placed to plumb the cathedral's resonance" (beat three) and "I plumb your depths and find them shallow" (beat six, climax). The action enables Marcus's method (finding frequencies that make stones confess) and delivers the key turn (naming the demon's hollowness). However, the verb is largely metaphorical here—Marcus doesn't physically measure depth with a tool; he speaks and listens. The second use is purely rhetorical, not a distinct physical beat. Two touches, one causal role (it enables resonance-finding), closure linkage weak (not present in final image). Setup and middle development qualify for 5.0+ band; causal role in the climax lifts it, but swappability (could be "sound," "test," "probe") and lack of closure participation cap it at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Through rhetorical devices" is signaled immediately (loop pedal, whispered prayer, "Tell me... what assumes the right"), developed across all middle beats (rhetorical questions as architecture, paradox that hangs "like incense smoke," "each question a step deeper into the demon's hollow core"), and shapes the climax ("I plumb your depths... You are not a demon but a habit"). The method is Marcus's sole tool; removing it collapses the exorcism. However, "rhetorical devices" is broad—any speech-act could fit—and the specific devices (questions, loops, paradox) blur together without distinct tactical costs. The woman's joining his loops is a nice touch but under-dramatized. Setup, middle involvement, closure linkage all present; lack of mechanical specificity (which device when, at what cost) and some swappability cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Dimensional anchor" is named twice: "suspended in the dimensional anchor of the nave's exact center" (beat two) and "The dimensional anchor held them both steady" (closure). It's described as essential ("this specific point in space where all possibilities converged") but never shown to constrain a choice or supply a resource. Marcus doesn't adjust his position relative to it, the woman doesn't try to leave it, and its mechanics remain unexplained. Lyric reprise (early mention, closure image) qualifies for ~5.5–6.3 under the allowance, but the element is asserted rather than dramatized, and its properties are generic (any symbolic center-point would do). Setup and closure participation with no middle beat use; ornamental role and high swappability justify 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>"Before the possession completes" is declared once ("The possession would complete in seventeen minutes, the bishop had warned") and never mentioned again. No mid-scene time checks, no urgency when the clock should narrow options, no cost tied to racing the deadline. Marcus "knew better than to rush," which neutralizes the timeframe as a pressure device. The closure offers no confirmation that he finished in time or paid a price for delay. Setup gate only (mentioned early), no development or payoff. Late declaration (paragraph two, after the opening has set a different rhythm) and complete absence from escalation or closure justify low score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"To illuminate hidden assumptions" motivates Marcus throughout: he asks what assumes the right to occupy flesh, names the demon as "unexamined certainties," and declares "true exorcism... illuminated them until they could no longer bear their own transparency." The motivation shapes his method (rhetorical devices to expose assumptions) and is fulfilled at closure (the woman "remembered how to inhabit her own assumptions"). However, the motivation is stated more than conflicted—Marcus never hesitates, doubts his approach, or faces friction between illumination and a competing want (mercy, speed, safety). Setup, middle method, closure participation all present; lack of on-page friction or visible cost tied to this specific desire (versus a generic "help the woman" want) caps it at 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Muffled clarity" is established early ("her voice joining... came out muffled, as if spoken through layers of cotton—or perhaps through layers of increasing clarity that made sharp edges soft") and threaded through: silence as truth-bearer, paradoxes that hang suspended, the woman's final "unmuffled" voice "possessed of a clarity that came from examining what had always been there." Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (mystery in the opening, tension during loop-building, release at closure), and charges the final image (clarity emerges from decorated silence). However, "muffled clarity" as a label is more asserted than felt line-by-line; the prose is consistently elevated and metaphor-dense without the muffle/sharpen oscillation the phrase promises. Setup, middle modulation, and closure linkage all present; pervasive figurative load and lack of distinct tonal shift under peak pressure (the climax reads the same register as the opening) slightly undercut execution.</comment>
