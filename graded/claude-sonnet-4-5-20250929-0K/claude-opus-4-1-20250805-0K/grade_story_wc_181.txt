<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curator's bewilderment is embodied through concrete actions (floating, clutching, biting the apple) and her retreat to the bathroom shows character-specific coping. However, interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("inheritance wasn't linear because knowledge itself wasn't linear") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to accept the temporal loop feels declared more than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("temporal vertigo," "vulnerability met necessity") that abstracts rather than grounds emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the museum collects from all times simultaneously, and the curator will loop through this experience. The cost is conceptual—she loses linear agency and becomes part of the artifact cycle—made legible in the final image of biting the paradox-apple. Accumulative lens holds through layered temporal reveals (shell → orchard → bathroom → other-self → understanding). Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (curator, astral orchard, asteroid). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes inheritance creates itself. Slight deduction: the middle bathroom retreat slightly softens pressure before the final revelation rather than tightening options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard constrains the curator's reality and charges the final image: trees at all ages simultaneously, blossoms falling upward, Earth in multiple states. The pistachio shell functions as micro-setting—its microscopic coordinates compel the journey, and she carves into it with a tool "she didn't yet possess," creating a tangible paradox. Magnetized boots and porcelain-from-bark bathroom ground the impossible in sensory specifics. The orchard's impossibility (fruit trees in vacuum) is filtered through her bewildered perception and directly enables the temporal logic that closes the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the undocumented shell—is signaled early and drives the journey to the orchard. One meaningful deepening: the bathroom retreat allows cognitive processing that leads to the inheritance insight, narrowing her understanding and compelling acceptance of the loop. However, escalation is primarily epistemic (she learns) rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution is acceptance/endurance, but the price (looping forever, memory instability) is conceptual and told ("would forget this journey, remember it") rather than dramatized through a present foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance across non-linear time—emerges through concrete particulars: the shell with her own handwriting, trees at all ages, the apple tasting like "memory, prophecy, temporal paradox." The bathroom functions thematically as liminal space where "vulnerability met necessity" allows understanding. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "some knowledge can only be inherited from oneself" and "inheritance, like time itself, was simply complicated—a circle with no beginning" articulate theme rather than letting the image resonate without explanation. The piece invites reflection but over-explains its own meaning in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "bewildered still but purposeful," sensory details filtered through curator expertise (acquisition ledger, ultraviolet light). Diction is generally controlled and voice-consistent. However, elevated register occasionally exceeds character lexicon during peak pressure: "temporal vertigo," "liminal space," "quantum branches" read more authorial than curator-particular. The other-self's dialogue ("Time inherits itself here, backwards and forwards, like light bouncing between mirrors") is slightly too on-theme, explaining rather than implying. Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative density in opening and closing (blossoms as moments, apple as paradox, juice like liquid starlight) creates texture but borders on overwriting—nearly every sentence in the final two paragraphs carries metaphor without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the museum paragraph: "She would return... She would forget... She would appear" (three parallel constructions). Paraphrase loop: "bewildered" appears three times, "inheritance follows no timeline" twice verbatim. Minor clarity issue: "simply complicated" as a repeated phrase feels more like prompt-fulfillment than organic voice. Information density is high, but the accumulation of figurative language in peak beats slightly dulls momentum. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—museum as non-linear collection, curator inheriting from herself via temporal loop, knowledge preceding its discovery—is conceptually fresh and commits fully to its premise. The pistachio shell as both artifact and message-carrier, and the bathroom as philosophical breakthrough space, are specific rather than generic. However, the core time-loop structure and "character meets older/younger self" beat are familiar tropes executed competently but not transformed through wholly unexpected tactics. The piece takes conceptual risks (impossible orchard, simultaneous timelines) but the emotional arc—bewilderment to acceptance—follows a predictable path. Specificity in world-building (magnetized boots, UV-revealed script) elevates, but the resolution feels predetermined by the premise rather than surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bewildered curator appears throughout and her journey to the orchard, bathroom retreat, and final acceptance are all on-page choices. However, her decisions are primarily reactive (follows coordinates, retreats when overwhelmed, accepts the loop) rather than creating key turns. The bathroom retreat enables her cognitive processing, which is one functional beat, but the insight arrives as epiphany rather than through her active inquiry. She observes and receives knowledge more than she pursues it through contested choices. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with a more active investigator archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank is handled in three distinct beats: arrival without documentation, revealing UV coordinates that send her to the orchard, and the final vision of herself carving the message into it. It carries reweighted meaning—blank because every inheritor carves their own design across time—and the shell's warmth signals her understanding. It is causally active (coordinates compel the journey) and charges the closure (she sees herself writing the message she already found). Removing it would break the inheritance loop logic. Strong integration with visible reprise and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance shapes the premise and stakes: the shell arrives before being sent, wisdom precedes discovery, the curator will experience this "for the first time again." The concept is signaled early ("Inheritance follows no timeline") and drives the orchard's structure (trees at all ages, her multiple selves). It directly alters her understanding and acceptance at closure. However, the concept functions more as setting logic than as a constraint that forces tactical choices—she does not navigate competing timelines or make a decision between linear and nonlinear paths. The concept is thematic and atmospheric rather than creating on-page friction with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice as a phrase: once as meta-commentary ("Time inherits itself here... simply complicated, like a child's drawing that reveals profound mathematics") and once in the closing line ("inheritance, like time itself, was simply complicated"). It functions as thematic label rather than constraining action. No on-page moment shows the curator enabled or limited by simplicity-within-complexity as a tactical attribute. The phrase describes the premise but does not create visible tradeoffs or shape her choices under pressure. Ornamental use; swappable with other paradox descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" is the stated action ("I need to inquire about the shell") and frames her purpose in the orchard encounter. However, the inquiry is answered passively—her other self volunteers information without resistance, and the bathroom epiphany arrives through reflection rather than active questioning. The action is present in setup and middle but does not drive the major turn; her understanding comes from internal processing, not from the inquiry itself. Functional but replaceable with "investigate" or "seek" without structural loss. One causal beat (prompts the encounter) but does not shape closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bathroom breakthrough is signaled in the first third ("Third tree from the binary stars. The door appears when needed") and occupies a full middle beat where the curator sits, breathes, and processes the shell's meaning. The bathroom as liminal space enables her key insight about non-linear inheritance. The method returns implicitly at closure (she now understands why such spaces exist). However, the mechanics are thin—she simply sits and thinks—without cost or constraint tied to the bathroom itself. The space facilitates reflection but does not impose friction or shape her tactics beyond providing quiet. Two-gate presence (setup, middle) but weak closure linkage. Early signal and one causal beat place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The astral orchard is introduced in the opening line, supplies the coordinates that compel the journey, and houses the encounter with her other self. Its impossible physics (trees in vacuum, petals falling upward, roots in stone) embody the non-linear time logic and directly charge the final image: "time grew like fruit on quantum branches," trees at all ages simultaneously, Earth in multiple states. The orchard's structure constrains her understanding—she must process its impossibility to grasp inheritance. Removing it would collapse the story's spatial and conceptual anchor. Present across all three gates with strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is written in the ledger and frames the premise as a temporal paradox. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the curator's journey unfolds without a clock. The phrase functions as thematic echo (repeated at closure when she sees herself writing it) but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. No live countdown or temporal limit shapes her choices. Present in setup and closure as motif but replaceable with another paradox marker. Lyric reprise without causal pressure places it in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared in the final paragraph ("the terrible joy of understanding that some knowledge can only be inherited from oneself") and implied throughout (she follows the coordinates despite bewilderment, bites the apple "sweet with the forbidden knowledge"). However, the pursuit is reactive—coordinates appear, she follows—rather than driven by conflicted desire with on-page cost. No moment shows her weighing the danger of forbidden knowledge against safety or institutional rules. The "forbidden" label is told rather than dramatized through friction. Present and thematically coherent but lacks visible choice-under-pressure that tests the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet is consistent throughout: bewilderment mixed with purposefulness, "terrible joy," wonder at impossibility. The tone charges the final image—"bewildered still but purposeful," juice "sweet with forbidden knowledge," blossoms falling upward as lived moments. Diction maintains this pairing: "impossible lavatory," "disturbed as much as it illuminated," "phantom apple blossoms." The tone modulates appropriately (sobers in the bathroom, lifts at closure) without breaking coherence. It is established early, sustained through pressure, and intensifies the ending's resonance. Strong integration across all gates with purposeful modulation.</comment>
