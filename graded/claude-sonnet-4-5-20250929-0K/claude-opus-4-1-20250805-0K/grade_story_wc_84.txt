<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is present but relies on stock phrasing ("breath caught," "perpetual surprise at the world transformed into perpetual wonder"). The pilgrim remains cipher-like with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The final epiphany ("she finally understood that belonging wasn't about finding your place") reads as an unearned platitude delivered via summary rather than dramatized cost. The relationship applies no pressure; the pilgrim guides, Kira accepts, with no friction or stakes-testing choice between them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens reads as accumulative/textural: the piece gathers matrices to complete a pattern, with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors early (observatory, Kira, drone, twilight). However, the closure cost is asserted rather than felt—"filling the missing pieces she hadn't known were empty" tells transformation without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what prior stance was sacrificed. The pilgrim's arrival and the matrix recovery follow because/therefore linkage adequately, but the final image lacks undeniable pressure or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and specific ("stone eye watching heaven," "copper light bleeding across worn limestone"). The thermal imaging mechanic—infrared revealing hidden matrices—constrains the recovery method and shapes middle action. The "brilliant dimness" twilight charges the final image, making the thermal trails visible. Spatial choreography (floor tiles, wall chambers, dome projection) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the floor message—is signaled early and drives matrix recovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pilgrim reveals only one chip but twelve gaps exist, forcing the search. However, the search itself is frictionless: every matrix is found without failed attempts, misreadings, or tactical costs. The "frequency of belonging" resolution is declared rather than tested against a competing need or fear, so the final choice feels costless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic belonging emerges from the matrix-star trail integration. However, the final paragraph states the theme outright: "belonging wasn't about finding your place but recognizing you were already part of everything" and "no longer pilgrims but natives of the universe itself." This direct articulation replaces scene pressure and triggers the thematic-echo penalty. The astronomers' "frequency" concept remains abstract and ungrounded in specific human cost or choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable third-person limited through Kira. Perceptual signature is present in drone-operator specificity (thermal imaging, infrared sensors). Dialogue carries goals and some subtext ("You see it now"). However, the pilgrim's voice lacks distinct idiom—she speaks in the same slightly elevated register as the narration. Under peak pressure (placing the final matrix), diction remains controlled without compression or intensification that would reflect urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates purposefully. Some strong images ("twilight...widening," "copper light bleeding") create texture. However, repeated template stems appear: "The pilgrim [verb]," "Kira [verb]," and paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("heat signatures in the walls—not random patterns but constellation maps, each one corresponding to a missing matrix" restates information from prior beats). Filter-verb stacks ("had been mapping," "had dismissed," "had been detecting") dull immediacy in exposition. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops under the patterned-artifact pack; no additional deduction elsewhere per routing rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The matrix-as-missing-puzzle-piece premise echoes familiar writing templates (artifact hunt, mystical guide, epiphany at completion). The thermal-imaging twist adds some specificity, but the emotional arc—lone professional meets mystic, recovers objects, gains spiritual insight—follows a well-worn path without transformation through character-specific cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The "frequency of belonging" resolution offers abstraction rather than a fresh synthesis rooted in lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's drone work appears in three beats: initial mapping, anomaly detection (floor pattern visible from above), and thermal imaging that reveals hidden matrices. The infrared sensor capability enables the matrix recovery and middle-turn discovery. However, her sharp-eyed observation does not create a costly decision—she follows the thermal trails without misreading, hesitation, or trade-off. Present in closure (recording the moment) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The matrix chip appears in four beats: pilgrim's introduction, socket discovery, eleven more recoveries, and final placement that triggers the tonal frequency. Its constellation pattern matching floor gaps is causally necessary and irreplaceable. Each placement contributes to the floor message and the final "chord." The chip's unique etched surface matters mechanically. However, the chip does not impose a cost or constrain a choice—it simply fits and works.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Missing pieces shape the central puzzle: twelve gaps in the floor require recovery of scattered matrices. The concept drives the middle action (search and placement). The "missing pieces she hadn't known were empty" callback in the closure reweights the concept thematically. However, the concept operates more as structural mechanic than stake-altering pressure—nothing forces Kira to choose between competing completions or accept incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" is mentioned twice: opening ("Everything about the ruins surprised her lately") and closure ("Her perpetual surprise...transformed into perpetual wonder"). Both are label-only summary without embodied cost or on-page choice constrained by the trait. The attribute does not enable or prevent any action; it exists as thematic claim rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pull" drives three beats: Kira pulls the first tile to reveal the socket, "they pulled stone after stone" to recover matrices, and implicit pulling of matrices into place. The action is mechanically necessary and causally central to the resolution. The verb's physicality (tiles lifting "with a grinding whisper," edges "worn smooth by forgotten hands") is specific. However, the action could be replaced by "insert," "turn," or "press" without major structural loss; it is apt but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Following star trails is signaled early (pilgrim's "star trails" comment), drives the middle search (thermal imaging reveals "star trails frozen in stone"), and enables matrix recovery across multiple beats. The method is mechanically demonstrated: switching to thermal imaging, reading constellation maps in walls, using trails to locate chambers. The method shapes attempts and appears in closure ("projecting star trails across the ancient dome"). Specific and causal but not tested by failure or alternate paths.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains and enables throughout: floor pattern visible only from above necessitates the drone, twilight timing makes thermal trails legible, stone tiles and wall chambers structure the search, and the dome's projection surface charges the final image. The cracked dome and "brilliant dimness" threshold light are mechanically necessary. The setting supplies the puzzle architecture and the means of solving it, with micro-setting (tiles, sockets, walls) altering tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim's morning arrival frames the window and her chip introduction incites the search. Twilight-to-darkness progression structures the sequence and makes thermal imaging necessary ("fading light transformed the observatory," "full darkness claimed the observatory"). However, the timeframe does not tighten pressure—Kira could complete the search over days; no stated or implied deadline forces faster choices or accepts incompleteness. Time is tracked but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Decoding the frequency is stated as goal ("key to understanding where we truly belong") and achieved at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized: Kira's desire to belong is asserted in the opening ("everything surprised her lately, as if the world kept revealing hidden layers") and closure but never tested by a competing want, fear, or cost. No scene shows what she sacrifices or risks to pursue this frequency. The motivation drives plot but lacks embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears in four moments: opening twilight, threshold description ("neither day nor night but something between"), full darkness arrival, and implicit in "glowed with their own light." The tone is coherent and modulates from observational to mystical. It charges the final image (matrices glowing in darkness) and reflects the liminality theme. However, the tone remains static rather than intensifying under pressure; the writing voice does not compress or sharpen at peak beats.</comment>
