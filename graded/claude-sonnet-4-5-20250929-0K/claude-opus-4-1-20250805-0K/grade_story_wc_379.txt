<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marta's motivation is coherent ("listening heals") but her interior remains abstract—she "understands" and "learns" in summary rather than showing contradictory impulses under pressure. Elena's breakdown and recovery are dramatized with embodied detail ("pounded…until her knuckles bled"), though her shift from muteness to fluent storytelling feels compressed. Jorge and Mrs. Chen function as expository support rather than characters with independent goals, and the courtyard collective arrives as a sudden chorus without prior friction. The final choice (Elena claiming the courtyard as home) carries relational cost but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path that tests prior values.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through discovery (locket → Jorge's story → letters → courtyard mobilization) and the closure reconfigures Elena's isolation into communal belonging. The cost is legible—Elena accepts dependence on neighbors rather than reunion with Sofia—but the turn from muteness to speech and the courtyard's instant coordination feel under-motivated, creating a micro-causality slip that does not break the ending but softens its inevitability. One meaningful deepening (locked mailbox becomes communal home) is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (amber walls, basil, hopscotch) and recurs as a spatial frame that charges the closure ("this home"). The locket and mailbox function as micro-setting objects that constrain plot moves and enable the ending image. Dawn and the shelter exterior provide texture but do not alter tactics. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is satisfied by the locket and courtyard, though some description (sparrows, breadcrumbs) is decorative rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting Elena with her daughter's letters—is signaled early and tightens through escalation (locket → backstory → shelter visit → postal search). One meaningful reversal occurs when the letters are found, forcing Elena to choose between isolation and community; the cost (accepting the courtyard over waiting alone) is felt but not deeply conflicted on the page. Jorge's nephew and the neighbors' mobilization arrive as solutions rather than hard-won agency, softening protagonist-driven escalation. The price is relational but lacks a visible trade-off that forecloses an equally viable path.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The theme—listening as healing—emerges from concrete events (Marta's silence, the courtyard's gathering, Elena's recovery) but the final paragraph states it overtly: "listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed." The locket and mailbox accumulate meaning through repetition, charging the closure image when Elena claims "this home," yet the last lines explain rather than trust resonance. The piece invites reflection on displacement and community but resolves into a tidy collective uplift without ambiguity or counter-pressure. Diagnostic phrasing ("sandstorm calm," "invisible network") in the closing reflection abstracts rather than dramatizes the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV anchors cleanly in Marta's perceptual signature ("thrift-store curator," "objects carried their owners' endings") with consistent psychic distance. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven, though Jorge's "sandstorm calm" voice and Mrs. Chen's interjections feel interchangeable in diction. The prose remains stable under pressure, though the final reflection slips into meta-commentary ("every object…was a doorway") that explains theme rather than trusting scene. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; narrative certainty matches Marta's plausible knowledge except for one phrase ("the neighborhood's living story") that abstracts rather than grounds.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in mid-beats. Minor loops appear: "She understood now why…" immediately followed by expository clarification; "Her curator's instinct already knew" paraphrases the same knowledge. The final paragraph recycles "sandstorm calm" and "locked mailbox" as thematic bookends without added pressure, and "invisible network" plus "doorway" metaphors feel stock. No grammar errors, but two scaffold phrases ("As stars emerged," "In the morning, she would return") slow momentum without adding causal detail. The closure image ("this home") is clean, but the surrounding reflection dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—thrift-store curator solves a locked-mailbox mystery through community listening—synthesizes familiar elements (found object, displaced immigrant, collective mobilization) with specific grounding in the locket and Elena's letters. The courtyard-as-home resolution transforms displacement into belonging, yet the conflict structure (problem introduced → community rallies → letters found → healing declared) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious turn. Jorge's nephew and the postal search arrive as convenient solutions rather than earned friction. The "listening heals" thesis is particular to Marta's curatorial lens but becomes overt in the ending reflection, reducing ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marta (thrift-store curator) is present from the opening, handles the locket across multiple beats, and her decision to follow the object to the shelter drives the shelter visit and postal search. Her "curator's instinct" shapes observation ("objects carried their owners' endings") and her silence invites Jorge's story, enabling the first turn. At closure, she reflects on listening as medicine, charging the thematic image. The character is essential to two beats (locket discovery, shelter visit) and the ending, though the courtyard mobilization proceeds without her active choices in the second half. Swapping her for a social worker would require minor edits but weaken the object-as-doorway motif.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The locket appears in the opening beat (discovery), prompts Jorge's backstory, opens to reveal Sofia's photo (motivating the shelter visit), and returns in the closing image when Elena "hung the locket around her neck." It is handled on the page across four beats and its meaning shifts from artifact to shrine to symbol of reconnection. The locket's chain "tangled in rust" and its lodging "behind a locked mailbox" tie it causally to Elena's eviction. Removing the locket would break the initial discovery and weaken the closure image, though the letters could still drive the plot. High integration with visible cost (Elena's physical and emotional attachment), but the locket does not constrain a tactical choice in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The locked mailbox is introduced in the opening paragraph, anchors Elena's backstory (she "pounded on that metal box until her knuckles bled"), and recurs in the closing reflection ("The locked mailbox had protected Elena's pain"). It shapes stakes by physically separating Elena from her daughter's letters and motivates the postal search. The mailbox's inaccessibility forces the community search rather than a simple key request, and its symbolic weight charges the ending ("listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed"). The concept is present across three beats (discovery, backstory, thematic closure) and drives the central mystery, though the postal solution bypasses the physical lock without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Leads through following" is signaled in the opening ("Marta…waited") and closing reflection ("to follow what needed following"), and Marta's passive listening enables Jorge's and Elena's stories. The trait shapes one key choice—her decision to extend the locket rather than speak first at the shelter—and the narrative repeatedly frames her as reactive ("followed where it led"). However, the trait is more thematic label than visible constraint: Marta's "following" does not cost her an alternate path or force a trade-off on the page. The courtyard mobilization in the second half proceeds without her lead, diluting the trait's causal role. Present across setup, middle passivity, and thematic payoff, but lacks a felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Hear" / "listening" structures the entire arc: Marta's silence invites storytelling, the courtyard "hears" Elena, and the climax ("We hear you") unlocks Elena's speech. The action recurs across four beats (Jorge's story, shelter visit, Elena's recovery, thematic closure) and directly enables the major turn (Elena speaking after muteness). Swapping "hear" for "witness" or "understand" would preserve most beats with minor edits, though the thematic payoff ("listening could unlock") would lose specificity. The action is essential to closure and integration is strong, but it operates more as motif than irreplaceable mechanics—Elena's recovery hinges equally on the found letters.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Neighborhood storytelling" is seeded early ("stories traveled like morning birds between balconies"), enacted when Jorge and Mrs. Chen share Elena's history, and culminates in the courtyard gathering where "Each person brought…stories of their own locked mailboxes." The method enables two beats (backstory transmission, collective mobilization) and charges the thematic closure. However, the mechanics are passive relay rather than constrained tactics—Jorge simply tells Marta, and the courtyard arrives as instant consensus without friction. The method's presence shapes atmosphere and ending resonance but does not force a costly choice or alternative path. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but replaceable with "community support" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored in the opening (amber walls, basil, hopscotch, worn bench) and recurs as the gathering site and closure location ("this home"). It supplies social resources (Jorge, Mrs. Chen, neighbors) that enable the postal search and provides the spatial frame for Elena's reintegration. The setting constrains choice by offering collective support Elena cannot access alone, and the final image ("she gestured to the courtyard") charges meaning. The setting is essential to closure and present across three beats, though dawn's specific timeframe does not tighten tactics. Swapping the courtyard for a community center would weaken symbolic resonance but preserve function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is enacted once—Elena's eviction ("the morning the outside world intruded with eviction papers")—and retrospectively charges the locked mailbox's meaning. The timeframe does not tighten present decisions; the story unfolds across a single morning and afternoon without a live clock or escalating deadline. The intrusion is backstory context rather than an on-page pressure that alters tactics. Present in setup (eviction backstory) and thematic closure ("the outside world had broken"), but absent from middle escalation. The element is more conceptual frame than functional constraint, and removing it would require minor thematic edits but leave plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Marta's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is stated in the closing reflection ("listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed") and implied through her silence and decision to follow the locket. The desire is present across three beats (initial waiting, shelter visit, thematic closure) and shapes her passive approach, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Marta never faces a choice where listening competes with another urgent need, and her belief is confirmed rather than tested. The motivation is functional and thematically coherent but lacks on-page friction or a visible trade-off. Present in setup (waiting on the bench) and payoff (reflection), weak in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Sandstorm calm" is introduced in Jorge's description ("sandstorm calm of someone who'd weathered loss") and echoed in Marta's closing reflection ("The sandstorm calm she'd cultivated"). The tone operates as pervasive quietude—Marta's silence, the courtyard's gentle gathering, Elena's slow recovery—and modulates subtly when Elena's tears fall "like rain after drought." The tone charges the final image by framing listening as patient endurance rather than urgent intervention. However, the phrase is more label than embodied texture; the narrative maintains steady pacing without tonal contrast or pressure-driven shift. Present across setup, middle atmosphere, and thematic closure, but the tone remains static rather than dynamically responsive to escalation.</comment>
