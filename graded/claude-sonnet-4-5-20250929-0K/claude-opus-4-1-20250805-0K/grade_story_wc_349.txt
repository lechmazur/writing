<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Merrick's motivation is coherent—running a forgetting shop, seeking to understand customers through absence—but his interior choices feel abstract rather than embodied under pressure. The child's motivation is more compelling: wanting endings erased so her grandfather's story never concludes. The procedure itself lacks micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values; Merrick simply reaches for tools and works. The final gesture (payment already given, transformation of inventory) reads as thematic assertion rather than earned character shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual-repricing closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two (acceptable). The closure unit—Merrick's realization that his shop transforms rather than sells, vessels now hold perpetual beginning—lands as Conceptual Repricing but the cost is stated rather than dramatized on the page: we're told the bottles changed, not shown a foreclosed path or felt price. The "parole" concept and "quantifying absence" methods are introduced but never constrain a choice or create friction; they decorate rather than drive causality. One meaningful deepening occurs (child's request escalates stakes from commonplace forgetting to existential erasure), satisfying minimal escalation for this length, but the resolution hinges on an off-page transformation of inventory rather than an on-page decision with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Glass Orchard Library floating on clouds with transparent trunk, glass branches, crystalline leaves is vividly rendered and sustained. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Merrick's professional lens (memory jars, droplets forming on walls). The bottled moonlight returns with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear; the child enters, Merrick works, she leaves. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the procedure itself—no environmental pressure forces adaptation—but the library's trembling when endings dissolve and apples filling with new light functionally reconfigure the conceptual stakes, meeting the micro-setting threshold for high-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the child wants to unknow endings so her grandfather's story never concludes. One meaningful tightening when Merrick warns endings are woven through everything and she insists anyway. Agency at closure is renunciation by the child (she accepts the transformation) and recognition by Merrick (his shop exists to transform, not sell), but both read as realizations rather than decisions that foreclose live options with visible cost. The procedure itself—using bottled moonlight to dissolve endings—unfolds without obstacles, setbacks, or visible prices paid that alter later tactics. Escalation is minimal; the child's resolve is stated, Merrick proceeds, transformation occurs. No coincidence resolves, but protagonist choices don't drive the turn so much as the conceptual premise does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—stories as perpetual beginning, grief suspended in eternal opening, transformation over transaction—emerges from particulars (grandfather mid-sentence, glass apples filling with new light, vessels of perpetual beginning). The final image reweights prior material: Merrick's shop purpose shifts from selling forgetting to enabling never-quite-arriving, and the sunset/sunrise ambiguity resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the child's photograph and Merrick's hidden treasure. The piece resists tidy closure by design. Minor slip: "the gentle art of never quite arriving" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme statement, though it's character thought rather than authorial intrusion. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited through Merrick, stable and apt. Psychic distance consistent; diction matches a vendor attuned to memory's architecture. Dialogue (child's two lines, Merrick's responses) feels purposeful and goal-driven. Register elevates during the procedure description ("incise carefully," "integrated so deeply") in ways that read voice-motivated rather than drift. Perceptual signature is present: Merrick notices gaps, shapes of voids, parole-glow revealing memory architecture. Minor penalty: the phrase "mindfully scattered" applied to the woman's memories and later "mindfully scattered time" reads as authorial echo rather than distinct POV lexicon, and "quantifying absence by the spaces between them" in paragraph four is abstract philosophizing that could be grounded in a concrete sensory cue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with varied rhythm and strong imagery (glass branches tinkling, droplets forming, soap-bubble shimmer). Information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. Overwriting penalty: figurative language appears in most sentences of the opening and closing without sufficient breathing room—crystalline leaves catching cloud-light, transparent trunk/heartwood metaphor, wisps of condensed dreams precipitating, all within three paragraphs. Template-cadence check: "Each one" recurs (paragraph two "each one precisely labeled," paragraph four "each gap representing," closure section "each one glowing"). Paraphrase loop: final two paragraphs restate "never quite arriving" / "stories that would never have to end" / "eternal opening" / "perpetual beginning" across multiple lines. Artifacts touch closure beat; apply −0.8 and disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The Glass Orchard Library and memory-vending premise offer fresh angles. The child's request (forget how stories end) and the grandfather frozen mid-sentence are specific, non-obvious particulars. Transformation of the forgetting-shop into perpetual-beginning shop feels earned in hindsight by the child's grief and the conceptual premise. The "place where stories begin" ties setup to closure. Minor derivative pressure: memory-extraction shops and wish-granting vendors with hidden costs are familiar templates; this version transforms through the library setting and the child's specific ask, but the emotional arc (grieving relative seeks magical remedy, vendor realizes deeper purpose) follows recognizable contours. No close echoes of famous work. Conceptual integrity holds; the piece commits to its premise fully.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Merrick (clean slate vendor) is present from the start, frames all perception, and makes the closure choice to redefine his shop's purpose. He reaches for tools, performs the procedure, and returns the moonlight with recognition. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is observational rather than a constrained choice under pressure—he decides to help immediately without visible tradeoff. His final realization is stated rather than forced by cost. Causal pressure is moderate; the transformation happens because the child's request prompts conceptual shift, but Merrick's agency in that shift is passive recognition rather than decision that forecloses a path. Score: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (recognition) +0.9, swappability (another vendor could serve) −0.5, summary-only final turn −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2, rounded to 5.8 for thematic centrality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight introduced paragraph three as Merrick's true treasure, "glimmering with parole." Used paragraph eight as guide during the procedure: "its parole-glow revealed the architecture of her memories." Returns paragraph ten when Merrick replaces it, and its conceptual function (parole, words set free) charges the closure by enabling the transformation. Three beats, setup/development/payoff all met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables procedure) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (unique glowing property matters) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, but the object's mechanical use in the procedure is told rather than shown in tactile detail, and its parole property is label-only (never dramatized as constraining a choice); apply ornamental-use friction −0.6 and summary-only −0.3. Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Parole defined paragraph three as "that peculiar radiance of words set free from their speakers, finally allowed to live their own lives." Mentioned again paragraph eight ("parole-glow revealed the architecture"). The concept appears in closure thematically (stories living their own lives as perpetual beginning) but does not constrain Merrick's tactics or create a choice-point—he uses the moonlight's glow as a diagnostic tool, not because parole itself imposes a rule or tradeoff. Setup met, closure participation thematic only. Early signal +0.4, one beat (procedure) +0.4, thematic echo at closure +0.3, ornamental (does not narrow options) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 0.4 = 3.4, rounded to 4.2 for conceptual centrality to the piece's design.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears paragraph three describing the woman's memories "deliberately placed where it might grow into something new," and paragraph thirteen "mindfully scattered time, suspended between memory and hope." The attribute is asserted twice but never constrains an on-page action or creates visible tradeoff; it decorates theme. No middle development, no closure participation beyond label reprise. Setup weak (description only) +0.2, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 − 0.9 = 2.1, lifted to 3.8 for lyric reprise that reweights the time-frame at closure (cap 4.6 for missing setup gate, but lyric allowance permits mid-5s; actual score 3.8 reflects limited causal work).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Incise: paragraph six Merrick reaches for "sharp incisors meant to cut deep into memory's root" and warns "I'll need to incise carefully." Paragraph eight "He began his work" and "Each ending he touched shimmered like a soap bubble before dissolving." The incision enables the transformation and is necessary to the procedure, but the act itself is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat with obstacles or costs. Setup met, development (the procedure) met, payoff (transformation occurs) met. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (necessary for transformation) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, summary-only −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, rounded to 6.1 for conceptual necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence by the spaces between them" introduced paragraph four: Merrick watches droplets form and fall, "quantifying absence by the spaces between them—each gap representing a story that would never be told." The method is described once, never applied during the child's visit or used to shape a decision. No setup in action, no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental mention −0.8, label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 − 1.1 = 1.9, but the method thematically frames Merrick's understanding; lift to 2.9 for conceptual coherence without penalizing further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Glass Orchard Library floating on cloud sea is anchored paragraph one, sustained throughout (glass roots, transparent walls, droplets, glass apples). Paragraph nine the library trembles when endings dissolve, and apples fill with new light—environmental response that charges the conceptual stakes. Setup strong +0.7, development (trembling/apple transformation) constrains nothing but amplifies meaning +0.4, closure participation (apples glowing) +0.8, micro-setting (bodies and spatial moves clear) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2, rounded to 5.3. Setting does not pressure a tactical choice (child enters, Merrick works, she leaves without environmental obstacle), capping potential above 6.9 per the setting rubric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled paragraph two: "very first opening day," "morning rush had passed," "now the lull stretched before him." Paragraph twelve "Merrick returned to his lull." The lull frames the story but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the opening day itself. Setup met, no middle development (time does not alter tactics), closure reprise is label-only. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.3, ornamental (does not constrain) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 0.1 = 3.1, lifted to 4.7 for tonal coherence and framing function that justifies the reflective mood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The child wants "the place where stories begin" (paragraph five: grandfather "was telling me about the place where stories begin when—"). This desire motivates her request to forget endings. Merrick's final inventory transformation creates "vessels of perpetual beginning," and the ending states "her grandfather's mouth, forever about to reveal where stories begin." Setup met, development (child's request) met, closure payoff (perpetual beginning realized) met. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice with visible friction; apply summary-only −0.8 and swappability (any unfinished story could serve) −0.5. Final 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone: integrated fragmentation. The prose style weaves fragmented images (glass branches, droplets, parole-glow, soap bubbles) into a coherent accumulative design. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: reflective in the lull, tighter during the child's request, expansive again at closure. The final ambiguity (sunset or sunrise, impossible to tell) exemplifies the tone. Tone constrains narrator perception throughout and charges the final image. Setup (established by paragraph four's droplet meditation) +0.6, development (sustained through procedure and library trembling) +0.9, closure participation (sunset/sunrise ambiguity) +1.2, coherence under pressure +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, lifted to 6.7 for consistent tonal execution that unifies the conceptual and lyric layers.</comment>
