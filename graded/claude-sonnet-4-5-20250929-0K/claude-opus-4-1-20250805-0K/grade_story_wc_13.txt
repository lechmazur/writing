<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority remains thin throughout—she observes and acts without substantial internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final choice to complete the drawings feels efficient rather than wrenching; no visible cost or foreclosed path materializes on the page beyond the cracked pendant. Minor: the time-sculptors' panic is told rather than shown through individuated reactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Closure is a Decisive Change—Marina uncages the extinct creatures and breaks the city's borrowed-time system—with felt cost (cracked pendant, sculptors' panic, Morteus waking). The chamber discovery and drawing-completion sequence form a clean because/therefore chain. The ending reweights prior material (illustrations shift from frozen to complete), though the cost to Marina personally remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop canals, upward water flow, and Morteus's body-as-architecture create a vivid, constraint-driven environment. The canal spiral around the giant's throat and the gap in his breathing function as physical gates that enable Marina's entry. The pendant and illustrations are handled tactilely (humming, fluttering, cracking) and constrain choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical and interior transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find and free the trapped echoes) is signaled early and tightens when Marina discovers the stolen-time chamber. The agency is hers: diving through the gap and completing the illustrations are decisions that foreclose the city's time-sculpture system. One meaningful reversal—realization that time comes not from dreams but from stolen extinctions—narrows options and raises cost. The time-sculptors' loss and Morteus's premature waking are visible prices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (honoring endings rather than preserving them in borrowed time) emerges from concrete particulars—the chamber, the incomplete drawings, the city's cadence. The final image (clear canals, uninterrupted flow, living subjects) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the grandmother's bequest and Marina's inherited role feel slightly convenient, and the epiphany ("some things weren't meant to be preserved") verges on stating theme rather than letting it resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Marina with consistent perceptual filters (illustrator's eye, temporal sensitivity). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("impossible insects," "sculptable, like clay"). No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax in the dive sequence). Psychic distance tightens during the chamber discovery. Minor: a few filter verbs ("She knew," "Marina understood") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high with multi-job lines ("water flowing impossibly upward between the towers, defying gravity through ancient engineering"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful ("time's natural rhythm skipped," "time itself resumed its natural, uninterrupted flow"). Minor: "interrupted cadence" appears three times, and "borrowed time" recurs slightly more than pressure requires, edging toward motif over-signal without crossing into artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The temporal-naturalist occupation, upward-flowing canals, and giant-as-city-infrastructure combine into a fresh synthesis. The discovery that extinction moments—not dreams—fuel the city's time reweights the premise in a non-obvious way. The grandmother's pendant and illustrations feel somewhat template (inherited magical object), but the specific mechanic (completing drawings to release creatures) transforms the trope. Risk-taking in world-building and the quiet, image-driven ending elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marina's illustrator identity is present throughout and shapes her choices: she carries her satchel, perceives interruptions visually, and the act of completing drawings drives the climax. The profession constrains her method (she must draw to uncage) and enables the resolution. Appears early, involved in two beats (studio flutter, chamber completion), and essential to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The infinity pendant hums at the opening (signals interruption), points toward Morteus (guides navigation), protects Marina from temporal shear (enables the dive), and cracks at the end (cost marker). Present in setup, middle constraint, and closure. The crack reweights its symbol from infinite preservation to finite cost. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is the story's hinge: the world's rhythm skips, leaving creatures trapped between heartbeats; Marina perceives these interruptions; the gap in Morteus's breathing enables entry; resolution restores "uninterrupted flow." The concept shapes stakes (free the trapped), tactics (find the gap), and the ending image (cadence "rang true"). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Time-sculpting is attributed to the city's engineers and the time-sculptors but not to Marina herself. She perceives interruptions and uses the pendant, but does not sculpt time on the page. The attribute appears as world-building context rather than a trait Marina wields with cost. Functional but replaceable with "time sensitivity" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Uncage" is the story's organizing verb: Marina seeks to uncage trapped echoes, completes drawings to release creatures, and the chamber sequence dramatizes the act. The action defines her goal, drives two beats (search, chamber), and delivers closure. Swapping it for a synonym ("free," "release") would require rewriting the thematic frame. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Borrowing time is established early (sculptors siphon dream-minutes), reweighted at discovery (time stolen from extinctions, not dreams), and reversed at closure (borrowed minutes evaporate). The method shapes Marina's understanding and the city's crisis. Present in setup and payoff with causal pressure, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract. One key turn depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system provides the literal path Marina follows, supplies temporal residue as a clue, and the spiral around Morteus's throat becomes the access point. Setting constrains navigation and enables the gap dive. Present early, involved in travel beats and closure approach. The upward-flowing water adds pressure through its defiance of physics, though Marina doesn't interact with that constraint directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The 77-year nap cycle and "seventy-six years and eleven months" deadline create urgency ("perhaps days before he stirred") and the premature waking becomes a cost. Time pressure is mentioned early and shapes Marina's speed, though the ticking clock doesn't tighten choices beat-by-beat. Functional in one key turn (Morteus stirs as stolen time returns) but the hourly urgency isn't dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marina's search for "the place where echoes are born" drives the plot from opening (she's been searching for months) through the canal journey to chamber discovery. The motivation is embodied in her pendant-following and satchel-carrying. Friction appears when she realizes the cost (city's time system collapses) but proceeds anyway. Desire shapes two beats and the ending, with visible cost.</comment>
