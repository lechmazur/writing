<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Syln's agency is clear—she gathers pellets, leaves messages, orchestrates the final reveal—and her devotion to truth coheres across the piece. Internal contradiction is minimal; her motives remain static rather than evolving under pressure. The pretender's entrance feels more like a plot delivery device than a character whose choices shape the turn; his "perfect composure cracked" is told rather than embodied in contradiction or micro-choice. The true heir's arrival lacks any interiority or friction, reducing him to a plot token.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (Syln, temple library, drift stasis), satisfying the test. Drive lens: causal-accumulative hybrid—messages accumulate evidence, then the pretender's breach triggers the pellet reveal. Closure lands on-page (pretender flees, heir enters), but the cost is abstract: we see flight and welcome, not a legible emotional or relational price Syln pays for three millennia of waiting. The pellet drop feels convenient—its mechanics (ink spreads "like living shadow") are asserted rather than constrained by prior rules, weakening causality at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's crystalline dome, drift stasis, and constellation pauses create vivid micro-setting that constrains Syln's temporal experience and charges the final arrival. Sensory hierarchy is selective: "simple robes whispering against stone floors," "starlight caught from the dome." The pellet—a recurring object—charges the closure image when it shatters and spreads truth. Spatial choreography is clean (main door, shelves, dome overhead). The drift rune and constellation mechanics remain decorative rather than tactically limiting mid-scene; only at the end does the library "tremble" to signal breach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: unmask the pretender to restore the true heir. Escalation occurs when the pretender breaches the drift and confronts Syln, forcing her to deploy the pellet. However, the turn is convenient—she simply drops the pellet, it auto-resolves, and the pretender flees. No trade-off or visible price is dramatized; Syln's three-thousand-year wait ends in a tidy victory without loss. One reversal (messages → breach → confrontation) is sufficient for this length, but the lack of on-page cost caps the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deception emerges through particulars (iron gall pellets, annotated records, the library as witness) rather than statement. The final image—truth "writing...in characters older than kingdoms"—resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates in the pretender's "honeyed" false warmth and Syln's patient devotion. However, the resolution leans tidy: truth wins without moral ambiguity, the pretender is wholly fraudulent, and the true heir's legitimacy is uncomplicated. The constellation pause/library drift motif recurs but remains ornamental rather than constraining choice until the breach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV held cleanly throughout; Syln's perceptual signature ("ancient frame," "gnarled but steady," minimal affect) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches her titan lineage without overreach ("dying truths," "truth's patient guardian"). Dialogue in the confrontation carries subtext ("Still maintaining this dying place?" / "Still maintaining dying truths"), though the pretender's voice isn't sharply differentiated from Syln's formal register. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates subtly with pressure (shorter clauses at the breach, longer during reflection).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are strong in most beats; sentence variety supports rhythm. However, mild template cadence appears in the message catalog ("Each cryptic note," "Over the next constellation pause," "Days later—or decades") and the opening sequence recycles similar stems ("her ancient frame," "her simple robes," "her bloodline"). The pellet's mechanics at closure—"releasing ink that spread like living shadow, writing truth across the floor"—leans purple and abstract, dulling the climactic image. Minor filter stacking ("She felt the walls tremble") and one paraphrase loop (messages described twice in adjacent paragraphs) lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library-as-temporal-nexus and message exchange across centuries offer a fresh angle on rightful-heir plots. The titan scale inverted to child-height and Syln's patient archival devotion feel specific. However, the core throne-usurpation arc is template-familiar, and the resolution (truth-ink reveals all, pretender flees, heir returns) follows predictable beats without a non-obvious moral calculus or character cost. The iron gall pellets and drift rune add texture but don't transform the underlying structure. Within-band adjustment: risk is present (temporal drift, cryptic communication) but does not heighten stakes sufficiently for higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Syln (diminutive titan) drives all key turns: discovers messages, responds, gathers pellets, confronts the pretender, drops the pellet to reveal truth. Present in setup, middle (message exchange), and payoff (confrontation/closure). Her decisions alter tactics (making starlight ink, preparing pellets) and enable the final revelation. Specific cost: her three-thousand-year wait and solitary devotion are felt but not viscerally dramatized as a trade-off at closure. Two gates plus causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score solidly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellets appear in setup ("preparing iron gall ink pellets"), middle (she gathers them "across centuries," mixes with starlight), and payoff (she drops one to reveal truth). Used in three distinct beats; the pellet's shattering is the pivotal action at closure. Specific mechanics (compressed knowledge, dissolved in titan blood) shape the tactic and enable the resolution. Cost: the pellet's use forecloses secrecy and triggers the pretender's flight. High irreplaceability and closure linkage justify upper band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rune of drift is present in setup ("held in stasis by the rune of drift"), shapes the library's temporal state (constellation pauses measure epochs), and at closure the drift is breached ("reality pressed against its boundaries"). However, its mechanics remain abstract; it doesn't constrain Syln's choices mid-scene or offer a trade-off. The breach is told rather than explored as a tactical problem. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus ambient pressure but limited causal specificity cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" (simple robes, no crown/throne, "quiet devotion") is signaled early and visible in Syln's actions: she tends shelves, makes ink, speaks plainly. The trait enables trust and patience across millennia. At closure, her calm offer of the pellet ("holding out a single pellet") and lack of triumph ("neither triumph nor sorrow") reflect the attribute. Cost: her modesty forecloses grandeur or recognition. Present in setup, middle (patient work), and payoff. Mild decorative phrasing ("graceful, necessary work") slightly lowers specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears explicitly ("seeks the rune. He knows the library holds power to sunder his false claim") and implicitly when the pretender breaches the drift and Syln's pellet "shatters" to reveal truth, sundering his legitimacy. However, the mechanics are asserted late; the action doesn't shape prior tactics or create mid-scene friction. Present in payoff strongly, setup weakly. One gate plus closure linkage but limited beat involvement and swappability (another verb could replace "sunder" with minor edits) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cryptic messages left in library books drive the entire middle: Syln discovers them ("fresh ink marks in the margins"), responds ("began leaving responses"), annotates battle records, and receives urgent warnings. The method shapes her understanding and tactics (gathering proof, preparing pellets). Present in setup (first message), middle (exchange across constellation pauses), and payoff (shelves glow with centuries of messages at closure). Specific mechanics (ink, margins, chronicle annotations) and causal pressure across three beats justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ancient temple library lost in time is present throughout: setup (drift stasis, crystalline dome, endless shelves), middle (spatial anchors for message discovery and ink-making), and payoff (library trembles at breach, "every book opening" at closure). The setting enables the message exchange (repository "that touched all times") and supplies the pellets (Syln's archive work). The dome's constellations track temporal pressure. Micro-setting (shelves, pellets, stone floor) constrains and charges the final image. High specificity and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Constellation pauses are signaled early ("measured not in days but in the slow rotation of constellations"), recur in the middle ("Over the next constellation pause—perhaps a century"), and climax when constellations "spun frantically, then stopped" at the breach. The timeframe creates urgency (messages grow urgent as "another constellation pause approached") and charges the final arrival. However, the mechanic remains atmospheric; it doesn't tighten a specific choice or create a legible countdown that alters Syln's tactics beat-by-beat. Two gates plus pressure contribution but limited tactical constraint cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to unmask the pretender is dramatized early (Syln "understood" the messages' meaning), shapes middle choices (leaving responses, gathering proof, preparing pellets), and drives the climactic confrontation (offering the pellet, revealing truth). Friction: the cost of three millennia of solitary waiting is felt but not explored as internal conflict (want vs. fear). The motivation is consistent and causally linked to all major beats, present in setup, middle, and payoff. Visible cost at closure (the pretender flees, heir welcomed) but minimal internal trade-off lowers slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" tone is signaled in the opening ("watching empires rise and fall," "dying place," "quiet devotion") and recurs at closure ("neither triumph nor sorrow," "kingdoms fall and rise again"). The tone modulates subtly with pressure: calm patience, then tremor at the breach, then serene return to ink-making. However, "collapse" is underplayed—the pretender flees, but Syln and the library endure without visible decay or loss. The tone is coherent and charges the final image but lacks the visceral weight of collapse, trending more toward "graceful endurance." Two gates plus thematic consistency but muted payoff.</comment>
