<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is defined entirely by external action and mystical wisdom-keeper labels ("spiralingly calm," "guardian of the truth") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Thomas receives more interiority—shoulders hunched, tears streaming—but his transformation from frozen grief to dissolving burden arrives through observation rather than micro-choices that constrain him. The piece tells us Mira "understood" and shows Thomas "began to understand" without dramatizing the internal friction that would make either credible. No visible cost forecloses a path; the boy simply walks away lighter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: shutters + mirror create layered images that reweight Thomas's grief through pattern rather than causal decision. Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt dock, Mira, Thomas). The closure—handing the mirror and Thomas walking away lighter—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (his burden dissolves), but cost remains asserted ("tears streaming") rather than shown as forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. The shutter demonstration accumulates density, yet the final gift feels like a symbolic handoff rather than a choice that forecloses an option with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet planks, puddles reflecting stars, and shutters are vividly anchored and revisited across beats. The dental mirror's reflective surface constrains Mira's teaching method—she positions it "with the precision of someone who had learned that small surfaces could hold infinite depth"—and charges the closure when she hands it to Thomas. Spatial choreography (kneeling, opening shutters, mirroring starlight) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Thomas's frozen confession to his dying grandmother. Pressure tightens through Mira's demonstration (shutters opening one by one = incremental reweighting), but escalation remains metaphorical rather than narrowing Thomas's options via decision. He watches transfixed, "began to understand," then rises and walks away—no on-page choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with cost. The demonstration deepens thematic texture without forcing Thomas to act under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy, darkness as container for light—emerges through shutters and stars rather than statement. The dental mirror's dual role (medical tool → telescope into the past) reweights prior material at closure. Yet the final paragraph moralizes directly: "darkness teaches us to treasure light, but only if we're brave enough to keep our eyes open" and "the most profound empathy often speaks without making a sound." These thematic summaries replace scene pressure and lower resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single stable third-person limited tracking Mira's perception and actions; no head-hopping. Diction elevates periodically ("spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse," "stillwater tension") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's lived lexicon. Thomas has no dialogue; Mira's silence is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but occasionally drifts into thesis-voice ("she had taught another soul…"), blurring the line between her thought and narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse," "secrets cast shadows darker than any night," "his work complete." Multiple beats restate the theme with synonym churn: "darkness wasn't empty but full," "grief was like closing every window," "stillwater tension…began to ease." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("Tomorrow would bring…and she would be waiting…") stacks declarative conclusions. No paraphrase loops touch closure directly, but overwriting dulls momentum across the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Silent guardian teaching through light-and-shadow demonstration is a recognizable archetype (mystical mentor, visual metaphor healing). The dental mirror as teaching tool offers a specific twist, yet the emotional arc—grieving boy learns grandmother heard his unspoken love—follows a template resolution without moral ambiguity or fresh calculus. The final image (canal carrying reflected stars) is lyrically executed but echoes prior "stars = spoken secrets" mapping. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira (silent canal guardian) is present throughout and performs the shutter demonstration, but her choices are enacted wisdom rather than decisions under pressure. She withdraws the mirror, kneels, opens shutters in "deliberate patterns," hands the mirror—all purposeful but not constrained by cost or conflicting options. Setup and development present; closure participation is handing the mirror (a gift, not a choice that alters her stance). Swappable with "wise teacher" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dental mirror appears in paragraph 3 (withdrawn from pocket), paragraph 4 (catches starlight), paragraph 5 ("became a telescope"), paragraph 7 ("positioned with precision"), paragraph 9 (handed to Thomas). Three distinct beats: catching light, reframing memory, gifting. Its reflective surface enables the teaching method (causal pressure). Closure linkage: Thomas receives it as "reminder that sometimes the smallest reflective surface could show us the vastness." Strong integration, though its mechanics (why dental vs. any mirror) remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Silent empathy is the premise and dramatized method: Mira teaches "without words," demonstrates rather than speaks, shows Thomas "love spoken in actions echoes longer." The concept shapes her tactics (shutters, mirror positioning) and Thomas's realization. However, the piece repeatedly labels it ("silent empathy," "empathy could be silent," "the most profound empathy often speaks without making a sound"), abstracting rather than trusting the dramatization. Present across beats; closure participation via the silent gift; cost is conceptual (renunciation of speech) but not felt as constraint on Mira.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears twice: paragraph 3 ("spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse") and final paragraph ("spiralingly calm as the night itself"). Both are labels without on-page cost or constraint. The simile ("like water circling a drain in reverse") poeticizes but does not show the trait enabling or limiting action. No middle development; closure mention is ornamental. Easily swappable with "serene" or "composed."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weave" is signaled early (paragraph 4: "she began to weave a lesson"), repeated in paragraph 7 ("Mira continued her patient weaving"), and frames the teaching method across middle beats. The action is metaphorical: Mira creates patterns with shutters rather than literal weaving. It shapes the demonstration (causal role in one major beat) and returns in closure framing ("ready to weave another pattern"). Two gates; lyric reprise reweights the stake. Yet "weave" is also generic metaphor for "teach" and could be replaced with "craft" or "build" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shutters appear in paragraph 4 ("old shutters that lined the canal house"), are opened and closed in "deliberate patterns" across paragraphs 4–7, creating shadow-and-light configurations that constitute Mira's teaching method. Mechanics matter: each shutter opening = one star's reflection; the sequence demonstrates how "grief was like closing every window at once." Two distinct beats (paragraphs 4–5, paragraph 7) and closure participation (the demonstration completes, Thomas rises). Causal pressure: without shutters, the metaphor cannot be enacted. Specific to this setting and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain is anchored in the opening sentence and revisited: wet planks, puddles reflecting stars, canal house with shutters, canal's "gentle lapping" and "dark water" carrying stars. The setting provides the reflective surfaces (puddles) and shutters essential to Mira's method; without them, the demonstration fails. Three beats and closure participation (final image of canal carrying stars). However, the dock itself exerts no pressure on Thomas's choice—he could leave or stay without spatial constraint. Strong atmospheric integration; micro-setting (puddles, shutters) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is abstract and does not function as a ticking clock. Paragraph 2 mentions Thomas's "secret half-spoken to his dying grandmother, words that had frozen on his lips when her breath stopped"—backstory, not live time pressure. The scene unfolds across "tonight" and "as the evening deepened" without urgency or tracked elapsed time. No middle development or closure participation as a temporal constraint. Ornamental thematic frame; easily removed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is told in paragraph 5 metaphorically ("she showed him how darkness wasn't empty but full") and summarized in the final paragraph ("darkness teaches us to treasure light"). It frames her demonstration but never conflicts with another want or encounters cost. Thomas's parallel realization (grandmother heard his love in silence) is the story's emotional stake, yet Mira's stated motivation remains abstract and unfelt. Functional in one beat (paragraph 5 demonstration); no friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named in paragraph 7 ("The stillwater tension that had held the dock in suspense began to ease") and echoed in "spiralingly calm" framing. Tone is quiet and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly as Thomas's burden dissolves. The final image of canal carrying stars sustains the meditative register. Coherent across beats and present at closure, though the tension itself is more asserted than felt—no sharp urgency or pressure that tightens before release. Static mood with one easing shift; mid-band.</comment>
