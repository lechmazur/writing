<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amara's motive to decode and understand the diary is clear, but her actions feel passive—she's "trapped," visited by Marcus, and follows his instructions. The retrocognitive state offers an interesting constraint, yet her interior life remains abstract ("temporal vertigo," "searing weight") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending realization about courage is told rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose a visible path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lagoon, diary, and Marcus's instructions layer meaning toward a final thematic reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (archivist, zeppelin, Sahara, morning arrival). However, closure relies on understanding delivered through exposition ("she finally understood") rather than a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The pattern of "encryption as courage" is stated, not dramatized at the ending beat, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, zeppelin gondola, and Sahara dunes are vivid and specific. The beach debris arranged as cipher constrains Amara's final action, charging the closure image with purpose. Spatial choreography (zeppelin descent, walking the shore) tracks cleanly, and sensory detail (black water shimmer, bleached wood) is filtered through Amara's archival lens, meeting the micro-setting constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the encrypted truth of betrayal and forgiveness—is signaled early. However, pressure remains largely static: Amara decodes, Marcus explains, and the lagoon reveals coordinates without meaningful tightening or a live trade-off. The "searing weight" and moral calculus are told rather than tested through decisions that narrow options. No on-page reversal forces Amara to choose between competing costs, leaving escalation underdeveloped under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—truth and betrayal as inseparable, and the courage to face complexity—emerges organically from the diary, lagoon, and Marcus's spectral presence. The final image of "stories that hurt and healed in equal measure" offers resonance, though it edges toward explicit statement. The tension between myth and reality is developed through particulars (coordinates, forgiven betrayals), but the ending explains the theme ("real encryption... in the courage") rather than letting the arranged debris speak silently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Amara's archival lens shapes perception (e.g., "symbols only another archivist would recognize"). Marcus's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext ("reading it wrong could destroy everything we built"). However, diction occasionally inflates under pressure: "retrocognitively locked," "searing reverie," "inseparable in their struggle" read as elevated register rather than Amara's lived thought. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans abstract when embodiment would deepen urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery (obsidian lagoon, infinity of floating libraries). However, several lines loop conceptually: "truth and tension were not opposites but partners" restates the earlier "truth creates tension" without added pressure. Phrases like "temporal vertigo," "searing weight," and "complex beauty of struggle" stack abstract modifiers in peak beats, reducing specificity. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The message took shape... The diary... The obsidian lagoon..." No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The zeppelin archive and obsidian lagoon as dual hidden-history sites offer a fresh spatial synthesis. The retrocognitive trap and Marcus's spectral presence transform familiar "ghost guides the living" material into a purposeful dual-timeline cipher. However, the core premise—discovering hidden truths of betrayal within a civil-rights movement—tracks closely to archival-mystery templates. The arranged-debris cipher and the coordinates-to-other-archives resolution feel inventive yet slightly convenient, arriving without the friction that would make them inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amara decodes the diary (early beat), walks the shore arranging debris (middle), and begins transcribing with new understanding (closure). Her choices advance plot, but the key turn—understanding forgiveness—is delivered by Marcus rather than earned through her decision under pressure. Present across all three gates but replaceable agency trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is seeded in the opening, serves as the secret meeting place (middle context), and appears in the final image as mirror/concealment motif. It constrains Amara's descent and the debris-arrangement action. Reweighted at closure ("not as hiding place but as mirror"), it participates causally in two beats and charges the ending, though the transformation is somewhat told.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary prompts Amara's mission, triggers the retrocognitive trap, and contains the coordinates revealed at closure. It shapes stakes throughout and enables the final transcription. However, the actual decoding happens off-page; we see results (coordinates, names) rather than the mechanics of discovery. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but swappable with "hidden map" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Being "retrocognitively trapped" enables dual-timeline perception and the synchronized debris arrangement with Marcus. However, the constraint is introduced suddenly in paragraph two without setup, and its mechanics remain vague. It does not visibly limit Amara's options or impose a cost—she can still move, descend, and act freely. The trap "releases" at closure without clear cause, reading as convenience rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "parley" with Marcus occurs once, mid-story, and consists mainly of exposition: Marcus explains the diary's purpose and instructs Amara. It does not create a turn or test competing goals. Easily replaceable with "consultation" or "lesson" without altering structure. Functional but ornamental; the key beats (decoding, arranging debris, transcribing) would proceed similarly without this labeled moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as cipher is signaled by Marcus ("Make the pattern I taught you through the diary") and executed on-page as Amara walks the shore. It directly shapes the middle beat and yields the coordinates at closure. The method is specific and irreplaceable—removal would break the mechanism of revelation. However, it appears only in one extended beat rather than recurring, and the "pattern I taught you" is told rather than shown earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zeppelin houses the archive, provides the aerial vantage that reveals the lagoon, and anchors the final circuit. The captain's descent enables the shore action. However, the zeppelin functions primarily as atmospheric transport; Amara could reach the lagoon by other means with minor edits. It enriches setting and tone but does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Present across all three gates but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Time is anchored at "that morning" when the diary arrived, but no clock tightens decisions afterward. The zeppelin's "slow circuit" and Amara's work proceed without urgency or deadline. The timeframe signals sequence (after discovery, before full transcription) but does not pressure tactics or escalate stakes. Functional setup only; middle and closure do not depend on temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amara's desire to uncover truth is stated early and drives her decoding and descent. The tension between revealing betrayers versus honoring the betrayed creates moral friction. However, the conflict is resolved by Marcus's explanation rather than Amara wrestling with competing costs on the page. The motivation is consistent and frames the arc, but its dramatization at closure is told ("she finally understood") rather than enacted through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone blends reverie (Marcus's spectral presence, "infinity of floating libraries") with weight ("searing," "hurt and healed"). The prose modulates purposefully: dreamy in the dual-timeline beats, grounded in the shore action, reflective at closure. However, several late phrases ("complex beauty of struggle," "long dance toward justice") edge toward abstraction that softens the searing quality. Coherent and mostly sustained, with slight drift from specificity in the final paragraph.</comment>
