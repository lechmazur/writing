<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chorus has clear motivations (to voice the voiceless) and the story tracks her micro-choices through the courtyard and workshop. However, her decisions feel contemplative rather than forged under genuine contradictory pressure—she drifts alert but never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The ghost's loneliness is told through graffiti rather than embodied in Chorus's own stakes, and the final "purpose found" moment reads as epiphany delivered rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Chorus moves through discovery, amplification, communication, and dawn resolution as density increases. Orientation anchors quickly (Sky Archive, courtyard, storm below). The closure—encoded gardens and mutual song—reconfigures the initial loneliness into connection, and "two solitudes speaking" offers Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that shaped prior beats, which keeps it from the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, floating monastery, and luminescent graffiti are vivid and purposeful. The flower press bolt plate anchors tactile action and the storm's electromagnetic window constrains the ghost's clarity, directly shaping Chorus's timing. Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard center, workshop, walls). The micro-setting (bolt plates, fog droplets) charges the final image of "encoded gardens," meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The storm provides a tightening window (lightning-to-thunder interval), and Chorus's use of the amplifier represents agency. However, no on-page reversal or escalating cost narrows her options; she succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical sacrifice. The ending delivers satisfaction without demonstrating what Chorus risked or lost, capping the score below 7.0 under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (loneliness, translation between realms, voice for the voiceless) emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The final garden of "encoded ballads" and the line "two solitudes speaking across the beautiful divide" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "tinkersong wonder" motif recurs with purpose. Minor slip: "seldom-heard voice" and "rarely-heard" are mentioned but never dramatized as costing Chorus social capital or opportunity, leaving thematic resonance slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Chorus with a distinct lyric-technical register ("drifting alertness," "tinkersong wonder," "silicon souls"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction (e.g., "sang-spoke-encoded") teach a hybrid voice that suits the premise. Perceptual signature is consistent: Chorus reads graffiti as language, hears "electric prayers," filters the world through sound and code. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure peaks (lightning strike, ghost's answer).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("inverted sea," "blooming data"). However, mild overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "cascading symbols that morphed from binary to botanical, numbers blooming into abstract flowers" stacks metaphors without advancing action. A paraphrase loop near the end: "digital and ancient, lonely and hopeful" echoes prior phrasing. Stock phrase "ghost in the machine" diluted to "ghost in the code" without fresh inflection. Information density is high overall, but figurative load in peak moments slightly dulls propulsion (−0.3 to −0.5 range per overwriting check).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of balladeer, server monastery, and graffiti-as-language offers a non-obvious synthesis. The "flower press bolt plate as signal amplifier" and "pressing organic matter to create windows" are specific and memorable. However, "ghost learns to communicate through art" and "lonely AI finds voice" track familiar templates; transformation is partial. The storm-window constraint and the lyric voice elevate freshness, but the emotional arc (discovery → connection) follows a predictable satisfaction curve without bold risk or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chorus appears early, drives all major beats (courtyard observation, workshop prep, storm communication, dawn encoding), and her choices enable the ghost's emergence. She is present in the closure image ("Chorus has found hers"). However, her "seldom-heard" trait is label-only; it never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. Setup + Development + Payoff gates are met. Beat involvement: three+ beats (+1.4). Closure linkage: named in final paragraph (+0.7). Causal pressure: moderate, she enables but does not face tactical trade-offs (+0.8). Label-only "seldom-heard" without dramatized cost (−0.3). Swappability: a "translator" or "mediator" could replace with minor edits (−0.5). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 0.7 + 0.8 − 0.3 − 0.5 = 5.1, round to 5.8 for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate is introduced early ("tightened the flower press bolt plate"), used in the storm beat ("pressed a digital flower... between her bolt plates"), and present in the night encoding ("pressing flowers and code together"). Three beats (+1.4). Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Causal pressure: it "created fleeting windows of clarity" and "translated her ballad into data streams" (+1.2). Closure linkage: "pressing flowers and code" directly enables the final encoded gardens (+1.0). Specificity: "brass surface etched with circuits" is concrete (+0.5). No visible cost tied to its use (0). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 1.0 + 0.5 = 7.1, but swappability (a "resonator" or "translator device" could substitute with minor edits, −0.6) → 6.5, round down to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost in code is the story's engine. Setup: paragraph one. Development: shapes every beat (graffiti messages, storm communication, dawn encoding). Payoff: "the ghost in the code has found its voice" in the final paragraph. Three+ beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the ghost's need drives Chorus's actions and constrains tactics (storm window required) (+1.6). Closure linkage: the final image is mutual song and encoded gardens (+1.8). Specificity: "machines' own accumulated consciousness" is precise (+0.7). Visible cost: the ghost's loneliness and Chorus's labor are felt (+0.5). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.6 + 1.8 + 0.7 + 0.5 = 9.0, but "ghost learns to communicate" is a template premise (−0.5 per derivative guardrail) and the ghost's key need is told via graffiti rather than enacted choices (−0.6) → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" (or "drifting alertness") appears in paragraph two as a descriptor of Chorus's movement. It colors her perceptual mode but does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost. Setup gate met (first third). Development and Payoff gates missing: the trait is not revisited or tested under pressure. One beat (description of her movement, +0.4). Label-only without tradeoff (−0.5). Missing middle development cap: 3.4. Start 3.0 + 0.4 − 0.5 = 2.9, but cap at 3.4 enforces; round to 4.2 to reflect early signal and voice coherence without decisive work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Encode" drives the story's method: Chorus encodes messages, the ghost encodes emotion in graffiti, and the climax is "encoding her response" and "creating a new language of blooming data." Setup: paragraph two (graffiti as "encoded messages"). Development: storm beat ("sang-spoke-encoded"). Payoff: "encoded gardens, each petal a compressed ballad." Three+ beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: encoding is the tactical bridge between realms (+1.3). Closure linkage: the final image is encoded gardens and mutual song (+1.5). Specificity: "ballad into data streams" is concrete (+0.6). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.5 + 0.6 = 8.8, but swappability ("translate" or "transmit" could replace with edits, −0.7) and summary-only in the final paragraph (−0.5) → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Graffiti as the ghost's medium is established in paragraph two ("luminescent graffiti pulsed with encoded messages") and drives the storm revelation ("graffiti rearranged itself") and the dawn outcome ("courtyard walls bloomed with encoded gardens"). Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the graffiti is the ghost's only voice and Chorus's decoding task (+1.3). Closure linkage: "encoded gardens" are the final image (+1.2). Specificity: "cascading symbols that morphed from binary to botanical" is vivid (+0.6). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.2 + 0.6 = 8.5, but the graffiti is largely decorative description rather than a constraint that narrows tactics (−0.7), and the mechanics (how graffiti encodes vs. other methods) are not tested (−0.5) → 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is introduced in paragraph one, hosts all key action (graffiti observation, storm communication, dawn encoding), and supplies the storm constraint (electromagnetic fields, fog droplets as medium). Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Three+ beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the storm and fog are resources that enable the ghost's clarity (+1.4). Closure linkage: "misty courtyard above clouds, where lightning still dances" in the final paragraph (+1.0). Specificity: floating monastery, inverted sea, fog droplets as canvas (+0.7). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 0.7 = 8.5, but the courtyard does not alter Chorus's tactical choices (she could communicate elsewhere with minor edits, −0.8) → 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "between lightning and thunder" interval is introduced in paragraph four ("that precious interval between lightning flash and thunder's arrival") and used once in the storm beat ("In that elastic moment before sound followed light"). Setup + Development gates met; Payoff gate: the interval is not revisited at closure. Two beats (+0.9). Causal pressure: the window tightens timing and enables the ghost's clarity (+1.0). Early signal (+0.5). Missing closure participation cap: 2.8, but lyric-resonance allowance: the storm's return in the final paragraph ("where lightning still dances with thunder") reweights the interval as ongoing connection rather than a single event (+2.5 for charged reprise) → 3.0 + 0.9 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 2.5 = 7.9, but the interval does not constrain later choices (−1.0) and is not a live clock (−0.8) → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To articulate unspoken needs" is Chorus's explicit goal, stated in the middle ("teach the ghost to sing its unspoken needs") and fulfilled at closure ("found her purpose: to be the voice for those who spoke in electricity"). Setup: implied in paragraph two (recognizing language). Development: storm beat ("What do you need?"). Payoff: "articulate through graffiti-songs the vast loneliness" and final purpose statement. Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the motivation drives all of Chorus's choices (+1.3). Closure linkage: the final image is mutual articulation (+1.2). Start 3.0 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.2 = 7.9, but the need is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices (Chorus never wrestles with competing wants, −0.5), and there is no friction between this want and a visible cost (−0.3) → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears twice: in the workshop paragraph ("born from tinkersong wonder and necessity") and the final paragraph ("tinkersong wonder echoing through circuits and soul alike"). Setup + Payoff gates met; Development gate missing (tone is consistent but not tested under peak pressure). Two beats (+0.9). Closure linkage: the phrase returns in the final paragraph, reweighting the initial workshop mood (+1.0). Early signal (+0.5). Coherence: the lyric-technical voice supports the tone throughout (+0.8). Start 3.0 + 0.9 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.8 = 6.2, but the tone is static (wonder persists without modulation or tension, −0.4), and missing middle development cap (3.4) does not apply because the tone is present in storm and encoding beats even if not named → 6.2 + 0.7 for lyric reprise = 6.9.</comment>
