<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller remains largely abstract—her physical traits are detailed but her interior contradiction and agency are thin. The piece tells us she "needed to hear the texture" but we never see her wrestling with doubt or cost in real time; the transformation into a bone tower reads more as mythic summary than earned character arc. The final choice to become part of the canyon feels imposed by the story's lyric design rather than motivated by on-page struggle. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are absent in favor of atmospheric declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (canyon, storyteller, dying language). The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure: the storyteller becomes a bone tower and the diamond's curse transforms into a translator. However, the cost remains abstract—"her veins finally cooled" is poetic but not felt. The middle escalation (drop into canyon, activate diamond, carve grooves) follows an accumulative logic, but the final leap to bodily transformation is summarized in retrospect ("years later") rather than dramatized, softening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon, and copper veins create a vivid micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dried lavender crumbling," "silk dragged across bark." The setting constrains her method (she uses the towers' resonance, carves with her nails) and the starlings' negative space becomes a spatial tactic. The only slip: the shift to "years later" abstracts the physical continuity, but the return image of her as a tower re-anchors strongly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving Thuvenli before it dies at dawn) is signaled early and pursued through concrete actions: dropping into the canyon, activating the diamond, humming with the towers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she feels the language's death through the diamond at dawn. However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—we're told she vanished and became a tower, but the sacrifice feels like mythic inevitability rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of translation and preservation emerges through texture-to-sound transformation and the tension between loss and survival. The flawed diamond's curse ("hear only what was lost") reweights at the end when it becomes a translator. The piece resists moralizing, but the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("teaching the echoes new ways to remember what was lost") rather than letting the image speak. The particulars (lavender crumbling, copper sealing the crack) carry thematic weight, though the retrospective frame softens immediacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the storyteller with a distinct lyric register: "copper-veined," "quietly articulate," "texture of Thuvenli's death rattle." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming out for the "years later" frame. Diction stays elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("translate sensation into sound"). No dialogue present to evaluate. The retrospective narrator voice in the final section ("travelers would find") shifts temporal stance but remains coherent and serves the mythic closure design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid specifics ("organ pipes," "frozen scream," "copper-laced fingernails"). Some redundancy: "echoes" appears repeatedly without reweighting, and the phrase "quietly articulate" is used twice in similar contexts. The final paragraph stacks clauses in a way that feels slightly overwrought ("the starlings returned each evening, their patterns writing stories in the air that only the canyon could read, preserving languages that had not yet been born"). No major loops, but density could tighten in the closing summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—translating a tactile language into resonant sound through a flawed diamond and starling patterns—feels specific and non-obvious. The copper veins as physical conduit and the bone towers as memory vessels create a coherent fantastical logic. The piece takes a risk with the mythic retrospective frame and largely succeeds. Minor friction: the "years later" pivot to external travelers softens the immediacy of the transformation, and the storyteller-becomes-monument arc echoes familiar metamorphosis tropes, though the textural details freshen it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller drives key beats: she drops into the canyon, activates the diamond, angles it to match the starlings' gap, hums to find harmonics, and carves grooves into the bone towers. Her final transformation into a tower participates in closure. However, her decisions feel more like mythic inevitability than contested choices—she executes a predetermined sequence without visible internal friction or cost that alters tactics. Early signal is strong; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears early, is used in two distinct beats (pressed against the tower to activate the curse, angled to match the starlings' negative space), and returns transformed at closure (crack sealed with copper, curse turned translator). Its crack is functionally irreplaceable—it tunes to "specific frequencies of loss" and shapes her method. The object drives tactics and charges the final image. Strong integration, though the sealing-with-copper detail is told retrospectively rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "tunnel of echoes" (canyon where sound transforms and rebounds) frames the setting and stakes: she seeks a place where Thuvenli can survive as echo. It shapes her tactic (using the bone towers' resonance) and the closure image (she becomes part of the echo structure). The concept is seeded early and participates in closure. However, "tunnel" itself does not constrain a specific choice—she could have worked in any resonant chamber. The broader echo logic is essential; the tunnel framing is more atmospheric than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is mentioned twice as a trait ("quietly articulate in seven living languages" and later "quietly articulate in the space between sound and sensation") but remains label-only. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—she does not face a moment where her articulateness creates friction or advantage. The phrase colors tone but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness" drives the core action: she descends to harness Thuvenli's echoes before the language dies. The act of harnessing (activating the diamond, humming with the towers, carving grooves, translating texture into sound) occupies the middle sequence and results in the hybrid Copper-Throat language. Major turns trace to this action. The exact verb "harness" could be swapped for "capture" or "preserve" without structural loss, but the underlying action is load-bearing and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The starlings' flight patterns are signaled early and used mechanically: she watches their synchronized turns to read "ancient grammar," waits for their pattern to shift, then angles the diamond to match "the gap in their formation" that corresponds to the crack. The birds act as conductors through the night. The method is specific (matching negative space in the flock to the diamond's flaw), shapes her attempt, and participates in closure. Removing the starlings would break the story's hinge moment. High integration with strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bone towers are introduced early, described in functional detail (carved from extinct creatures' skeletons, hollow chambers that hum), and actively used: she presses the diamond against the largest tower, hums to find harmonics with them, carves new grooves with her nails, and ultimately becomes one herself. The towers constrain her method (she cannot preserve Thuvenli without their resonance) and charge the closure image. The canyon setting is indispensable; the towers within it drive both tactics and transformation. Strong, multi-beat integration with closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("across the death of a language") is clearly signaled: Thuvenli will die "with tomorrow's dawn when its final speaker drew her last breath." The storyteller works "through the night," and "as dawn approached, she felt the moment through the diamond—the last Thuvenli speaker's final exhale." The ticking clock shapes urgency and the closure beat is tied to the exact moment of the language's death. The time constraint is dramatized and tightens decisions. Solid causal integration, though the "years later" epilogue softens the immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "translate texture into sound" is seeded early ("How could such a thing be preserved?"), dramatized in the middle act (she "began to hum, her voice finding harmonics," "translating sensation into sound"), and fulfilled at closure (the canyon now "sang in a language that made listeners feel words"). The desire drives her tactics (angling the diamond, carving grooves) and the final hybrid creation reflects the achieved goal. The cost (her transformation into a tower) is tied to the success of this translation. Strong causal and thematic integration with closure participation.</comment>
