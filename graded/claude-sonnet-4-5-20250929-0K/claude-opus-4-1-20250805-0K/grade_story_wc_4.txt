<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained—she moves from recognition to preservation to orchestrated closure—but her interiority remains thin. The piece tells us she "possessed a gift" and felt "urgency" yet never dramatizes internal conflict or embodied hesitation under pressure. The workers' descendants appear only in summary at the end, denying us relationship friction or status dynamics. "Perceptively calm demeanor masked the urgency she felt" is label-only emotion without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spiral pattern builds across photographs, deepens through timeline tracing, and culminates in the exhibition recreating the arcs. Orientation anchors late—"subtle puzzle archivist for the Museum of Industrial Memory" arrives after two paragraphs of map-case description; who/where/when clarity wavers past 120 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the community spiral completed), but cost remains asserted rather than shown: no on-page sacrifice, no path foreclosed with visible price. The shutter-click and cradled case offer lyric resonance yet the "proof" and "blueprints" language tells the closure effect instead of letting the image speak. Orientation slip triggers −0.3; cost legibility gap prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lavender field behind rusted factory ruins is vividly anchored and the dove gray case functions as micro-setting with tactile specificity. The field constrains the exhibition design (coordinates, human arcs) and charges the final image where "dawn light caught the rusted factory bones." Sensory detail is purpose-driven—"purple blooms," "soot and steam," "worn smooth as river stones"—and the industrial-versus-botanical contrast threads through. The field reaches the 9+ gate test by shaping multiple choices and appearing in the closure image, but the space itself never imposes a surprise obstacle or alters tactics under pressure in the middle; it remains backdrop rather than active constraint across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preservation and collective healing, signaled early. Escalation reads as accumulative density increase: five workers → thirty → one hundred, then the exhibition brings "hundreds." Yet the town council's demolition deadline ("next month") is declared once and never tightens on the page—no countdown, no interference, no visible cost when Elara acts. The exhibition unfolds without friction: visitors arrive, find their spots, the spiral forms, camera clicks. Agency is present (Elara designs the treasure hunt, invites descendants) but no choice forecloses a live alternative with felt price. The resolution is generous coincidence—everyone shows up, everyone cooperates—rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice or trade-off. Pressure coheres but never narrows options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational healing and resilience emerges through concrete images—lavender arcs, human mandalas, the spiral across decades—without overt moralizing until the final two paragraphs. "We plant what the machines cannot make" is earned, specific, non-diagnostic. But the ending drifts into thematic summary: "some puzzles take generations to solve," "blueprints for collective healing," "slow, necessary weaving of community from threads of shared sorrow and stubborn hope" are thesis statements rather than images that let the reader infer. The penultimate paragraph especially ("transmute inherited pain into beauty that could finally be seen whole") tells the theme rather than trusting the dramatized spiral to carry it. The dove gray case returns with changed meaning, a valid lyric move, yet the final paragraph's direct articulation of the factory's "true production" undercuts resonance. Apply −0.5 for thematic echo in closure paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "perceptively calm," "earnest whimsy," "traced...as vines climb" reflect a measured, slightly elevated register appropriate to an archivist. Psychic distance narrows during photograph inspection and widens during timeline summary, purposefully modulating. The prose has textural specificity—"dove gray," "river stones," "purple canvas"—and perceptual signature (Elara notices arcs, patterns, inheritance). Weakness: filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("She recognized," "She lingered," "She understood," "She traced") and the final paragraph's shift into collective "they" loses individual perceptual anchor. Rhythm control is strong under pressure with no template cadence or mid-paragraph POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high and figurative language is mostly coherent—"grief itself, traced," "vines climb," "bodies as brushstrokes"—but density sags in the middle third where timeline exposition ("1952: five workers...1967: thirty...1984: over a hundred") lists rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase loop: "transmute pain into beauty" / "transmute inherited pain into beauty" / "transmuted industrial trauma into intergenerational art" recurs across three paragraphs with synonym churn. Stock metaphor: "future they were finally learning to compose together" and "threads of shared sorrow and stubborn hope" are generic high-level descriptors. The final two paragraphs stack thematic summary instead of propelling through image. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 2–3 ("recognized," "possessed," "showed," "lingered") dulls immediacy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template summary; −0.3 for filter clustering. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so cap at mid-band rather than lower.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—archival photographs as blueprints for living human art—offers a fresh angle on collective memory and healing, and the lavender-field-behind-factory juxtaposition is specific. Yet the execution follows a familiar arc: lone curator discovers hidden history, organizes exhibition, community gathers, healing occurs. No meaningful friction complicates the vision; the exhibition succeeds exactly as planned with universal cooperation. The "treasure hunt" frame and "earnest whimsy" label attempt quirk but remain surface decoration. Emotional beats are genuine (elderly survivors' tears) yet the resolution's tidiness—hundreds arrive on cue, children on shoulders, spiral forms perfectly—retreats to safety. The transformation test flags concern: swap Elara for any preservation-minded protagonist, lavender for another symbolic plant, and the arc holds unchanged. Within-band, no bold risk elevates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara (subtle puzzle archivist) appears early, frames the discovery, designs the exhibition, and raises the camera at closure—three beats. Her archival skill enables the photograph interpretation and the treasure-hunt design, so the trait constrains tactics. Yet her choices are unopposed and cost-free; she decides, designs, invites, and succeeds without sacrifice. The "subtle puzzle" aspect is told rather than shown through on-page deduction under pressure. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is summary rather than scene. Functional but swappable with "perceptive historian" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dove gray map case is handled in the discovery beat, opened to reveal photographs, and cradled in Elara's arms at closure—three touches. Its worn leather ("smooth as river stones") and survival across generations add specificity. The case houses the photographs that drive the entire plot, so removing it breaks story logic. Yet the case itself is passive container; Elara could carry loose photos and the arc holds. The closure reprise ("cradled in her arms") reweights it as vessel of memory but does not charge the final image with new cost. Setup, middle (as reference), and closure present; causal but replaceable with "folder" or "archive box."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Collective healing is the story's premise and stated theme. The photographs show communal arcs, the exhibition recreates them, the ending asserts "blueprints for collective healing." Yet the concept operates at thematic declaration rather than on-page friction. No individual resists, no faction fractures, no descendant balks—the collective coalesces without cost or complication. Setup is implicit in the photographs; middle is exposition; closure claims it but does not dramatize a choice where collective-versus-individual pulls Elara or anyone else. Present throughout but not tested under pressure. Functional theme, low causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is mentioned once in paragraph 3 ("Elara's perceptively calm demeanor masked the urgency she felt") as a label. No on-page action shows calm enabling or constraining a choice; no moment where her calm steadies others or costs her speed. The attribute is ornamental self-description rather than dramatized trait. Introduced late (second third), never tested, absent from closure. Present but does not affect momentum or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Linger" appears once: "She lingered over one particular image: twenty women in work aprons." This beat frames Elara's recognition of the tradition and quotes the photograph's inscription, anchoring her motivation. Yet "lingered" is easily swappable with "paused," "studied," or "examined" without structural change. The action does not create a turn or foreclose an option; it introduces expository reflection. Setup gate met (first third), but no middle beat or closure tie beyond general attention. Functional scene marker, mid-causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Arcs in black-and-white photographs" are introduced early, traced across decades in the timeline, and directly shape the exhibition design (photograph fragments as coordinates). The arcs form the spiral that is the story's conceptual spine, so the method is indispensable. Elara's reading of the arcs drives her insight ("complete picture...enormous spiral") and the treasure-hunt mechanics. Present in discovery, middle analysis, and closure image (camera adds "one more arc"). Strong causal role across three beats; specificity (arc geometry, decades-long assembly) is irreplaceable. Cost tie is indirect (no arc-reading challenge on the page). Solid integration, just shy of high band due to unopposed execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lavender field behind rusted factory ruins anchors setting from paragraph one, supplies the exhibition venue, and frames the closure image ("dawn light caught the rusted factory bones"). The field's coordinates structure the treasure hunt, so it shapes tactics. Purple blooms versus soot-and-steam recurs as motif. The field is present in early, middle (via photographs), and ending beats with specificity (tucked behind ruins, still blooming). Removing it breaks spatial logic and symbolic resonance. Yet the field never imposes a constraint that forces Elara to adapt—no weather, no access issue, no spatial surprise. Strong presence and closure charge, but passive backdrop rather than active pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears once in paragraph 4 ("She traced the photographs' timeline as vines climb, slowly but with inevitable purpose"). This is a simile describing Elara's method, not a plot timeframe or countdown. No clock tightens decisions; the town council deadline ("next month") is mentioned once and never tracked. The exhibition unfolds in a single morning without time pressure. The element is ornamental metaphor rather than temporal constraint. Present as diction, absent as structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The desire "to transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated mid-story ("transmute inherited pain into beauty") and echoed at closure ("industrial trauma transformed into intergenerational art"). Elara's actions—designing the exhibition, inviting descendants—pursue this goal. Yet the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No scene shows Elara torn between personal ambition and community need, between archive protocol and artistic risk. The want succeeds without friction or cost. Setup implicit, middle present as exposition, closure declares fulfillment. Functional but frictionless; told-only motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is declared once in paragraph 7 ("Working with earnest whimsy, she designed the exhibition as a treasure hunt"). The treasure-hunt frame and "laughing as they discovered their positions" gesture toward whimsy, but the prose elsewhere is elevated and serious—"crystalline clarity," "collective artwork spanning decades," "intergenerational art." Tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image; the ending is lyric and declarative, not whimsical. The label is ornamental descriptor rather than coherent tonal texture. Present as single phrase, absent as sustained voice.</comment>
