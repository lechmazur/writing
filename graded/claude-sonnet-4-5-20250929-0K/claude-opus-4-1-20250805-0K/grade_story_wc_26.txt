<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve dreams is stated but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. Her interior consists largely of discovery-summary ("she understood," "she recognized") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother exists only in reflective backstory, never applying pressure to Mira's present decisions. The final transcription feels like a thesis statement rather than an action that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the transcription decision, but the cost remains abstract—no tactical forfeiture or relational price is dramatized on the page. The shadow's "migration" across decades functions as backstory payload rather than present escalation; Mira watches footage but never faces a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming library's "glass petals" and "bio-glass membranes" are vivid, but the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters Mira's actions. The river stone appears as a prop without spatial choreography—placed, held, warming—but never limits access or frames a tactical decision. Micro-setting credit cannot be awarded when the object is inert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the shadow's journey—is signaled, but no on-page reversal tightens Mira's options. Her colleagues' dismissal is mentioned in summary, not dramatized as opposition that forces a trade-off. The discovery unfolds as linear revelation without a moment where Mira must choose between competing goods or accept a visible price. Accumulative lens does not waive the need for one meaningful pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of hope persisting across generations emerges clearly from the shadow's collection of hope-filled moments and the grandmother's embedded dream. The final image of tending dreams "through the waiting darkness" resonates without overt moralizing. However, "luminous regret" and phrases like "love's softly deliberate preservation" veer toward abstraction; the theme would strengthen if anchored to a specific on-page cost Mira pays to preserve this knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and the diction ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate") establishes a distinct lyric register. However, several lines drift into expository summary—"she understood her purpose," "knew that some dreams take generations"—that tell insight rather than dramatize discovery. Under peak emotional pressure (the vision), the prose sustains its rhythm without collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops degrade momentum: "shadow in the recordings moved independently" / "shadow had been migrating"; "dreams become shareable" / "dreams became shareable"; "softly deliberate" recurs three times without functional variation. Figurative density is high throughout—"glass petals," "dark aurora," "translucent figure," "prismatic light"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating a decorative haze in peak beats. The phrase "the shape of hope" and "luminous regret" are abstract where concrete image would sharpen. Template cadence is present but does not dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—dreams shareable via technology, a shadow migrating through archived footage—combines familiar SF tropes (dream-sharing, surveillance archives) without a non-obvious synthesis. The emotional arc (grandchild discovers ancestor's hidden legacy) follows a well-worn template. The story does not transform these elements through unexpected moral calculus or lived specificity; the grandmother's theory and Mira's realization feel constructed to serve the prompt rather than emerging from irreducible character need.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") observes and catalogs but makes no key on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her decision to transcribe is stated in the final paragraph without friction or cost. Present across beats but observational role limits causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three time periods (2024, 2054, 2084) and is handled physically (carried, placed, grows warm). Setup and development gates are met, and it anchors the shadow's migration. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its function is symbolic continuity rather than mechanical necessity. Closure participation is present (warmth) but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is introduced early, drives the investigation across multiple beats, and the shadow's metamorphosis is central to the vision scene. The concept shapes Mira's investigative tactics (frame-by-frame comparison) and the final understanding. Swappability test: replacing "shadow" with another unbound phenomenon (e.g., light anomaly) would require only minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears as a descriptor for the shadow's movement and the grandmother's preservation, but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only, applied to motion and metaphor without demonstrating a trade-off (e.g., slowness that risks discovery vs. carefulness that preserves accuracy).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is signaled early (shadow "began to metamorphose"), drives the middle vision beat where the shadow becomes translucent figure, and the completed transformation enables Mira's direct experience of her grandmother's dream. The action is causally central and participates in closure. Moderate irreplaceability: "transform" or "evolve" could substitute with minor tonal loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is introduced in paragraph two, used actively across beats (tracking frame-by-frame, syncing timeline comparisons), and shapes Mira's method of discovery. The mechanics matter: the footage spans decades and the shadow's progression is only visible through comparison. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Swappability: another archival medium (e.g., photographs) would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" is described vividly (glass petals, bio-glass membranes, eternal dusk) and appears in opening, middle, and closing paragraphs. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The setting is postcard atmosphere—beautiful but inert. No micro-setting element (body, tool, small object) constrains action either; the river stone is present but not used tactically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams become shareable" (2084, thirty years post-technology) anchors the premise and enables the dream-sharing interface Mira activates. However, the "shareable dreams" technology does not tighten a decision or create a time-pressure tactic. The historical span (2024–2084) structures the investigation but does not function as a live clock that alters moves. Functional setup, minimal development, closure presence is thematic only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated explicitly in paragraph seven and again in the final paragraph, but is never dramatized through a conflicted choice. Mira's desire drives the investigation, yet no friction appears between this want and a competing cost (e.g., institutional censure, personal sacrifice). The motivation is told and then fulfilled without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named once and modulates across the piece: "sharp-eyed" observation, prismatic light imagery, "tears that caught the library's prismatic light," "colors that had no names, only feelings." Tone is coherent and charges the final image's wistful resolve. However, the single direct label and reliance on "luminous" abstraction rather than embodied sensation keeps it in mid-band.</comment>
