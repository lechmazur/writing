<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's reverse-aging is presented but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost on the page. Marcus exists only to receive exposition; no relationship pressure emerges. The character's stated motivations ("weaving truth carefully") remain abstract labels rather than dramatized trade-offs. Internal contradiction is absent—she executes her lesson plan smoothly without embodied struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing via the final aphorism about "absence that makes presence visible," but no on-page cost is legible—Marcus simply achieves understanding without forfeiting anything. The "backwards aging" reveal arrives as exposition rather than causally altering tactics or options. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words) without payoff, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the closure reweights nothing with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating platform and magnetic grotto are vividly anchored and the pond ripples provide concrete sensory focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop. The "tenth ring inside the first" offers a charged image but arrives without micro-setting pressure that shapes the meditation's outcome, capping the category below 7.0 despite strong descriptive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching Marcus to "see time differently"—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the meditation proceeds to inevitable success. Marcus's "confusion" is mentioned but not dramatized as resistance that must be overcome. The lesson succeeds without visible cost, trade-off, or credible alternative path, leaving escalation absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of time-as-spiral and "vanishing to appear" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final-paragraph aphorism ("The only way to teach vanishing...") exemplifies thematic echo, explicitly articulating the thesis in prompt-like language (−0.6). The pond patterns function as symbolic decoration rather than lived constraint. No non-literal answer grows from prior scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature ("sycamore hush of autumn afternoons, soft and papery") is distinct and voice-motivated. POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("temporal perspective," "beta waves of their shifting consciousness") repeatedly clashes with the meditative frame, creating register drift in peak beats (−0.4). Marcus's interiority in his single line lacks distinct idiom from Elara's narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops recur: "The trance descended...trance began to lift," "weaving truth carefully...woven truth finally ready," "backwards aging...aging in reverse." Template cadence runs appear: "She had been withholding...would withhold...had been preparing to say since the day she would die" across three consecutive sentences without taught pattern (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("leaves on still air," "rings carrying data") dull clarity. Information density is moderate but momentum flags during exposition blocks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The reverse-aging scientist teaching time-perception through meditation combines familiar SF/fantasy tropes without transformation. The "backwards aging" conceit is introduced but not explored through lived constraint or fresh implication—it remains ornamental. The pond-ring pedagogy and magnetic-grotto setting read as assembled to fulfill prompt elements rather than inevitably arising from character or world logic. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the synthesis above median genre execution.</comment>
