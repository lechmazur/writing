<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear—dual allegiance and preservation instinct—but her interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The stone chip touching becomes a gestural tic rather than a window into competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her "orderly intuitive" decoding reads smoothly but remains label-only; we don't see the trait constrain or enable a costly choice. The ending choice (incorporate as preservation society) feels efficient rather than wrenching, with minimal visible cost to her mainland ties or community trust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid; closure reads as Decisive Change (reorganization enacted) with a micro Conceptual Repricing (laws as shield). Orientation anchors early (raft city, Maya, graffiti overnight). The escalation—graffiti warning → developers arrive → community meeting → incorporation plan → legal murals—advances causally with one meaningful tightening. Cost is present but muted: the stone chip finds a home, the carnival continues "protected," and Maya watches "knowing she had helped" without a felt price for her dual allegiance or a path foreclosed. The ending assertion "still floating, still free" tells resolution rather than showing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city is vividly rendered: perpetual carnival lights, recycled bottles, wave generators, fortune teller booths, oil-drum fires. Sensory detail is filtered through Maya's practiced ease and the community's lived-in textures. The foundation stone chip and the lighthouse replica constrain choices (communication tower, cornerstone). Spatial choreography across platforms remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (edge of floating world, mainland boats approach) and the carnival's perpetual motion mirrors resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survival of the free-floating community before privatization. Pressure escalates cleanly: graffiti warning → developers' sleek boats → Maya's call to reorganize → legal incorporation as shield. One meaningful tightening when developers photograph the chaos, narrowing options. Agency lands in Maya's plan and the artists' immediate mural work. Cost is visible (documenting traditions, legal framework encoded in art) but the ending's assertion that laws "protected" the lights and "still free" undercuts the trade-off; we don't see what was surrendered to become "something unbreakable."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—preservation versus transformation, resistance through adaptation—emerges from the graffiti system, dual allegiance, and incorporation strategy. The foundation stone chip seeds and returns with reweighted meaning (cornerstone). Subtext operates in the encoded murals and Maya's silent thumb-cutting. However, the final paragraph tips into statement: "a culture that absorbed every shock while refusing to sink" and the graffiti's "STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE" articulate theme rather than letting the image resonate. The plan to "become something they can't buy" is declared more than dramatized with ambiguous cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya throughout. Voice carries distinct texture: "hopeful desperation," "orderly intuitive mind," the graffiti decoded as survival language. Perceptual signature is present (stone chip, weathered notebook, carnival's chaos). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present (Maya's gathering speech). The phrase "before privatization reached their floating sanctuary" and "absorbthe shock of change" edge toward essay register. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the carnival's encoded warnings filter consistently through Maya's practiced lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "foundation stone chip" is named six times with similar framing, and "perpetual" recurs three times in close proximity. "Hopeful desperation" and "orderly intuitive" are repeated without evolving meaning. The phrase "before privatization carved up the water rights" and "ungoverned and ungovernable" edge toward lyric inflation. The ending paragraph stacks assertions ("unbreakable," "protected," "still free") rather than trusting the image. Overall momentum is strong, but closure beats carry redundant claims that dull propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The raft city carnival and graffiti-as-warning-system offer fresh specificity. The incorporation-as-resistance tactic transforms a familiar gentrification arc. However, the dual allegiance and community-versus-developers frame follow well-worn paths, and the resolution (legal preservation society, murals as folk art) arrives efficiently without a non-obvious moral calculus. The foundation stone chip and carnival lights are purposeful but not surprising. The ending's assertion of victory ("still floating, still free") leans toward wish fulfillment rather than a complex cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya as "culture shock absorber" is named early and her translating/negotiating role shapes multiple beats: decoding graffiti, helping vendors understand permits, calling the gathering, proposing the incorporation plan. Her mainland education enables the legal shield tactic. She appears in the closure scene ("stood at the edge") but her shock-absorbing function there is passive observation rather than active decision. Two gates met (setup, development); closure participation is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip is introduced early (doorframe fragment, grandmother's gift), handled mid-story (rough edge cutting thumb, held high at gathering), and returns at closure (cornerstone of community center). Three beats. The object seeds preservation motive and recurs with reweighted institutional meaning. However, its use remains symbolic anchoring rather than a constraint that alters a tactic or forecloses a path. Cost tied to the chip itself is conceptual (continuity) rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (raft-born, mainland-educated) is introduced early, named explicitly ("her dual allegiance pulled tight as rope"), and shapes Maya's role as translator and her plan to use mainland knowledge as shield. It creates the story's central friction and drives the incorporation strategy. Present in closure framing ("mainland boats approach with papers to sign, knowing she had helped"). However, the cost of choosing one world over the other is muted; both allegiances serve the same resolution without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is named once ("orderly intuitive mind decoded it instantly") and demonstrates immediate graffiti translation. The trait enables her culture-shock-absorber role but does not constrain or complicate a later choice. No visible cost or trade-off emerges from being orderly-intuitive versus another mode of processing. Functional but label-only; swappable with "quick-thinking" or "pattern-recognition skilled."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is signaled early in the title phrase "before privatization…survival meant learning to read the walls," announced at the gathering ("We reorganize tonight"), and enacted through incorporation as preservation society. The action redefines options (from resistance to legal shield) and drives the climax and resolution. Artists work immediately, murals encode the framework, community center is built. Present and active in closure. The reorganization is the story's central turn and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Graffiti as encoded message system is introduced in the second paragraph (blue dolphins, golden text "DEEP POCKETS DIVING SOON"), used repeatedly to convey warnings and meeting times ("TIDE RISES AT NOON," "SEAHORSES DANCE BACKWARDS," green paint spiral), and returns transformed in the climax (legal framework encoded in new murals) and closure ("graffiti surrounding her whispered hope"). The method shapes multiple beats and evolves from warning system to legal documentation. Mechanics matter: community reads the deeper meaning, outsiders see folk art.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is established early (perpetual lights, bobbing platforms, recycled bottles, Ferris wheel, puppet theater) and richly detailed throughout. Setting provides resources (communication lighthouse, communal kitchens, main platform for gathering) and pressures choices (developers want boutique hotels, yacht clubs). The carnival's perpetual motion and legal gray space are stakes. Present in closure (edge of floating world, lights now protected). The carnival is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before privatization" appears in the title phrase and is named repeatedly ("before privatization reached," "before privatization carved up," "Before privatization could fragment them"). The timeframe creates urgency (developers arriving, need to act now) and shapes the incorporation tactic (preempt privatization with legal status). However, no live countdown or ticking clock tightens tactics beat-by-beat; the threat remains general. Present conceptually in closure but does not alter the final moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is the story's engine: developers threaten the community, Maya decodes the warning, calls a meeting, proposes incorporation to preserve the carnival. The desire is dramatized through her movements, her plan, and the community's immediate action. Conflict between preservation and transformation is present (dual allegiance, impossible choice) but the resolution achieves both without visible sacrifice. The motivation drives all major beats and is legible in closure, though the friction between wants and costs is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named once ("her voice carrying the hopeful desperation that infected them all") and tonally present in the graffiti warnings, the community's vulnerability, and the final whispered hope. The tone modulates with pressure: threat (developers arrive), resolve (gathering and plan), cautious optimism (lights protected, still floating). Present in the closure image (watching boats approach, "knowing she had helped"). However, the ending tilts toward hope-only ("still free") without sustaining the desperation cost, flattening the emotional charge.</comment>
