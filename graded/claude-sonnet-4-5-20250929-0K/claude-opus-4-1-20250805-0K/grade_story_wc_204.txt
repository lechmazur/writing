<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moth's interiority is rendered largely through abstract metaphysical concepts ("rustling awakenings," "every possible version of herself") rather than embodied emotion or concrete contradictory impulses. The decision to uncork the bottle and print eternity lacks dramatized internal conflict; we're told she "knew she should file it properly" but no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of competing desires. The final self-scattering reads as a metaphysical gesture rather than a choice with felt human cost. The character functions as a cipher for the story's concept rather than a person under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns and whispers accrue symbolic weight toward the final compression. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the library dissolves and Moth becomes pattern—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page ("let herself scatter"). Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by ~100 words). The uncorking moment functions as a hinge but the causal chain from bottle to dissolution feels inevitable without genuine friction or a narrowing of options. The ending reconfigures the premise but lacks the visceral price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Glass Orchard Library is vividly rendered with consistent, purposeful detail: glass trees bearing book-fruit, bottled whispers arranged by frequency, the cloud sea below. The frost patterns guide Moth's letterpress work and return at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Moth's choice structurally (the library's stability depends on her filing system) and the final rupture is inseparable from the location. Strong work; environmental detail actively shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: maintain the library's perfect system versus the destabilizing bottle. The uncorking provides one meaningful turn that reweights options, and the library's dissolution follows. However, the escalation feels smooth and preordained rather than forced by protagonist agency under pressure. Moth's decision to print the compression is declared ("working quickly") but not tested by a visible trade-off or live friction. The cost—library dissolved, self scattered—is conceptual and distant rather than felt in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: perfection's fragility, the generative power of rupture, the paradox of compressing infinity. The frost-pattern motif recurs with shifted meaning at closure. "Some systems are meant to be destabilized" arrives in the final paragraph as a near-statement but is mostly earned by prior imagery. The ending offers a resonant image (Moth as frost pattern) that reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the bottled-whisper metaphor and the library's rules. Strong thematic coherence, though the final paragraph edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Moth with a consistent lyric register. Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("negotiable reality," "origami made of time") fits the metaphysical premise. Perceptual signature is present in how Moth notices frost patterns and whisper frequencies. No head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into narrator glossing ("She understood now why she had been cryptic") that tells rather than trusts image. Psychic distance is intentionally wide but consistent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening third (filing system, frost patterns, Great Softening). Clarity is mostly strong, though some metaphors stack without grounding: "eternity folded into itself like origami made of time" is vivid but abstract. Minor scaffold appears: "She knew she should file it properly" followed immediately by restating the system's purpose. The phrase "rustling awakenings" recurs without cumulative charge. No major loops or template cadence. Propulsion is steady but the final paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the peak action ("working quickly," "continued pressing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—bottled whispers, a floating library, reality made negotiable—combines familiar SFF tropes (cataloging magic, post-reality settings) without a sharp transformative angle. The letterpress-operator detail is specific but underused; Moth's seventeen years of expertise don't shape the climactic choice in a unique way. The emotional arc (perfection ruptures into freedom) follows a well-worn path. The frost-pattern motif is elegant but not unexpected. Competent synthesis, but lacks the fresh inflection or bold risk required for higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Moth is present throughout and makes the key decision to uncork the bottle and print eternity, which triggers the library's dissolution. However, her cryptic nature is told rather than demonstrated through evasive speech or riddle-like choices on the page. The character's function feels more symbolic than agential—she enacts the premise rather than wrestling with it. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure) but swappable with a generic "keeper of secrets" without major structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bottled whisper appears early (paragraph 4), is handled at the uncorking (middle), and its release drives the climactic rupture and ending. The label "The Last First Word" adds specificity. The whisper's dark, compressed quality contrasts with others in the collection, and its silence-producing effect narrows Moth's options. It is present in all three gates and causally active across multiple beats. Its properties (compression, paradox) are irreplaceable for the closure's logic. Strong integration, though the whisper itself is more vehicle than agent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" is named three times but functions primarily as a thematic label rather than a mechanic that alters tactics. The phrase describes Moth's experience ("cascade through her") but doesn't constrain or enable specific choices. It appears in setup (paragraph 2), is restated at the uncorking, and returns in the final line, satisfying lyric reprise but not causal pressure. Ornamental use; the story's logic would hold if the phrase were replaced with "threshold states" or similar. Present but not integral to choices or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The attribute is dramatized: the dark bottle "destabilizes her perfect system simply by existing," making shelves tremble and trees chime. This forces Moth's choice to uncork it, driving the middle beat and closure. The system's rupture is on-page (books fall, library sinks) with visible consequence. Present in all three gates: the system is established early, the bottle tests it mid-story, and the ending completes the destabilization. The trait is specific and irreplaceable—perfection's rigidity is the hinge. Strong integration with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rupture" is the climactic action: Moth uncorks the bottle, which "ruptured the air itself," and then prints the compression, causing the library to rupture and dissolve. The action is seeded (paragraph 2 mentions "rupturing"), executed on-page (uncorking and pressing), and defines the ending (library dissolved, Moth scattered). It is causally central and irreplaceable—no other action delivers the same closure. Present in all three gates with strong specificity. The verb's recurrence charges the final image. Essential to story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Morning frost patterns are introduced early (paragraph 2), guide Moth's letterpress technique ("her fingers moving in patterns learned from morning frost"), and return in the final image (Moth becomes frost on future windows). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter: frost maps conversations, Moth transcribes them. Present in all three gates. However, the frost's role in the climactic printing is gestural—we're told she uses "patterns learned from morning frost" but not how those patterns enable the compression. Lyric reprise is strong but causal pressure is modest. Mid-band for purposeful recurrence without decisive mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Glass Orchard Library is vividly detailed and central to every beat: its filing system is Moth's stake, the glass trees and bottled whispers populate the middle action, and its dissolution is the closure. The floating-on-clouds detail anchors the opening and returns when the library sinks. The setting is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this exact location and its properties (fragility, order, elevation). Present in all three gates with strong causal linkage. However, the clouds themselves are more scenic than functional; the library's internal rules do most of the work. Strong integration just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "after reality becomes negotiable" timeframe is established in paragraph 2 and provides thematic context (edges grew fuzzy, truth became consensus). It explains why the library exists and why Moth's work is possible. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics in the peak beat—Moth's choice to uncork the bottle would function identically in a pre-Softening world with minor edits. Present in setup but not developed or tracked through middle or closure. Functional worldbuilding but swappable with other post-reality framings. Low functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moth's desire "to compress eternity into a moment" is stated explicitly in paragraph 9 and enacted in the printing scene. The motivation is dramatized—she uncorks the bottle, sets type, makes impressions despite the library's destruction. Present in middle action and closure. However, the desire isn't seeded early; we learn Moth has been "preparing for this moment" only retroactively. The friction between this want and her duty to maintain the system is declared ("she knew she should file it properly") but not felt in scene through micro-choices or embodied hesitation. Mid-band for on-page enactment without deep internal conflict.</comment>
