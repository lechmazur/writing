<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyralei's motivation to free the echoes is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("body a living poem," "living anthology of resistance") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she is untouched and trained in seduction yet never dramatizes an on-page moment where those contradictory impulses collide in a micro-choice. The final transformation is declared ("no longer tamed") without visible cost that forecloses a path; we see no sacrifice, no relationship severed, no ability lost—only enhancement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lyralei untangles threads while absorbing echoes, building toward a tonal reconfiguration at the sanctuary door. The orientation is clear (courtyard, night, Academy), and the final image (empty sanctuary, melted snow circles) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual and external—"Academy would wake to find"—rather than a visible on-page price Lyralei herself pays. The closure reweights her stance but does not demonstrate what she loses or forecloses in the present moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary are vividly anchored with snow, starlight, and crystalline walls. The threads and echoes function as tactile micro-setting elements that constrain her unlocking process across multiple beats. The final image (melted snow circles revealing silver stones) charges the closure by showing environmental transformation tied to her act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the captured echoes to claim agency—is signaled early and tightens as each thread gives way. The accumulation of echoes does deepen pressure, but the escalation is textural rather than agonistic; no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off dramatized. The Academy's response is anticipated but off-page, and Lyralei's "technical faithfulness to vows" sidesteps rather than confronts cost, leaving the price abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of liberation versus conformity emerges through the echoes and Lyralei's act, avoiding overt moralizing. The recurring image of threads and the space "between sigh and smile" reweights meaning at closure. However, phrases like "devotion could exist without submission" and "dangerous knowledge" tip toward thematic echo rather than letting the final image speak non-literally. The ending offers resonance but leans on near-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a lyric register ("body a living poem," "cada movement a verse") that fits the elevated Academy setting. However, the diction is uniformly ornate across all beats, including high-pressure moments, without modulation; descriptions like "alarming thing about serenity" read as narratorial intrusion rather than Lyralei's perception. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular—syntax and imagery feel authorial rather than filtered through a courtesan's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("silver courtyard," "living anthology," "dialogue between past and present," "constellation patterns," "cada movement a verse") without pattern-teaching or escalation, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "her body a living poem" / "her body now a living anthology"; "writing rebellion" / "bodily poetry finally speaking." Stock metaphors ("scattered diamonds," "breaking bells") and template cadence ("She was," "She had," "She coaxed") accumulate to −0.8 total in Q7. Clarity remains intact, but momentum suffers from ornamental density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The courtesan-bound-by-chastity premise and rebellion-via-forbidden-archive plot follow familiar templates (magical academy, stolen knowledge, liberation). The "between sigh and smile" frame offers a fresh verbal hook, but the emotional and plot arc—trained seductress defies institution, frees suppressed voices—does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity. Derivative premise adjustment −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lyralei appears throughout, drives the unlocking, and her choice to open the sanctuary is the story's hinge. However, "chaste courtesan" as a trait is told rather than tested on-page; no moment dramatizes the tension between seduction training and celibacy vow. Her Academy paradox is setup and thematic but does not constrain a mid-story choice with visible cost. Present in closure (she opens the sanctuary and becomes "no longer tamed"), but the chastity element itself is ornamental to that act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced early (paragraph 4), its crystalline walls and trapped echoes shape Lyralei's goal across multiple beats, and the sanctuary door swinging open is the story's climactic turn. The "under starlight" detail recurs (opening image, sanctuary pulsing with trapped starlight) and the final melted snow circles reflect starlight, creating a purposeful reprise. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability high (no generic vault would carry the same optical/echo resonance). Reaches high 7s on beat involvement and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is introduced early (paragraph 4: "harvest of echoes"), directly names the Academy's practice, and becomes the story's central action: Lyralei absorbs echoes from the threads and releases thousands from the sanctuary. The concept shapes her tactics (untangling to harvest) and the ending (echoes pour out, she plants them in herself). Strong setup, middle involvement (absorbing memories), and closure presence (echoes as payload). Reaches mid-6s on causal necessity and thematic integration; "harvest" verb is used literally and metaphorically, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is told repeatedly ("body a living poem," "movements became a dialogue," "body move with greater fluidity," "bodily poetry finally speaking") but never constrains or enables a specific on-page choice with cost. The trait is descriptive label rather than dramatized capability; we never see a moment where her movement-language solves a problem or fails under pressure. Present across beats but ornamental; swappable with "graceful" or "expressive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unlock" is the story's spine: Lyralei's goal from paragraph 2, her method across paragraphs 3–7, and the sanctuary door "swung open" is the climactic turn. The action is irreplaceable (no synonym like "open" or "breach" carries the same thread/knot specificity). Strong setup, sustained middle development (each thread unraveled is a micro-unlock), and definitive closure participation. Reaches low 7s on indispensability; removing "unlock" would require rewriting the entire tactical layer.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is introduced early (paragraph 2: "fingers working through silken threads"), its mechanics detailed in paragraph 3 (feeling tension, cascade logic), and recurs in paragraph 7 (final threads requiring understanding). The method is specific and non-generic, shaping her approach across multiple beats. However, the threads could be replaced with locks, wards, or seals with modest edits; the untangling metaphor is vivid but not irreplaceable to the story's logic. Solid setup and middle work, contributing to closure; mid-6s for beat involvement and moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard is anchored in the opening line, recurs as the action's location, and the final image ("silver courtyard where conformity came to die") closes the frame. Snow detail is used actively: "melted in perfect circles" reveals silver stones that charge the ending. The setting is more than backdrop—it functions as stage and symbol—but does not constrain Lyralei's tactical choices (the unlocking could occur in any courtyard). Strong setup and closure reprise with lyric reweighting; mid-6s for thematic resonance without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears in paragraph 6 as a metaphorical duration ("That infinitesimal pause contained lifetimes") and is reprised in the final paragraph. However, it does not function as a live ticking clock; the story spans one night without urgency tied to elapsed time. The timeframe is poetic framing rather than pressure device; no choice is accelerated or complicated by the sigh-to-smile window. Present in setup and closure but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lyralei's desire to "defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated in paragraph 6 ("systematically destroyed the Academy's most sacred protection") and motivates the sanctuary-opening. The piece tells us she seeks freedom but does not dramatize friction between wanting liberation and fearing consequences; her resolve is untroubled throughout. The motivation is clear and drives the plot, but lacks on-page conflict between desire and cost. Mid-6s for causal presence without contradictory pull.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named in paragraph 6 and embodied in Lyralei's "composed, almost ethereal calm" while destroying protections. The tone is coherent and intentional—elegant diction sustains calm even during rebellion—but does not modulate with escalation; the register remains uniformly ornate from opening to close. The final image maintains the serene-yet-revolutionary tone, charging closure, but the static mood across all beats limits tonal arc. Mid-5s for coherence without dynamic range.</comment>
