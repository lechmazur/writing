<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradiction ("patience had always been Marcus's greatest strength" tells rather than showing through micro-choices under pressure). His three-year wait is described but not dramatized with visible internal conflict or cost until the escape itself. The final paragraph's "staggering grace" and "weight of ten thousand possible futures" slides into elevated abstraction that doesn't feel earned by prior particular struggle. Motivation is coherent but remains largely uncontested—no moment where his resolve wavers or competes with a live alternative desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (carnival captive, redemption center). Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative texture (piano-key decoding, seed scattering). Closure is a Decisive Change (chain snaps, Marcus leaves with seeds) but the cost is conceptual and future-oriented rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path in the final beat, only promise. The piano-key GPS sequence feels like a puzzle insert rather than organically discovered pressure; it arrives and solves without prior setup or failed attempt. One meaningful tightening (chain breaks) but the stakes remain abstract throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The redemption center is vividly seeded (dusty stuffed animals, ring toss games, old piano) and supplies resources that enable escape. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains Marcus's movement (chains allow "just enough") and he harvests from specific carnival objects. However, the environment doesn't force a tactical choice or dilemma—it's a backdrop and a supply depot rather than an active pressure. The arrow's arrival through "a broken window" and the piano in "the corner" are functional but not charged with specificity that would push this into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: liberate seeds to counter the Drought Authority. One tightening (chain snaps after filing) but the escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—the arrow arrives by external gift, the piano code is passively decoded, the chain breaks when worked. No on-page reversal or moment where Marcus must choose between competing goods; the path from captivity to liberation is linear. Cost is deferred (he will plant seeds) rather than paid in the closure beat. The Authority is declared but never dramatized as immediate opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of resilience versus control emerges through seed-vault particulars and "patient rebellion." The closing image of scattered seeds "beginning their slow, inexorable push toward light" offers resonance. However, the final two paragraphs over-articulate theme ("redemption itself," "make the desert bloom with patient rebellion") where image alone would suffice. The arrow's seed-fletching is a purposeful callback but borders on symbolic convenience. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity—the Authority is flatly oppressive, Marcus unambiguously heroic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marcus. Diction is mostly controlled but drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "staggering grace," "weight of ten thousand possible futures," "forest" from "a tiny act." The piano-key decoding sequence ("each key corresponded to a number based on its position from middle C") reads more like puzzle exposition than Marcus's embodied thought process. Filter verbs ("he'd been," "he thought") are present but not intrusive. Voice is competent but not character-particular—could describe many liberators in many settings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Sentence rhythm varies but slips into template cadence in the harvest sequence: "From the giant stuffed elephant... From the ring toss games... From the baseball pitch booth." The final two paragraphs loop thematically: paragraph penultimate declares "redemption itself" and "whispered gardens," then the final paragraph restates "secret garden at a time" and "slow, inexorable push toward light." "Staggering grace" in the penultimate line elevates diction without embodied justification. Information density is adequate but the closing beats over-explain rather than trusting image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Seed-vault-as-carnival-prizes is a fresh specific but the larger frame—lone captive liberator, oppressive authority, hidden hope—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piano-key GPS code and seed-fletched arrow are clever touches but feel engineered for the puzzle rather than inevitable from character or world. The Drought Authority and underground resistance remain abstract conveniences. Emotional arc (patient captive waits, then escapes with purpose) works but could transfer to many premises with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and makes the key choice to harvest and leave. Setup early, middle beats (decoding, breaking chain, harvesting), and closure participation all present. His decisions alter tactics (from passive study to active harvest) and the ending depends on his liberation. Cost is conceptual (he becomes "forever a liberator") rather than a visible trade-off on the page, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Arrow appears in opening paragraph, used to break the chain in the middle, and its fletching crumbles to release seeds that "herald his escape route." Three beats, causal role, and closure linkage. However, it arrives as an external gift from the resistance rather than through Marcus's agency, and the strange fletching feels like symbolic convenience—why would the resistance craft an arrow from seeds if they're already underground and active? Swappable with another tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Seed vault is the story's engine: Marcus guards it, the Authority fears destroying it, and he harvests from it to complete his mission. Setup immediate, drives middle action (identifying teddy bears, ring toss, baseball booth), and shapes closure (scattered seeds, his burden of "ten thousand possible futures"). Removing it would collapse the plot. The vault is handled across multiple beats and its contents dictate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is declared ("patience had always been Marcus's greatest strength") and told through summary ("Three years of studying his captors' routines") but not dramatized with visible cost or tradeoff on the page. No moment where patience constrains a hasty option or strategy forces a sacrifice. The trait is label-only rather than embodied in a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Impede" is conceptual rather than physical: Marcus impedes the Authority by seeding resistance. Setup and closure participation present (he will "impede the Authority's sterile tomorrow"). However, the action is future-oriented and not tested on the page—no scene where he actively blocks or disrupts. The verb could swap for "undermine" or "resist" with minimal edits. Middle involvement is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Piano-key decoding is signaled early ("pattern of keys someone had left pressed down") and solved in the middle beat. The mechanics are explained and the resulting GPS coordinates shape his mission. However, the method feels like a puzzle insert—no failed attempt, no cost to solving it, and it doesn't constrain later action. Removing it would require minor rewrites but not structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Redemption center is the sole location, houses the vault, and supplies the objects Marcus harvests (elephant, ring toss, baseball booth). Setup immediate, middle beats involve spatial choreography (piano in corner, shelves), and closure echoes it ("stood empty of its treasures"). The setting enables and constrains—Marcus's chains limit movement, the piano holds the code, the prizes contain seeds. Removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" is metaphorical (barrier between scarcity and abundance) rather than a literal timeframe. Dawn approaches in the final third, providing mild urgency, but no ticking clock shapes tactics. The phrase appears only in one sentence and doesn't tighten decisions or create visible time pressure. Could be removed or replaced with "when freedom comes" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Plant resilience in dry soil" is the explicit motivation, stated twice and driving the harvest and departure. Setup clear, middle action (filling pockets, fashioning carrier), and closure (first seed falls, he walks with "carnival-prize burden"). The desire is told more than dramatized—no scene where planting competes with another want or where the cost of carrying seeds forces a sacrifice. Functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as description rather than pervasive tone. The prose throughout is earnest and declarative, not modulating into grace under pressure. The word "staggering" suggests burden or overwhelming weight, which could fit the seed-carrying image, but "grace" implies elegance or ease that the prior struggle doesn't earn. Tone is static and mission-focused rather than charged or shifting.</comment>
