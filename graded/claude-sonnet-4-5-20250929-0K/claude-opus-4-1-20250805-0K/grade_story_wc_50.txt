<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent—documenting temporal wonder through broken mechanisms. Her peripheral observation technique and grandmother's influence provide concrete character grounding. The final choice to leave the mechanism broken and document its malfunction shows earned understanding with visible cost (abandoning conventional repair). Internal contradiction between her locksmith training and her embrace of productive failure creates authentic tension, though the stakes remain largely intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observations across multiple cave visits, building density through layered reflections and pre-echoes until the final realization that "damage sometimes revealed deeper mechanisms than perfection ever could." Closure is Conceptual Repricing—Mara's decision to preserve the blueprint of malfunction rather than repair reweights her entire profession with clear conceptual cost (rejecting her role as fixer). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The wounded season provides a coherent temporal frame, and causality holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern with its quartz veins, natural camera obscura effect, and shifting acoustics directly enables Mara's method—studying reflections at different angles and times. The pool of groundwater and eastern wall function as tools that constrain her observation technique. The cave's temporal properties create the pre-echoes that teach repair through future memory. Setting is not ornamental; it supplies the mechanism for the central action and charges the final image of leaving the timer "in its marble cradle."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly established: understanding and documenting the temporal mechanism. Pressure accumulates through the wounded season's approaching end, which will heal the valley's temporal distortions and close Mara's observation window. The key deepening occurs when she realizes the mechanism "revealed more than it ever had while functional"—shifting from repair to documentation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she chooses not to fix it, foreclosing her professional purpose. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulating observations: wonder preserved not through capture but through "documenting the precise shape of its escape." The grandmother's music-box technique (listening to silence) plants the seed; the broken timer's revelation pays it off without stating a moral. The final image—leaving the mechanism broken while storing documentation in her workshop cellar—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how wonder and reason coexist. The wounded season metaphor layers temporal confusion with emotional vulnerability without becoming heavy-handed. No thematic echo or moralizing in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Mara's perceptual signature (peripheral observation, listening to silence) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches her technical expertise without becoming clinical: "tumblers," "calibrations," "temporal architecture." The phrase "birdsong arrived seconds before the birds themselves moved" demonstrates controlled lyricism that serves the temporal distortion premise. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance remains intimate but not intrusive, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong imagery: "veins of quartz that spiraled through limestone walls like frozen lightning," "moments that hadn't quite happened yet." Rhythm modulates appropriately—longer contemplative sentences in observation beats, tighter syntax during the realization. Minor scaffold appears in "She'd learned" constructions (appears three times), creating slight template cadence. Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or clarity issues. The figurative language occasionally clusters but remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—reverse-engineering a broken temporal mechanism through reflections rather than direct observation—offers a fresh synthesis of locksmith craft and temporal fantasy. The peripheral observation method (inherited from grandmother's music-box technique) transforms the standard "magical artifact" trope through specific professional practice. The choice to document malfunction rather than repair subverts the genre expectation of restoration. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and dense technical-lyric fusion heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The wounded season metaphor and pre-echo mechanics feel particular to this story rather than generic fantasy elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout, present in opening and closure. Her key decision—to document rather than repair—drives the ending and reweights her professional identity with cost. She makes multiple on-page choices: positioning mirrors, sketching observations, adjusting the gear "not to fix it but to document its broken state perfectly." Setup, development, and closure participation all present. The reflective mode is essential to the accumulative structure and her peripheral observation method constrains how she interacts with the mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timer mechanism is introduced in paragraph three, appears in at least four distinct beats (initial finding, mirror study, noon acoustics shift, final gear adjustment), and anchors the closure choice. Its broken state enables the story's central discovery—that damage reveals deeper architecture. The mechanism's reflection showing "different configurations depending on the angle" directly enables the method. Causally active throughout and essential to the final image of leaving it "in its marble cradle." High irreplaceability: the story's logic depends on this specific object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echo-harvesting is introduced early ("mechanism seemed to harvest echoes"), shapes the central conflict (the valley's "confusion of cause and effect"), and determines tactics (Mara must study pre-echoes to understand repair). The pre-echoes create the noon acoustics shift where "sound began arriving before its source." The concept reappears transformed in the ending: echoes will "realign with their sources" when the season heals. This core concept structures causality, provides pressure (the wounded season will end), and charges the closure. Not merely thematic—it changes available options throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Peripheral focus is introduced in paragraph six ("worked peripherally, never focusing directly") with cost: she cannot examine the device directly. This trait enables her grandmother-taught technique and constrains her method to reflections and angles. It determines her tactical approach across multiple beats and connects to the ending insight about wonder being preserved "not through capturing it, but through documenting the precise shape of its escape." The attribute drives action with visible methodological cost—direct observation is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is signaled in paragraph three, drives the mirror-positioning beats and sketch documentation, and motivates the final realization. However, the reverse-engineering itself produces observation rather than decisive intervention—it's a frame for accumulation rather than a pivot point. The action shapes tactics (studying reflections rather than touching the device) and appears in closure context (the "blueprint of malfunction"), but could arguably be replaced with "documenting" without major structural loss. Solid integration across beats but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reflection-angle study is introduced in paragraph four ("set up her mirrors at calculated angles"), mechanics elaborated in paragraph five (eastern wall shows backward gears, pool shows future repairs), and determines the noon discovery beat. The method is inseparable from the cave setting and timer properties. It appears in the closure context ("each angle of reflection became a note in an instruction manual written backward"). Setup, development, and closure participation all present with high specificity—removing this exact method would collapse the story's observational logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced in the opening line, its natural camera obscura effect enables the reflection method (paragraph five), and it supplies the final image ("marble cradle"). The cave's acoustics create the pre-echo phenomenon at noon. Spatial properties (eastern wall, groundwater pool, cave mouth) function as tools that constrain observation angles. The setting is causally active across multiple beats and irreplaceable—the temporal distortion and reflection opportunities depend on this specific environment. Charges the ending with "leaving the timer mechanism in its marble cradle."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The wounded season is introduced in paragraph one, provides the temporal frame ("three months ago"), creates urgency (season "would end soon"), and determines the mechanism's broken state (it "tried to harvest too much" during this season). The timeframe shapes the valley's temporal confusion and gives Mara a closing window. However, exact temporal pressure is loose—no scene-level clock tightens decisions beat by beat. Present in setup and closure context but functions more as backdrop than immediate constraint. Solid causal role but not high-urgency pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "store wonder" appears explicitly in paragraph eight and is reprised in the ending ("store these observations in the cellar of her workshop"). It drives the final choice to document rather than repair, with visible cost—she rejects conventional fixing. The desire is tested by the approaching season's end and paid off in the closing image of remembering "how damage sometimes revealed deeper mechanisms than perfection ever could." Setup, development, and closure participation present. Dramatized through the documentation choice with clear friction between professional duty (repair) and this deeper goal.</comment>
