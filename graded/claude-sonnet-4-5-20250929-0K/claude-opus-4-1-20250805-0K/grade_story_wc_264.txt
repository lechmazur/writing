<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kess demonstrates consistent motivation (protecting cargo, cultivating sparks) and her skill at charming wave functions is established and used under pressure. Internal life is present through her relationship to the frozen clock and the lullaby, though emotion tends toward poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The confrontation choice feels earned, but the pirate's threat and Kess's response resolve too smoothly—she sings, reality "chooses her version," and he disperses without visible cost or struggle that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—quantum imagery and lullaby fragments build pressure toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The pirate encounter provides a micro-turn, and the ending reweights the frozen clock from symbol of broken reality to tool of possibility ("when the world finally chose which version of itself to become"). Cost is conceptual and felt in the image of tending "dreams that didn't exist yet," though the pirate's defeat lacks visible friction or forfeiture that would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune is vividly rendered with phosphorescent sand, quantum blooms, and helical grain-dances that constrain Kess's awareness and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through a post-catastrophe lens (smoke three years ago, divergent archives, probability fog) and feels purposeful rather than ornamental. The train, dune, and blooms provide spatial choreography that remains coherent throughout. The micro-setting (dune + clock) charges the closure image when the dune "sang along in harmonics that only the dreamless could hear."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: guard the cargo and ensure sparks reach the unlit corners. The pirate's arrival tightens pressure, and Kess's lullaby-charm creates a micro-reversal where the container shifts into a parallel probability. However, the resolution unfolds without visible cost—Kess sings, reality complies, the pirate fades. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page; the tactic succeeds cleanly. One meaningful tightening is present, but the ease of victory and lack of trade-off caps the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from quantum fragmentation, dreamlessness, and the cultivation of future possibility without direct statement. The frozen clock, fractured lullaby, and "sparks that didn't exist yet" cohere into a meditation on hope and continuity after collapse. The final image—"a fractured lullaby for a fractured world learning to bloom again"—reweights prior material and resists tidy resolution. Subtext operates in the pirate's accusation ("impossible" vs. "necessary") and in Kess's role as tender of potential rather than restorer of the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinctive lyric-philosophical register ("reality's weave," "probability waves," "quantum entanglement") that suits the speculative premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("existence ended," "wave functions collapsing") that flattens immediacy under pressure. The pirate's dialogue ("dreamless one," "you're cultivating something impossible") and Kess's reply feel slightly expository rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent but leans more toward ornamental poeticism than character-specific idiom in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is imagistically dense with purposeful rhythm variation ("petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once," "electric blue, singing petals"). Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance effectively. However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "quantum flowers that existed in multiple places simultaneously, petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once" restates the same idea; "divergent archives, those scattered repositories where humanity's memories had fled" is immediate gloss. Template cadence appears in the pirate encounter ("his form flickering," "his voice echoing," "his fingers phase-shifting"). Figurative density is high but occasionally muddles clarity ("probability fog," "quantum foam," "probability clouds" cluster without distinct function). Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalypse, quantum superposition, and lullaby as protective charm offers a fresh angle on memory-preservation narratives. Kess's role as "dreamless one" tending future sparks rather than past certainties transforms the guardian archetype. The frozen clock at midnight and the train carrying consciousness avoid stock imagery through specificity of function (quantum entanglement, archives that diverged). The pirate encounter and resolution feel somewhat familiar—charm succeeds, antagonist disperses—but the quantum mechanics framing and the closing image of cultivation rather than restoration provide enough transformation to avoid derivative capping.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kess is present throughout and her choices drive two beats: checking the manifest and singing the lullaby to protect cargo. Her decision to charm wave functions at the climax alters the pirate's ability to steal, though the mechanics rely more on the lullaby and quantum rules than on internal conflict. She is the sole decision-maker and the ending hinges on her commitment to cultivation, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. Cost is conceptual (tending what "didn't exist yet") rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chess clock appears in three beats: intro (breast pocket, frozen at midnight, belonged to the Archive), absent in middle action, and final paragraph (she winds the key that doesn't turn). It charges the opening and closing with the image of time in superposition, and its quantum entanglement is named, but it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. The clock's meaning shifts from broken artifact to symbol of "anything might still become possible," a lyric reprise that reweights but lacks causal pressure in the pirate encounter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The divergent archive is established early (split into infinite versions, repositories where memories fled) and shapes the world logic and Kess's role as freight guard. The cargo—consciousness, archived sleep, crystallized hope—exists because the archive diverged. The concept enables the stakes (protect cargo for unlit corners) and the pirate's motive (steal memories to sell in markets of never-was). It does not directly constrain Kess's tactics in the confrontation but provides the conceptual infrastructure for the entire plot and closure image of cultivation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once" describes quantum blooms in the opening and is echoed in the cargo's existence "in a parallel probability" after Kess's charm. The attribute is named and illustrated but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as descriptive flavor for the world's quantum instability rather than a trait that forces a trade-off or enables a unique tactic. Late arrival in the pirate beat and lack of causal pressure cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Charm the wave functions" is signaled early ("learned to charm," "sweet-talk reality into brief moments of solidity") and becomes the decisive action in the pirate encounter: Kess sings the lullaby, reality "chose her version," and the container shifts. This action is specific to Kess's skill and irreplaceable—without it, the cargo is vulnerable. The charm shapes both the middle stakes (why she can protect) and the climax. Cost is light (no visible struggle or price paid), preventing a higher score, but causal role across setup, development, and closure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Wave functions are named in the opening ("wave functions collapsing momentarily into solid form") and middle ("charm the wave functions around the train"). The method is Kess's primary tool and shapes her tactics: she must stabilize quantum instability to guard cargo. In the climax, she charms the wave functions with the lullaby, causing reality to "choose her version." The mechanics matter and are signaled early, driving two beats and the resolution. Specificity is present but the ease of success and lack of visible cost or constraint limits the score to the low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The glowing dune is present in every major beat: opening description, nightly performance (sand grains dancing, blooms opening), the pirate materializes on or near it, and the closing image where "the phosphorescent dune sang along." The dune provides atmosphere and continuity, and its blooms respond to Kess's lullaby, but it does not supply a resource or constraint that alters tactics—Kess could guard the train elsewhere. Its strongest role is charging the final image with the harmonics "only the dreamless could hear," a lyric payoff that reweights but lacks mid-scene causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "three years since the last forest burned" anchors backstory and Kess's dreamlessness, establishing the post-catastrophe setting. It appears in the opening and colors the world's quantum instability but does not tighten decisions or tactics in the present scene. The frozen clock at midnight gestures toward time's collapse, but no live countdown or temporal pressure shapes Kess's choices during the pirate encounter. The timeframe is atmospheric and contextual, satisfying setup but lacking development or closure participation with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kess's motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated directly in dialogue and enacted in her role as freight guard. It drives her confrontation with the pirate ("These sparks aren't for taking," "seeds for the unlit corners") and the closing image of tending quantum gardens. The desire is consistent and shapes the dominant stake, satisfying setup, development, and closure. However, it is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost—Kess articulates the goal rather than struggling with competing wants or a price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fractured lullaby appears in four beats: Kess's voice carries "broken rhythm of old lullabies" in the opening, she hums it during the dune's performance, sings it louder to charm wave functions in the climax, and the closing image names "a fractured lullaby for a fractured world learning to bloom again." Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (hum → sing louder), and charges the final image with resonance. The lullaby's brokenness mirrors the world's quantum fragmentation, and its use as both emotional anchor and tactical tool integrates tone with action and theme across all three gates.</comment>
