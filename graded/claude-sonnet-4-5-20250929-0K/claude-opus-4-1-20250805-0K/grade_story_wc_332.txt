<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (searching vs. waiting; spending her own capacity for feeling) is embodied in concrete actions—positioning the palette, setting it down. The grandmother's deathbed moment anchors motivation effectively. However, the protagonist's emotional progression through seven years of searching feels summarized rather than dramatically tested on the page; the pivotal choice arrives without on-page struggle that would earn the renunciation. The final insight ("Some longings were meant to remain ciphers") reads as slightly over-articulated wisdom rather than emerging strictly from embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara sets down the palette, forecloses the resurrection path, and shifts from searching to waiting—visible cost in the dissolving figure and her own emptied capacity. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a single decisive deepening at the smallest island. Orientation anchors quickly (floating library, archipelago, dawn). The causality from grandmother's deathbed gift through seven years to this final island is motivated by ellipsis but the seven-year span lacks intermediate dramatized friction to ground the final renunciation's weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archipelago, dawn light, glass palette, and skiff constrain Mara's movements and methods throughout. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: molten copper water, salt-stained books, morning mist interacting with refracted light. The smallest island serves as the closure location with purposeful geographic selection. However, the floating library and individual islands remain lightly sketched; spatial choreography of the rowing and palette positioning is clear but the islands themselves lack tactile specificity that would deepen the sense of place under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give form to grandmother's lost love vs. preserve her own capacity for feeling—is signaled early and tightens at the smallest island. The warming leaving her chest is a legible on-page cost. The figure's extension and Mara's choice to set down the palette narrow options with visible consequence. However, the escalation relies on a single pivot rather than compounding pressure; the seven years of prior searching are summarized, so the final choice feels somewhat abrupt despite its thematic clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the glass palette, the dissolving figure, and the shift from vitalization to recognition without overt thesis. The final image—"luminous in their absence"—resonates as a non-literal answer to whether lost love should be resurrected. Subtext operates in the figure's sad, understanding smile and the islands' grateful whispers. Minor slip: "Some longings were meant to remain ciphers, beautiful in their incompleteness" edges toward direct thematic statement in the closing paragraph, though it grows from prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance; perceptual signature is consistent (light, salt-stained pages, whispers as radio signal). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("molten copper," "luminous absence"). The camera-as-prop and "not filled with pigments but with fragments of colored glass" deliver purposeful detail. Slight register drift: "vitalized memories" and "cipher, encoded in the very landscape" read slightly elevated for the voice established in the opening, though they remain within the narrator's conceptual range and do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor effectively. Information density is high: the palette description, the cover-story photography, the grandmother's deathbed gift all do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "whispers grew stronger…not in volume but in clarity" is echoed by "the islands' whispers seemed softer" without new pressure; "luminous absence" and "luminous in their absence" repeat the key phrase in adjacent lines of the final paragraph. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the closing moralizing edges toward scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of librarian, light-painting, and encoded landscape memory offers a fresh angle. The glass palette as prism (not pigment) and the choice between resurrection and recognition avoid template outcomes. However, the "lost love never spoken" premise and the grandmother's deathbed gift to complete her unlived dream sit close to familiar romantic-legacy templates; the transformation is solid but not fully surprising. The piece commits to its premise without hedging, and the final renunciation carries risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's graveyard shift at the floating library establishes her odd hours and isolates her for the dawn work. Her choice to work nights enables the palette work and her final decision to set it down alters her trajectory (searching to waiting). Present in setup, middle constraint (enables daily access to islands), and payoff (her return to the library after the choice). Causal pressure is moderate; the librarian role could be swapped for another solitary occupation with minor edits, but the book-tending and "odd hours among the books" frame her solitary search effectively.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The palette appears in the deathbed gift, is handled and positioned at the smallest island, and set down at the climax. Its unique property (glass fragments that split light, not pigments) constrains method and is irreplaceable. Present across setup, middle use, and payoff. The setting-down forecloses the vitalization path with visible cost. Strong integration, though the palette itself does not evolve or accumulate new meaning beyond its initial function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cipher framing—grandmother's longing encoded in the archipelago landscape—shapes Mara's seven-year search and her final recognition that some longings should remain incomplete. It defines the dominant stake (decode and resurrect vs. leave as cipher). Present in setup (grandmother's explanation), middle (each island holds a fragment), and payoff (recognition replaces resurrection). Moderate causal pressure; the concept could be replaced with "fragments of memory" without major structural change, though "cipher" adds thematic specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Painting with light using the glass palette as prism is the sole method by which Mara can vitalize memories. It constrains her to dawn timing and specific positioning. She performs the action at the smallest island and the refracted light coalesces the figure on the page. The attribute is irreplaceable and drives the middle and climactic beats. However, the mechanics (how light becomes form) remain somewhat abstract; specificity of cost or tradeoff in the light-painting itself is light.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vitalizing memories is the core action: Mara has done it for seven years and performs it at the smallest island where the figure materializes. The choice to halt vitalization by setting down the palette is the climactic reversal. Present in setup (established practice), middle (attempted at closure scene), and payoff (renounced with visible cost—her own capacity leaving). High causal pressure; removing vitalization removes the entire plot. The action is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is explicitly named as the cover story; the camera is a prop she carries but never uses. The method that actually matters is the glass-palette light refraction at dawn. The dawn timing (sunrise) is causally essential to the vitalization mechanics. Present in setup (cover story explained), middle (positions palette at dawn), and payoff (dawn light coalesces the figure). Moderate integration: the "photography" label is ornamental, but the sunrise timing itself constrains and enables.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The archipelago's scattered islands hold different memory fragments; Mara rows to a different island each morning and saves the smallest for the seventh year. The whispers grow clearer as she approaches. The setting provides spatial structure (library to islands) and thematic charge (fragments encoded in landscape). Present in setup, middle (selection of smallest island), and payoff (whispers soften, grateful). The islands constrain her method and the final island selection matters, though individual island characteristics remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "hush of improbable beginnings when night surrenders to day" anchors the vitalization to the dawn transition window. Mara must position the palette precisely as the sun breaches the horizon. The phrase recurs thematically in the closing (waiting for her own improbable beginning). Present in setup (dawn timing established), middle (sun breach moment), and payoff (thematic echo). Moderate constraint: the dawn window tightens timing, though the exact duration is not tracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to capture/give form to the runaway dream drives Mara's seven-year search and her final choice. The grandmother's deathbed command ("Find it, give it back its shape") establishes it; the choice between completing vitalization and keeping her own heart open dramatizes the friction. Present in setup, middle (seven years of search), and payoff (recognition replaces capture). Strong causal pressure; the motivation is indispensable. Minor deduction: the seven-year span is told rather than shown, so the weight of renunciation relies on summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Luminous absence as tone is established early ("the luminous absence that had driven her") and returns in the closing ("luminous in their absence"). The tone coheres through the refracted light imagery, the dissolving figure, and the sad understanding. It modulates appropriately: searching urgency to recognition calm. The final image is charged by this tone. Present in setup (absence driving search), middle (figure materializing from light/mist), and payoff (closure sentence). Strong thematic and tonal integration; slight over-reliance on the phrase itself in the final paragraph.</comment>
