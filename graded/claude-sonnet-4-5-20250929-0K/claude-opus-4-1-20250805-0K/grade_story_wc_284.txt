<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margot's motivations are clear—she seeks resolution after betrayal—and her final choice to deliver the folder feels earned by the scene's pressure. However, her interiority relies heavily on retrospective summary ("Three years of running, hiding, surviving") rather than embodied contradiction in the present moment. Viktor's motivations are functional but he exists primarily as an exposition delivery device; his emotions are asserted ("wind and worry") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The closure choice forecloses a path but lacks visible internal friction; Margot moves from anger to acceptance too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors clearly (Margot, Zephyr Bluff, present night) within the opening paragraph. The plot delivers a meaningful tightening: Viktor's revelation that the burn was intentional reconfigures Margot's three-year premise, and her decision to deliver the folder constitutes an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost (choosing renewed danger over continued hiding). However, the escalation relies heavily on exposition dialogue rather than dramatized pressure; the snow-codes and pillbox mechanics are revealed rather than tested, and Viktor's appearance feels conveniently timed rather than causally earned by Margot's choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bluff setting provides strong atmospheric grounding with purposeful detail: frozen rock, accumulated snow forming codes, mist as obscuring curtain. The snow-codes function as micro-setting, constraining Margot's route and method of discovery, thus shaping one key choice. However, spatial choreography weakens when Viktor "emerges from the mist below, climbing steadily upward" while Margot simultaneously "followed the trail of snow-codes down the bluff's eastern face"—their relative positions and movements blur. The setting charges the final image ("silver-hushed dawn") but environmental details don't constrain the climactic conversation itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Margot can trust Viktor and reclaim agency—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Viktor reveals the burn was intentional, reframing three years of exile. However, escalation relies on exposition rather than protagonist pressure: Viktor delivers folder, explanations, and choice; Margot receives rather than wrestles. The resolution ("I'll deliver it") involves agency but no visible trade-off or live cost on the page; the decision feels inevitable rather than fraught. Coincidence (Viktor's arrival at the exact coordinates) complicates setup but the lack of interim reversals or tactical choices under duress keeps pressure theoretical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-exile emerges organically from the pillbox, snow-codes, and "no longer burned but forged" final image. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate beat: "everything broken could be mended—or at least transformed into something useful" veers toward stated thesis. The final image—Margot descending through melting codes—offers a resonant answer to the central question (can trust be rebuilt) without demanding a single reading. "Unused courage" as recurring motif reweights effectively from mystery to self-understanding. The "silver hush" operates as both tone anchor and thematic vehicle for clarity emerging from obscurity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; psychic distance is controlled and appropriate. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-particular—phrases like "the whole broken machinery of nations and secrets looking small and fixable" feel elevated beyond Margot's operational lexicon under stress. Dialogue is functional and advances plot but lacks strong subtext or character-specific rhythm; Viktor's lines ("We needed someone completely outside") read more as exposition than goal-driven speech. The prose texture is consistent but not distinctive—diction defaults to competent espionage-register without idiosyncratic coloring. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sentences generally advance story without padding. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several text artifacts diminish precision: "prudently daring in her approach" is a forced attribute insertion; "vouchsafed her extraction papers" uses an archaic register that clashes with operational urgency; "the tilt of the earth toward spring" repeats verbatim as bookend without evolution. Paraphrase loop: "watching him disappear into the mist, then began her own descent" / "The snow-codes were already melting" recaps rather than advances. Minor filter-verb stack in the exposition middle ("He reached...pulled out...set") doesn't obscure but dulls immediacy. No major loops or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The burned-spy premise follows a recognizable template (betrayed agent, secret meeting, redemptive mission) and the piece does not fully transform it through unexpected moral calculus or world logic. Specific details—GRU field code in snow, dual pillboxes as cipher—provide fresh texture. The emotional arc (anger → understanding → renewed purpose) is executed clearly but predictably. The mist-and-bluff setting offers atmospheric freshness yet the core turn (burn was protective, not punitive) is a familiar espionage beat. Risk-taking is modest: the piece commits to its premise without bold structural or perspectival choices that would heighten stakes beyond genre competence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margot (burned spy) is present throughout, drives the approach and final decision to deliver the folder, and her choice alters tactics from hiding to action. She appears in setup, middle discovery, and closure. Causal pressure: her status as burned enables Viktor's plan and her final choice forecloses her ghost-existence. Cost is felt (renewed danger) though not heavily dramatized. The element is essential but somewhat passive in the middle section where Viktor dominates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pillbox appears in three beats: arrival (setup), Viktor's reveal of its coordinates (middle), and dual pillboxes at closure. Its engraved coordinates constrain Margot's route and enable the meet. However, the morphine tablet inside is noted as "unused, unnecessary"—a wasted specificity that doesn't return. The second pillbox introduces new function (account numbers) rather than reweighting the first. The object is functional but not indispensable; a letter could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" shapes stakes explicitly: Margot came "to fix what was broken," and the ending asserts "everything broken could be mended." The concept motivates her approach and colors the thematic closure, but it operates more as frame than on-page pressure—the folder-delivery mission doesn't require "fixing" per se, just delivery. Middle beats don't dramatize repair attempts; the concept is echoed thematically rather than tested tactically. Present in setup and closure; constrains one choice (to come at all).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" appears once as label in the approach beat ("She moved along the cliff edge, prudently daring in her approach") but doesn't constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a tactical trade-off—no moment shows caution and boldness in friction. Late setup (second page), ornamental use, no middle development, no closure reprise. Swappable with "careful" or "cautious."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (Viktor vouchsafed extraction papers before the burn) is backstory-only; the term reappears in dialogue summary but doesn't drive an on-page turn. The past act motivates Margot's willingness to meet (setup signal), but no present beat hinges on the vouchsafing itself—the folder and new offer create forward pressure. Summary-only use, no middle dramatization, not present in closure. Functionally replaceable with "promised" or "arranged."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Snow-codes appear in setup (coordinates on pillbox), middle discovery (Cyrillic letters in crevices guide Margot down the bluff), and closure (melting codes). The method shapes Margot's route and provides one causal turn (she follows the trail to Viktor). Specificity is high—GRU field code is irreplaceable texture—but the codes don't constrain a choice under pressure; they guide rather than test. Present across all three beats with early signal and closure reprise that reweights (transience of the message).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist provides the meet location, constrains access (cliff-edge approach), and charges the final image (descent through dispersing mist at dawn). The mist functions as tactical obscurity and thematic veil. However, the setting doesn't alter the climactic conversation itself—Viktor could deliver the folder anywhere. Spatial choreography has one slip (their relative positions blur). Present in setup, middle, and closure; one causal constraint (remote, hidden meet); closure linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" appears as frame in opening and closing sentences but doesn't create time pressure or constrain decisions. The temporal marker is poetic but ornamental—no ticking clock, no seasonal window that narrows options. "Tonight" sets a single-night frame but elapsed time within the scene is vague and doesn't tighten tactics. Mentioned twice; no middle development; no cost tied to timing. Swappable with any transition-season metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unused courage waits" is signaled early (coordinates, snow-code message "Your courage waits where you left it") and returns at closure ("Her unused courage had been waiting here all along"). The motivation drives Margot's approach and colors her final understanding (choosing when to emerge). However, it's told more than dramatized—no on-page beat shows her wrestling with cowardice versus courage; the revelation is asserted in interiority. Present in setup and closure; one thematic turn; cost is implied (three years in hiding) but not friction-tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs across the piece (opening mist description, "silver-hushed dawn" at closure) and modulates with pressure: early opacity and menace, final clarity and possibility. Tone is coherent through turns—quiet, laden, reflective—and charges the final image when the mist disperses. The hush operates as both atmospheric anchor and thematic vehicle (silence as concealment and revelation). Strong closure linkage and purposeful modulation, though one beat ("the whole broken machinery...looking small and fixable") breaks into optimistic abstraction that tensions the established register.</comment>
