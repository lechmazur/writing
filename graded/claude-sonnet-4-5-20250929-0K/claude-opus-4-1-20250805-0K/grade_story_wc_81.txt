<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory work (bone-conducting earpiece, finger-tracing frequencies). Internal contradiction appears when she balances certainty with "dappled resolve," showing both commitment and doubt. The micro-choices—extracting volumes, marking pages—reveal hierarchy of values under time pressure. Minor slip: her competence faces little genuine struggle; the work proceeds methodically without mistakes that compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout enables detection, detection reveals pattern, pattern motivates marking, restored power ends window. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~80 words. Closure achieves Earned Stasis—Mira completes her task knowing the truth survives for future indexers, accepting the cyclical nature of her work with visible cost (she must wait for the next blackout). The "already planning her next descent" line clarifies the foreclosed immediacy and ongoing commitment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algae intensifies and generators cycle, narrowing her working time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submerged library setting constrains choice throughout: algae light enables her verification method, electromagnetic interference from preservation systems blocks detection except during blackout, rising pressure signals time limit. Micro-setting (bone-conducting earpiece, vacuum-sealed volumes, preservation table) all shape tactics. The algae's wavelength-specific illumination directly enables her ink's function, charging the closure image of truth "written in honest ink" protected by eternal pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving authentic records) signals early and tightens when she discovers systematic forgery pattern, then intensifies as backup generators cycle. The time constraint is felt: "minutes at most" forces efficiency. Her agency—marking pages, recognizing patterns—drives escalation. Visible cost: she can only mark patches, not restore everything, and must accept incomplete work. The resolution (ascending with stamp, planning next descent) shows endurance that forecloses the fantasy of complete restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-preservation versus deliberate obscuration emerges through concrete action (marking pages, discovering corporate profit cover-up) without thesis statements. The stamp/database contrast and the "slow work of tracing honest origins through layers of deliberate obscuration" crystallize via image rather than assertion. Final image—algae protecting secrets in honest ink below the blazing electric surface—offers non-literal answer to the question of where truth survives. Minor issue: "profound purpose in quiet spaces" edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (sensing vibrations, detecting discord, reading molecular structure). Diction stays technical-specialist throughout: "bone-conducting earpiece," "preservation field," "laser printing rather than traditional press." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register slip: "dappled resolve" in narration feels slightly elevated for the working moment, though it ties to the prompt's required tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; information density is high (each paragraph advances situation or reveals pattern). Clarity is strong in technical sequences. Two friction points: "tranquilly perceptive purpose" front-loads modifiers awkwardly; "Each mark was an act of dappled resolve" in climax leans ornamental when momentum wants economy. Paragraph on "As she worked, she began to recognize a pattern" employs efficient telling to compress discovery. No loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language (algae's eternal pulse) stays coherent and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise and sensory-indexing method offer fresh angles; the detail of frequency-based authentication and wavelength-specific ink feels specific. The corporate water-rights conspiracy adds a non-obvious moral layer. However, the solitary-expert-racing-the-clock frame and the mentor stamp object trend familiar. Transformation test: swapping names and replacing "vibrations" with another sense would not fundamentally alter emotional arc. The piece executes its premise competently but doesn't take bold structural or perspectival risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira the logical page indexer appears immediately, drives every beat (extracting volumes, isolating frequencies, marking pages, recognizing forgery pattern), and her decision to descend specifically during blackout creates the story's possibility. Her choice to mark "enough" and ascend rather than risk incompleteness shapes closure. Irreplaceable: her specialist skillset (sensing vibrations, reading molecular structure) is unique and causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Antique ink stamp introduced early (second paragraph), used at preservation table to mark verified pages (middle), and carried in ascent (closure). It contrasts with failed digital databases and enables future indexers to identify truth. Present in three beats but its use is somewhat static—marking pages repeatedly performs the same function. The stamp's survival and reliability matter thematically, but swapping it for another analog tool (wax seal, punch) wouldn't break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is explicitly named in opening ("Only in this reclaimed stillness could she properly listen") and motivates descent during blackout when preservation hum stops. It enables her detection method—electromagnetic silence is prerequisite for frequency-reading. Returns in penultimate paragraph ("next moment of reclaimed stillness"). Shapes tactics but feels somewhat thematic-label rather than constraint that costs her something specific on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears once in opening as descriptor ("Moving with tranquilly perceptive purpose") but doesn't constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. Her perceptiveness is shown through sensing vibrations and detecting forgeries, but the "tranquil" quality remains label-only. No moment where calmness trades off against another need (speed, urgency) or where perception fails under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears when Mira reconsiders hypothesis about forgeries: "She readjusted her approach, considering an alternative hypothesis: what if the forgery wasn't the entire book, but selective pages within it?" This pivot is the story's key turn—changes her detection method from whole-volume to page-level, enabling discovery of systematic pattern. Present in middle, drives escalation. Could be replaced with "reconsidered" or "revised" without major structural loss, but the cognitive shift it represents is essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is named at the readjustment beat and drives the method shift from whole-book to page-level verification. The mechanics matter: pressing earpiece to spine, isolating discordant pages (247, 511, 742). This approach enables the central discovery (corporate forgeries) and distinguishes her method from simple visual inspection. Present in setup (her "trained senses"), development (the pivot), and implicitly in closure (method succeeds). Solid integration but slightly generic as scientific thinking.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Forgotten library in sunken city is introduced immediately, pressures every choice (algae light enables verification, water surrounds, electromagnetic fields block/enable detection, depth requires ascent through emergency shaft), supplies the preservation table and vacuum-sealed volumes, and the algae's specific wavelength makes her ink visible. Setting is indispensable: remove the flooding and electromagnetic systems, and her detection method, time pressure, and ink's function all collapse. Essential across all beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Blackout timeframe introduced in opening ("three hours ago"), motivates descent (silence needed for detection), and creates escalating pressure as backup generators cycle. Time is tracked concretely: "wouldn't last forever," "minutes at most," "first electromagnetic pulse." The clock forces her choice to mark "enough" rather than complete the work, and her planning for "next blackout" in closure shows the constraint's persistence. Live ticking clock alters tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is dramatized through action (extracting volumes, marking authentic pages, uncovering corporate cover-up) rather than merely told. Friction appears between her want (complete restoration) and reality (she can only mark patches, must wait for next blackout). The cost—accepting incomplete work and cyclical effort—is visible in closure. Not heavily internalized as conflicted desire, but enacted through her methodical choices under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears explicitly once ("Each mark was an act of dappled resolve, neither entirely certain nor wholly doubtful") and is suggested by the algae's "dappled light." The neither-certain-nor-doubtful quality modulates somewhat (she's confident in method, uncertain about completeness), but the tone remains fairly steady rather than shifting with pressure. Final image (algae's eternal pulse, surface electricity) echoes the dappled quality through light contrast. Present in setup and closure; modest charge.</comment>
