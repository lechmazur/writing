<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vex's immortal weariness is established through concrete detail ("twelve thousand years," "third millennium"), but her internal contradiction—wanting death yet helping the mutiny—is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to step through lacks visible cost; she simply smiles and agrees after centuries of stagnation. Thorne and crew are functionally identical voices serving plot rather than individuals with distinct stakes. The amulet choice feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (magnetic imagery). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure—stepping through the door "beyond forever"—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: Vex has wanted escape for millennia, so the step costs nothing she valued. The causal chain (storm → masked approach → amulet fusion → door) is clear, but the "spatial mutiny" premise dissolves into background; the crew's revolutionary stakes vanish when the door simply opens to "something after goodbye" without resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered ("light bent into impossible colors," "gravity obeyed suggestions") and the solar storm's magnetic fields enable the crew's approach, creating atmosphere and tactical constraint. Spatial choreography of the dimensional breach is coherent. The amulet fragment as micro-setting object charges the final image by fusing with its siblings, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, occupational detail (Consortium exile policy, interdimensional navigation) remains abstract; the "translucent barriers" and "crystalline walls" are described but never constrain a choice or impose cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Vex seeking true death) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—the crew arrives, offers the fragments, and the door opens without complication or cost. No reversal or deepening occurs; Thorne's request and Vex's acceptance are frictionless. The "spatial mutiny" as revolutionary action evaporates; they simply walk through a door that grants their wish. The ending forecloses no live option Vex valued (she's been bored for millennia), so the cost required for high-band entry is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over stagnation emerges through the escondite imagery and the mutiny premise, and the final line ("chose to discover what lay beyond forever") offers resonant subtext. However, the resolution is abstract—"something after goodbye" is a placeholder rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. The Consortium's exile policy and the crew's "revolutionaries" framing are told labels; their moral calculus never dramatizes complexity. The amulet as "curse" versus "possibilities they're afraid of" flirts with thematic echo but stops short of overt sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Vex; psychic distance and tense are consistent. Voice carries distinct texture ("hushed thunder," "drinking light") that modulates with the solar storm's intensity. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Thorne's two lines advance plot without subtext or character distinction. Filter verbs ("felt them gathering," "watched Thorne's crew") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, though the narration occasionally tilts toward cosmic abstraction ("dimensional awareness," "fold in reality") that flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("obsidian surface drinking light," "light through heavy water") is purposeful without overwriting. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the crew of the Meridian Splice, humanity's first interdimensional vessel" repeats content from the prompt rather than advancing knowledge. Template cadence in the middle ("She pressed... Through it, she watched... They moved...") creates a march rhythm. The final paragraph's "something after goodbye" is repeated from earlier, and "whispering stories of those who chose to discover what lay beyond forever" is an expository summary rather than a charged image. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—immortal seeks death through dimensional rift during solar storm—leans on familiar tropes (bored immortal, fragmentary artifact, exiled crew). The magnetic-field method and prismatic escondite offer specific texture, but the core arc (fragments reunite → door opens → step through) follows a predictable template. The "spatial mutiny" as rebellion against the Consortium promises fresh stakes but dissolves into a convenient reunion without resistance. Emotional specificity is present in Vex's weariness, yet the resolution—walking through a door to "something else"—avoids bold risk by leaving the discovery abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.3</grade>Vex's boredom with immortality is established early and her choice to help Thorne by threading magnetic bridges is causally active in two beats (opening the window, enabling their emergence). Her final decision to step through completes the arc, though the cost is minimal since she's sought escape for millennia. The immortal trait shapes the central question but does not constrain tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade>The amulet fragment is handled in the opening (Vex turns it between her fingers), pressed against the wall to create the dimensional window, and fused with the other fragments in the penultimate paragraph to open the door. It drives two key beats and is indispensable to the closure mechanism. However, its "cursed" nature is told rather than demonstrated through cost, and its reweighting as "possibilities" arrives via dialogue label rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade>The spatial mutiny is named and its backstory explained (Consortium exile plot), but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—the crew simply arrives, requests passage, and is granted it without friction. The concept functions as thematic backdrop rather than live conflict. Swappable with "dimensional refugees" or "exiled navigators" without altering the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade>Dimensional awareness enables Vex to "feel" the crew gathering, perceive weak points in reality, and thread magnetic field lines—three distinct on-page uses. It constrains her options by limiting her to these methods and enables the crew's passage. However, the trait is more enabling than costly; no trade-off or visible price is shown for using it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade>Intrigue is named ("The intrigue ran deeper") and backstory exposition follows (Consortium conspiracy, amulet shattering), but the on-page action is collaborative rather than duplicitous—Vex and Thorne's goals align immediately. No betrayal, revelation, or hidden motive surfaces. The element is ornamental rather than causal; the plot would function identically if labeled "alliance" or "reunion."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade>Magnetic fields from the solar storm are signaled early, used to mask the crew's approach, and employed by Vex to create bridges through weak points in reality. The method shapes two tactical beats and is intrinsic to the closure mechanism (amulet fusion occurs "in the solar storm's magnetic embrace"). Its mechanics matter on the page, though the explanation is abstract rather than specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade>The escondite is vividly described and its "between spaces" nature is central to the premise. It provides the location for the dimensional breach and its prismatic walls enable the window Vex creates. However, it does not constrain her choices or impose cost; she operates freely within it. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure tactics, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade>The solar storm is present throughout, enabling the magnetic-field work and intensifying in the penultimate paragraph to "send cascades of charged particles." It provides cover and catalyzes the amulet fusion. However, time pressure is absent—no clock or urgency forces faster decisions. The storm is more atmospheric enabler than tactical constraint, and removing it would require only minor edits to the magnetic-field method.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade>Vex's desire to discover "what happens after goodbye" (death beyond dimensional barriers) is stated early, drives her decision to help Thorne, and is directly answered by the door that opens to "something after goodbye." The motivation shapes the central arc and the final image echoes the phrase, creating purposeful reprise. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Vex's agreement is frictionless, so the tension between want and cost is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade>"Hushed thunder" is voiced in Vex's speech tag ("voice carrying the weight of hushed thunder—power restrained, waiting") and echoed in Thorne's dialogue tag ("voice low as distant thunder"). The tone of restrained power modulates with the solar storm's intensity and charges the quiet final step through the door. However, the tone is more asserted through metaphor than embodied in syntactic restraint or atmospheric tension throughout the prose.</comment>
