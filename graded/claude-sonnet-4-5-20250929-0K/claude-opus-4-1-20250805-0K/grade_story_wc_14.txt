<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stationer remains passive throughout, observing and documenting without making a consequential choice that forecloses a path. Her "earnestly studious" preparations and measurements feel more like enacted profession than interior conflict. The monk's silent understanding and the closing plan to return next season suggest stasis rather than alteration. Interiority consists largely of exposition about her trade rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stationer arrives, sets up instruments, records frequencies through the night, and closes at dawn with tea and a plan to return. One subtle tightening occurs as the lamp's hum "grew stronger" at dawn and she captures "another texture of time," but no decision narrows options or imposes visible cost. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"invented back into existence"—yet the cost remains abstract; we cannot point to a specific forfeited path or felt price on the page. Orientation is clear early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, fountain, and fluorescent lamp anchor the scene with vivid specificity. Sensory detail is purposeful: "twisted trunks," "water trickled over stones shaped like sleeping birds," "moss," and the lamp's hum all ground the ritual. The lamp's positioning and the fountain's spray matter to her method, constraining her technique. The mountaintop setting and the town's silence below frame the temporal boundary effectively, charging the final image of dawn breaking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting "textures of different times"—is signaled early but never tested. The stationer encounters no obstacle, makes no tactical adjustment, and faces no competing pressure. The monk's appearance is observed, not responded to. The lamp hum shifting and dawn approaching feel like scheduled events rather than escalations that narrow her options or force a trade-off. No visible cost accompanies the closure; she simply closes her notepad and plans to return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory versus official erasure, "invented histories" as recovery—emerges through the bonsai trees' scars and the denied monastery fire. The gold-leaf pressing functions as "luminous protest against erasure," and the notepad's "invented histories" are framed as recovery rather than fiction. However, the final paragraph over-articulates this ("Her work...was never complete—there were always histories waiting to be invented back into existence") where the prior imagery had already carried it. The closing "The trees would remember, even if no one else did" works as resonance but edges toward restatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the valley's throat," "manuscript written in living wood," "incandescent restraint." Diction remains elevated and consistent throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. One minor register slip: "electromagnetic patterns that still echoed in the moisture between leaves" feels slightly anachronistic for the otherwise lyric medieval-monastery texture, but it does not break the established voice. The perceptual signature—filtering through the lens of temporal frequencies and "invented histories"—is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the lamp-hum passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "invented histories of places that might have existed" (para 1) and "invented back into existence" (final para) restate the core conceit without added pressure. "The bonsai masters had told her their trees remembered everything. Not metaphorically, but literally" over-explains what the following sentence already demonstrates. The phrase "her profession demanded such faith" tells rather than shows. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She crouched...She believed...She began" across adjacent beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gilded-leaf stationer, bonsai memory, and frequency charting is specific and non-obvious. The premise—documenting erased histories through electromagnetic refraction—transforms a familiar "hidden truth" trope through sensory and procedural detail. However, the emotional arc (arrival → documentation → departure with plan to return) follows a predictable observational frame. The monk's silent approval and the tea ending feel safe rather than bold. The piece commits fully to its lyric-procedural vision, but the lack of a consequential turn or risk-taking choice keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer is present throughout and performs her documentation ritual, but she makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her actions are procedural execution of an established method. The decision to return next season is stated intention, not a dramatized turn under pressure. She observes the monk, records frequencies, and closes her notepad—all functional but without cost or reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in at least three beats: arrival (cracked spine, pressed flowers, "invented histories"), opening to reveal gold-leaf petals (her signature), and closing at dawn ("warm from her hands," capturing "another texture of time"). Its contents—gold leaf and pressed petals—symbolize her trade and recur in the margin notations. The notebook's physical state (battered, warm) and its function (holding recovered histories) matter, though it does not constrain a choice or shift meaning decisively at closure. Strong setup and development; closure linkage is present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Invented histories" frames her profession in the opening paragraph, drives her night-long documentation ("not fiction but recovery"), and is restated in the final paragraph ("histories waiting to be invented back into existence"). The concept shapes her motivation and the thematic question (erasure versus recovery). However, it does not create a tactical constraint or a moment where she must choose between competing methods or costs. It functions more as thematic claim than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" appears once in paragraph three ("She was earnestly studious in her preparations") and describes her setup ritual. The trait does not constrain a later choice or create visible friction. It reads as a label rather than a lived constraint that forces a trade-off or enables a specific action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Refract" is the method by which the lamp's hum reveals temporal textures: "Its faint hum would refract through the water droplets at dawn, creating patterns she could chart." She later watches "how it bent through the fountain's spray, how it wrapped around the ancient trunks." The refraction mechanics matter to her method and are demonstrated on the page. However, the action does not drive a reversal or test; she executes the technique as planned. Setup and development are solid; closure participation is indirect (she completes the charting). Swapping "refract" for "echo" or "resonate" would require moderate rewrites but not fundamentally alter the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamp appears in setup (placed beside the fountain), is used in the middle beats (hum shifts with temperature, grows stronger at dawn), and its switch-off marks the closure transition ("As true dawn broke, the lamp's fluorescent glow became unnecessary"). The lamp's "faint hum" and its modulation under temperature change are the procedural heart of her frequency charting. The method is signaled, demonstrated, and shapes multiple beats. It does not, however, force a tactical pivot or create conflict. Strong integration across all three gates, but the lack of cost or constraint caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop" is established in paragraph two, frames the entire ritual, and provides the spatial and thematic anchor. The bonsai trees' "particular lean toward light" and "careful scars" encode the histories she seeks. The fountain and the positioning among the trees matter to her lamp placement. The mountaintop isolation and the town's silence below set the temporal boundary. The setting does not pressure her choices—she encounters no obstacle from the environment—but it charges the thematic closure (trees as memory keepers). Early signal, sustained presence, and thematic payoff meet the three-gate test; lack of causal pressure or tactical constraint prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the town below had gone silent" anchors the opening, and the narrative tracks the hours ("By three in the morning," "as dawn approached," "As true dawn broke"). The timeframe matters: the lamp's frequency shift occurs specifically at the night-to-morning boundary. However, no urgency or countdown pressures her choices; the clock is observed, not a source of friction. The dawn arrival feels scheduled rather than a ticking constraint. Setup and development present; closure participation is structural (dawn ends the session) but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" is stated early and drives her night-long activity. She sets instruments, records modulations, and captures "another texture of time." The motivation is clear and sustained. However, it is never conflicted or tested—she wants to collect, and she does, without competing desire or obstacle. The closing plan to return "next season, when the bonsai bloomed again, to collect more frequencies" confirms the motivation but shows no friction or cost. Told more than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" coheres in the prose: "She documented them all with incandescent restraint, never allowing her excitement to disturb the delicate measurements." Tone is controlled, observational, and lyric throughout—no melodrama, no rush. Diction like "luminous protest," "temporal signature," "invisible textures" maintains the register. The restraint modulates slightly at dawn ("she could feel it now, that particular frequency") but does not break. The tone charges the final tea scene's quiet. Strong coherence and modulation under the inferred Accumulative lens; lack of decisive tonal shift or intensification at a pressure peak keeps it mid-band.</comment>
