<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is clear and her actions cohere around transcription work, but interiority leans toward exposition rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The phrase "thistled calm—prickly at the edges but serene at its core" exemplifies label-speak that diagnoses emotion instead of embodying it. Her decision to transcribe the rebel song flows smoothly without meaningful internal friction or visible cost that would foreclose an alternate path. The grandmother's whispered backstory provides context but doesn't alter a present micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with thematic density building toward the final image of story restoration. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Mariel carrying "luminous burden toward the awakening city" reweights the premise of story-famine recovery, though the conceptual cost (risk, isolation, slow cultural work) is implied rather than sharply legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pirate broadcast addresses Mariel directly, narrowing her mission's stakes, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment with a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (warmth, mist, shortwave glow) that supports atmosphere and reflects the story-famine setting. The radio dial glow functions as both light source and symbolic charge, anchoring multiple beats and reappearing in the final gesture of gratitude. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single location, and the setting subtly enables Mariel's covert work by providing isolation and warmth. The alcove constrains her work (limited light, isolation) and charges the ending image when she steps into mist, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring stories through secretly luminous music—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure builds through the pirate broadcast's direct address and Mariel's act of weaving rebel notes into the official score, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment with a visible cost. The resolution (distributing the scores, imagining the gala's effect) is narrated as future consequence rather than a present trade-off that forecloses an alternate path. The phrase "Dreams would return first… Then memories… Finally, the ability to imagine" reads as wish-fulfillment summary without dramatized resistance or price paid in the present scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—story as survival, memory encoded in matter—emerges organically from the dust-mixing ritual, luminous notes, and pirate broadcast without overt moralizing. The final image of carrying "luminous burden toward the awakening city" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of cultural restoration. The dust-as-witness conceit and the phrase "teaching dust to tell stories again" risk abstraction but are grounded in Mariel's physical ink-mixing and the grandmother's prior testimony. Subtext operates in the radio's continued glow and Mariel's gesture of gratitude, which imply connection and risk without stating them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with selective, character-filtered detail (transcription work, shortwave familiarity, dust-mixing ritual). Voice carries a distinct lyric register ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous," "narrative spores") that remains consistent under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("narrative potential," "thematic question") that reads more authorial than character-bound. The final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("Tomorrow, the music would play. The dust would remember.") creates effective cadence but borders on declarative summary rather than immediate perception. No dialogue appears; interior voice is coherent and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong sensory anchors and no major loops, but several lines edge toward overwriting: "the dial glow that painted her fingers in amber light," "elusive song lyrics," "thistled calm—prickly at the edges but serene at its core." The phrase "secretly luminous" recurs four times, twice as identical construction, creating minor template cadence. Information density is generally high (transcription, dust-mixing, pirate broadcast mechanics), though the penultimate paragraph's list of future effects ("Dreams would return first… Then memories… Finally, the ability to imagine") reads as scaffold summary rather than propulsive image. No grammatical errors; syntax supports momentum except where figurative language clusters in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar dystopian censorship with a fresh angle: music-as-smuggling and dust-as-memory-carrier. The "secretly luminous notes" and dust-mixing ritual offer specific, sensory particulars that avoid generic resistance-narrative tropes. However, the core frame (artist in repressive regime encoding forbidden content) follows a well-worn template, and the resolution—successful distribution with imagined future effects—lacks the non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk that would elevate originality into the 7+ band. The "story famine" and "Ministry of Permitted Narratives" read as competent world-building but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariel's role as orchestra copyist is established immediately, enables her access to official scores, drives the central act of transcribing rebel notes between staves, and shapes the final image of carrying scores to the city. Her occupational skill constrains her method (working by faint light, mixing ink) and appears in at least three distinct beats: opening transcription, pirate-song weaving, sealing scores. The choice to transcribe the rebel broadcast is decisive but lacks visible on-page cost that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in the opening line ("shortwave radio dial glow that painted her fingers"), returns mid-scene as Mariel adjusts the dial with "practiced delicacy," and charges the ending when "its dial continued to emit the faintest glow—not electrical, but something older" before her final gesture of gratitude. It functions as light source, connection to the pirate network, and symbolic charge across at least three beats, reweighted at closure from mundane tool to "older" force akin to stories themselves.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is signaled early, drives Mariel's decision to transcribe the rebel song, and provides the instructions ("Find the seventh measure's rest") that shape her method. It appears in at least two beats (initial reception, direct address) and its content constrains her transcription choices. The broadcast's mechanics (static, melody, coded lyrics) are specific and irreplaceable. It does not directly participate in the closure image but enables the entire mission, placing it solidly in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is introduced early as a discovered property of certain musical phrases and becomes the mechanism by which the notes will activate at the gala. It appears in at least two beats (initial explanation, closure reference) and constrains Mariel's transcription method (specific sequences required). The trait is specific and irreplaceable, but the actual on-page action it enables—glowing in darkness—occurs off-page at the imagined future gala rather than in the present scene, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cloak appears only in the final sentence as Mariel "wrapped her cloak around the precious scores and stepped into the mist." It functions as pragmatic concealment and contributes to the ending image but is introduced too late (final beat) and could be replaced with "coat," "shawl," or "bag" without structural impact. No cost is tied specifically to the cloak; it enables transport but does not constrain or complicate an earlier choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Elusive song lyrics" are signaled in the opening third ("instructions, cloaked in elusive song lyrics that only trained ears could decipher"), drive Mariel's transcription method ("Find the seventh measure's rest, where silence speaks what words suppress"), and constrain her work across at least two beats. The method is specific—coded instructions embedded in rebel songs—and irreplaceable; removing it would break the logic of how Mariel receives and interprets the pirate broadcast. It does not directly participate in the closure image but enables the central action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove is established in the opening line, provides warmth that sustains Mariel through the night, and enables her covert work through isolation and retained heat. It appears across the full scene (opening, mid-scene "alcove's warmth," final "stepped into the mist" departure) and its environmental qualities (warmth, isolation, mist-wrapped) constrain her method and charge the contrast when she leaves. The setting is specific and irreplaceable; "warm room" would lose the post-fire connotation and sensory texture that ground the story-famine context.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "story famine" timeframe is established immediately ("fires that burned during the story famine"), shapes every stake (government surveillance, burned books, silenced storytellers), constrains Mariel's tactics (working by faint light, secretly luminous notes as covert method), and charges the closure image of restoring stories. It appears in at least three beats (opening context, grandmother's memory, ending mission) and is causally indispensable: removing "after the story famine" would collapse the premise. The temporal anchor "as dawn approached" adds urgency but the larger historical frame does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mariel's desire "to teach dust to tell stories again" is stated explicitly in the second third and dramatized through her ink-mixing ritual and transcription work across at least two beats. The grandmother's whispered testimony ("The dust was always listening") provides backstory that primes the present mission. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable, driving the dust-mixing and secretly luminous note mechanics. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no friction between this want and a competing fear or cost—capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Thistled calm—prickly at the edges but serene at its core" is named explicitly mid-scene when the pirate broadcast addresses Mariel. The tone descriptor attempts to modulate the atmosphere (danger + resolve) but the label-speak phrasing undercuts its embodiment. The narrative does maintain coherent control between urgency (radio wavering, dawn approaching) and reflective stillness (transcription, dust-mixing), and the ending image carries quiet resolve. However, the tone is declared rather than emergent from syntax and rhythm under pressure, and the explicit gloss reduces its charge.</comment>
