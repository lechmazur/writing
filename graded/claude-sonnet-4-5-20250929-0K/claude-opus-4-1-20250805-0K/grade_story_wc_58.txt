<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is vivid and distinctive—"her presence filling rooms like incense smoke"—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; we see her documenting grief without a live on-page choice between competing desires. Marcus is a vivid presence, yet his foreclosed path lacks visible cost: the story tells us he "explains his wife's absence" but does not dramatize a moment where this explanation alters his stance or Elara's. The final winding of the thread suggests a new tactic, yet no prior on-page conflict made that shift costly or earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by line 30; dominant stake (mapping grief to enable healing) signals early. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of image and reflection deepens toward the final metaphor of "healing as map." The closure image—winding the thread, promising to weave endings into peace—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), yet the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The reflection-heavy design (~40% reflective mass) is anchored to present stimuli (thread, garden, Marcus's projection) and interleaved with micro-choices (observing, writing in air, planning tomorrow's visit), meeting the BRR exception test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden—dry fountain, frost-edged roses, amber leaves—is rendered with lyric specificity and filters through Elara's elegiac lens. The crimson thread and topiary anchor spatial choreography; Marcus's translucent form "barely disturbing the fallen leaves" charges the atmosphere. The thread's warmth and pulse pressure her final winding gesture, meeting the micro-setting constraint test and elevating the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to map the geography of healing—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through layered reflection and Marcus's projection appearance, yet no on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; the final decision to visit the weaver sisters reads as continuation rather than tightening. The thread's pulse "synchronizing with her heartbeat" suggests deepening, but without a prior fork or visible cost the escalation remains textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the unraveling carpet, the living-dead citizens, and Elara's cartography metaphor. The final image—"healing was not a destination but a map"—reweights prior material without explicit moralizing, and the recurring thread accrues meaning across beats. However, "lonesome splendor" and "the geography of healing" verge on prompt-echo language; the conceptual repricing is eloquent but lacks a live trade-off to anchor its undeniability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature—"her consciousness settling like dust," "words visible only to her"—is character-specific and consistent. Free indirect style is clean; diction ("explained absences," "departed-but-present") remains within an educated, elegiac register without jarring leaps. Under peak reflection the voice modulates with the accretive mood, yet no dialogue tests voice distinction and the narrator's certainty about Marcus's interiority ("telling them she merely stepped out for cardamom") reads omniscient rather than inferred.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense—"incense smoke," "divining rod," "threads of crimson silk"—and coherent within the elegiac register, yet stacks in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without breathing room, risking overwriting (−0.4). A paraphrase loop appears: "Each pulled thread revealed another story, another life" echoes "their souls already halfway to wherever souls go" in restating the living-dead conceit (−0.2). Information density is high and rhythm supports the accumulative design, but the closure paragraph—"And Elara, keeper of their stories..."—summarizes rather than dramatizes the final turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of obituaries-for-the-living, projection, and unraveling-as-cartography is specific and non-obvious; the template of "elegiac observer in a dying city" gains fresh inflection through the tactile thread and the paradox of mapping wounds to create peace. However, the "last ship sailed / abandoned capital" setup and the transparent-ghost imagery echo familiar post-apocalyptic elegy beats without full transformation. Risk is present in the reflection-heavy structure, yet the ending's safety—promising future visits rather than a decisive act—pulls toward the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her projection method is described, yet her on-page choices—observing Marcus, writing in air, winding the thread—are contemplative rather than decisive. She plans to visit the weaver sisters tomorrow, but that decision does not alter present tactics or foreclose a path with cost. Setup is clear, development involves multiple beats of observation, but closure participation is ornamental: she winds the thread as a ritual rather than a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crimson weft thread appears in the opening paragraph, is handled and used across four beats (opening observation, divining rod, writing in air, winding on wrist), and returns at closure with reweighted meaning ("threads of crimson silk" as map-making tools). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. However, its use remains symbolic rather than causally decisive; removing it would weaken texture but not break story logic. Swappability and lack of visible cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is foregrounded in paragraph three and shapes the story's conceptual frame: Elara learns "the geography of their particular wounds," and Marcus "explains his wife's absence to the stars." The concept appears in ~four beats and charges the thematic repricing at closure. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (two distinct) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. Yet the concept functions as theme rather than constraint; it does not narrow Elara's options or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" prose saturates the text—shadow-pooled fountain, frost-edged roses, translucent projection—but functions as a style trait rather than a dramatized attribute. The trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it describes the narrative voice without altering tactics. Ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (the story could be told in plainer prose without breaking logic) (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intimate" as action appears in Elara's projection method ("each letter a small act of intimacy with the departed-but-present") and the thread's pulse synchronizing with her heartbeat. Setup occurs in paragraph two, development in the writing-in-air beat, and the winding at closure links to intimacy via the thread's warmth. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.7. However, the action is described rather than dramatized at peak moments; if swapped with "connection" or "attention," story logic holds. Summary-only use (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Projection is named in paragraph two ("project herself into their empty houses") and demonstrated with Marcus's observatory visit ("her consciousness settling like dust on his instruments"). Method appears in two beats and returns implicitly at closure when she plans tomorrow's weaver-guild projection. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, but no mechanics constrain her choices; she can project at will without cost or friction. Resolves observation without prior problem (−0.9), swappability (could be replaced with "visiting" or "imagining") (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is anchored in the opening and developed across the story: dry fountain basin, frost-edged roses, topiary where Marcus's projection pauses, dying maple canopy. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (the garden "held its breath around her" as she prepares the next thread) +1.1, specificity +0.6. The garden's seasonal decay mirrors the city's decline and the thread's warmth against the frost creates textural pressure. However, no garden feature forces a tactical choice or alters outcome; its role is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is foregrounded in the opening sentence and establishes the post-departure stasis; "three autumns ago" anchors elapsed time. The timeframe shapes the story's elegiac premise but does not tighten present decisions: Elara can observe and write at any moment without a live clock or deadline. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (background in multiple beats) +0.6. Missing middle development (no ticking pressure that narrows options) and missing closure participation (the ending does not hinge on time running out). Cap 4.6 per missing-setup-development rule; late signal (background rather than foregrounded past opening) (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is articulated in paragraph two ("learning the geography of their particular wounds") and reprised at closure ("healing was not a destination but a map"). Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants: Elara never faces a choice between mapping and intervening, between documenting and participating. Friction between want and cost is abstract; no on-page moment shows her sacrificing an alternative path. Told-only (−0.7), swappability (could be "to document loss" without breaking logic) (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears as a phrase in paragraph five and permeates the story's tone: beauty edged with loss, elegiac specificity, the paradox of things "more beautiful for being almost gone." Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with the thread's warmth and Marcus's translucent appearance. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (atmosphere in four beats) +1.4, closure linkage (the final image holds the lonesome/splendor tension in "shadows deepening with the promise of winter" and "stars that had already burned out") +1.2, specificity +0.7. The tone charges the final image rather than remaining static.</comment>
