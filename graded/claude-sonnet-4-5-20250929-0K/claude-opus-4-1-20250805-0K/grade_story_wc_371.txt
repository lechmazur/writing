<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's observational gift is consistent and her guerrilla-gardening choices show agency, but her interior life remains flat—we see what she notices, not why she *needs* to notice or what contradictory impulses drive her. The ending gesture (planting seeds) feels predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses another path. The woman's grandfather backstory adds emotional texture but arrives as exposition rather than dramatized pressure on Lila's present stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: bread → courtyard → tea house → woman → seeds forms a density curve. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Lila accepts her "ministry"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—what does she lose or forfeit by committing to this role? The final image (planting tomorrow) recaps intent without reweighting prior material. The inferred lens holds, but the closure lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vivid and purposeful; jasmine vines, thornrose hedge, and midnight lettuce create a lived-in guerrilla space. The tea house's paper screens and the bread's waxed-paper wrapping constrain Lila's approach (she must notice, must follow). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image (courtyard as sanctuary) and enables the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (Lila follows impossible bread to hidden spaces). The tea house discovery is a meaningful tightening, and the woman's explanation deepens Lila's understanding of her gift. However, escalation is gentle; Lila faces no live choice between competing goods or trade-offs. The resolution (she will plant more gardens) is affirmed rather than earned through on-page friction. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but cost clarity is low.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (the sacred hides in the ordinary; attention grants absolution) emerges from concrete images—bread, guerrilla gardens, the tea house flickering between being and not-being. The woman's line "absence is just presence wearing disguise" risks overt philosophizing but is anchored in the grandfather's bread. The final image (bread tasting of forgiveness and time) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Lila's perceptual signature (noticing "reality's soft edges") is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a lyric, patient texture apt for the Accumulative lens. The woman's dialogue ("Your attention freed him") edges toward prompt-echo but stays within diegetic bounds. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she observed," "she understood") are present but not stacked in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates appropriately as Lila moves deeper into the impossible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the tea house scene. However, the piece carries minor scaffold: "This tea house exists because you noticed. Your gardens gave it permission to grow" loops the same concept across adjacent sentences. "The sacred hides in ordinary things" + "love persists even after the ovens cool" veer toward stock wisdom phrasing. The final paragraph ("tasted of forgiveness and time") recaps rather than propels. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 max).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis (guerrilla gardening as threshold for displaced sacred objects; bread as anchor for a baker's love) feels specific and non-obvious. The "cursed awareness" framing and the tea house that flickers between being/not-being offer fresh inflections on magical realism. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking (the bread "uncloaking" as woven memories, moths writing messages) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these exact elements, not generic fantasy placeholders.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila's noticing is central and present throughout; her observations guide every beat. However, her role is primarily receptive—she follows, accepts, understands—rather than making a decision that alters tactics or stakes. The ending commitment (planting seeds tomorrow) is framed as continuation rather than a turn. Two gates (setup, closure participation via understanding her "ministry"), but Development involves observation, not choice under friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bread appears in paragraph 1, drives the courtyard journey (beat 1), "uncloaks" as woven memories in the tea house (beat 2), and returns in the final line ("tasted of forgiveness and time") with reweighted meaning (beat 3). Its properties (warm, rosemary-scented, wrapped in pre-fire paper) are specific and irreplaceable. It directly enables closure by anchoring the grandfather's absolution. All three gates present; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Absolution is the story's conceptual spine: the grandfather's spirit needs witness, Lila's attention "grants it absolution," and the final bread tastes of forgiveness. It shapes the dominant stake (witnessing the impossible to free the trapped). However, the concept is mostly told through the woman's explanation rather than tested in on-page choices. It frames rather than constrains tactics. Setup and closure gates present; Development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Heuristic kindness" appears once in the final third as a descriptor for the universe's behavior toward Lila. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it is a thematic label rather than a trait that creates friction. The story's gentleness is pervasive (tea, bread, the woman's smile) but "heuristic" as a modifier does no causal work. Late signal, ornamental use. Missing setup and Development gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The bread "uncloaking" as woven memories is a vivid mid-story image that reframes the bread's nature and introduces the grandfather's plight. It enables the woman's explanation and charges Lila's understanding. However, it does not drive a protagonist choice or turn; it is a revelation received rather than an action taken. Present in two beats (tea house, aftermath) but does not redefine Lila's options in a way that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (paragraph 1: jasmine vines planted illegally; paragraph 3: midnight lettuce, moon radishes planted without permission) and its mechanics matter—each unauthorized seed creates doorways for the sacred. It shapes the woman's recognition ("you plant truth in abandoned spaces") and the ending commitment (planting more gardens citywide). All three gates; Development is present (gardens "gave permission" for the tea house to grow), though the causality is metaphorical rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tea house is discovered mid-story, provides the revelation space (all of beat 2), and its flickering presence in the final paragraphs charges the closure image ("waiting for someone else to need what only the attentive could see"). The overgrown palace courtyard frames every beat. Both settings pressure Lila's choices (she must navigate hidden gaps, tend gardens to sustain the tea house) and supply the final stakes (sanctuary for lost things). All three gates; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" appears once in the tea house description ("scenes of birds flying south, though autumn had long since passed") and again obliquely in the penultimate paragraph ("birds returning too early, or perhaps too late"). It does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Time is vague throughout; no clock shapes Lila's moves. The seasonal inversion adds atmosphere but no causal pressure. Ornamental use; missing Development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila's desire to witness the impossible and find meaning in anomalies drives her initial journey (following bread, tending secret gardens). The woman's dialogue makes it explicit: "to know that love persists even after the ovens cool." The motivation is present in setup and closure (she will create more hidden gardens) but is affirmed rather than tested through friction or competing wants. She never doubts or struggles against her gift. Two gates; thematic rather than conflicted.</comment>
