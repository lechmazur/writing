<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is established through consistent interior voice and the scarf motif, but his choices remain largely observational until the final vision—no forked-path decision with visible cost appears on the page. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("sanely eccentric") but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat. The grandmother's influence anchors motivation, yet the climactic "understanding" reads as epiphany without prior struggle that would earn it causally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates imagery (scarf, hyperbolic geometry, impossible marginalia) and builds density, but the final "glimpse" moment lacks a legible cost—Marcus smiles and continues his shift with no path foreclosed or option narrowed. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when). The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the infinite library exists in curved space between memory and story), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what Marcus sacrificed or what tactical choice this realization alters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library's non-Euclidean architecture is vivid and specific (aisle seven-and-a-half, spiral staircase, shelves breathing), and the scarf functions as micro-setting that recurs with tactile detail. The setting pressures Marcus's search and charges the final image when the infinite shelves "fold through dimensions." However, the environment does not visibly constrain a choice—Marcus moves freely, and no door, distance, or rule blocks his path at a decision point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the place where stories live"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful deepening (the marginalia in his grandmother's handwriting) that shifts Marcus's understanding, but no on-page tightening narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The midnight vision is presented as revelation rather than a choice under pressure, and no visible price is paid; Marcus returns to his shift unchanged in tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (analog memory, hyperbolic topology as metaphor for how stories and memories fold) emerges organically from image and action without overt statement until the penultimate paragraph's summary ("not a place... but the recognition that they live everywhere"). The scarf's unraveling and the impossible marginalia charge the ending with resonance. The final image offers a non-literal answer, though the last paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("the beauty of analog memories—they changed with each remembering").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and Marcus's perceptual signature (numbers, equations, hyperbolic curves) is distinct. Free indirect style is clean. However, the final two paragraphs shift into a slightly elevated, expository register ("recognition that they live everywhere, if you know the right geometry") that drifts from the intimate voice of earlier beats. Dialogue is minimal and functional (patron exchanges); no voice convergence issues arise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose carries momentum through most beats. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "searching" recurs without advancing knowledge, and the final paragraph's wine/books/architecture list feels stacked. The closure paragraph contains template cadence ("waiting... for the next revelation to unfold") and near-summary of theme that flattens propulsion. Figurative language (shelves breathing, scarf as portal) is vivid but occasionally dense without pattern-teaching in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of topology, analog memory, and library architecture is specific and fresh in detail (aisle seven-and-a-half, hyperbolic marginalia). However, the "librarian discovers hidden truth in magical space" frame is a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or high-stakes choice. The ending's resonance grows from particulars (scarf unraveling, grandmother's impossible handwriting), yet the final revelation feels more meditative than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus appears in every beat and frames the search, but his choices are largely curatorial (guiding patrons, selecting books) rather than decision-points that alter tactics. The midnight vision is granted rather than earned through a forked choice. Two gates: setup (opening), closure presence (final image). Missing middle development as distinct choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scarf is handled in three beats: catching on the shelf (with apology), growing warm at the marginalia discovery, and being adjusted at the end. It seeds the grandmother's influence early and returns with reweighted meaning (artifact and portal). All three gates; causal pressure is moderate (the warmth signals the impossible marginalia moment), and closure linkage is present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analog memories are introduced early ("memories weren't stored in the brain but in the spaces between things") and recur thematically, shaping Marcus's belief system and the library's design. However, the concept remains largely thematic and metaphorical—it does not visibly constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Two gates: setup, closure echo. Missing middle development where analog/digital distinction changes an action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is labeled early ("colleagues called him sanely eccentric") and illustrated with quirks (alphabetizing dreams, whispering numbers), but the attribute does not enable or constrain a key on-page action with visible cost. It colors voice and provides texture, yet remains ornamental. One gate: setup. Missing middle constraint and closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is named in the grandmother's teaching ("To reawaken what's lost... you must think in dimensions that don't quite exist") and implicitly drives Marcus's nightly ritual, but the action itself is not dramatized as a distinct, high-stakes attempt. The midnight vision functions as passive revelation rather than active reawakening with cost. Two gates: setup (grandmother's advice), closure presence (vision). Missing middle beat where Marcus attempts to reawaken something and faces friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early (grandmother's teaching, Marcus's notebooks mapping the library) and recurs (tracing a curve in the air triggers the vision). The method shapes the library's impossible architecture and the final image ("infinite shelves folding through dimensions"). All three gates; the mechanics are signaled and the method is present at closure, though it does not visibly constrain a middle choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library is established immediately and pressures Marcus's search through its non-Euclidean design (aisle seven-and-a-half, spiral staircase, restricted section, shelves reorganizing). The setting supplies resources (the marginalia, the building's "frequency") and charges the final vision. All three gates; the library's architecture is indispensable to the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" frames the shift (three-to-eleven, "tonight," "after midnight," "midnight approached") but exerts minimal tactical pressure. Time passes in summary rather than tightening decisions; Marcus moves freely without a clock constraint. Two gates: setup (shift hours named), closure presence (midnight mentioned). Missing middle beat where time scarcity alters a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "find the place where stories live" is stated early (the grandmother's teaching seeds it) and drives Marcus's nightly ritual and the final revelation. However, it is more contemplative quest than urgent desire with friction; no on-page moment shows Marcus torn between this search and a competing want. All three gates; the motivation is dramatized in action (selecting books, climbing to restricted section) and resolved at closure, yet the absence of visible cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is invoked twice ("in the observed solitude of his work—watched by no one but somehow never alone") and coheres with the library's sentient atmosphere and Marcus's communion with his grandmother's memory. The tone modulates subtly (intimate early, slightly elevated at closure) and charges the final image of Marcus waiting alone. All three gates; the tone is consistent and supports closure, though it does not sharply shift under pressure.</comment>
