<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to find her mother is established and drives the search, but her interior life relies heavily on abstracted perception ("synesthetic ribbons," "violet whispers") rather than embodied contradiction. The reunion scene offers emotional stakes but resolves too cleanly into collaborative purpose without genuine friction between abandonment and reunion. The mother's exhaustion is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the final pivot to "map the repairs" arrives as an epiphany without prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal chain: shard appears cyclically, Kira uses it to navigate worlds, discovers her mother at a nexus, learns the map-makers' damage, proposes a solution. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the closure—shifting from exploration to repair—feels conceptually neat but lacks visible cost on the page; the shard's dissolution and "vast work ahead" gesture toward consequences without showing a foreclosed path or immediate sacrifice. The lens reads as Causal with an Accumulative accent, but the ending leans into thematic reconfiguration without demonstrating what Kira loses or risks in this exact moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored early and recurs across parallel versions (bioluminescent fungi, sideways gravity, underwater), creating vivid sensory variety. The setting's final reframing as a place of restoration charges the ending image. However, the bay functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint; Kira's navigation choices are not shaped by spatial access or resource scarcity within the bay itself. The green glass shard and nexus do more causal work than the repair bay's physical layout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding her mother and understanding the withheld truth—is signaled early and pursued across parallel universes. The revelation that map-makers damage reality provides a meaningful deepening, and Kira's proposal to "map the repairs" narrows the tactical path. However, the escalation is driven more by revelation than by Kira's choices under rising pressure; she discovers rather than decides until the final beat. The cost of the new path is promised ("vast work ahead") but not felt on the page as a visible trade-off or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—exploration as both gift and curse, repair as redemption—emerges through the map-makers' dilemma and the repair bay's symbolic shift. The final image reweights the shard and the setting without overt moralizing. However, the ending risks neatness: "cyclically spontaneous gift transformed from curse to cure" edges toward thematic summary, and the phrase "some truths are withheld not from cruelty but from love" in the penultimate paragraph leans into explicit statement. The particulars (synesthetic navigation, quantum foam, nexus threads) support the theme without becoming allegory, but the resolution feels conceptually complete rather than resonantly ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Kira with consistent sensory filtering ("rust became the taste of copper bells"). The prose maintains a speculative register throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("synesthetic ribbons," "probability streams," "quantum foam") that reads more like worldbuilding shorthand than Kira's lived perception. The mother's dialogue ("You solved it. The shard's pattern. I knew you would.") and Kira's reply feel functional rather than voice-distinct. Perceptual signature is present but relies on repeated sensory-translation descriptions that blur into pattern rather than deepening under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled in most beats. However, the opening relies on stacked sensory metaphors ("rust became the taste of copper bells, engine grease transformed into violet whispers") that prioritize texture over clarity, and similar constructions recur ("harmonics from a dozen realities," "golden filaments stretching between worlds"). The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" appears twice, once as descriptor and once as thematic callback, bordering on loop. The climax beats are clear, but the final paragraph's summary tone ("their cyclically spontaneous gift transformed from curse to cure") deflates momentum. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she could feel it pulling") in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—sensory map-maker navigating parallel universes to find her mother and discovering that exploration damages reality—offers a science-fantasy angle on environmental cost and legacy. The cyclical shard arrival and the repair bay's symbolic function show some specificity. However, the core arc (protagonist discovers their gift harms the world, pivots to healing) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (collaboration, repair, transformation of curse to cure) lands in expected territory. The synesthetic navigation and nexus imagery add texture but do not fundamentally transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kira is present throughout and her sensory map-making drives the search across universes. She makes the key decision to "map the repairs" at closure. However, much of the middle is observation—she experiences parallel bays and follows the shard's pull—rather than active choice that alters tactics. The final turn is a proposal, not a choice under competing pressures. Present by end of first third, drives one major beat (the ending), but middle beats are more responsive than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in the opening line, is pressed to Kira's temple to enable navigation, grows warmer to signal a deliberate path, and dissolves at closure after mother and daughter join hands. It recurs across four distinct beats (opening, cyclical history, nexus pull, dissolution) and its final disappearance signals "purpose finally complete," reweighting its prior function. Essential to the mechanics and emotionally charged at the ending. Could not be removed without breaking the navigation logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the story's central action: Kira navigates parallel universes, discovers the damage map-makers cause, and proposes to "weave" repairs at closure. The concept shapes every major beat and the ending pivot. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—redirecting through the shard's crystalline structure, following sensory trails—rather than imposing tactical constraints or visible costs during the search. Present throughout, drives the ending, but the concept's rules do not visibly narrow options in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The shard's cyclical appearance (age seven, nineteen, thirty-one) is mentioned early and echoed in the final paragraph ("cyclically spontaneous gift transformed from curse to cure"). However, the trait functions more as backstory pattern than on-page constraint. The cyclical timing does not impose a deadline or force a tactical choice; Kira simply uses the shard when it arrives. The final thematic callback labels the trait without demonstrating its cost or tradeoff in action. Present, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears five times as Kira's navigation technique: she redirects through the shard to shift between parallel bays. Each redirect advances her search spatially and causally, culminating in arrival at the nexus. The action is specific to the mechanics and cannot be easily swapped. However, the redirects function as transit rather than choice under pressure; Kira follows the shard's pull rather than deciding between competing paths. Essential to the method, drives multiple beats, but lacks tactical cost or dilemma at each use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled in the opening ("countless journeys through parallel universes") and demonstrated through the bay's transformations (bioluminescent, sideways gravity, underwater, pristine). The method shapes every navigation beat and the revelation that universe-crossing damages reality. The mechanics are clear and consistent. However, the method does not impose a visible cost per crossing until the late revelation; Kira navigates freely without tactical friction. Present throughout, shapes the ending, but the cost arrives as exposition rather than felt constraint during attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is established in the opening line and recurs as the spatial anchor across parallel versions and the nexus. The ending reframes it as "not a place of endings, but of restoration," charging the setting thematically. However, the bay does not constrain Kira's choices or supply tactical resources; it functions as backdrop and symbol rather than pressure. Present early, returns at closure with reweighted meaning, but does not alter tactics or enable a key turn through its spatial properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears twice: once mid-story as a sensory mode for memory and once in the penultimate paragraph as thematic reflection. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than structural; the story unfolds in a continuous present during Kira's navigation, with no live clock or deadline shaping urgency. The phrase reads as lyric accent rather than a constraint on decision-making. Present, but ornamental and does not tighten tactics or shape the ending's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kira's desire to discover the withheld truth (her mother's disappearance and message) is stated early and drives her search across universes. The revelation—map-makers damage reality—delivers on the "weight" of the truth and is dramatized through the mother's explanation and the visible fraying edges. However, the emotional cost of the truth (years of abandonment, the burden of repair) is summarized in reflection rather than shown through conflicted choice. The motivation shapes the arc and ending, but friction between discovery and its price is muted by the collaborative resolution.</comment>
