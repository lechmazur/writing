<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elsa's reticence and connection to Jonas through stone-language is established, but her decision to tend the lamp feels insufficiently earned by prior struggle. The transition from supply skipper to guardian resolves too smoothly without visible internal conflict—her "quiet nature" becomes a solution rather than a complication. The ghost keepers are vivid but their collective presence dilutes individual psychological pressure. Jonas's motivation (loneliness worse than death) lands cleanly, but Elsa's acceptance lacks a dramatized cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). The causality holds: letters → arrival → stone message → confrontation → choice to tend lamp. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elsa becomes the new keeper and offers communion to the ghosts, crystallizing her role with the final stone message. The cost is visible (isolation accepted, prior life abandoned) but not deeply contested on the page—she steps into the role without a reversal that tests her commitment. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (stone language, sea glass, lamp imagery recur and deepen).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse, dock, beach, spiral stairs, and lantern room are anchored with purpose-driven detail. The sea glass functions as micro-setting (warmth, phosphorescence) and constrains the closure beat by symbolizing safety. Spatial choreography is clean; the climb and the lantern room's glass walls charge the final confrontation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elsa's observant POV (phosphorescent foam, salt and cold). The stacked stones serve as both setting and communication system, directly shaping the plot and ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect the keepers and restore the light. The lamp's death creates urgency, and Elsa's climb tightens options. However, the confrontation lacks a meaningful reversal—Jonas reveals the trap (snuffed lamp to summon her), but Elsa accepts without resistance. The final act (lighting the lamp with intention) is a clear alteration, yet it bypasses the escalation test: no competing goods, no tactical failure that raises cost. The ghosts' relief provides thematic closure but not a contested choice that narrows Elsa's options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: isolation vs. communion, purpose transforming loneliness. The stone messages, sea glass (safety bottled), and lamp (dispensing light to the drowning) form a coherent symbolic architecture without overt statement. The final stone arrangement ("You are not alone") reweights prior material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "bottled safety" and "dispensing drop by drop" veer toward on-the-nose metaphor in the penultimate paragraph, though the image itself (tears falling like sea glass) recovers with specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV (Elsa) with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is clear: worn skiff, practiced hands, phosphorescent foam—observations filtered through her maritime experience. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; Jonas's whisper ("though his lips didn't move") maintains tonal control. Diction remains character-apt (reticent, cairns, sea glass). Minor filter-verb reliance ("She'd always been reticent," "she'd always checked") in backstory, but voice stays controlled under pressure. The final stone-message beat modulates rhythm effectively without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the climb and confrontation. Minor loop: "The lighthouse keeps us, but loneliness is worse than death" and the subsequent elaboration ("they'd all been watchers, protectors...") paraphrase the same idea without new pressure. Stock metaphor: "its dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky" elevates slightly above purpose. The final image (tears falling like sea glass) is specific and propulsive. No major scaffolding, but a few stock constructions ("chill running through her bones," "ache of isolation") dull immediacy in early beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (haunted lighthouse + anonymous letters + guardian succession) synthesizes familiar gothic elements. The stone-language communication system and "lamp responds to intention" offer specific twists, though the latter is introduced late without groundwork. Elsa's trait (comfortable in solitude) transforms the haunted-keeper trope into a resonance about purposeful isolation. The emotional truth—loneliness as a haunting—feels earned. However, the ghost collective and the lamp's magical operation lean toward convenience; a more grounded escalation would sharpen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elsa's role as supply skipper establishes her connection to Jonas and the lighthouse, and her decision to climb and tend the lamp drives the final beat. Her reticence shapes her acceptance of isolation. However, her choices do not create a key turn—she receives information (letters, stones, ghost reveal) and responds without a contested reversal. She is present in all three beats (arrival, confrontation, closure) and her occupation matters causally, but the story would function with a generic "visitor" if the stone-language were simplified. Specificity (seventeen years, skiff, dock routine) adds texture but does not narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in three beats: stone message (warm against palm), referenced in Jonas's explanation (holds last memories of safety), and charges the lamp-lighting ("The sea glass in her pocket grew warmer"). It is causally active in the closure beat, enabling the lamp's ignition through accumulated intention. The object's warmth and phosphorescence are specific and irreplaceable—no generic token could substitute. The reweighted meaning (safety bottled and dispensed) ties directly to theme and final action. Strong integration, though the mechanism (why sea glass enables the lamp) is asserted rather than earned through prior world-building.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain frames the inciting action and sustains Elsa's journey to the lighthouse. The letters shape stakes (terror, plea, "after the lamp dies") and provide narrative momentum. However, the concept does not constrain choices once Elsa arrives—she learns the truth from Jonas directly, and the letters become backstory. The final reveal (all keepers wrote them collectively) reweights their origin but does not alter Elsa's tactics or the closure. Present in setup and explained at the confrontation, but absent from the ending beat. Functional but replaceable with a simpler summons (e.g., Jonas's distress signal).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is claimed in the setup (reticent, understanding silence, reading stone messages) but not tested under pressure. Elsa's observations (phosphorescent foam, ghostly keepers) advance description without complicating her choices. The trait does not create a visible tradeoff—her observant nature is an asset without cost. Label-only at key beats; the final stone-stacking demonstrates observation turned to communication, but this is an expression of the trait rather than a constrained choice where warmth or observation foreclosed an alternative. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Protect" drives the central stake (stone message: "protect"; Elsa's final role: guardian of souls and sailors). The action shapes two beats: interpreting the stone message and accepting the keeper role. The closure beat (lighting the lamp, stacking stones) enacts protection with visible cost (accepting isolation). The concept is irreplaceable—"rescue" or "save" would not capture the ongoing vigilance. However, the protect action is more thematic scaffold than tactical constraint; Elsa does not face a choice between protecting the ghosts vs. another priority. Strong thematic integration, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stone-stacking appears in three beats: Elsa and Jonas's prior supply arrangement (signaled in backstory), the beach message ("danger," "remember safety," "protect"), and Elsa's final message to the ghosts. The method is specific and irreplaceable—it encodes their shared language and enables the plot turn (stone message guides Elsa to the truth). The closure beat (stacking stones: "I am here. You are seen. You are not alone") recharges the method with new meaning and completes the communication loop. Mechanics matter: seven stones = danger, blue sea glass accent, collapsed pile. Early signal, middle development, closure payoff all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern room is the site of confrontation and transformation. Its glass walls, darkened lamp, and operator's chair ground the climax. The setting provides resources (the lamp that Elsa must reignite) and pressure (the dead lamp as wound, ghosts materializing in the enclosed space). However, the room does not constrain Elsa's choices—she could have had the same conversation elsewhere. The lamp's mechanics (responds to intention, not oil) are introduced late without spatial or physical challenge. Strong atmospheric contribution, moderate tactical pressure. Present in setup (dead lamp seen from skiff), developed in middle (climb), and active at closure (lamp ignition).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the lamp dies," "three hours ago," "tonight," "as dawn approached") anchors urgency and shapes Elsa's decision to come despite danger. The dead lamp creates the inciting pressure and the need for restoration. Time is tracked loosely (journey, climb, confrontation, dawn) but does not tighten tactics—Elsa does not race a clock or face escalating consequences if she delays. The lamp's darkness is more symbolic than mechanical. Present in setup (lamp flickered out three hours ago), implicit in middle (nighttime climb), and resolved at closure (dawn approaching as lamp is relit). Functional but does not create a live countdown that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is dramatized in Elsa's final action: thinking of sailors she's guided, activating the lamp, dispensing light. The motivation is seeded early (Elsa checks the light before heading to shore, "knowing it meant someone was watching"), developed through Jonas's explanation (sea glass holds memories of safety), and enacted at closure (holding that feeling to light the lamp). Visible cost: accepting isolation to provide safety for others. However, the motivation is more thematic than contested—Elsa does not weigh safety against another desire. The choice to protect is clean but not agonized. Desire is shown, not just told, and the final beat ties it to visible action and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is sustained through imagery (moonlight, phosphorescent foam, star-reflected eyes, "peculiar ache of isolation," soft luminescence, tears falling like sea glass) and modulates with pressure. Early beats carry longing and dread; the confrontation layers sorrow (Jonas's flickering form, generations of watchers); the closure shifts to relief and communion without losing the ache (ghosts weep, but the isolation remains). Tone charges the final image (tears as sea glass, stone message of presence). Coherent and purposeful, though some lines ("luminescence," "ache of isolation") state the tone rather than purely embodying it. No tonal breaks; rhythm supports the elegiac register throughout.</comment>
