<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper remains wholly passive—a witness who "never ceased their work" yet makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or foreclose options. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical summary ("truth bent like light through water") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The explorers who arrive provoke no genuine conflict; she hands them paper and demonstrates folding without stakes. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost appears; the ending restates her static witness role without dramatizing what path was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: moss-words-swan-river images recur, but no single moment crystallizes a before/after with legible cost. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, waiving the test. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing ("she had become what she documented"), yet this insight is asserted rather than demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior material—no visible or felt price appears on the page. One tightening occurs when explorers arrive, but their departure leaves no trace, flattening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library supplies vivid, selective detail—vines through volumes, phosphorescent moss, books-to-mulch—that charges atmosphere and reflects the protagonist's acceptance of decay. The obsidian refuge and underground river constrain her spatial existence and prime the ending image. Sensory hierarchy (green darkness, water murmur, spore weight) filters through her contemplative stance without tourist cataloging. The library's transformation does not directly alter a peak choice, capping the score below 8.0, but the micro-setting (refuge, river, paper swan) charges the final paragraph's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or consequence. The explorers' questions offer a potential pressure point, yet she deflects them without cost; their confusion does not alter her tactics or foreclose any path. No meaningful tightening narrows options: she folds, unfolds, sits, watches across untold seasons with no on-page reversal or trade-off. Agency reads as endurance, but the ending does not dramatize what was renounced or what price was paid to sustain her silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as continuous becoming, the futility of fixed chronicle—emerges from concrete images (books-to-moss, swan folds as map of choice) rather than overt statement. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection on impermanence. However, the final paragraph ("she had become what she documented") edges toward thesis statement, and the explorers' scene offers a near-allegory (handing paper = teaching the lesson) that clarifies rather than complicates. The mushroom-words moment and river-as-memory motif charge subtext without forcing a moral, lifting the score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping appears. Diction is controlled and elevated ("phosphorescent," "catacomb," "perpetual twilight") but remains voice-consistent across beats. Perceptual signature is legible: she notices decay, pattern, and silence in character-specific ways. However, interior texture flattens under peak moments—"crumbling peace," "delicate ecology"—into abstract summary rather than embodied sensation. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations, longer lyric clauses), and no filter-verb stacks appear. The piece earns mid-6s for clean distance and voice coherence, with the caveat that stress does not degrade diction or perception as expected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs mar the prose. Information density is high in description (refuge holds "only three things," swan folds "worn soft as silk"), yet several beats loop conceptually: "books became mulch became moss became memory" and "Facts decomposed into dreams, dreams crystallized into wisdom, wisdom dissolved back into silence" restate transformation without advancing pressure. Mixed metaphor appears in "burrowing through time itself, following root-paths of causality"—roots and burrows conflate. "Crumbling peace" recurs as a phrase without fresh context. No major scaffold or register drift; clarity remains high. Cumulative paraphrase and figurative density in the final third trigger −0.6, landing the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The underground librarian-as-witness premise offers a fresh spatial frame (catacombs, overgrown books) and the origami swan as chronicle-method carries specificity. However, the emotional arc—passive acceptance of impermanence—follows a familiar contemplative template without fresh moral calculus or surprising turn. The explorers scene gestures toward interaction but resolves predictably (she teaches, they leave confused). The mushroom-words image and book-to-ecosystem metaphor provide textural originality, yet the ending's "she had become what she documented" restates the premise rather than transforming it. Transformation test: swap names and setting, the arc of witness-without-judgment remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and her witness-stance frames the piece, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Handing paper to explorers is gestural demonstration, not a decision under pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation as an active agent; she remains static observer. Late penalty does not apply (present from start), but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any passive contemplative could fill the role) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in paragraph two, is revisited in the penultimate paragraph ("In her obsidian refuge, she would sit for hours"), and houses the three objects that define her minimal existence. It constrains her spatial world and primes the river-watching beat, but it does not enable or prevent a key choice—she could witness from any alcove. Two beats (introduction, late reprise) and closure linkage (river scene) earn mid-band, but the refuge's black polish and carved detail remain ornamental. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Regenerative silence" is named explicitly in the final section and implicitly throughout (mushroom-words disperse, books decompose and regrow). The concept frames her philosophy but does not shape an on-page decision or narrow options under stress. It operates as theme label rather than stake-driver. Present in setup (moss/growth imagery), developed thematically in middle (mushroom-words), and named at closure, satisfying all three gates but without causal pressure. Functional but replaceable with "cyclical transformation" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is explicitly stated in paragraph three ("understanding that truth bent like light through water"). The trait colors her perceptual filter (she watches time dissolve, accepts contradiction) but does not enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off. Present in setup, colors middle perception, but absent from closure participation as a lever. Swappable with "embraces ambiguity" or "rejects fixed knowledge."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears explicitly in one sentence ("learned to burrow not through earth but through time itself") and metaphorically in the final paragraph ("burrowing through existence with the patience of roots"). It operates as metaphor for her time-witnessing, not a physical action with consequences. The verb does not drive a turn; removing it and substituting "drift" or "travel" would leave structure intact. Missing middle development as causal lever; present in setup and closure as linguistic flourish only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced in paragraph two, unfolded "each morning" to reveal cryptic marks, and becomes the map of becoming in paragraph nine. Its mechanics matter: she folds and unfolds it, the creases mark choices unmade, and she demonstrates folding to explorers. Three beats (introduction, daily ritual, map revelation) and closure linkage ("folding and unfolding like an origami swan") earn solid mid-band. However, the swan does not constrain a choice under pressure—it teaches philosophy but does not prevent or enable an action with cost. Early signal, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library is introduced in paragraph one, revisited across multiple beats (book-trees, philosophy text with mushroom-words, "wilder each year"), and anchors the explorers scene and final image ("not books but an ecosystem"). It supplies the moss, vines, and ferns that embody transformation and constrains her spatial existence. The setting enables her witness-work and would fundamentally alter if removed—no other locale offers books decomposing into soil. Three-plus beats, early signal, closure participation as final metaphor, and moderate causal pressure (her role depends on this exact space) push the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" is the stated timeframe; "seven winters" of silence opens the piece, and "Seasons drifted overhead like clouds" recurs. Time is vague and does not tighten decisions—she has infinite patience, no clock pressures her. The frame allows transformation to accumulate but does not force a choice or tactic shift. Present in setup and as recurring texture, but absent as a constraint at closure. Functional for accumulative pacing, but swappable with "over countless years" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is explicitly articulated in paragraph four ("required a peculiar kind of forgetting") and demonstrated in her refusal to answer explorers. The motivation frames her actions (sitting, folding, watching) but does not generate friction or trade-off on the page—no moment where judgment threatens her stance. Present in setup, colors middle beats (explorer scene), implied in closure ("pure witness"), satisfying all three gates. However, it remains told more than dramatized under pressure, and no visible cost tied to maintaining the stance appears. Lyric reprise without causal cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is explicitly named in the penultimate paragraph and woven throughout via "decay," "dissolution," "perpetual twilight," and "regenerative silence." Tone is coherent across all beats, modulating from contemplative opening to lyric intensity in the mushroom-words moment to quiet closure. The tone charges the final image ("crumbling of all things into their next beautiful form") without static repetition. However, the piece never tensions this peace with genuine urgency or dissonance—the explorers' arrival does not destabilize her calm. Coherent and purposeful, but lacks modulation under pressure to reach higher bands.</comment>
