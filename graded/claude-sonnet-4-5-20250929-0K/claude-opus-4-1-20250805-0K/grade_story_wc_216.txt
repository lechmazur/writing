<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority relies heavily on abstract conceptual labels ("texture of time passing," "borrowed-time timekeeper") rather than embodied emotion and concrete micro-choices under pressure. The entire middle passage operates as a reflective info-dump about Voss's design without dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "choice" to gather fragments and teach others feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path appears; he simply accepts a mission that costs him nothing we can see.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural but never teaches its pattern or delivers a meaningful deepening; instead it unfolds as linear exposition: Marcus enters silo → reads ads → understands Voss's plan → leaves with new purpose. The Orientation Test is borderline (who/where/when emerge slowly but are present by ~15% mark). No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the "understanding" arrives as sudden revelation without prior friction. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the texture-of-time answer to a numbering crisis), but the cost is asserted ("borrowed though it was") rather than felt or demonstrated in a concrete image. The final paragraph moralizes the theme instead of letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo and its "crystalline walls" and "vibrations of accumulated years" supply vivid sensory detail filtered through Marcus's timekeeping lens, and the cremation urn fragment "grows warm" at a key beat, constraining his perception. Spatial choreography inside the silo remains coherent. However, the rust-colored horizon and post-numeric world receive only abstract gestures ("numbers lost their meaning") without concrete sensory consequences that would ground daily life or shape Marcus's tactics. The silo does charge the final understanding, meeting the 9+ gate, but the world outside feels generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering how to mark time after the Great Uncounting—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Marcus searches, finds exactly what the records said, reads the messages, has an epiphany, and departs; no complication or narrowing of options occurs. The "borrowed-time timekeeper" status is label-only and imposes no visible trade-off or limit on his actions. Agency is present in the decision to gather fragments and teach, but it arrives without friction, price, or a foreclosed alternative path. One tightening is required under Accumulative lens; none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme—experiencing time's texture versus counting—emerges from the premise but is stated repeatedly in the garage-sale messages and Marcus's reflections rather than enacted through scene pressure. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "The texture of time passing wasn't something to be counted—it was something to be lived, felt, and shared," converting the story into a thesis statement. The cremation urn and emerald silo function as symbolic conveniences introduced to "mean" rather than to complicate choice. No non-literal answer or resonant ambiguity survives the explain-everything ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture ("rust-colored horizon," "sandpaper of anxiety, silk of contentment, sticky tar of grief") that reflects Marcus's timekeeping lens. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "could perceive") appear frequently but stay within the contemplative voice. The middle section shifts into expository summary about Voss's design, flattening narrative distance and momentum. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks a perceptual signature sharp enough to distinguish Marcus's noticing from generic narration under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates adequately. However, the middle third loops conceptually: "She'd anticipated these mysteries" → "Each description revealed another piece" → "The borrowed-time timekeepers would become living bridges"—three consecutive paragraphs restating Voss's plan without advancing present pressure (paraphrase-loop deduction −0.4). The garage-sale ad gimmick (embedding warnings in item descriptions) strains credibility and reads as quirky ornament. Final paragraph over-explains theme, dulling the closure image. Figurative language ("beacon," "egg," "lighthouse") is functional but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. Clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—time loses numerical meaning, requiring texture-based perception—offers a speculative angle, but the execution relies on template moves: protagonist on a quest, finds prophetic messages, gains sudden understanding, accepts a teaching mission. The garage-sale cipher is clever surface detail but does not transform the familiar "ancient-knowledge-hidden-in-plain-sight" trope. Emotional specificity is absent; Marcus's borrowed-time status and his seventeen-cycle search impose no lived cost or personality. The ending recapitulates the premise as thesis rather than dramatizing a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus (borrowed-time timekeeper) is present throughout and makes the final decision to gather fragments and teach, but his choices do not create key turns—he follows a linear path of discovery without opposition or trade-offs. The "borrowed-time" trait is mentioned but never constrains an action or imposes visible cost. He observes, reads, understands, and departs; no tactic shift or foreclosed alternative appears. Setup is clear; middle involves passive reception; ending decision lacks friction. Two gates (setup, payoff) met weakly; development gate missed. Swappable with "wandering scholar" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears when Marcus lifts it (~30% mark), grows warm at the network-perception beat (~70%), and is tucked into his coat before departure (~95%). Three distinct beats; the warming moment enables his perception of the fragment network, altering his understanding. However, the fragment does not narrow options or impose cost—it simply unlocks knowledge. Specificity is present (Voss's consciousness embedded). Closure involves the fragment but Marcus's final stance would remain similar without this exact object. Strong setup, moderate development, solid payoff; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is the central object: Marcus searches for it, finds it in the silo, and extracts the garage-sale ads and urn fragment that drive his understanding. Setup is immediate; the capsule's contents constrain what Marcus learns and shape his mission. Development: the ads provide the embedded messages that reveal Voss's plan. Payoff: the capsule's treasure defines his new purpose. The concept is indispensable—remove it and the entire discovery mechanism collapses. However, the capsule itself is passive; Marcus's interaction is one-way extraction without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is attributed to the urn fragment and the emerald silo, described as existing "outside the broken chronology" and "in all moments simultaneously." Setup occurs at ~35% (fragment) and ~85% (silo). The trait enables Marcus to perceive the fragment network but does not visibly constrain or complicate his actions—it functions as a passive quality that explains rather than pressures. No trade-off or cost tied to timelessness appears on the page. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; development weak. Moderate thematic echo but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" drives the entire plot: Marcus has been searching for seventeen cycles, finds the capsule, and rediscovers Voss's embedded solution. Setup is clear in the opening; the action spans the narrative. However, the rediscovery is reception rather than struggle—he reads, understands, and accepts without complication. No failed attempt or alternative path appears. The action is central but could be replaced with "decode" or "retrieve" with minor edits. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure; limited cost. Solid integration but not indispensable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions is introduced at ~25% and provides the central puzzle: the ads carry Voss's warnings and instructions. Setup is clear; Marcus reads multiple ads that together reveal the design. Development: the method constrains what Marcus can learn (only those who look in garage sales will find it). Payoff: the method's cleverness is explicitly noted and frames his understanding. However, the mechanic is one-way—Marcus decodes but does not use or wrestle with it. Three gates met; solid causal role; moderate specificity. The method could be swapped with "encoded journal entries" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is the story's primary location, present from the opening line. Marcus presses his palm against it, feels vibrations, enters to find the capsule, and experiences the silo's resonance as it hums and materializes more ads. Setup is immediate; the silo houses the discovery and its "crystallized time" nature charges the thematic payoff. Development: the silo's hum triggers Marcus's perception shift. Payoff: the silo is Voss's "final message" and "lighthouse." All three gates met strongly. However, the silo does not impose spatial constraint or alter tactics—it functions as a passive container and thematic symbol. Solid integration; high presence; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers change meaning" is established in the opening and frames the entire premise—the Great Uncounting has made mathematics suspect and duration uncertain. Setup is immediate and pervasive. However, time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Marcus's search has lasted "seventeen cycles—or was it seventy, or seven thousand?" without urgency or consequence. The post-numeric condition is thematic context but does not pressure tactics or escalate stakes on the page. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff) met; development (time constraining choice) is absent. The timeframe is present but mostly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated repeatedly and frames his mission, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. He searches, finds, understands, and accepts his teaching role without friction between want and cost. The desire does not compete with fear or another want; no trade-off or sacrifice appears. Setup is clear; the motivation drives his presence at the silo. Development and payoff are weak—the motivation is satisfied by revelation rather than tested by pressure. Functional but not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" as tone is present in phrases like "peculiar treasure," "unexpected," and the final "anticipated mysteries were finally revealing themselves." The tone is contemplative and wonder-oriented throughout, with no modulation under pressure—discovery elicits the same measured curiosity as the opening search. Setup is clear; the tone remains static rather than charging the final image with earned pressure. Payoff: the tone is explicitly named in the closing beats but feels asserted rather than embodied. Two gates (setup, payoff label) met; development (tone shift that reweights stakes) is absent. Coherent but one-note.</comment>
