<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus shows practiced competence and earned knowledge through twelve years of work, with clear interiority around his role as transformer rather than transporter. The passenger remains thin—her distress is labeled ("breathing came too quick") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses, and her shift feels guided by Marcus's wisdom rather than her own agency. The backstory about Marcus being "once a passenger too" arrives as explanation rather than constraint on present choice. Internal conflict is present but muted; Marcus operates smoothly without meaningful friction between his wants and the situation's demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece lands Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman learns to listen differently, Marcus completes another passage) with conceptual cost implicit in the train-whistle callback. Orientation is clear early. However, the escalation is almost purely pedagogical—Marcus teaches, she receives—with no reversal or tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The storm glass vial suggests atmospheric pressure changes but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it functions as mood indicator rather than stake-shaper. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is weak; under Accumulative, the density doesn't meaningfully shift until the Mirror Gallery callback, which arrives late and feels decorative rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terraces are vividly realized with acoustic specificity (Ruby absorbs whispers, Sapphire amplifies heartbeats, Emerald echoes unspoken thoughts) and the gondola's spatial movement through refractive zones is clear throughout. The storm glass vial functions as body-object micro-setting, though it never meaningfully constrains a choice. Sensory detail is filtered through Marcus's professional expertise and the piece maintains coherent spatial choreography. The final terrace (Prism Crown) charges the ending image with "full of all the sounds that had been gently filtered," meeting the gate for closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the passenger to find comfort in curated silence—is clear and coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Marcus identifies her distress, adjusts gondola speed and route, offers wisdom, and succeeds without friction or cost. No reversal tests his commitment; the storm glass "grows warm" but doesn't force a tactical pivot. The woman's transformation from rigid to relaxed is asserted through description ("shoulders began to drop") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path. Agency rests almost entirely with Marcus, and even his actions face no resistance or price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme—silence as presence rather than absence, comfort found in attention rather than elimination—emerges clearly from the acoustic terraces and is rendered through image (train whistle transformed, echo delayed by three seconds) rather than lecture. The closing image of the woman listening to the fade without flinching offers a resonant answer. However, Marcus's final speech ("comfort isn't found in silence itself, but in learning which sounds deserve our attention") states the thesis rather than trusting the dramatization, and the storm glass "rests quiet against his heart" in the last line feels like symbolic convenience rather than thematic pressure that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as clear focalizer; perceptual signature is strong (he reads air pressure, navigates acoustic zones "like a musician reading sheet music"). The prose texture is consistent and purposeful, with diction that fits his twelve-year expertise. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; Marcus's "voice calibrated to barely disturb the air" and his completion of her sentence feel natural. The woman's interiority is accessed only through external observation, maintaining focalization discipline. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates appropriately as emotional intensity rises through the terraces.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear with varied rhythm and strong sensory anchoring. However, several passages show overwriting: "vaulting hush here wasn't empty but full—full of all the sounds" uses repetition without adding pressure, and "veils of refracted sound and light" in the penultimate paragraph elevates diction without narrative necessity. Minor scaffold appears in "another soul successfully ferried not just through space, but through understanding"—the parallel construction lands as thesis rather than image. The storm glass descriptions cycle through similar phrasing ("crystalline formations," "fluidly logical precision," "contents dance with perfect equilibrium") across three beats, creating subtle synonym churn. No loops fully obscure causality, but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The acoustic terraces with differentiated refractive properties (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Opal, Mirror Gallery, Prism Crown) offer fresh world-building specificity, and the gondola-as-therapeutic-passage frame synthesizes transit with transformation in a non-obvious way. However, the emotional arc—anxious passenger learns to embrace silence under wise guide's tutelage—follows a familiar template without meaningful subversion. The storm glass vial, while evocative, functions as atmospheric ornament rather than driving choice. The train whistle callback and the "quiet that follows" motif are purposeful but not irreplaceable; the story's logic would hold with different acoustic markers.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout, his twelve-year expertise shapes his tactical choices (adjusting gondola speed, routing through specific terraces), and his decision to "catalyze something in this passenger" drives the middle action. His role in the closure—guiding descent and reflecting on his work—participates but doesn't transform under pressure. He makes choices that alter the passenger's experience, but none foreclose a path or reveal cost to him.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in three beats (introduction, mid-journey warmth, final "rests quiet"), meeting the gate for setup, development, and closure participation. However, its function is purely atmospheric: it predicts pressure changes but never constrains Marcus's choices or enables a tactic unavailable without it. The "contents swirling faster" and later settling signal emotional weather but don't reweight the stake or create cost. Swappable with any mood-indicator object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In transit" is literalized through the gondola journey and thematized as transformation ("another soul successfully ferried not just through space, but through understanding"). The concept frames the entire structure and appears in the closure reflection. However, it doesn't constrain tactics or narrow options—the journey could pause or accelerate without cost. It shapes the metaphoric architecture more than the on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is applied twice to the storm glass vial's behavior ("fluidly logical precision," "contents dance with perfect equilibrium") but remains descriptive label without enabling or constraining action. Marcus doesn't rely on the vial's logic to make a choice, and no cost attaches to its fluid versus static state. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is explicitly named as Marcus's goal midway ("his role wasn't just transportation but transformation. He needed to catalyze something in this passenger") and drives his subsequent choices: tilting the gondola, routing through Opal Arch, explaining the terraces' function. The action shapes the middle beats and connects to closure. However, "teach" or "guide" would substitute with minimal structural change; the specificity of catalyze—implying acceleration or transformation through presence rather than instruction—isn't fully dramatized as distinct from direct pedagogy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is introduced early ("began monitoring noise levels with practiced subtlety, adjusting the gondola's speed to minimize cable vibration") and recurs in his route choices through acoustically differentiated terraces. It's a method Marcus uses throughout, not just at the end. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we see results (hum through cables, delayed echoes) but not the granular monitoring process that would make this method irreplaceable versus "guiding carefully" or "choosing the right path."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly detailed with acoustic properties that Marcus navigates tactically (Ruby absorbs, Sapphire amplifies, Emerald echoes, Opal delays, Mirror reflects, Prism Crown resolves). Each terrace affects the passenger's state and Marcus's routing choices. The setting provides resources (angle that catches breeze, delay that transforms gasp) and pressures the woman's emotional journey. It charges the final image and its removal would collapse both the world logic and the closure. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The train whistle and its echo bookend the piece: introduced early ("the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo, Marcus knew, lived a particular kind of loneliness") and returned at closure ("another train whistle echoed through the night, but this time she didn't flinch. She listened to it fade"). The timeframe is more thematic window than ticking clock—it doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics. The woman's transformation happens across the journey, not because time is running out. The reprise reweights her stance but the timeframe itself is passive container rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is articulated midway and shapes Marcus's explanations and route choices through the terraces. It drives his pedagogical approach and connects to closure when the woman learns to listen without flinching. However, the motivation is more professional mission than conflicted desire—Marcus faces no friction, no cost, no competing want. It's a job he does smoothly, not a stake he wrestles with. Functional but without the "friction between wants and costs" that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" is named once at the Prism Crown and tonally consistent throughout: the prose maintains quiet reverence, selective sound, and contemplative rhythm from the crystalline opening through the patient teaching beats to the gentle descent. Tone modulates subtly as the woman's distress eases (shorter breaths → slowed breathing → smile) without breaking the hush. The final image of resting quiet and gradual dissolution charges the ending. Coherent and controlled, integral to the conceptual frame.</comment>
