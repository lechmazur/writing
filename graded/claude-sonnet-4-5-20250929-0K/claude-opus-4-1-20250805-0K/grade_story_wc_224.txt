<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seer's internal arc—from mercury visions to soil gardening—shows contradictory impulses (prophecy consuming her past vs. desire to recover lost talents) that drive the plot. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract; the choice to plant is less a difficult decision under pressure than a lyric realization. Embodied emotion appears in "the particular ache of kneeling" and "the smell of rain," but peak moments lean toward poetic assertion rather than struggle. The final stance crystallization is earned by the stone's guidance, though the cost (abandoning prophecy) is implied rather than viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (seer), where (mountain bookstore), and when (after remembering became painful) by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the stone's arrival seeds a pattern of sensory memory that deepens through the descent, culminating in the garden as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with Charged Poise—she plants instead of seeking visions, forecloses prophecy with visible cost). One meaningful deepening occurs when she kneels and remembers her original calling. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (decades of prophecy set aside), and the inferred lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is vivid and purposeful: "books formed walls that spiraled upward," "pages made of materials that weren't quite paper," and the soil chamber with its skylight constrain the seer's journey and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her blindness (trailing fingers, texture of the stone). The garden chamber—dark soil, starlight, no books—serves as micro-setting that enables the closure action (planting). Environment shapes choice and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering a buried talent—is signaled early and tightens when the stone guides her downward. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the soil chamber and understands "not her past, but permission to plant a future." Agency is present (she chooses to plant), and the cost is legible (abandoning prophecy). However, the escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric; no external reversal or difficult trade-off tests her commitment on the page. The final act reweights options under the Accumulative lens, but pressure remains largely metaphorical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—buried talents, loss and recovery, prophecy vs. creation—emerges through concrete particulars: the mercury pools, the stone's warmth, the soil chamber, the garden that blooms with words. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "she had learned to read the future in mercury, but here she grew it from seeds." Subtext operates in images (silver-blind eyes, mercury reflecting "the shadow of who she'd been") without overt moralizing. The thematic question is earned by specific experience, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. No thematic echo or sermon in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; the seer's perceptual signature is distinct (texture-based navigation, silver dreams, memories as sensations rather than images). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("mercury-glass seer," "the texture of a feather"), with purposeful lyric compression. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but serve the contemplative voice. Distance modulates appropriately as emotional intensity rises. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts; the prose reflects the focalizer's mind and state throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or story. Some overwriting in figurative language: "the weight of ten thousand witnessed futures crushed her ability to recall," "hidden thunder rolled," and stacked metaphors around mercury/silver. A few near-paraphrases ("she'd been a gardener… had known soil and seed, had coaxed life") and template stems ("she moved… she found… she pressed"). No major loops or scaffold, but density of metaphor in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion. Clarity remains intact; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind oracle + lost gardening talent + language stone as seed + bookstore mountain—feels fresh and specific. The turn from prophecy to planting is non-obvious and earned by prior particulars (mercury visions, soil memory, the chamber without books). Tropes (oracle, mountain sanctuary, lost language) are transformed through grounded detail (books as walls, blindness from reading futures, feather-texture inscriptions). The garden that blooms with words is a bold, imaginative image that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure succeeds; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer frames expectation, drives the descent through the bookstore, and makes the climactic choice to plant. She appears in setup (opening), development (following the stone downward), and payoff (kneeling to plant, tending the garden). Her decision to kneel and plant—rather than seek more visions—narrows options and forecloses prophecy with visible cost. Two distinct beats: receiving the stone, planting it. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice is more lyric realization than agonized turn. Specificity is high (silver-blind, texture-reader, former gardener). Integration: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4, irreplaceability +0.5; minus late first full agency −0.3, swappability (could be "stone-reader seer") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, round to 6.7 for demonstrated causal work and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone arrives in the second paragraph, is held and felt in multiple beats (warming in her palm, guiding her downward, pulsing against her chest), and is planted at closure. It appears in setup, development (guides the descent, conveys memory-sensations), and payoff (pressed into soil, dissolves to seed the garden). Three distinct beats: arrival, warming/guidance, planting. Causal pressure: the stone enables the journey and the final act. Closure linkage is strong—planting the stone is the climactic action. Specificity: inscriptions "so finely that even her sensitive fingertips couldn't trace them," readable via recognition, contains "the memory of seeds." Integration: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, cap at 7.8 due to swappability (could be "memory stone" or "seed relic") −0.6 and ornamental first mention (description without immediate pressure) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Buried talents shape the seer's motivation and the thematic question from the opening ("the weight of… witnessed futures crushed her ability to recall her own past"). The concept frames the dominant stake: recovering her gardening talent. It appears in setup (her lost calling), development (memories returning as she descends), and payoff (the garden within the mountain, "buried gifts could take root and grow"). The stone contains "the memory of seeds, the potential of seeds, the promise that buried talents could grow again." Two distinct beats: realization of the buried talent, planting/tending it. Causal pressure is moderate—it guides her choice but does not constrain tactics. Closure linkage: the final image directly enacts the concept. Integration: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5; minus abstract theme claim (concept stated rather than fully embodied in constraint) −0.7, swappability (generic "lost gift" structure) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, round to 6.4 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality with visions drawn from mercury pools" is introduced early and appears in multiple beats: nightly visions, searching for what she'd lost, mercury reflecting "the shadow of who she'd been." The trait shapes her identity and loss but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost during the story's window. It defines backstory and sets up the contrast (visions vs. planting), but the active choice at closure is to stop seeking visions, not to use them under pressure. Setup present, development weak (the trait explains her state but doesn't enable or block a tactic), payoff indirect (she plants "for the first time since prophecy had claimed her"). Integration: early signal +0.5, one beat (contrast at closure) +0.4, thematic linkage +0.6; minus ornamental use (described but not dramatized) −0.7, summary-only (past habit recounted) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Seeding/planting is the climactic action: "she planted," "creating small furrows, spacing them properly," "seeded the chamber with fragments of the lost language." The action resolves the dominant stake, enacts the buried talent, and produces the garden that blooms with words. It appears in setup (implied by her lost gardening past), development (the stone's message about seeds), and payoff (the planting itself, then months later the green shoots). Three distinct beats: stone as seed, planting, garden growth. Causal pressure is high—the action redefines her role from oracle to gardener. Closure linkage is total. Irreplaceability: no other action would complete the arc (she must plant, not merely decide or speak). Integration: early implicit signal +0.4, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.8, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.5 = 9.5, cap at 8.6 due to summary in final beat (months later growth is told, not shown) −0.4 and minor swappability (could be "grow" or "cultivate") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Via the texture of a feather" appears when she holds the stone against her cheek: "she felt its message like the texture of a feather—soft warnings brushing against her consciousness." The method is signaled once in the middle third and does not shape subsequent attempts or constrain tactics. It is poetic but ornamental—she could receive the message via warmth, sound, or vision without altering the plot. Setup absent, development minimal (one descriptive beat), payoff absent (the planting itself does not use this method). Integration: one beat +0.4, specificity +0.4; minus late first appearance (second third) −0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.9 = 2.9, lift to 4.8 for vivid sensory image that supports the seer's texture-based perception.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is established early: "ancient books formed walls that spiraled upward," "she navigated the labyrinthine bookstore by trailing her fingers along leather spines." It constrains her journey (she must move downward through sections), supplies resources (the stone is found "wedged between volumes of dead alphabets"), and provides the soil chamber at the mountain's heart where planting occurs. Three distinct beats: navigation, descent through older sections, arrival at the chamber. Causal pressure: the setting enables the descent and the final act. Closure linkage: the chamber without books is where she plants. Micro-setting (the soil chamber) charges the final image. Integration: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, minus minor swappability (could be "vast library" or "cathedral of books") −0.3. Round to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is signaled early: "when remembering became painful—when the weight of ten thousand witnessed futures crushed her ability to recall her own past." The timeframe establishes the seer's current state and motivates her search, but it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Setup strong, development weak (the past pain is context, not constraint), payoff indirect (the garden helps visitors "remember who they'd been before loss reshaped them"). One beat: the opening establishes the painful remembering; the closure echoes it thematically. Integration: early signal +0.7, one beat +0.4, thematic linkage +0.6; minus vague tracking (no on-page moment when pain intensifies) −0.6, swappability (generic "after loss" timeframe) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, lift to 5.9 for clean thematic setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is dramatized through the seer's search in mercury visions and her realization: "understanding at last the shape of home—not a place returned to, but a talent recovered and transformed." The motivation is signaled early (searching for "something she'd lost"), developed through the descent (memories returning as sensations), and resolved at closure (planting as homecoming). Two distinct beats: searching, understanding. The desire is conflicted—prophecy vs. original calling—and the final choice enacts the motivation with visible cost (abandoning visions). Integration: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5, irreplaceability +0.5; minus abstract phrasing ("shape of home" is poetic but could be "sense of belonging") −0.5, partial summary (realization is asserted) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, round to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears as "something thundered in the distance—not sound but possibility, hidden in the mountain's bones" and returns in the final paragraph: "Hidden thunder rolled through the mountain's passages whenever someone discovered the garden, that quiet rumble of recognition." The tone is coherent—quiet, resonant, charged with potential—and modulates with the seer's descent and planting. It appears in setup (implied by the mountain's depth), development (the thundering possibility when she plants), and payoff (the thunder as ongoing recognition). Two beats: planting, final image. The tone charges the closure without overwhelming it. Integration: early implicit signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6; minus late explicit mention (second half) −0.3, lyric ornament (the thunder is metaphorical, not a constraint) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, lift to 6.3 for purposeful early → final reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>
