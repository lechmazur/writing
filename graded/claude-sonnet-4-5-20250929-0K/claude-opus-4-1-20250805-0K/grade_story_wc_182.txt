<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear (find the library) and her expertise in dead languages creates her solution, but interiority remains thin—we never feel contradictory impulses or embodied cost during her choices. The amber-trapped seekers and time traveler function as props rather than relational pressure. Her offer to "complete the diary" arrives smoothly but without prior struggle or visible trade-off that would earn the transformation; the mountain simply accepts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through deepening layers (three chambers, trap room, amber chamber) with image accumulation (humming books, singing volumes, glowing specimens). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's offer transforms the library from hoard to garden, releasing seekers. Cost is present but oblique: the diary's blank pages fill with silver text, implying future labor, though the immediate cost to Mira remains abstract. Orientation anchors quickly (mountain door, bookstore, three levels down) and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore provides vivid, layered detail (shelves carved into granite, circular trap room, amber-preserved seekers) and the setting constrains choice in the trap room where Mira must solve the book-sequence puzzle. The botanical diary as micro-object charges the ending when its blank pages become the payment. Spatial choreography remains clear across descents, though the mountain's rearranging nature is declared but never pressures a tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach the library of unlearned lessons) signals early and tightens through three obstacles: the rearranging passages, the circular trap room, and the final negotiation. The trap room provides one meaningful reversal where gap-pattern recognition unlocks progress. However, the climactic negotiation lacks friction—the mountain accepts Mira's first offer without counter-pressure, and the cost (filling blank pages) remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image: unlearned lessons as "pressed flowers," seekers frozen mid-reach, and the shift from hoard to garden. The ending offers a non-literal answer (knowledge as seeds, not artifacts) that reweights prior material. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("turning unlearned lessons into seeds of future wisdom") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The mountain's question and Mira's answer feel slightly thesis-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices linguistic patterns, gaps, and encoded directions—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("consuming Mount Erebis from within, its corridors spiraling through hollowed rock like the chambers of an ancient heart") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The mountain's voice ("What will you offer that they could not?") reads cleanly. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("translucent amber that smelled of forgotten gardens," "book bound in condensed starlight"). Minor template cadence in the opening ("had consumed," "had arrived," "had belonged") and occasional filter-verb stacks ("noticed how," "understood she would need"). The trap-room sequence demonstrates good information density. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, though early exposition is slightly front-loaded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise (living mountain bookstore of unlearned lessons) combines familiar fantasy elements—sentient libraries, time travelers, ancient passwords—without a sharp transformative angle. The botanical diary's "gaps as map" offers a clever twist, and the shift from extraction to dissemination provides thematic freshness. However, the emotional arc (lone expert solves puzzle, releases trapped seekers) follows a recognizable template. The piece demonstrates competent synthesis rather than bold reimagining.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (arcane linguist) signals early, her expertise enables key beats: whispering the password (entry), speaking titles in dead languages (trap room), and speaking "in the mountain's own tongue" (negotiation). Her linguistics shape three distinct beats and the closure hinges on her language skill. However, the negotiation turn feels smooth rather than hard-won—her expertise solves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in paragraph one, guides Mira's descent through encoded directions (paragraph two), glows in response to the mountain's acoustics (paragraph four), and its blank pages become the payment mechanism at closure (paragraphs seven and nine). Present across four beats with evolving function; the final reprise reweights it from artifact to living contract. The cost (filling blank pages with future knowledge) is tied to the diary specifically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rescue missions" appear thematically (the bookstore "conducting rescue missions for lost knowledge," the amber chamber as "museum of failed rescue missions," seekers' "rescue missions finally complete") but the concept does not constrain Mira's tactics on the page. She does not frame her approach as rescue until the ending paragraph. Present but more as motif than causal driver; the core conflict centers on negotiation and access rather than rescue logistics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is demonstrated when Mira marks her path with silver silk threads (paragraph three) to navigate the rearranging bookstore and when she pulls "phantom books from her memory" to solve the trap room (paragraph five). Two visible instances where forethought enables progress. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or create cost—the preparations succeed without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is signaled in paragraph six ("would need to renegotiate the ancient contract"), executed in paragraphs eight and nine when Mira offers to complete the diary, and the mountain's acceptance ("Accepted") drives the closure transformation. The renegotiation is the structural hinge; prior seekers failed because they came to "take," and Mira's reframing (document and plant, not hoard) defines the resolution. Swapping this action would break the ending logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" appears early (paragraph two: "researching gaps in the diary's entries"), enables the trap-room solution (paragraph five: "studied the gaps in the room's logic," "missing spines creating a pattern"), and pays off when the diary's "blank pages—the gaps she'd researched" become the offering (paragraph eight). The method shapes two beats and closure participation. Specificity is high; gap-research is irreplaceable for this ending logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying Mount Erebis is present from the opening, provides escalating obstacles (rearranging passages, trap room, amber chamber), and the setting's sentience becomes the negotiating partner at closure. The bookstore's logic (testing visitors, preserving seekers) structures the conflict. The mountain's voice and acceptance drive the final transformation. The setting is causally active across all major beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" is mentioned in paragraph two ("mere hours after") and the time traveler is found frozen in amber, but the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten Mira's choices on the page. No countdown, no risk of being too late; the time traveler's prior arrival sets up mystery but does not pressure tactics. Functional but replaceable framing device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To find the library of unlearned lessons" is stated early (paragraph two) and drives Mira's descent through all beats. However, the motivation is told and goal-directed rather than conflicted—we learn she wants to reach it but not what internal friction or competing desire complicates the pursuit. The goal shapes action but lacks embodied want-versus-cost tension until the ending reframe (take versus plant).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" is introduced in paragraph four ("books began to sing... pure meaning... unheard symphony"), recurs when the amber cracks ("the books' symphony swelled into something almost audible"), and the tone of knowledge-as-music threads through the piece. The tone modulates from inaudible to "almost audible" at closure, supporting the transformation theme. However, the tone effect is more metaphorical gloss than pressure-charging device; it enriches atmosphere without constraining choice.</comment>
