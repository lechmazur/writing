<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect the Ninth Island is clear and her action of swallowing the seed drives the memory sequence, but her revelation about "conscious paradox" arrives as a delivered insight rather than emerging from concrete struggle. The contradiction-discovery moment works, yet the final ledger entry feels more like authorial thesis than earned character stance. Internal conflict is present but resolved through epiphany rather than a choice that costs her something visible on the page. Embodied emotion is thin; most pressure lives in concept rather than visceral particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds pressure through multiplying contradictions and reaches Conceptual Repricing when Mira reclassifies the island, reweighting the premise with a new taxonomy. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (challenging the Council, using an unprecedented classification), and the knowledge-fruit sequence causally enables the final judgment. One meaningful deepening occurs when contradictory memories force Mira to shift her interpretive frame. Minor slip: the "quantum folklore" label feels slightly imposed rather than inevitable, nudging the score below 7.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient ridge with ghost orchids and the approaching monsoon establish atmospheric pressure and a ticking clock. However, setting detail remains largely ornamental—neither the ridge's spatial properties nor the orchids constrain Mira's choices during the key memory-interpretation sequence. The monsoon's three-day deadline disappears once she swallows the seed; the climactic classification scene could occur anywhere. Micro-setting (the seed in her palm) recurs but does not materially alter tactics at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the Ninth Island survives—is signaled early and Mira's swallowing of the seed tightens pressure by forcing interpretation of contradictory data. The contradiction discovery deepens the problem once, and her final classification reweights the outcome. Yet escalation is conceptual rather than agonistic; no visible trade-off or live option is foreclosed. The monsoon's arrival and the island's survival feel declarative rather than earned by Mira's specific tactical sacrifice. Cost is conceptual (Council challenge) but not felt in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—reality sustained by multiplicity rather than singular truth—emerges from the contradictory memories and is crystallized in Mira's "quantum folklore" classification. The ghost orchids' final image (each petal a different version) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("what could be more real than the stories we tell...") that edges into stating the moral rather than embodying it. Subtext operates in the memory sequences but the ending tilts declarative. The piece invites reflection but the final paragraph over-explains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is present in phrases like "heavier than grief" and "luminous doubt." However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, writerly register that sits awkwardly with a field assessor's pragmatic task—"empirically whimsical," "interpreted dreams," "prismatic rather than singular" feel more like authorial gloss than Mira's working lexicon. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice reads more as lyric narrator than embodied character under occupational pressure. No dialogue to judge. Compression at peak beats (memory sequence) works, but the final paragraph's syntactic uniformity and thematic articulation weaken voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant ("translucent as forgotten names," "heavier than grief"), but density tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats—multiple metaphors per sentence without all earning their space. The closing paragraph stacks three rhetorical questions and summary statements that loop thematically rather than propel. Minor paraphrase: "empirically whimsical warmth—measurable yet inexplicable" restates the same idea. No major template cadence or grammar breaks, but information density dips in the final third where telling replaces image. Filter-verb use is light and purposeful. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—floating islands judged for survival, collective memory as quantum superposition—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative and philosophical elements. The "reality checker" role and knowledge-fruit mechanism are specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc (inspector discovers deeper truth, challenges authority) follows a familiar template. The contradiction-resolution move (paradox as strength) is conceptually interesting but not transformed through deeply particular lived detail or unexpected moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its premise and the ghost orchids' final reprise adds resonance, lifting it into mid-6s despite some writerly safety in the thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's role as reality checker frames the premise and her choice to swallow the seed initiates the memory sequence. Her final classification decision directly alters the island's fate and challenges the Council. Present in setup, drives middle exploration, and delivers closure through active judgment with conceptual cost. The character is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed appears early (setup), is physically swallowed to trigger the memory dive (middle action), and reforms glowing in her palm at closure, symbolically affirming the classification. It constrains Mira's method of investigation and returns with reweighted meaning. Three distinct beats: introduction, ingestion, and final reprise. Specific properties (contains collective memory) matter; a generic device would require different mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Collective memory is the dominant stake: Mira must interpret it to judge the island's survival. The contradictory memories create the central problem, forcing her to abandon consensus-reality assumptions. The final classification ("quantum folklore") directly names and resolves the collective-memory paradox. The concept shapes every beat from inciting seed to closure taxonomy. Removing it collapses story logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is introduced early and applied to the seed's warmth and later to the island's nature. It operates thematically to signal paradox but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost—Mira's interpretation process would proceed similarly if described differently. The phrase recurs but remains more tonal label than causal lever. Present in setup and thematically charged at closure, but swappable with "paradoxical" or "contradictory" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Waken" appears in Mira's whispered command and again when she "felt herself beginning to waken—not from sleep but from the assumption that reality required consensus." This realization drives her shift in interpretive frame, which enables the final classification. The metaphorical waking shapes the key turn but could be reframed as "understand" or "recognize" with moderate edits. Present in setup and middle; participates in closure via thematic residue but is not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through interpreted dreams" describes the knowledge-fruit mechanism: Mira walks the "interpreted dreams of ten thousand souls." The method is signaled early (seed contains memory), structures the middle exploration (memory corridors), and the interpretive act yields the paradox discovery that drives closure. The phrase itself is somewhat ornamental, but the dream-interpretation process is functionally necessary—without it, Mira has no access to contradictory data. Two beats: ingestion and corridor sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient ridge with blooming ghost orchids anchors the opening and closing images. The orchids return in the final paragraph ("each petal a different version"), reweighting the multiplicity theme. However, the ridge does not constrain Mira's choices—she could perform the classification anywhere. The setting provides atmosphere and a lyric frame but no tactical pressure. Setup and closure reprise qualify it for mid-band; lack of middle involvement and causal constraint cap it here.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The three-day monsoon deadline is declared in the opening but disappears once Mira swallows the seed. The storm arrives at the end, but its timing does not force a trade-off or alter Mira's classification decision—she writes at her own pace. Time is mentioned (setup) and the rain begins at closure, but the clock does not tighten tactics in the middle. Functional but largely ornamental; removing the deadline would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to protect cultural memory from erasure—is established early, tested when she encounters contradictory data, and fulfilled when she classifies the island to ensure survival. The desire drives her choice to swallow the seed and her final ledger entry despite anticipated Council challenge. Friction between methodological rigor (consensus reality) and cultural preservation creates internal conflict. Present across all three gates with visible cost (professional risk). Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is named in the memory sequence ("each memory blazed with luminous doubt") and recurs in the final image via the glowing seed and uncertain island edges. The tone—wonder tinged with epistemological uncertainty—is coherent and modulates from investigative calm to conceptual revelation. It charges the closure image and supports the paradox theme. However, tone alone does not constrain choice; it enriches but is not mechanically indispensable. Setup, middle coloring, and closure reprise place it solidly in mid-6s.</comment>
