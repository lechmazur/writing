<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to find Pattern User 4827 is clear and intensifies toward a decisive choice with visible cost—she becomes Pattern User 8625, forfeiting her existence as she knew it. The mission patch provides embodied emotional weight tied to her father's disappearance, and her professional skill (data archaeology) drives her agency throughout. Minor deduction: the internal contradiction between wanting to solve the mystery and willingly entering the same fate could be sharpened; the shift from investigator to archived feels slightly abrupt, though the groundwork is present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (corporate memory keeper, SocialSync archive, searching for Pattern User 4827). The drive lens is Causal: Lila discovers coordinates → ghost profiles → shadow network → realizes users are archived, then chooses to join them. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she initiates the protocol, transforms into Pattern User 8625, leaving behind only breadcrumbs. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes her father followed the same pattern. Cost is legible on the page: "leaving behind only a mission patch and recurring numbers."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid and specific: "towers of obsolete servers," "substrata," "spaces between legitimate data packets." Micro-setting (the mission patch) recurs and charges the final moment. Setting constrains choice: the archive's structure guides her descent through layers, and the Apollo-X frequency link makes the discovery feel inevitable. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor gap: the "office between floors" detail could pressure one mid-scene choice more directly to reach the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: find where deleted files (and missing persons) go. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lila realizes users are compressed into the archive and her father is among them, raising the personal cost. The final choice—initiating the protocol—narrows options and forecloses her prior existence with visible cost. Agency is strong: she creates breadcrumbs before transforming. Minor deduction: the escalation from discovery to choice could be stretched by one beat to show her weighing the decision under more friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "absence is just another form of presence" crystallizes through the archive's sensed void, ghost profiles, and compressed consciousness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"they go home"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. The mission patch motif shifts meaning from loss (father's disappearance) to legacy (breadcrumb for the next keeper). The piece resists tidy resolution: Lila's transformation is ambiguous (liberation or entrapment?), inviting reflection without confusion. No thematic statement intrudes on scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with appropriate narrative distance; perceptual signature (data archaeologist noticing patterns) is consistent. Diction remains within Lila's lexicon: "brightly attentive," "breadcrumbs," technical terms like "RGB values" and "metadata." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during discovery beats. Minor deduction: a few constructions lean slightly expository ("she'd seen it once before, in the corrupted files from the Apollo-X mission") where elision or brief flashback would be sharper. The phrase "sensed absence" recurs purposefully but borders on explaining what has been shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, figurative language is controlled ("graveyard of deleted profiles," "infinite library"), and information density is high—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "brightly attentive" reads slightly precious and recurs without embodied stakes; "the echo of forgotten songs" in the penultimate paragraph is elevated but vague, a rare moment of overwriting. Filter verbs ("noticed," "recognized," "realized") cluster in discovery beats, dulling immediacy slightly. Overall propulsion is clean and the closure image lands crisply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise (digital afterlife via archived data) is familiar but executed with specificity: the shadow network, frequency modulation through liked posts, and the Apollo-X mission link add fresh texture. The transformation of "missing persons cold case" into "archived consciousness" is a non-obvious synthesis. Minor deduction: the core concept echoes recognizable "trapped in the digital" templates; the story transforms it through detail (recipe-as-coordinates, timestamp-encoded messages) but does not fully transcend the premise's familiarity. Risk-taking is present (Lila's choice to become Pattern User 8625) and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila (corporate memory keeper) drives every beat: she searches, decodes coordinates, follows ghost profiles, realizes the truth, and chooses transformation. Her role enables the investigation and her decision creates the closure. Present early, active throughout, and causally essential to the ending. Removing her occupation would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mission patch appears in paragraph 1 ("her father's final gift"), returns with emotional weight when she realizes the truth ("felt warm against her chest"), and is left behind at closure ("leaving behind only a mission patch"). Early seed and final reprise reweight the dominant stake (finding deleted files becomes finding her father). However, it does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; its role is primarily symbolic resonance rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case is the inciting stake ("another missing person whose digital footprint ended abruptly"), drives the search through Pattern User 4827, and is revealed as the archive's mechanism ("each person had discovered something they shouldn't have"). The concept shapes Lila's tactics (following metadata, decoding ghost profiles) and is reweighted at closure (they're not missing, they're archived). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is mentioned once early ("brightly attentive to anomalies others overlooked") and enables her to notice the recurring 4827 pattern, but the trait is not dramatized in action or tested under friction. Label-only; could be replaced with "observant" or "perceptive" without structural change. No visible cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila lies to her supervisor ("Just a coincidence") in paragraph 4, enabling her to continue the investigation without interference. The lie appears early and permits the search, but it does not return or face consequence at closure. Functional but replaceable: she could have omitted the detail or deflected without a direct lie. One causal beat, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (4827) appear in metadata, drive the search ("timestamp intervals, file sizes, RGB values"), guide discovery of coordinates and ghost profiles, and are revealed as a frequency tied to Apollo-X. The method is signaled early, shapes multiple investigative beats, and is reinterpreted at closure (8625, her new pattern). Essential to the plot's mechanism and the thematic reveal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The social network archive is the arena for all action: "towers of obsolete servers," "substrata," "shadow network," and "spaces between legitimate data packets." Setting provides the resources (cached databases, deletion logs, backup systems) and pressures Lila's tactics (following layers, decoding ghost profiles). The archive's structure is inseparable from the mystery and closure. Removing it would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once near the ending as atmospheric phrasing, not a functional timeframe. The story unfolds in present action (Lila's investigation) with no clock pressure or temporal constraint dramatized. Ornamental; does not shape decisions or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find where deleted files go") is stated early, drives every beat (search, decode, realize, join), and culminates in the closure choice (Lila becomes an archived file herself). Friction is present: she must forfeit her existence to find the answer. Desire and cost are inseparable, and the final image ("they go home") delivers the answer with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" is coherent and modulates with pressure: the archive's "emptiness that was presence," "spaces between legitimate data packets," and "shadow network" maintain the tone throughout. The final image ("space between deletion and existence") charges the tone with closure weight. The phrase "sensed absence" recurs purposefully but leans slightly label-like in one instance, preventing the highest band.</comment>
