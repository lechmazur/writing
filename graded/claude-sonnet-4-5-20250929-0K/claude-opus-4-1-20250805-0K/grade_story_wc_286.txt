<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to understand timeline resistance is established early and drives her journey, but her interior life remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The potter's muscle memory and measured movements provide embodied detail, yet critical choices feel more like recognitions than decisions under pressure. The final understanding arrives as epiphany rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "patient as fired clay" analogy and craft metaphors are consistent but risk becoming decorative rather than constraining actual on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mei seeks, arrives, observes through the lantern glass, understands, departs. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph two), and the closure offers Conceptual Repricing—the oasis resists fracture through harmonious care, reweighting Mei's quest. The cost is oblique: she carries knowledge but departs without acting, a stance crystallization with felt opportunity cost. The structure is single-scene, single-POV, fitting Track A defaults. However, the middle lacks a meaningful complication or deepening beyond observation; the lantern glass reveals rather than tests, and no live option is foreclosed with visible friction on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, stone well, and hexagonal hive arrangement are vivid and purposeful. The oasis functions as more than backdrop: hive positioning explains temporal stability, and Mei's seated posture at the well mirrors her wheel work, charging the space with her craft identity. Sensory detail is selective—cracked earth, thrumming glass, flattened smoke—and filtered through Mei's potter's perception. The micro-setting (lantern glass against her spine, hives catching sun) constrains her interpretive choices and directly enables the closure insight, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists timeline fractures—is signaled early and sustained. Mei's arrival and glass-aided observation constitute one meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge. However, no reversal or trade-off occurs; the glass reveals without cost, and Mei's agency is purely receptive. The flattened smoke signals synchronization, but this is environmental luck rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The ending forecloses return "until timelines heal," a mild opportunity cost, but the decision feels more like narrative closure than a choice under pressure that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: care-as-temporal-anchor, natural rhythms resisting chaos, craft patience versus world-burning haste. The beekeepers' "patient dance" and Mei's wheel rhythm interweave without overt statement, and the final image—pots thrown to wing-rhythm—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The lantern glass "phototropic to kindness" risks symbolic convenience but earns its presence by driving the middle revelation. Minor slip: "something both ancient and endlessly beginning" flirts with abstraction in the closing line, though the prior image anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Mei's perceptual signature—potter's metaphors, sun-reading, measured steps "precise as throwing porcelain"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is elevated but fits an artisan's interior voice. No dialogue to assess. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed during travel, expansive during revelation. Minor register drift: "phototropic to kindness" and "temporal anchor" edge toward authorial vocabulary rather than strict POV lexicon, though they remain legible. No head-hopping or POV leakage detected.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character memory, or world logic. "The glass thrummed against her spine" and "pale green like memory, cracked like the world itself" demonstrate vivid specificity. However, craft metaphors recur heavily: "patient as fired clay," "like glaze settling on bisqueware," "precise as throwing porcelain." While voice-consistent, the pattern risks mechanical template cadence across high-pressure beats. The phrase "or perhaps tomorrow" and "or was it four?" are purposeful disorientation cues that pay off, but the figurative density in paragraph eight ("flooding through her like glaze settling") slightly muddies momentum. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—fractured timelines stabilized by care and solar rhythm—offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic, temporal, and craft themes. Beekeeping as temporal anchor is non-obvious and well-integrated. However, the emotional arc could play unchanged in another setting (pilgrimage to understand resilience), and the "phototropic to kindness" concept, while inventive, risks whimsy without deeper cost. The story commits fully to its vision and avoids hedging, but the resolution arrives through revelation rather than earned struggle, softening the ingenuity of execution. No proximity to famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mei's potter identity shapes perception (wheel rhythm, throwing metaphors, measured steps) and her motivation (understanding through craft patience). She appears in all three gates: setup (crossing wasteland), development (seated observation), payoff (final understanding). However, her choices are largely observational—arriving, looking, departing—rather than tactical decisions under constraint. The craft lens enables interpretation but does not force a trade-off or alter her approach with visible cost. Two beats (travel, revelation) involve her, but neither narrows options through her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early (paragraph two), thrums harder as Mei approaches (paragraph four), reveals past/future oasis states (paragraph four), reaches crescendo then stops (paragraph eight), and gains "faint golden tint" in the final departure (paragraph nine). Present in all three gates with escalating function. It enables the key revelation—seeing beekeepers across time—and its phototropic property explains why Mei was drawn here. The "thrumming" recurs across four distinct beats, each advancing understanding. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the glass functions more as revelation tool than constraint; swapping it for another divinatory object would require only modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame the world (paragraph one: "fractured timelines made counting difficult"), explain the oasis's uniqueness (paragraph three: "resisted timeline fractures"), and drive Mei's quest. The concept shapes the dominant stake and enables the middle revelation (seeing "all these moments simultaneously"). Present in setup, development, and payoff. However, the timelines function more as setting condition than active constraint—they explain the problem but do not alter Mei's tactics or force difficult choices on the page. The cost is conceptual (world damage) rather than immediate trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is introduced mid-story (paragraph six, just past the 50% mark), explaining why the glass led Mei here. It reframes prior thrumming as attraction to care-saturated places, a causal reveal that reweights the setup. Present in development and payoff (the glass gains "golden tint, borrowed from the memory of honey"). The trait enables understanding but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—Mei does not choose between kindness-sites or sacrifice to follow it. Late introduction (−0.3) and label-only use without trade-off (−0.5) lower the score, but causal reframing and closure tint lift it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The thrumming appears in four distinct beats: initial sensation (paragraph two), intensification on approach (paragraph four), crescendo at revelation (paragraph eight), and cessation that opens auditory space for "ghost of wings" (paragraph eight). It drives Mei's route, signals proximity to the answer, and its stopping marks the moment of full understanding—a clear turn. Irreplaceable in its escalating sensory signature. Present in all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage. The action is specific and vocalized repeatedly, shaping both tactics (Mei follows the thrum) and the revelation's timing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sun patterns appear early as Mei's navigation method ("sun patterns she'd learned to read in the clay's drying cracks," paragraph two) and recur as the oasis's secret: hives "faced the sun's path perfectly" to create temporal harmony (paragraph five). The method shapes both journey (how Mei arrives) and revelation (why the oasis endures). Present in all three gates. It drives two key beats—navigation and understanding—and charges the final image ("The sun would guide her hands"). The mechanics are signaled and matter causally. Slight swappability (another natural pattern could substitute with edits) prevents top-band, but integration is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The oasis appears in setup (Mei's destination, paragraph one), dominates development (arrival, observation, sitting by the well), and anchors payoff (she will return here to throw pots). The hexagonal hive arrangement directly explains temporal stability—environment as answer. The stone well provides the seated observation point, and the "shade of rebuilt hives" charges the final image. The oasis functions as both mystery and solution, micro-setting and conceptual anchor. It constrains Mei's interpretive work (the hives' positioning is the key data) and supplies the closure's spatial grounding. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; impossible to swap without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flattened chimney smoke appears mid-story (paragraph seven) as a synchronization signal: "When smoke flattened, the timelines briefly synchronized, allowing her to see clearly." It enables the vision of "hundred beekeepers across a hundred years" in the next paragraph, a key revelation beat. Present in development and payoff (the vision is crucial to understanding). However, it arrives late (~60% mark, −0.4) and functions as environmental cue rather than tightening clock—Mei does not race the smoke's dissipation or make trade-offs against time pressure. The timeframe expands understanding but does not alter tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mei's desire "to understand why some places resist change" is established in paragraph three and sustained throughout. It drives her three-lifetime search, her careful approach to the oasis, her glass-aided observation, and her departure with "the answer she'd sought." The motivation is tested against effort (crossing wasteland, repeated searches) and rewarded with insight, then foreclosed by the implicit wait "for the world to remember." Present in all three gates with strong causal linkage. The friction is mild—no competing want forces a sacrifice—but the endurance cost (lifetimes seeking, deferred action) is legible. Dramatized through journey and revelation rather than told-only internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone blends precision and gentleness: "measured steps, her movements precise as throwing porcelain," "patient as fired clay," "soft purr," "ghost of contentment." Sharpness appears in the scorched wasteland, cracked earth, and "great burning," while gentleness pervades Mei's craft patience and the beekeepers' care. The tone remains coherent through the journey and modulates subtly—compressed during travel, expansive during revelation, quiet at departure. It charges the final image: "throw pots in the shade of rebuilt hives, her wheel turning to the rhythm of wings." The juxtaposition of devastation and tenderness supports theme without jarring. No static mood; the tone deepens as understanding grows, fitting Accumulative design.</comment>
