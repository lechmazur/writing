<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and specific ("methodically curious nature demanding precision"), and her motivation to understand silence and empathy drives her physical journey. However, the final choice to visit the moorland feels inevitable rather than a genuine decision under competing pressures—she encounters no internal contradiction or friction that might foreclose another path. The "shielded openness" transformation is asserted more than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present but sometimes drifts toward therapy-speak ("protection without isolation, revelation without exposure").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pattern accumulation (torn map, videos, oil marks, gestures) builds toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara adds her palm to the map and commits to the journey. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—her decision to visit the coordinates and her palm-press—lands on the page with felt cost (she leaves her solitary, archival work to physically engage the sacred space), though the cost could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the chapel's purpose and her role in continuing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (rain hammering skylights, water stains spreading like continents, flaking fresco eyes). The torn map becomes a micro-setting that constrains her investigation and charges the final image when she presses her palm to it. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The vault's physical properties—damage, water, UV light—enable her discovery and guide her choices, elevating the setting beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the henge's location and the chapel's silent communication—is signaled early and tightens through the video comparison and map analysis. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the homeless teenagers are unknowing participants, reweighting her investigation from archival to participatory. Agency is present in her decision to film herself and visit the coordinates, though these feel more like fulfillment than choices that narrow competing options. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: torn maps, silent gestures, oil marks as invisible writing, empathy communicated through presence rather than words. The final image of her palm on the torn edge offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how knowledge travels across silence. No overt moralizing. The fresco of Abraham's sacrifice operates as meaningful subtext (hearing what was never spoken) without heavy-handedness. The closing paragraph risks stating theme too directly ("proof that empathy needs no language") but the final sentence recovers with a more oblique formulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices cartographic hesitations, deliberate damage patterns, and oil-mark coordinates—observations filtered through her thirty years of expertise. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during analysis, wider during historical reflection). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though a few phrases drift toward elevated register ("shielded openness," "prophetic transformation"). No head-hopping. The prose reflects her methodical mind through syntax and rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, several passages show template-cadence patterns and near-paraphrase loops: "She understood now why she had been drawn here" followed immediately by restating the henge's nature; "the same angle, the same vault, the same frescoes" is echoed by "those same gestures" two paragraphs later. Filter-verb stacks appear in the video-comparison sequence ("she could see it clearly," "She understood now"). Minor clarity issues don't touch closure but accumulate to −0.6 in this category under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartographic expertise, silent communication, and participatory archiving through touch offers a fresh angle on the "hidden sacred site" premise. The torn map as both damage and message, and skin oils as invisible coordinates, demonstrate specific ingenuity. The video-comparison method and the concept of "shielded openness" feel particular to this story. However, the emotional arc—solitary expert finds larger community through patient study—follows a recognizable template. The piece commits fully to its premise and resists the safety middle, though the stakes remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's perceptive work (reading torn maps, comparing videos, discovering oil-mark coordinates) creates the key turn when she realizes the henge's location and the chapel's ongoing purpose. Her decision to film herself and visit the coordinates in the final third directly stems from her map-reading insight. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure participation. However, the final choice feels confirmatory rather than a high-cost decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ancient henge is the investigation's target but remains abstract—described only through satellite imagery showing "nothing visible, just moorland and sheep paths." It appears in setup (discovered through map damage), middle (coordinates identified), and ending (Elara's tomorrow-plan), meeting gate requirements. Yet it is never handled, used, or dramatized on the page; all interaction is deferred to the future. The henge shapes the dominant stake but does not constrain present choices or charge the closure image with its own properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Whispered Chapel concept shapes stakes and tactics throughout: Elara investigates why it was called that, understands its purpose (confessions in silence), realizes the homeless teenagers continue its ritual, and decides to "reopen the chapel, not its doors but its purpose." The concept alters her understanding from archival restoration to participatory continuation. It appears in setup (monks' naming), middle (video analysis of gestures), and ending (her filmed testimony). The final paragraph explicitly ties closure to the whispered/silence paradox.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is shown through her frame-by-frame video synchronization, UV-light examination, and "demanding precision." The trait enables her discovery of the oil-mark coordinates and constrains her approach (systematic rather than intuitive). However, it functions more as consistent characterization than a choice with visible trade-off or cost. Present in setup and middle beats but does not create friction or foreclose a path at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The action "reopen" appears explicitly in the third quarter: "She would reopen the chapel, not its doors but its purpose." This decision redefines her goal from discovery to participation and continuation. However, the reopening itself is deferred to the future (filming herself, planning tomorrow's visit). The action shifts her stance but is not fully enacted on the page—it shapes closure but does not constitute the closure beat itself. Swappable with "continue" or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is the engine of discovery: she synchronizes the 1961 and recent videos frame by frame, identifying Brother Thomas's gestures repeated by homeless teenagers. This method is signaled early (twin monitors, footage introduction) and its mechanics matter—the comparison reveals the ritual's continuity across decades. The method directly enables the key turn when she understands the chapel's ongoing purpose. It shapes her final choice to add her own filmed testimony, completing the archive she has been analyzing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault supplies concrete resources: UV light reveals the oil marks, water stains guide interpretation, the vault's specific spot (where Abraham's sacrifice is painted) becomes the ritual location. The rain intensifies at closure, "drumming its own ancient rhythm," charging the final image. The vault's damage and weather enable discovery rather than merely framing it. Spatial positioning (standing at the exact spot) matters for the gesture-analysis. The setting constrains her investigation method and charges the palm-press ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the spot where a map tears" is interpreted as the liminal boundary between known/unknown rather than a timeframe. The story tracks time loosely (thirty years background, 1961 footage, last month's video, today's work, tomorrow's plan) but no urgent clock tightens decisions. The "spot" functions spatially (coordinates, vault position) more than temporally. The torn map's edge becomes the charged location for the palm-press closure, so there is some closure participation, but this element reads as setting rather than timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interpreting silence with empathy is Elara's explicit motivation: she reads cartographers' hesitations, seeks to understand silent confessions, and recognizes the teenagers' unknowing participation. The desire drives her investigation and her decision to continue the silent testimony by filming herself. However, the motivation is more stated than dramatized through friction—she encounters no competing desire or ethical dilemma that tests her empathy. Present in setup (reading what cartographers "never meant to reveal"), middle (understanding the monks' purpose), and ending (adding her palm to the silent record).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is named explicitly and modeled in Elara's approach: "protection without isolation, revelation without exposure." The tone coheres through her careful, methodical investigation that seeks understanding without violating the sacred. The monitor-reflection moment shows her expression softening into this state. However, the phrase is asserted more than enacted through modulating prose rhythm or pressure. The final image (palm on torn map, understanding in the space between) embodies the tone, giving it closure participation, but earlier beats rely on telling rather than tonal demonstration.</comment>
