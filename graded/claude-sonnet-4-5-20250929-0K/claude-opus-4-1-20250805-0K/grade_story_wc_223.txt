<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is established early and her choices (tracing words, refusing to testify) emerge from consistent interiority. The contradiction between survivor and "crisis actor" label creates credible psychological pressure. However, the internal experience leans heavily on poetic reflection rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The decision to stay and document rather than witness officially feels earned but the micro-choices lack visible friction—her walking-writing proceeds without dramatized hesitation or cost beyond the stated refusal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Marina's final "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" crystallizes her stance against becoming official witness, foreclosing participation in the new government with felt cost (isolation, continued marginalization). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The interregnum as liminal space creates coherent situational pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the other survivor arrives and Marina refuses, reweighting her solitary documentation against communal testimony. The accumulative-textural lens holds through the walking-words pattern to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustics actively shape Marina's method (footstep-words multiply into chorus) and the chessboard's absent pawns charge the final image with loss and remembrance. Spatial details (curved space, dome, marble floor, spiral stairs) remain coherent and the setting constrains choice: Marina stays in this specific acoustic sanctuary rather than join the government. The body-as-micro-setting (her feet tracing letters) functions purposefully. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's documentary priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting small truths versus becoming official witness—is signaled early and tightens when the other survivor calls her to testify. Marina's refusal is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the path of reintegration. The interregnum provides situational pressure (breathless pause, nomadic penumbra) but escalation proceeds more through accumulation than reversal. The cost of remaining marginalized is felt but not deeply tested; no second complication forces her to defend or risk her sanctuary. One meaningful deepening is present but the final third restates rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chessboard's missing pawns, Marina's foot-spelling, and the tension between grand history and small gestures. The final "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, reweighting survival and witness against performance accusations. "Luminous absence" functions as lived paradox rather than label. Subtext operates in Marina's refusal ("Tell them the real witnesses are the gestures no one notices") and the empty pawn-squares that "demanded accounting." No thematic summary mars the ending and the conceptual cost—remaining outside legitimacy—is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with Marina's perceptual signature (architectural accident of acoustics, microseconds of meaning). Diction is elevated but consistent; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. The one dialogue exchange with the other survivor feels slightly expository ("They're forming the new government tomorrow. They want witnesses") but serves plot economically. Under peak pressure (the refusal moment) the voice stays controlled. Some register elevation ("benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra") rides the line of lexicon fit but reads as Marina's interior scholarly vocabulary. Psychic distance is intentional and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, figurative language appears densely without always advancing pressure: "breathless pause," "ghosts of legislation," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" cluster in ways that occasionally obscure rather than propel. "Tell them I'm busy unbinding the small truths from the large lies" borders on thematic echo. Paraphrase near the end: the penultimate paragraph restates Marina's stance in slightly varied terms without new pressure. Template stems appear ("she who had pulled," "she'd learned," "she thought") but do not form runs. Net effect: −0.6 for density without consistent payoff, −0.2 for mild loop in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor conspiracy, interregnum politics, whispering gallery acoustics, and pawns-as-unremembered creates a specific, non-obvious frame. The foot-spelling method is distinctive and the chessboard detail transforms a familiar symbol (missing pieces) into commentary on erasure. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflection-heavy structure succeeds in maintaining coherent pressure. However, the "survivor turned into conspiracy theory" premise has recent cultural saturation and the story does not fully transform it through lived occupational detail or moral calculus—Marina's response (withdraw, document privately) feels expected rather than surprising. Freshness is present but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina (crisis actor real crisis survivor) is present throughout and her survivor status motivates her refusal to testify. The attribute drives her withdrawal into documentation and frames the irony of being labeled fiction. She makes the key choice to refuse official witness and remain in the gallery. However, the "crisis actor" label itself does not create a dramatized on-page complication—it's backstory that contextualizes but doesn't actively constrain her present actions. Two gates: setup (paragraph two backstory) and payoff (refusal linked to being reduced to narrative). Missing middle development where the label creates fresh friction. Causal linkage is present but replaceable with "misunderstood survivor" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chessboard missing all pawns appears in beat three (center of gallery), returns in Marina's thought when the survivor calls, and charges the final section ("The chessboard waited, patient in its incompleteness" and "The pawns were gone, but their spaces remembered them"). Its specific property—absence of the pieces that "did most of history's dying"—directly supports Marina's stake (documenting the unremembered). The object reweights meaning across three beats and enables her metaphor for the missing names she walks. All three gates met with strong closure linkage. Cost: the empty board reinforces her choice to remain outside official history. High irreplaceability; swapping for another incomplete artifact would require rewriting the thematic center.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Nomadic penumbra appears once as description ("the country existing in a nomadic penumbra, neither in light nor darkness but forever at the edge of both, wandering between legitimacies"). It characterizes the interregnum's liminality and connects to Marina's own shadowland existence. The concept frames atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not constrain a specific choice or alter tactics—Marina's actions (walking words, refusing testimony) would remain unchanged if "nomadic penumbra" were replaced with "twilight state" or "liminal drift." Present in setup (paragraph five) and echoed at closure ("forever approaching but never quite reaching either darkness or dawn") but no middle beat where it enables or blocks an action. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but causal pressure is absent. Two gates (setup, payoff) with thematic charge but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Benevolently ruthless appears once as a label ("She'd learned to be benevolently ruthless with truth—kind enough to preserve it, merciless enough to strip away the decorative lies"). It characterizes Marina's documentary stance but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. No beat shows her struggling between kindness and ruthlessness in a micro-choice; the trait is told rather than dramatized. Setup present (paragraph five) but missing middle development and closure participation. Swappable with "uncompromising archivist" or similar descriptor without structural impact. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unbind is Marina's first traced word, appears in her self-description ("unbinding the small truths from the large lies"), and returns in the final paragraph ("unbinding memory from myth"). The action shapes her method and motivates her refusal to become official witness—she unbinds rather than binds into state narrative. Three beats with strong closure linkage. The specific verb drives the contrast between her solitary work and the government's binding legitimacy. Cost: remaining unbound means isolation. High irreplaceability; replacing with "separate" or "free" would lose the tactile, active quality and the echo with "bind" (government forming, testimony binding). All three gates met with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Walking that spells words is introduced in paragraph one (U-N-B-I-N-D), used in paragraph four (W-I-T-N-E-S-S), paragraph six (R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R M-E N-O-T), and the final section (names of missing pawns, W-E R-E-M-A-I-N). The method is Marina's primary on-page action and the gallery's acoustics (setting) multiply each footstep into chorus, making the means essential. Four distinct beats with closure participation. The mechanics matter: feet on marble, acoustic perfection holding each name. Cost: the labor is solitary and the words dissolve unless someone hears. High irreplaceability; swapping for hand-writing or voice-recording would lose the embodied, ephemeral, acoustic charge. All three gates met with strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery supplies the acoustic property (whispers travel the curve, footsteps multiply) that enables Marina's word-walking method and its effect (chorus of herself, parliament of whispers). It pressures her choice by offering sanctuary during the interregnum and its specific architecture (curved space, dome) constrains how she documents. Three beats: opening setup, paragraph four elaboration, and closure ("whispering gallery of a democracy's intermission"). The setting's unique property is irreplaceable—no other location would provide the acoustic multiplication. Cost linkage: staying in the gallery means remaining underground and outside official history. All three gates met with high causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The interregnum is established in the opening line, noted as "three months already" in paragraph five, and provides the situational pressure (no government, Marina outside legitimacy, other survivor calling her to new government forming "tomorrow"). The timeframe shapes stakes by creating a window where Marina's alternative documentation is possible before the new order closes. Two gates: setup and middle (three-month marker that shows duration weighing on the country). Closure participation is weaker—"tomorrow" raises urgency but Marina's choice to stay doesn't visibly trade against a ticking clock. The time tightens context but doesn't alter her tactics; she would document the same way regardless of whether the interregnum were two months or six. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina's desire to become historian of small gestures is introduced in paragraph four, drives her refusal to testify officially (paragraph eight: "Tell them the real witnesses are the gestures no one notices"), and is enacted through her word-walking across multiple beats. The motivation is dramatized in action (documenting collar adjustments, ring-tracing, shoulder angles) and tested when the other survivor offers reintegration. Cost: accepting historian role means rejecting communal witness and remaining marginalized. Three gates met with visible friction between want (document gestures) and price (isolation). Strong causal integration but the friction could be sharper—no beat shows her tempted to abandon the role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Luminous absence as tone is established through the chessboard's missing pawns ("Their luminous absence spoke louder than their presence ever could"), repeated in "light through a wandering shadow," and charged in the final image ("The pawns were gone, but their spaces remembered them"). The tone coheres across beats—reverent attention to what's missing rather than present—and modulates subtly with pressure (elegiac in contemplation, sharper at refusal). It participates in closure by framing the ending's stance on memory. Two strong gates (middle and payoff) with thematic charge. However, the phrase "luminous absence" itself appears only once as a label; the effect is sustained more through image (empty pawn-squares, names spelling into air) than tonal consistency. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but the tone could be more distinct from general elegy.</comment>
