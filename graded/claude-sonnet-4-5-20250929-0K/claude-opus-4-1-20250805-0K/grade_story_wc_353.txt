<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's motivation is coherent and her core trait (symphonically minded) shapes perception throughout. However, interiority leans toward abstraction—"profound compassion," "careful listening"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment of standing "still in the intensely quiet grove" feels more summative than a forfeiture with visible cost. No major slips touch closure, but the interior lacks the contradiction and embodied specificity needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, workshop window, siskin alder grove, dawn) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases as sound emerges layer by layer, and the final image reweights the premise (silence can be broken through tenderness). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the porcelain insulator now etched with new cracks offers charged poise for future sculptors. Cost is conceptual (the insulator's fractures, tomorrow's continuation) rather than a decisive forfeiture, which holds the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The porcelain insulator and the alder's stress cracks function as micro-setting, constraining Mira's method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "scarred with stress cracks," "glazed surface," "warm in her hand." The grove itself remains mostly atmospheric; spatial choreography is minimal but legible. The insulator's evolving state (warm, then etched) crosses the gate for setting-as-constraint, elevating the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped sound—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure deepens as Mira coaxes vibrations from the tree, adding layers until a symphony emerges. However, there is no reversal or tightening that narrows options; the process unfolds smoothly without resistance or trade-off. The ending offers continuation ("tomorrow she would return") rather than a decisive choice that forecloses a path. Accumulative deepening is present, but the absence of visible cost or constraint on this particular act caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as trauma, memory as substrate, tenderness as method. The porcelain insulator's new cracks offer a resonant non-literal answer—today's song stored for future sculptors—without stating a moral. The piece resists binary resolution and invites reflection beyond plot. Minor thematic echoes ("proof that silence could be broken not through violence or technology, but through careful listening and profound compassion") veer toward explicit statement but remain anchored in scene action, keeping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "symphonically minded" filters observation ("whole movements waiting to be freed," "acoustic architecture"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific. The piece carries minimal dialogue, so that dimension is neutral. Free indirect style is clean ("She wasn't simply extracting sound; she was dancing..."). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Strong rhythmic control elevates the score, with no slips touching closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "She approached... She pressed... She began..." and metaphor density in peak beats ("acoustic architecture," "musical memory," "ghost of birdsong") without pattern-teaching. The phrase "empathy in motion" reads as label-only insertion rather than embodied action. Minor scaffold and figurative stacking reduce clarity slightly, triggering a −0.4 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—sound trapped in wood grain, freed by a porcelain insulator—offers a fresh synthesis. Mira's method (strumming stress cracks) and the sensory logic are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (discovering, practicing, succeeding without resistance) follows a template discovery-into-mastery path. The transformation test is mixed: swap "siskins" for another species and the stakes remain largely unchanged. Specificity in execution rescues the score from mid-band, but the lack of a risky turn or non-obvious moral calculus keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (approaching the alder, pressing the insulator, strumming cracks) drive all beats. She appears in the opening and shapes the final image. However, her decisions do not narrow options or face resistance; the process unfolds smoothly. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met, but causal pressure is low. The character is essential but not indispensable in the high-band sense.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The porcelain insulator is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (pressed, strummed, grows warm), and returns with reweighted meaning (etched with new cracks for future sculptors). It enables Mira's method through unique properties (holds and releases charge) and appears in the closure image. All three gates met with strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Specificity and irreplaceability are high, pushing the score toward 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Empathy in motion" is named once in a single sentence but does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action. The concept reads as thematic label rather than a mechanic that shapes stakes or tactics. Mira's body sways, but the phrase itself is ornamental. Setup and payoff gates are weakly present; development gate is missing. Swappable with "attentive listening" or similar generalities.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Symphonically minded" is introduced early and filters Mira's perception throughout ("complex harmonies," "whole movements," "layered like geological strata"). It enables her unique method of reading stress patterns. However, the trait does not create visible cost or tradeoff; it functions as competence marker rather than constraint. Setup and development gates met; payoff is thematic echo rather than decisive turn. Mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Strum" is the core action: Mira strums the crack with the porcelain edge, coaxing vibrations, finding new cracks, each adding layers. The action is irreplaceable—cutting or hammering is explicitly rejected. It drives the middle beats and shapes the ending (the insulator now etched from strumming). All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity is high; removing "strum" would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The method—analyzing stress cracks—is introduced in the second paragraph ("scarred with stress cracks... frozen sound waves") and shapes all middle beats. Mira reads the cracks, finds resonance points, and strums specific fractures. The mechanics matter throughout and determine success. All three gates met with strong development involvement. The method is essential to the plot and irreplaceable, justifying a score above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The siskin alder grove is named early and provides the ancient alder Mira works on. However, the grove itself does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics—Mira could perform this act in any grove with old trees. The setting is coherent and atmospheric but functionally replaceable. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. Lyric resonance (opening and closing mentions) cannot overcome low causal pressure, capping the score near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls at dawn" frames the opening and the hedgehog returns at closure ("by noon... for its midday rest"), bracketing the work session. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Mira's process is untimed and proceeds without clock pressure. The element is present in setup and payoff but ornamental in function. Swappable with any diurnal marker. Lyric reprise without causal work trends low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation—to create music in a silent world—is signaled immediately ("last tree-song sculptor," "Silence had stolen all natural sound") and drives every beat. Mira's goal is dramatized through action (approaching the tree, pressing the insulator, strumming cracks) and the ending fulfills it (symphony from the grove's scars). Friction is minimal; no competing want or cost tests her commitment. All three gates met with strong beat involvement and closure participation, but the absence of visible tradeoff keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"Intensely quiet" is embedded in the title-concept (the Great Silence), modulates through the emergence of sound, and charges the final line ("stood still in the intensely quiet grove, surrounded by the ghost of birdsong"). Tone is coherent and shifts purposefully as organic sound breaks through mechanical quiet. The exact phrase appears at closure, reweighting the premise. All three gates met with strong closure linkage and rhythmic control. High irreplaceability and closure charge justify a score nearing 8.0.</comment>
