<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior is vivid early ("light-painting," "daydream fold"), but motivation shifts from personal restoration to broadcast joy without clear dramatized pressure. The "knowledge network" floods her with technique; no visible struggle or trade-off grounds the sudden skill. The laugh ("When had she last laughed?") gestures toward change, yet no prior choice foreclosed a path with felt cost—she simply receives and displays, then drifts back. Embodied contradiction is present in the ache for lost happiness, but agency remains passive reception rather than a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (apple blossoms, festival scenes, knowledge network pulse), and the final return to daydream offers a cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line three (Marina, studio-cave, fragment). Closure is Charged Poise—she resolves to venture deeper tomorrow, reweighting her stance from isolated study to networked mission—but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactic change occurs in the ending beat. The midpoint tightening (network activation) deepens her access but does not narrow options with immediate price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, fog, and studio-cave anchor place with consistent sensory detail (fog-dampened decay, twisted skeletons of wood). The fresco fragment recurs and charges the final image (glows faintly, held close). Micro-setting qualifies: the fragment constrains her initial touch and primes the daydream fold. Spatial choreography is clean (cave walls, palms, air shimmers). The fog functions as atmospheric constraint rather than tactical obstacle; it dampens souls but does not force a present choice on the page, keeping the setting in strong support rather than indispensable territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering and displaying lost joy—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful deepening: the knowledge network sparks mid-story, expanding her from solo reconstruction to collective project. Agency is attention and reception; she does not face a trade-off or reversal that forecloses a live option. The resolution ("venture deeper," "burn away the fog") is aspirational intent rather than an on-page choice with visible cost. Coincidence (network awakening, other artists stirring) complicates without forcing a decision. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow tactics with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resurrection, communal joy overcoming fog—emerges through concrete images (apple blossoms, festival, crushed seeds in plaster). The final image (fragment glowing, drift back to daydream) offers a resonant return without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "permanence wasn't the point" and the bitter-sweet apple-seed taste. The network pulse invites reflection on collective vs. solitary creation. Yet the thematic answer feels soft: no hard counter-pressure or cost complicates the hope that enough dreamers could "burn away the fog entirely," leaving the question more aspirational than reweighted by lived stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is clear: Marina notices pigments, plaster texture, photon metaphors, all filtered through artist's idiom. Diction stays consistent ("gossamer strokes," "luminescence flowed," "fold of daydream") with purposeful lyricism. No head-hopping. The knowledge-network moment risks slight omniscience ("hundreds of muralists ... their techniques flooded") but reads as gift-enabled perception rather than POV leak. Psychic distance modulates well from concrete touch to expansive vision. One line edges toward prompt echo: "Show me what joy looked like here" reads slightly authorial, but recovers quickly in embodied action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the middle (festival reconstruction, network mechanics). Two minor loops: "knowledge network" appears identically phrased three times in close succession (−0.2); "joy" and "fog" recur in formulaic opposition across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). "Light-painting" and "photon" feel mildly label-heavy in peak beats but remain legible. No simultaneity errors or grammar slips. Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; final line recharges the daydream motif with image over assertion. Propulsion is steady, though mid-story exposition (network explanation, original-artist backstory) slows the beat slightly without stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Premise—artist receives visions via mystic network, paints with literal light—combines familiar elements (psychometry, collective unconscious, fog-as-despair) without a sharp, non-obvious synthesis. The light-painting gift and knowledge network are asserted rather than discovered through grounded choice or constraint. Emotional specificity (ache for communal happiness, bitter-sweet apple seeds) lifts the piece above template, and the orchard-district ruin adds textured particulars. Risk is moderate: the daydream frame and lyric mode commit to soft causality, which fits the Accumulative lens but stops short of bold structural surprise. Transformation test: swapping "light" for another art medium would leave arc and emotion largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina handles the fragment (traces, holds, whispers to it), enters daydream, paints light-visions, and resolves to venture deeper. Present across setup, middle development, and closure. She makes one micro-choice (to display rather than hoard) but the turn is told more than dramatized; no visible cost or tactic shift follows. Swappable with another artist type (sculptor, singer) with minor edits to the gift mechanism. Causal involvement in two beats (fragment touch → daydream; network pulse → collective display) earns functional credit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresco fragment anchors the opening (traced, pulsed warm), triggers the daydream, and returns glowing in the final image, reweighting her resolve. Present in setup, middle (knowledge source), and closure. Its properties (centuries-old pigment, crushed apple seeds) are specific and irreplaceable. Two distinct beats: initial touch and final glow. It does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost; Marina receives rather than struggles with it. Closure linkage and charged reprise lift it to strong support, but lack of mid-scene friction or swappability test (another relic could serve similarly) caps higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Exposed film appears once as metaphor: "techniques flooded ... like exposed film developing in reverse." Present only in middle exposition; no setup signal, no closure return. Does not shape a choice or tactic. Ornamental rather than causal. The light-painting mechanism could operate without the film metaphor; the story's dominant conceit is photon-weaving, not photographic process. Functional metaphor in one line, but not integrated across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is signaled early ("painted with light itself, drawing photons from memory"), demonstrated in the middle (light pools in palms, flows to cave walls), and implicit in the final image (fragment glows, visions persist). Present in setup, development, and closure. Enables the central action (mural creation) across two beats. No visible cost or constraint: the light flows freely once the daydream activates, with no resource trade-off or failure risk dramatized on the page. Swappable with "conjures illusions" or "sings visions into being" without breaking logic. Functional trait, replaceable mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Display" is the protagonist's chosen action: she paints visions on cave walls and understands she is "meant to display them, to restore what the fog had stolen." Present in middle development (active painting) and closure intent ("venture deeper ... find more fragments ... display"). The action enables the thematic turn (personal to collective) and shapes her resolve at the end. One distinct beat (wall painting) with closure participation via stated intent. No on-page cost tied specifically to display vs. hoarding; the network activates regardless. Easily swappable with "share," "broadcast," or "project" with minor edits. Functional across two moments, replaceable verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Knowledge network is introduced mid-story ("that invisible web connecting all artists across time"), drives the middle beat (techniques flood her, other artists stir), and persists to closure ("sharing that rediscovered joy through the network"). Present in middle development and closure reflection. Enables the collective-joy turn and reweights her mission from solo to networked. One distinct beat (network pulse); closure participation is thematic rather than causal action. No mechanics explained that constrain or cost; it activates conveniently when needed. Swappable with "ancestral echo" or "psychic link" without structural change. Functional mechanism, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ruined orchard district frames the story (opening, middle festival vision, closing resolve to venture deeper). Fog is persistent constraint (dampens souls, obscures history) but does not force an on-page choice; Marina escapes into daydream rather than navigating the ruin tactically. The orchard's past abundance charges the visions and contrasts present decay. Present in setup, middle (vision content), and closure intent. Two beats (opening anchor, vision substrate). Specific and irreplaceable for thematic resonance, but does not alter tactics or supply resources that change outcome. Atmospheric pressure rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is the stated timeframe; Marina enters "liminal space between waking and sleeping" early and returns to it at closure. Present in setup and closure. Daydream mode relaxes causality, allowing gift activation and network contact without resource cost or ticking clock. No tightening: time is elastic and untracked; Marina can linger indefinitely. The fold enables the central action but does not constrain or pressure decisions. Swappable with "trance," "vision," or "meditation" with minor edits. Functional frame, no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rediscovering lost joy is Marina's stated motivation ("Show me what joy looked like here"), demonstrated through the festival visions and her own surprised laugh. Present in setup (fragment's "original artist's joy"), middle (reconstruction of communal happiness), and closure (resolve to let joy grow wild again). Drives two beats (vision request, laugh reaction) and shapes ending intent. Told more than dramatized: no on-page friction between joy-seeking and competing cost (safety, solitude, resource). The laugh moment offers embodied glimpse, but no trade-off or mistake complicates the desire. Functional motivation, moderate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pensive mirth operates in the laugh line ("Marina laughed, surprising herself"), the gentle resolve at closure, and the lyric diction throughout ("gossamer," "summer honey," "lighter than fog"). Present setup to closure. Tone modulates slightly: wistful early (crumbling fresco, fog-dampened), brighter mid-story (apple blossoms, children mid-laugh), soft-hopeful at end (drift back to blossoms). Coherent but static—no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure. The laugh charges one beat; the final image sustains pensiveness without mirth's return. Swappable with "wistful hope" or "melancholy wonder" without breaking coherence. Functional mood, moderate charge.</comment>
