<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—cultivation as antidote to violence—and her choices (finishing her round despite her father's early return, leading him to the rose) reflect patient interiority. However, the father's arc is summarized rather than embodied: "something shift in his expression" and his kneeling gesture are told, not shown through contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal conflict. The final planting scene avoids dramatizing the father's struggle to adopt her method; instead, the prose asserts he is "learning" and "understanding finally," which reads as label-only transformation. Internal texture for Mira is consistent but the father's renunciation lacks visible cost or embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a light Situational accent. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mira, greenhouse, post-tower world) and builds pressure through the father's return and his gradual exposure to her method. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): they sit together "no longer hunter and pacifist but simply family," and the final line "here, something else rose" reweights the opening question. Cost is felt in the father's relinquishment of the hunt as identity, though it remains implicit rather than dramatized. One tightening (father's arrival and weapon-sheathing) shifts the emotional register. Minor deduction: the closure's conceptual cost would be sharper if the father's internal renunciation were shown through a concrete micro-choice rather than narrated summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm are vividly rendered and anchor spatial choreography throughout: Mira's movement between rows, the central rose, the entrance where she meets her father. Sensory detail is purposeful ("geometric patterns across the desert rose farm," "airship descended," "blazing crimson despite its tranquil bearing") and filtered through Mira's perception. The dome constrains and protects—"the desert waited with its harsh truths. Inside, the roses continued their quiet revolution"—charging the final image. The sandbag scrap and the roses as tactile objects recur across beats and ground the body/tool micro-setting, meeting the 9+ test narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: Mira's cultivation work as counterpoint to her father's violence. Pressure escalates when the father returns "earlier than expected," weapon in hand, and the scene tightens as she leads him into the greenhouse. The father's sheathing of his weapon and kneeling at the rose constitute a meaningful deepening that narrows his options—he chooses to engage her method—but the cost (foregoing the hunt's identity) remains implicit rather than shown through a dramatized trade-off. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the stakes would enter the 8+ band if the father's choice foreclosed a live option on the page (e.g., a contract abandoned, a weapon laid down permanently) with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—continuity and peace as counterforce to violence—emerges through concrete particulars: the roses, the father's weapon, the phrase "engraved quiet," the sandbag scrap. The story avoids moralizing until the final paragraph, where "The world breaks. We grow anyway" and "her pacifism wasn't weakness but a different kind of strength" veer toward explicit statement rather than letting the image carry the weight. The ending's resonance ("The tower had fallen, but here, something else rose") reweights prior material without a stated moral, though the earlier line "teaching them to weave continuity through chaos" edges into thematic echo. Minor deduction for one instance of authorial commentary that undercuts what the scene already shows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, and Mira's perceptual signature is consistent: "senseless perception, the ability to notice what others overlooked." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("prayer made solid," "engraved quiet," "quiet blaze"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the father's "The Bennett contract. Complete" and Mira's "Here. This one knows your story" carry subtext. Minor slip: "what he called a senseless perception" reads as editorial intrusion rather than Mira's internal lexicon. Filter verbs ("saw him trying," "saw something shift") cluster in high-pressure beats and dull immediacy slightly, though the overall voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor artifacts: "Patience," "Resilience," and "engraved quiet" function as thematic labels rather than dramatized pressure; the phrase "teaching them to weave continuity through chaos" is a paraphrase loop (restating her method without adding detail). "Understanding flooding through her with that peculiar perception" and "saw something shift in his expression" are filter-verb stacks that summarize rather than show. Template cadence in the reflection block ("not for targets or threats, but for the spaces between violence") and near-synonym churn ("bounty hunting," "architects of destruction," "antidote") add scaffold. Apply −0.6 for these artifacts clustered in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—bounty hunter's pacifist daughter cultivating roses after a tower's fall—synthesizes familiar elements (violent father/peaceful child, post-apocalyptic garden) into a specific configuration. "Engraved quiet" and "inculcating plants with values" offer fresh inflection on cultivation-as-resistance, and the sandbag-as-seed-pouch detail is particular. However, the emotional arc (violent parent softened by child's gentle counterexample) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious turn; the father's kneeling and learning could occur in countless stories with different names and places. Proximity check: no close echoes. The story commits to its premise but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is introduced early, her choices (finishing her round, leading her father to the rose) create two beats, and her presence shapes the closure (planting together). Her decision to wait and then guide rather than hurry is a micro-choice that reflects her values and alters the father's trajectory. Causal pressure is moderate—her method enables the father's shift—but the turn is more delivered than forced by her agency under stress. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, cost connection (her patience as constraint) +0.3 = ~6.5 baseline. Subtract −0.3 for limited on-page friction (she does not struggle or sacrifice visibly). Final: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears early ("In her pocket"), is handled in two beats (carrying seeds, shaking seeds into her palm at the end), and returns with reweighted meaning (vessel that once navigated sky now plants ground-level life). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (coarse fabric for delicate work) +0.5 = ~5.8. It does not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it is a resonant image but not causally indispensable. Could be replaced with another seed pouch without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is introduced early as her practice, described in one paragraph, and echoed thematically at the end ("engraving peace into the world one bloom at a time"). It does not shape a beat or constrain tactics; it functions as a label for her method rather than a mechanism that alters options on the page. Setup +0.5, thematic echo at closure +0.4 = ~3.9. Ornamental use −0.5, swappability (could be "cultivated stillness" or similar) −0.4. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Senseless perception" is named early but functions as a label rather than a constraint or enable. Mira notices "the way sand shifted before a storm, how plants leaned toward kindness," but these observations do not drive an on-page action with cost. The attribute is told, not shown through a visible tradeoff (e.g., perceiving subtle cues but missing overt threats). Setup +0.5, label-only use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.5. Introduced early but not developed; cap at 4.6 per missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The father's sheathing of his weapon is signaled mid-story, dramatized on the page ("she watched him sheathe his weapon with the deliberate care of someone learning a new language"), and directly shapes the closure turn—his relinquishment of violence to engage her method. One beat +0.4, causal pressure (enables the planting scene) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (the deliberate care) +0.6 = ~7.6. Subtract −0.2 for late middle arrival (not seeded earlier). This action could be replaced with another gesture of renunciation, but its specificity (weapon → tool transition) makes it nearly indispensable. Final: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's method of "inculcating plants with values" is introduced early, demonstrated across multiple beats (whispering to seedlings, teaching resilience, "teaching them to weave continuity through chaos"), and appears at closure (planting new seeds together). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (her method shapes the father's learning) +1.0 = ~7.2. Subtract −0.4 for partial summary-only treatment ("She didn't merely water them; she taught them" tells rather than showing the mechanics in action). Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is introduced in the opening line, supplies spatial choreography across all beats (rows, center row, entrance, landing pad), and charges the final image ("Inside, the roses continued their quiet revolution"). The dome constrains (protects from the harsh desert) and enables (creates the microclimate for roses). Setup +0.8, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (dome as both shelter and symbol) +0.7 = ~8.7. Subtract −0.6 for minor postcard description in the opening ("geometric patterns across the desert rose farm" reads decorative). Final: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" is signaled early and frames the world state, but it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The timeframe is a static backdrop rather than a live clock. Three years have passed since the tower fell, but this duration does not constrain Mira's or her father's choices in the present scene. Setup +0.5, thematic backdrop +0.4 = ~3.9. No middle pressure or closure linkage. Vague tracking (no urgency tied to elapsed time or impending deadline) −0.3. Final: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to weave continuity through chaos" is stated early, reflected in her actions (cultivation work, leading her father to the rose), and articulated at closure ("teaching them to weave continuity through chaos"). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9 = ~6.4. The desire is told more than dramatized; friction between want and cost is minimal—Mira does not face a choice where weaving continuity competes with another need. Ornamental phrasing ("weave continuity") reads thematic rather than action-specific −0.4. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is signaled early ("glass dome... catching the afternoon sun," "quiet blaze of afternoon light") and recurs at closure ("quiet revolution"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly: calm cultivation interrupted by the father's arrival, tension at the weapon-sheathing beat, return to stillness at the planting. Setup +0.6, modulation across beats +0.8, closure charge ("Inside, the roses continued their quiet revolution") +1.2, specificity (oxymoron mirrors pacifism/violence tension) +0.6 = ~7.2. The tone does not intensify under pressure as much as hold steady, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits dramatic arc. Final: 7.2.</comment>
