<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus shows clear motivation to contain the prophecy and his micro-choices (dancing fingers without touching keys) demonstrate agency under pressure. However, interiority remains thin—his emotions are told through abstractions like "eerie nostalgia" rather than embodied contradiction. The gathering musicians lack distinct voices or individual stakes, functioning as ambient chorus rather than pressure points. The final renunciation carries weight but feels more conceptual than viscerally earned through prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Marcus, grotto, prophecy threat) land by ~150 words, slightly delayed but functional. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: silence accrues density until the prophecy "sleeps beneath blankets of unplayed jazz." Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis—Marcus wraps the prophecy in protective silence with the cost that it will wake again and require perpetual vigilance. The cost is conceptual and forward-facing rather than immediately felt on the page, which keeps the effect in mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radiant grotto with bioluminescent moss and prism atrium creates a vivid, purpose-driven space where "silence had weight and substance." Dewdrops on the saxophone keys function as micro-setting that charges the closure image: "each one carrying away a syllable of the prophecy." Sensory detail (pale light, emerald/gold glow, mist) is filtered through the magical-realist frame and supports the stakes. The grotto's unique acoustics constrain Marcus's method, elevating setting beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain the prophecy before it becomes inevitable) is signaled early and coherent. The tightening occurs when Marcus shifts from planning to performing the un-music, a meaningful turn but not a high-cost reversal—he executes the plan without tactical adaptation or visible sacrifice. The prophecy's response is immediate and cooperative rather than resistant, reducing friction. Cost is deferred ("will wake again someday") rather than paid in the present beat, keeping escalation in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of negative space and protective silence: utterance can be dangerous, preservation may require permanent vigilance. The final image—rainbows through dewdrops as "promise that some futures were worth the price of permanent silence"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "eerie nostalgia...for futures that would never be" edges toward abstract philosophizing, and the grandfather's burden/legacy motif is seeded but not causally charged at closure. Subtext operates cleanly in the unplayed music conceit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; distance is controlled and Marcus's perceptual signature (musical, atmospheric, quiet) is consistent. Diction ("vested hush," "shadow-song," "unheard harmonies") leans lyric-literary and occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calibrated quiet," "cultivated restraint") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully between description and action, though some passages ("practice the art of musical negative space") read more expository than embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("mercury finding itself," "blankets of unplayed jazz") is vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "dewdrops formed on his brass instrument" / "As dewdrops formed along the saxophone's keys" / "The dewdrops on Marcus's saxophone grew heavy and fell"—three functionally identical beats across the story (−0.2). "Quietly vivid" recurs as a phrase without evolving (−0.2). Some filter stacks ("he saw them gathering," "felt it settle") in reflective passages dull immediacy slightly. Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—musicians playing silence to contain a spoken prophecy—offers a fresh synthesis of music-as-magic and negative-space metaphysics. Execution is competent but leans toward surface cleverness: the prophecy never resists, Marcus's plan works exactly as intended, and the "will wake again" ending is a familiar template for deferred stakes. The grotto and unplayed-jazz mechanics feel purposefully designed but not inevitably discovered through character struggle. Risk is present in the lyric conceit but the arc remains safe and symmetrical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus initiates the silence performance and gathers musicians, creating two functional beats. His choices (where to perform, how to instruct others) enable the resolution. However, he executes a pre-formed plan without tactical revision or visible cost to self; the prophecy cooperates rather than forcing adaptation. Present across setup, middle instruction, and closure participation, but causal pressure is moderate and the element is somewhat replaceable (another musician-protector could occupy the role with minor edits). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability friction −0.6, ornamental instruction beat −0.3 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in paragraph three as the chamber "where sound behaved strangely" and "silence had weight." Marcus uses it as the performance venue (middle beat) and the closure notes it "amplified their collective restraint" and continues to hold dewdrops/rainbows in the final image. Three distinct beats with causal and closure linkage. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (sound behavior enables method) +0.8, closure linkage (final rainbows) +1.0, specificity (acoustics matter) +0.5 = 4.3 base. However, mechanical description without dramatized constraint or cost lowers realized impact. Functional but not indispensable: ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vested hush" is defined as "that ancient silence that existed before the first word was ever spoken" and descends upon the grotto as Marcus performs. It appears in setup (grandfather's journals), shapes the middle tactic (cultivating silence), and charges the closure image where the prophecy "slept beneath blankets of unplayed jazz." Causal: the hush is the weapon. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5 = base 4.0. Label-only in some passages (−0.3), but tactical use and closure presence elevate: ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears as a descriptor for the grotto tableau (emerald/gold moss) in paragraph one and recurs in the penultimate paragraph as "the quietly vivid echo of songs never born." It characterizes setting atmosphere but does not constrain or enable an on-page choice with cost. Ornamental use across two mentions without causal pressure. Early signal +0.3, lyric reprise +0.4, ornamental friction −0.8, label-only −0.3 = ~4.1. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Whisper" appears when Marcus "whispered instructions to the others" (middle beat) and is the method used to "whisper the world back to sleep" in the closure sentence. Two beats with thematic closure linkage. However, the whispering does not visibly constrain tactics or impose cost—Marcus could have spoken softly without mechanical difference. Early absence (not in setup) −0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (could be "murmur" or "speak softly") −0.6 = ~6.4. Functional in closure image but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Negative space is the story's central method: Marcus performs by "almost playing," "fingers danced above keys without touching," creating "shadow-song" and "unplayed music." Introduced in paragraph four, it drives the middle performance beat and defines the closure tactic ("unplayed jazz," "spaces between the notes"). Early signal (setup journals) +0.6, three beats (planning, performance, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (method enables containment) +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = base 5.0. Strong integration but the mechanics are told more than dramatized with visible cost: ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The radiant grotto is the story's sole location, introduced in the opening line and present throughout. Bioluminescent moss pulses with the un-music, and the space's unique acoustics enable the silence tactic. Early signal +0.8, pervasive presence (all beats) +1.4, causal pressure (acoustics matter) +1.0, closure linkage (final dewdrops/rainbows) +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base 4.8. However, the grotto does not visibly constrain Marcus's choices—he could perform elsewhere with minor edits. Atmospheric but not plot-critical: ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As dewdrops form" appears in the title slot and recurs three times as a temporal/atmospheric anchor: opening (dewdrops form on saxophone), middle (dewdrops grow heavy), closure (dewdrops continue forming/falling). Time passage is marked ("Hours passed, or perhaps minutes") but does not tighten tactics or create urgency—Marcus completes his plan without clock pressure. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (final dewdrops cast rainbows) +0.8, ornamental (no urgency) −0.8, vague tracking −0.4 = ~5.6. Atmospheric marker without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to contain the prophecy is stated in paragraph two ("doom when translated," "already begun spreading") and drives his choice to perform the silence ritual and gather other musicians. Desire is clear and coherent but not visibly conflicted—he never hesitates or pays personal cost beyond future vigilance. Early signal +0.8, two beats (decision to perform, execution) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (prophecy sleeps) +0.9, friction (told rather than dramatized in choice-conflict) −0.7 = ~6.7. Functional but lacks on-page friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Eerie nostalgia" is named in paragraph seven as "nostalgia...for futures that would never be" and infuses the grotto atmosphere and musician motivations. Tone is coherent (hushed, elegiac, magical-realist) and modulates slightly from discovery to performance to closure. Present throughout but somewhat static—no sharp tonal shift marks escalation. Early presence +0.6, pervasive +1.0, closure coherence +0.8, label-only in places (−0.3), static mood rather than charged modulation −0.6 = ~6.1. Coherent but does not dramatically charge the final image.</comment>
