<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional history and her choice to pursue the shard are clearly motivated, and her decision at the end to teach others shows agency. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—she enters seeking the shard, finds it smoothly, and emerges with a resolved plan. The bodily tingles and amber glow provide some embodiment, but the peak experience in the silence reads as passive reception rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "tune her life differently" arrives without visible cost or friction that would foreclose another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Maya, towers, gorge, lunar perigee) arrive early. The piece accumulates celestial-signal imagery and builds toward the shard-of-hush encounter, then closes with Maya's decision to teach. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she smiles, the fragment is cool, and her new path is declared without on-page forfeit or friction. The six-hour trance compresses the central experience into summary ("she'd been in the shard for six hours"), flattening what should be the story's peak pressure. A Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable cost; here the reweighting is conceptual but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The suspended tower city, maintenance ladder, and lunar perigee create vivid spatial and temporal anchors. Sensory details—mist, mineral rain, moon shadows, rung-pitch—are purposeful and filtered through Maya's professional lens. The fragment and copper filaments function as micro-setting that constrains her method. The gravitational sway during perigee directly enables the shard's appearance, charging the final discovery with environmental necessity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the shard of hush—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through Maya's climb and tuning process, and the lunar perigee tightens the window. However, escalation is linear rather than deepening: she seeks, she finds, she descends. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the shard opens "like a door" without resistance. The decision to teach rather than monetize is a thematic pivot, but it arrives without on-page friction or a visible trade-off that would raise cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—endings as beginnings, silence as communication—emerges organically from the shard encounter and the abandoned city's history. The hollywood fragment's glow-and-darken cycle and the city's potential to "sing again" offer concrete images rather than abstract claims. The final paragraph risks over-articulation ("every ending was just a beginning waiting for someone to listen") but stops short of outright moralizing. The fragment's "weight like a promise" provides a resonant closing image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean; Maya's perceptual signature—tuning "with intention," feeling signal streams—is consistent and professional. Diction remains within her idiom, blending technical terms (spectral receivers, quantum processors) with lyric phrasing (frequencies as "electromagnetic poetry"). However, some constructions drift toward elevated literary register ("pocket of absolute stillness," "profound music of the space between") that slightly tensions the established voice under peak pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is abundant but mostly coherent. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "endings became beginnings" / "every ending was already writing its next beginning"; "the shape of its absence" elaborates "couldn't be captured" without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks thematic restatements ("to teach others to find beginnings in their endings by discarding the assumption that silence meant absence") that feel like scaffolding. Sentence openings vary, but density dips in reflective passages. No major grammatical errors; spatial choreography is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of signal interpreter, suspended city, lunar perigee, and a literal fragment from the Hollywood Nebula offers a fresh synthesis. The concept of "shard of hush" as a pocket of silence between frequencies is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—lone specialist defies Guild to pursue forbidden knowledge, finds it, decides to share it—follows a familiar template. The "practicality of magic" frame and the reversal-signal mechanic add texture, but the journey from commercial work to teaching feels well-trodden. Transformation is present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's role as signal interpreter frames her goal and method throughout. She climbs, tunes, connects the fragment, and traces the shard backward—three distinct beats of professional action. Her final decision to teach is interpreter-work repurposed. However, the peak encounter inside the silence is passive reception rather than active interpretation, and the choice to defy the Guild arrives without on-page friction. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in the breast pocket, is connected via copper filaments, glows during the shard encounter, then goes dark. Four beats of evolving use. It enables the resonance no machine can detect and its final coolness signals completion. However, its unique properties—"dense with frozen light and extinct dreams"—are declared but not causally demonstrated on the page. It could be replaced with "rare tuning crystal" without breaking the plot. Purposeful reprise, but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shard of hush is the story's central stake and shapes Maya's tactics: tuning with intention, using the fragment, timing the climb to perigee. The encounter inside the shard alters her understanding and drives her final choice to teach. It appears in setup (Guild deems it impossible), dominates the middle (the door opens, she traces it backward), and charges the ending (the data she recorded, her new mission). The concept is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the narrative. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the spectral receivers' pulses in the opening line and recurs implicitly in the "amber shadows" and signal-stream metaphors. However, it functions as atmospheric label rather than a trait that constrains action. No choice hinges on serene-versus-chaotic signal quality; no cost is tied to it. Present early, tonally consistent, but ornamental. No middle development or closure participation as a distinct property.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tuning drives every major beat: adjusting receivers, connecting the fragment, drifting along signal streams, tuning "not with dials but with intention," and the final decision to "tune her life differently." The action is irreplaceable—"searching" or "listening" would not capture the active frequency-adjustment mechanic. It shapes her method, the shard discovery, and the thematic closure. Early signal, middle enactment, closure metaphor. High causal integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("learned to discard such assumptions" about quantum processors) and recurs at the end ("by discarding the assumption that silence meant absence"). It frames her heterodox method and thematic stance. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what specific on-page choice does she make by discarding an assumption during the climb or shard encounter? The method is told twice but not dramatized as a tactical constraint. Lyric reprise without middle development caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over Whisper Gorge provides spatial constraint (the climb, the apex platform), temporal pressure (cables sway with lunar pull), and thematic resonance (built to escape Frequency Wars, abandoned when silence was forgotten). The maintenance ladder's pitch-singing and the gorge's mist are sensuously realized. The setting enables the shard's appearance via gravitational distortion and charges the ending (the city will "sing again"). Setup, middle use, and closure participation are all strong. Environment alters tactics and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is signaled in the opening, explained as tripling celestial transmissions and creating gravitational gaps for the shard to exist, and tracked on the page (the moon "hung fat and silver," cables sway). Maya's timing depends on it. However, the six-hour duration is told rather than felt, and no on-page countdown or shifting moon position tightens her choices during the climb or shard encounter. The timeframe is causally necessary but not dynamically pressuring. Setup and middle explanation are solid; closure linkage is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the beginning in every ending—is declared early, pursued throughout, and voiced again at closure ("every ending was just a beginning waiting for someone to listen"). It drives her heretical quest and her final teaching decision. However, the desire is never shown in conflict with competing wants (Guild approval, safety, doubt). She seeks, finds, and resolves without friction. The motivation is present and thematically coherent but lacks the on-page collision of want versus cost that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality"—the blend of lyric metaphor (electromagnetic poetry, frequencies as songs) with technical grounding (spectral receivers, copper filaments, quantum processors)—is coherent throughout. The tone modulates slightly: workmanlike setup, lyric intensity in the shard, practical resolution. "The practicality of magic" is named on the page and demonstrated in her method. The closing smile and cool fragment balance wonder with earned outcome. Tone supports the concept and charges the final image without tipping into pure lyricism or dry technicality.</comment>
