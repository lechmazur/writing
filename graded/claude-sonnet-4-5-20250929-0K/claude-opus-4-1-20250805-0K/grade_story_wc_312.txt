<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her "lukewarm" magic constrains her approach, but interiority relies heavily on summary ("she'd discovered," "she theorized") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The Academy's laughter and her father's death are told backstory that primes but doesn't actively complicate present choices. The final collapse reads as exhaustion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Competence overwhelms genuine struggle; the ritual succeeds exactly as planned without meaningful error or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors adequately (Mira, viaduct, dawn, post-fish world by ~100 words). The causal lens is inferrable: bell frequencies caused the rift, so recreating them should restore fish. However, "The third drop never fell" introduces a rule change (suspended drop, reality blur) not seeded earlier, weakening because/therefore linkage at the climax. Closure is a Decisive Change (fish return) but the cost is vague—Mira collapses from exhaustion, a generic price that doesn't foreclose a named path or reweight prior stakes. The ending summarizes triumph without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct functions as a tuning fork, constraining Mira's choice of location and enabling the ritual through its crystalline resonance—this qualifies as micro-setting that shapes tactics. Dawn's temperature/humidity equilibrium is specified and necessary. Sensory detail (azure arches, translucent fish, pure water reflecting sky) is vivid and filtered through Mira's focus. The bell's broken edge and condensation mechanics ground the climax in concrete process, charging the final image when the bell hums without being struck.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the fish, validate the theory) is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Mira performs the ritual as rehearsed, condensation forms on cue, and the climax ("The third drop never fell") arrives as spectacle rather than a choice-driven tightening. No visible trade-off or forfeited option is dramatized; the success is complete and unambiguous. The cost—collapse from exhaustion—is generic and doesn't narrow future options or force a renunciation, keeping pressure in the mid-band under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell/frequency metaphor and Mira's gentle magic proving superior to brute force—"Sometimes the cosmos needed not power but precision." The closing epigram ("Sometimes it needed someone naive enough…") risks thematic echo but is earned by the prior demonstration. The broken bell creates harmonics no intact instrument could, a resonant inversion. However, the piece leans toward thesis illustration rather than ambiguity; the ending validates Mira's belief fully without complication or lingering cost, limiting thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and focused on Mira throughout. Diction ("cosmic scales," "lukewarm talents," "membrane between worlds") balances accessible metaphor with voice specificity. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Narrative distance is consistent, though phrases like "madness and revelation often wore the same face" and "Sometimes the cosmos needed…" slip toward summary wisdom rather than character-bound perception. Filter verbs ("she murmured," "she'd discovered") are present but not stacked heavily enough to dull immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are solid; the ritual sequence propels forward without major loops. However, several template stems recur: "She'd spent," "She'd practiced," "She'd need to," creating mild cadence monotony in the setup. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "flickering like a candle in wind," "slipped sideways into somewhere else." The climax relies on generic intensifiers ("began to shimmer," "flickered in and out") rather than concrete sensory escalation. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the penalty in the modest range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (sound frequencies hold reality together, gentle magic repairs rifts) synthesizes fantasy tropes with acoustic science in a fresh angle. The broken bell creating superior harmonics is a clever inversion. However, the emotional arc is template-familiar: underestimated outsider validates niche theory, saves the world, is vindicated. The Academy's dismissal and Mira's father are stock motivators. The resolution is tidy and complete, lacking the ambiguity or cost that would deepen originality. Transformation test: swap names/places and the arc remains generic "misfit genius proves doubters wrong."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout and her choices drive setup (salvaging the bell, choosing the viaduct, timing for dawn equilibrium) and the climax (channeling her modest magic into the bridge). Her "lukewarm" power constrains her method—stronger magic would collide realms—demonstrating cost and necessity. The final collapse is reaction rather than choice, but the ritual itself is her decisive action. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the execution reads more as problem-solving than character transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell is introduced early (salvaged from the Aurora, the last vessel), recurs in the middle (suspended, condensation forming), and anchors the climax (singing without being struck, its broken edge creating unique harmonics). Its fracture is essential—"harmonics that no intact instrument could produce"—and it remains humming as "a new lighthouse for the boundary between worlds" in the ending. Removal would collapse the story's central mechanism. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" is invoked thematically (Mira's "earnest faith," "devoted enough to prove it") but does not constrain on-page choices with visible cost. Her commitment is complete and unwavering; no moment shows devotion threatening to break or forcing a sacrifice. The concept is echoed in summary rather than tested in action. Present as a thematic label, but does not narrow options or create friction that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" is assigned early ("naive enough to believe the impossible") and Mira's persistence despite Academy mockery reflects the trait. However, it functions as backstory motivation rather than an on-page constraint. The trait enables her belief in the theory but does not create a visible tradeoff or complicate a present choice—she succeeds exactly as planned without naivety costing her. Functional but largely ornamental in execution, lacking dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rebuild" structures the entire plot: Mira rebuilds the bell's voice through condensation and viaduct resonance. The action is signaled early ("she'd need to rebuild the bell's voice, not its body"), executed in the middle (suspending the bell, channeling magic), and completes at closure (the bell sings, fish return). The distinction between voice and body is essential and not swappable. Strong causal role across beats, though the rebuild proceeds without setback or pivot, keeping it below indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is signaled in the setup ("the precise dripping rates of condensation… three drops per minute") and determines the ritual's mechanics at the climax. The method is specific and irreplaceable—temperature/humidity equilibrium at dawn triggers the rate. However, it functions as knowledge applied rather than a process tested; Mira's months of study are summarized, and the dripping proceeds on cue without adjustment. Present in setup and payoff with clear causal necessity, but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is introduced immediately, its properties explained ("massive tuning fork… ancient engineers who understood frequencies"), and it enables the climax by conducting Mira's magic into resonance ("pressed her palms against the viaduct's stone… the bridge itself" rang out). The setting constrains her location choice and supplies the necessary acoustic resource. Dawn timing tightens the window. The viaduct participates actively in the ending, charging the final image. Strong integration across gates with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last fish is caught" establishes the world state and Mira's motivation, but does not function as a live clock that alters tactics. "Three years had passed" is background; the dawn window provides urgency, but the fish-loss timeframe itself remains static context. The Aurora's bell being the "last" bell matters conceptually but does not track or tighten decisions within the scene. Present in setup and thematically, but does not pressure the present action with countdown or scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To right a cosmic imbalance" drives Mira's goal from the start and structures the plot: she believes the bell network stabilized realms, and recreating the harmonic will restore fish. The motivation is dramatized through her months of research, choice of viaduct, and ritual execution. However, it is never conflicted—no moment shows Mira doubting or weighing the cost of success against another desire. The motivation is pursued without friction or trade-off, keeping it functional but not deeply tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Plausible impossibility" is sustained: the acoustic mechanism is explained with pseudo-scientific detail (dripping rates, frequencies, viaduct resonance), while fish slipping between realms and translucent schools remain fantastical. Tone modulates from melancholy backstory to procedural ritual to spectacle at the climax. The final image (bell humming, boat motoring out) balances wonder with earned practicality. Coherent through turns, though the ending's triumph flattens tension rather than charging ambiguity, limiting the tone's final reweighting.</comment>
