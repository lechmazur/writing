<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory anchors (compass weight, kayak rhythm, pole counting), and his decision to teach navigation arises from the paddle journey with visible cost in acknowledging his broken state. However, the final epiphany ("broken things can still point toward something meaningful") edges into therapy-speak abstraction rather than remaining embodied. Sarah's merrily melancholic tone is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. The backstory block (~25%) anchors in the present compass touch and primes the teaching offer, meeting BRR expanded-mode tests.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pole counting and compass handling accumulate pressure until the teaching offer reconfigures Marcus's stance with conceptual cost (accepting brokenness as a new navigation method). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Marcus, coastal launch, morning). The closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting toward Charged Poise): Marcus accepts his broken state and finds utility in simplicity, with the cost legible in his acknowledgment that the astronomical compass will never guide ships again. One meaningful deepening occurs at pole nineteen when he laughs at the seal, signaling the shift from passive grief to active acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation choices and charges the final image; their numbered progression creates spatial choreography and Marcus's professional filter (pole seventeen/current, twenty-three/rocks) reveals character-specific perception. The coastal launch and fog-lifting are vivid but largely atmospheric. The astronomical compass as recurring object shifts from failure witness to memory anchor, meeting the object-as-setting test by constraining the teaching decision at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marcus finding purpose after catastrophic failure—is signaled early and tightens through the paddle sequence. The pole-nineteen stop generates meaningful deepening: confronting the rescue-launch site forces him to reweight the compass from broken instrument to honorable memory, narrowing his grief-navigation to a teaching path. The teaching offer forecloses endless passive paddling with visible cost (accepting he'll never captain ships again). Agency is renunciation and stance crystallization, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: utility poles as makeshift constellation, broken compass as honorable witness, seal's curiosity triggering genuine laughter. The final exchange ("broken things can still point toward something meaningful") risks stating theme but is immediately grounded by Sarah's shoulder touch and the action of pulling the kayak ashore. The closing image—poles as "unconventional constellation marking safe passage"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether broken navigators can guide again, reweighting prior material without overt moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with Marcus's professional filter (grid references, merchant fleet terminology) coloring perception. Dialogue carries subtext—Sarah's "broken navigator finds a new way" acknowledges his shift without overexplaining. However, "merrily melancholic" as a POV-asserted descriptor for Sarah's tone reads as external labeling rather than embodied observation. The prose modulates appropriately under stress (short sentences at pole nineteen), and psychic distance tightens during the seal encounter to capture surprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the pole-counting sequence. Two minor loops appear: "broken" repeats across adjacent beats without added pressure ("broken things"/"broken navigator" within three lines near closure), and "gravitating" appears twice in similar constructions. The metaphor "backlash of regrets...like waves eroding" is apt but followed immediately by "fragments remained," mixing erosion and breakage without clear vehicle. Template cadence in the backstory paragraph ("He'd been...until that night...when his calculations...") slightly flattens momentum but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—failed navigator rebuilding via utility poles instead of stars—offers a specific angle on redemption-after-failure material. The pole-numbering system is concrete and character-integrated. However, the seal encounter and teaching epiphany follow familiar recovery beats without significant transformation. The merrily melancholic descriptor and "flickering faith" lean on stock metaphor rather than fresh synthesis. The closing image of poles as "unconventional constellation" ties elements neatly but predictably.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's choice to teach kayak navigation (final third) grows from the pole-nineteen confrontation and seal-laugh beats; his decision forecloses endless passive paddling with visible cost. Present in setup (broken navigator introduced paragraph one), middle (pole-counting choice), and closure (teaching offer). Two distinct beats: pole-nineteen stop and teaching declaration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Astronomical compass appears in four beats: opening tactile trace, pocket weight during paddle, pole-nineteen examination, and final image in sunlight. It shifts from failure witness to memory anchor, enabling the teaching decision. Early signal (paragraph one), middle constraint (its brokenness mirrors Marcus), and closure participation (held up to catch light). Causal pressure: its degraded state validates utility-pole method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is named early and shapes Marcus's paddling ritual as grief navigation. The concept constrains his avoidance of traditional tools and enables acceptance of simpler methods. Present in setup (backstory paragraph), development (pole-nineteen reflection), and closure (regrets feeling "less like drowning"). However, it operates more as thematic backdrop than on-page tactical pressure; the teaching choice traces more directly to the seal encounter than to regret mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sarah's "merrily melancholic tone" is asserted twice but never dramatized through contradictory action or dialogue that shows simultaneous cheer and sorrow. It does not constrain an on-page choice or generate visible cost. Late middle arrival (rental shack scene) and closure mention ("merrily melancholic smile") are ornamental labels without embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gravitate" appears twice: Marcus's eyes "gravitating toward the horizon" and the closing "gravitating between grief and healing." The first instance suggests pull toward open water but does not drive a turn; the second is thematic summary. The action is present but does not redefine options or shape the teaching decision. Swappable with "drawn to" or "moving between" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles is signaled early (paragraph five), its mechanics detailed (pole seventeen/current, twenty-three/rocks, thirty-one/safe return), and used throughout the paddle sequence to create spatial pressure. The method contrasts with astronomical navigation, enabling Marcus's acceptance of simpler tools and directly shaping the teaching offer at closure. Present in setup, development (counting backward), and ending (teaching proposal). Irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on this exact navigational frame.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coastal kayak launch anchors all action, provides the utility poles as navigation frame, and supplies the fog-lifting moment that charges Marcus's shift. Setting enables the paddle ritual, constrains return timing (pole thirty-one safety limit), and houses the teaching conversation at closure. Present in setup (paragraph three), development (pole sequence), and ending (beaching the kayak). Micro-setting via body (kayak rhythm in shoulders) and tool (paddle) further grounds choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" frames the backstory (three years ago, twenty-seven souls lost) and the present teaching offer reweights that collapse. However, the timeframe operates as past-tense context rather than live pressure on the page. The morning paddle has no urgent clock; Marcus's shift happens when expectations have already collapsed, not during the collapse. Functional but not pressuring present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to "align heart and action" is dramatized through Marcus's conflicted compass-carrying (failure symbol vs. memory anchor), the pole-counting ritual (simpler action), and the teaching offer (new alignment). Friction between grief and utility is visible in his surprise at laughing and in the final image where alignment remains incomplete ("gravitating between"). Present in setup (compass weight vs. empty flask), middle (pole-nineteen choice), and closure (teaching as new action). Cost: accepting he'll never captain again.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" is named once and suggested through Marcus's hesitant choices (stopping at pole nineteen, surprise at laughter, tentative teaching offer). Tone modulates from heavy grief (backstory) to lightness (seal encounter) to cautious hope (ending), coherent with pressure shifts. The flicker quality charges Sarah's observation that faith is "solidifying just a little." Present thematically but not as distinct constraint; the tone supports rather than drives the closure image.</comment>
