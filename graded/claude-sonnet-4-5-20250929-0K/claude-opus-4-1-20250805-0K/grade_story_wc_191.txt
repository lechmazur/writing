<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is declared ("find the stairway") but her interior life remains thin—discovering the throne's purpose lands as epiphany delivered through mural text rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The line "understanding flooding through her" exemplifies tell-heavy revelation. Embodied emotion is sparse; no micro-choices under pressure constrain her path with visible cost. The ending reconfigures her goal (sharing knowledge vs. claiming power), but the shift reads conceptual rather than felt, and no prior on-page struggle between hoarding and sharing dramatizes the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing: the throne's purpose is revealed as a monument to restraint, reweighting the quest premise. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique—Anya dissolves the ruby flake and returns home with knowledge, but no live option is foreclosed and no tactical price is visible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered paint reveals, song ritual, fragment network), held consistently, but the closure lacks the felt or relational cost required for higher bands. Midpoint coherence is strong; the mural sequence advances knowledge in motivated steps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, orchard, and maintenance shed are anchored with vivid sensory detail (bio-luminescent leaves, smart-paint flickering, chromium oxide trace). The shed's layered paint constrains Anya's method (precision laser peel) and charges the closure by housing the ultraviolet revelation. However, spatial choreography inside the shed remains vague—no body-scale choices (e.g., kneeling, shifting light angle) pressure her movement. The sunrise ritual (trees singing) enriches atmosphere but does not alter her tactical options. Micro-setting (the ruby flake in her pocket, the suit's visor) appears but does not constrain a choice. The orchard supplies resources (the song, the mural) that shape understanding, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is signaled early and coheres through the paint-peeling sequence. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—each paint layer simply reveals the next piece of history without cost or trade-off. The deadline ("until sunrise") creates urgency in framing but never forces a tactical choice; Anya completes her discovery with time to spare and sits to listen. The resolution (sharing knowledge, not claiming power) is thematically clear but not dramatized as a choice under pressure; no competing want (e.g., temptation to hoard the fragment, fear of returning empty-handed) creates friction. The ruby flake dissolves passively, not as a renunciation with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present (density increases through layered reveals) but lacks a moment where Anya's agency forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (collective knowledge over centralized power, restraint as wisdom) emerges clearly through the mural sequence and founders' choice. The final image—Anya returning with "another fragment of truth"—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward abstract philosophizing ("slow ascension toward something better than kings") rather than letting particulars speak. The ultraviolet paint text ("to rise above the old ways") borders on thematic echo, though it functions as in-world message rather than narratorial summary. The ruby flake's dissolution and the song ritual are purposeful recurring images that reweight the premise, but the conceptual cost (accepting the throne remains unclaimed) is not dramatized through Anya's internal conflict—she smiles in understanding rather than grappling with loss or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scanner detecting chromium oxide, suit's visor filtering the waterfall) but not character-particular—the diction reads elevated and genre-neutral rather than reflecting Anya's specific idiom or professional priorities as a lore keeper. Phrases like "wisely adventurous steps" and "democracy reborn in exile" drift into essayistic register. The single line of dialogue ("Sally forth," "They chose not to rule") carries thematic weight but does not pursue a goal or reveal subtext. Psychic distance is consistent; no filter-verb stacks. Narrative stance modulates appropriately (wonder at the orchard, solemnity at the mural), but the prose does not sharpen under pressure—syntax remains uniform through discovery beats. The final paragraph's rhythm ("carrying the future's memory of a past that chose not to repeat itself") prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but template cadence and synonym loops appear throughout: "began to sing… song of democracy," "Fragment… fragments… fragment," "knowledge… discoveries… knowledge." Figurative language stacks without always serving clarity: "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "prismatic cascade," "binary sunlight" within one short sequence. The phrase "the future's memory of a past" is conceptually muddled. Stock metaphors ("monument to restraint," "guardian, watching over") dull the closure image. Information density is uneven—paragraph three front-loads archival knowledge (chromium oxide, paint encoding) that could be woven through action. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than trusting the dramatized moment. Sentence openings vary; rhythm is controlled. The scaffold check reveals some exposition ("She knew from the archives") that could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (unclaimed throne as monument to restraint, knowledge fragments scattered to force collaboration) offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic governance. However, the execution leans on familiar YA/quest templates: lone seeker, hidden knowledge, timed quest, epiphany through ancient artifact. The mural-peeling method is specific, but the emotional arc (confusion → understanding → acceptance) lacks a non-obvious turn. The throne never exerts narrative pressure as a temptation or cost; Anya never considers claiming it or hoarding the fragment, so the thematic choice feels preordained. The "wisely adventurous" trait and "sally forth" invocation are gestural rather than particular to this voice. No proximity echoes of famous lines, but the conceptual synthesis (democracy through decentralization) reads derivative of well-known political philosophy without lived-in specificity. The binary suns and bio-luminescent trees add surface novelty without altering the core stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Anya (lore keeper) is present throughout and pursues the stairway, but her role as "lore keeper" does not constrain or enable key choices—her suit's laser and scanner could belong to any explorer. She makes no difficult decision; the mural reveals answers passively. Her choice to return and share knowledge (final third) is narrated, not dramatized as a turn. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but her specific character function is replaceable with "seeker" or "archivist." Mid-band functional use without causal pressure or visible cost tied to her role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears in paragraph three (setup), hums in response to the mural (middle development), projects ultraviolet light to reveal hidden text (key turn), and dissolves at closure, its data absorbed. Four distinct beats; its unique property (ultraviolet projection) is irreplaceable for unlocking the final message. However, the dissolution is passive—Anya does not choose to destroy it or trade it; it simply melts. No visible cost tied to losing the object. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability at the ending (any data-transfer mechanism could serve) and lack of felt sacrifice prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is named in paragraph one, drives Anya's goal throughout, and the mural revelation (paragraph six) redefines its purpose—not lost but deliberately rejected. The final image explicitly ties Anya's return to the throne's enduring symbolic role. However, the throne never appears as a physical object or exerts pressure as a temptation; it remains an abstract idea. The piece explores its conceptual meaning but does not stage a choice where Anya must decide whether to claim or reject it. Present across all three gates (setup, middle realization, ending commentary), shaping the dominant stake, but its causal role is thematic rather than tactical. Lyric resonance without on-page agency test.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" appears once as a label ("wisely adventurous steps," paragraph two) without constraining or enabling a choice. Anya's actions (stepping through the waterfall, using the laser carefully) could be motivated by caution, curiosity, or protocol; the trait is not irreplaceable. No second mention; no cost tied to balancing wisdom and adventure. Ornamental use; swappable with "careful" or "determined." Falls below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sally forth" is invoked as Anya steps through the waterfall (end of paragraph one), framing the transition into the orchard. However, the phrase is a ritual invocation, not a tactical action—removing it would not alter the sequence. The step through the waterfall is the load-bearing action, and "sally forth" is a verbal flourish. Present in setup but does not drive a turn or redefine options. The story could proceed identically with "she stepped through" alone. Functional as atmospheric detail but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Peeling paint layers is signaled (paragraph three: archives encoded in layered murals), demonstrated (paragraph five: precision laser peels outermost layer), and drives the sequence of reveals (gray → constellations → schematics → founders' mural → ultraviolet text). The method's mechanics matter—each layer requires deliberate removal, and the ultraviolet reveal depends on the ruby flake. Present across setup, middle escalation, and ending (the final hidden text charges the closure image). The method is irreplaceable for this discovery path; swapping it (e.g., digital scan) would require rewriting the core sequence. However, no visible cost or trade-off (time pressure, tool failure) complicates the peeling. Strong beat involvement and causal necessity; lacks only a price tied to the method itself to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored in paragraph one (setup) and revisited at closure (Anya sees settlement lights through the waterfall as she prepares to return). The orchard houses the maintenance shed (key location for mural discovery) and the trees' dawn song (ritual that completes thematic understanding). However, the orchard as environment does not constrain choices—Anya walks through it without obstacle, and the waterfall is a threshold crossed once without cost. The setting supplies resources (shed, song) rather than pressure. Present in setup and ending; functional in middle. Spatial layout is clear, but no micro-setting choice (e.g., navigating rows, avoiding bio-luminescent exposure) alters tactics. Lyric reprise and resource role without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is declared in paragraph one ("until sunrise to find the stairway") and referenced at closure ("the first rays of binary sunlight," "dawn approached"). However, the timeframe never tightens a choice—Anya completes her discovery and then sits to listen to the song with time to spare. No moment where the clock forces her to skip a layer, leave early, or choose between competing actions. The deadline functions as atmospheric framing rather than tactical pressure. Present in setup and ending but absent from middle development. Swappable with "by nightfall" or removable without altering the sequence. Functional setup without escalation bite.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Anya's goal (find the stairway of ascension) is stated in paragraph one, pursued through the orchard and shed exploration, and recontextualized by the mural revelation ("not a place but a choice"). The motivation drives her forward through all beats and is reweighted at closure when she understands the stairway as collective wisdom rather than individual ascent. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing fear (e.g., doubt about returning without a throne, temptation to claim power) creates friction. She accepts the revelation with a smile; no visible cost. Present across all three gates, shapes the dominant stake, but lacks dramatized want-versus-cost tension. Strong setup and thematic payoff; missing the pressure test in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia (longing for lost Earth, ancient colony wisdom, binary suns, smart-paint) is established early and sustained through the mural's Earth constellations, the founders' solemn choice, and the orchard's programmed song. The tone modulates appropriately—wonder at the waterfall, reverence at the mural, quiet satisfaction at closure. However, the tone remains stable rather than charging the final image with new emotional weight; the ending's nostalgia ("future's memory of a past") echoes the opening without a felt shift. Coherent and consistent across beats; no tonal clash. Lyric unity without a decisive cadence break or ironic turn that would elevate closure. Mid-band for coherence and modulation; lacks the intensification or recontextualization required for higher scores.</comment>
