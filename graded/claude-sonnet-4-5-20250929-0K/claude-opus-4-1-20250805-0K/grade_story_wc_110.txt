<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority carries consistent voice and her micro-choices (approaching, confessing eavesdropping, completing the doodles) show agency under pressure. Internal conflict between protecting Marcus and honesty is stated but not simultaneously dramatized—choices alternate rather than collide in-scene. Samuel remains functional but flat; his protective sacrifice is told rather than shown wrestling with cost. The final reconciliation feels unmotivated by on-page struggle; trust thaws via confession exchange without visible friction or residual doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: confessions layer toward reconciliation, the lens stays coherent, and forecourt acoustics deepen throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the hand-taking and shared understanding reweight mistrust into tentative trust with felt cost ("simply two people learning to trust again"). Orientation is clean by opening paragraph. The escalation is modest—one accumulative deepening via parallel confessions—but sufficient at this length and the cost (months of silence, protective deceptions now transparent) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt is vividly rendered with selective acoustic and visual detail (puddles as mirrors, quartz pillars singing with rain, mist on the lens). Micro-setting constrains the tone and charges the final image: acoustics amplify whispers into music, paralleling the thematic shift from silence to honesty. Spatial choreography is clear (Mira's approach, lens on ledge, hand-holding). Minor: the museum archive and board-meeting vents are referenced but not grounded enough to test the eavesdropping claim's plausibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when both confessions converge and Marcus's own confession removes the audit shadow, narrowing their protective architectures into transparency with visible relational cost (months of silence, elaborate misdirection now unmade). Agency is present in Mira's choice to meet and confess; Samuel's protection is told but still shifts options. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens without requiring reversal. Cost is legible but quiet—foreclosed deception, nascent trust—and could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—honesty as liberation versus protective deception—emerges through the lens metaphor ("clarity and distortion were sometimes the same gift") and the forecourt's acoustic transformation of silence into music. The final image (lens gathering rain and moonlight, breath becoming music) reweights prior secrecy with resonance and avoids stating a moral. Subtext operates in doodles, silence, and gesture. Minor: "freed by the simple, terrifying act of honesty" edges toward explicit thesis in the penultimate paragraph (−0.2), but the ending recovers with image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (museum lexicon, visual metaphors via lens and light). Dialogue carries subtext ("Then you know," the lens as stand-in for their history) and advances confession efficiently. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("elaborate architectures of protection," "withheld truth had crystallized") in ways that feel authorial rather than Mira's natural thought. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") cluster in mid-scene without harming immediacy. Distinct voice, minor polish needed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in confession beats. Figurative language (lens as metaphor, forecourt acoustics) recurs purposefully and charges closure. Loop/scaffold issues: "resonant hush" appears three times, "ambiguously clear" twice, "crystal whispering forecourt" is template-repeated in opening and penultimate paragraph without tonal shift (−0.4 paraphrase/template). Elevated diction ("elaborate architectures," "sewn itself between them like a dark thread") occasionally clashes with night-registrar POV (−0.3 register drift). Propulsion is steady; no causality-breaking artifacts. Closure beats remain clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The doodle-invitation frame and acoustic forecourt offer fresh angles on reconciliation-after-betrayal. Emotional specificity (eavesdropping confessed, parallel protective lies) avoids generic templates. The lens-as-metaphor recurs with purpose, though "clarity and distortion" becomes slightly overt. Tropes (misunderstanding resolved by confession, symbolic object) are elevated by the acoustic setting but not fully transformed—the arc could occur with different props and still function (transformation test friction). Risk-taking in tone and setting partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira as night registrar appears in opening and drives all key choices: approaching, confessing eavesdropping, completing doodles, meeting Samuel. "Quiet" trait reads in her silence over three months but doesn't constrain a peak choice with visible cost. Setup clear, middle choices present, closure linkage strong. "Registrar" occupation is mentioned but irrelevant to conflict—trait could be swapped for another museum role without structural change (−0.4 swappability). Her agency shapes two beats and the ending; score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Projector lens is handled in three beats: Samuel holds it at opening, Mira picks it up and examines it mid-scene, it rests on ledge gathering mist at closure. Metaphoric weight ("showed things clearly, even when they weren't") ties directly to theme. Reprise in final paragraph ("gathering rain and moonlight equally") reweights clarity/distortion motif and charges closure image. Setup early, beat involvement strong, closure linkage clear, irreplaceability high. Cost connection indirect but thematic. Strong upper-7 integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Honesty as liberating force is dramatized: both confessions (eavesdropping, protecting Marcus) occur on-page and shift options—Marcus's confession removes audit shadow, enabling reconciliation. Setup in opening ("transparency had a way of demanding its due"), middle confessions shape the turn, closure states "freed by the simple, terrifying act of honesty" with hand-holding as proof. Concept shapes stakes and alters tactics. Minor: stated a bit directly in penultimate paragraph rather than purely shown (−0.3). Mid-6 for functional causal work with slight overstatement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is stated twice (doodles, final lens line) and applied to communication method—doodles require interpretation yet Mira "understood immediately." Trait enables the invitation mechanism but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; it describes their shared idiom rather than forcing a tradeoff. Setup present, middle use functional (doodles decode), closure reprise ("as clear and ambiguous as light") thematic but not causal. Functional but mid-replaceable—trait could be "coded" or "oblique" without structural loss (−0.6 swappability). Low-5 for ornamental trait use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is confessed mid-scene and reveals Mira knew Samuel was protecting Marcus, shifting the reconciliation's foundation from suspicion to shared secrecy. Setup via confession, middle revelation alters Samuel's understanding ("surprise, then understanding"), closure depends on this knowledge leveling. Action drives one major turn and enables transparency. Could be replaced with another covert-knowledge method (e.g., overhearing in hallway) without breaking story (−0.5 swappability), but the archive-vent detail adds specificity. Solid mid-7 for causal involvement across two beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cryptic doodles on concert tickets frame the invitation: Samuel's spirals/arrows/clock/keyhole establish the meeting, Mira's additions (bridge, clock hands, exclamation) signal acceptance and reciprocal honesty. Method is signaled early, mechanics matter (interpretation shows shared language), and tickets reappear mid-scene as proof of mutual transformation. Setup clear, development strong (doodles enable the meet), closure participation present (spread on wet stone as confession artifact). Swappability moderate—could be coded note or other shared symbol (−0.4). Upper-6 for method shaping attempts and middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crystal whispering forecourt constrains tone (acoustics amplify whispers into music, reflecting honesty's resonance) and charges every beat: Mira's approach ripples in puddles, confessions gain harmonic weight, final breath becomes music. Setting is introduced in opening, pressures middle confessions by transforming speech into something larger, and supplies the closure image (singing walls, moonlight, stars). Irreplaceable—no other venue offers acoustic transformation that mirrors thematic shift from silence to honesty. Strong causal and thematic integration; upper-7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" timeframe is stated in opening and closing but never pressures tactics or creates urgency—it's a poetic descriptor rather than a constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the scene unfolds at contemplative pace without time cost. Setup present as mood, no middle development, closure reprises phrase ("after words had become unnecessary") but time remains atmospheric. Lyric reprise noted but without causal weight (−0.8 ornamental). Cap at ~4.8 for descriptive rather than pressure-driven timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to thaw mistrust with transparency drives Mira's meeting choice, eavesdropping confession, and doodle-completion. Setup clear ("weight of withheld truth had crystallized"), middle choices dramatize friction (risk of vulnerability, months of silence undone), closure delivers on motivation (hand-holding, trust beginning). Cost is felt—protective lies unmade, months of distance acknowledged—and desire conflicts with self-protection impulse. Strong causal and emotional work. Upper-7 for dramatized want shaping choices with visible relational cost across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resonant hush tone is established in opening ("weighted with what remained unspoken"), modulates through confessions (forecourt "held their confessions like a vessel," acoustics transform whispers), and charges final image ("even their breathing became music"). Tone coheres through turns without static flatness and intensifies at closure when silence becomes music, mirroring reconciliation. Setup strong, development consistent, payoff clear. Minor: phrase "resonant hush" repeats identically three times without tonal shift (−0.3 template). Upper-7 for coherent, pressure-responsive tone that charges ending.</comment>
