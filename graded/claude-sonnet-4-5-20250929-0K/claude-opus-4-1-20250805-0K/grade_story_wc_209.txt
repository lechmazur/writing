<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's quiet devotion is legible and her final choice to hide the postcards feels motivated, but her interior work remains largely contemplative rather than conflict-driven. The piece tells us she "understood" repeatedly without dramatizing the struggle that earns understanding through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears sporadically ("fingertips still stained"); most interiority operates at a remove, summarizing rather than enacting the cost of her obsession. The ending forecloses a path (leaving the postcards) with visible cost, but the decision emerges from reflection more than from a dramatized crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's final act of hiding the postcards crystallizes her understanding that certain beauties refuse scrutiny, reweighting her winter-to-winter journey with visible cost (she walks away stained, carrying a gift "she hadn't yet given"). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery and the pavilion transforms across seasons—with a meaningful cadence shift at the solstice when she "understood." Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). One friction: the midpoint pivot ("The postcards hadn't been documentation—they'd been instruction") is told rather than discovered through scene pressure, softening causality slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion's copper roof, weathered floor, and loose panel constrain Mara's final choice to hide the postcards, charging the closure image. Seasonal markers (October dusk, November near-complete, winter solstice snow) track time and shift atmosphere purposefully. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "candlelight, the way the postcard artist must have worked" reveals her working method as discovery. The pavilion's dual nature (daylight botanicals, nocturnal blooms) functions as both setting and thematic container, shaping her layering technique and final understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the flowers were painted and hidden—is signaled early and tightens once at the solstice when Mara realizes the postcards are instruction, not documentation. That tightening reweights her mural work with visible cost: she commits to secrecy, accepts that her art will be misread by most, and walks away still carrying the mystery. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase (winter → spring → summer → autumn → winter solstice) that deepens her investment. One friction: the pivotal realization is conceptual rather than tested by an on-page reversal or refusal; no live option is dramatized and foreclosed in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—hidden beauty, patient transmission, the shelter of shadows—emerges organically from Mara's nocturnal layering and the postcards' cathedral origin. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she hides the postcards "their edges barely visible to someone looking at just the right angle," mirroring the flowers' refusal of daylight scrutiny. "Dawning hush" recurs purposefully, reweighting transitions and the final image. One slip: "certain beauties refuse the sun's scrutiny" and "why certain beauties refuse the sun" repeat the thesis too explicitly in the closing paragraphs, edging toward thematic echo without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices paint, light, layering). Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("held breath," "urgently driven") that teaches a pattern. One persistent friction: "dawning hush" and several lyric phrases ("petals that caught moonlight like memories," "soft as petals, patient as the moon's slow journey") repeat cadence and vehicle across multiple paragraphs, creating convergence at emotional peaks and reducing distinctness. The prose reads as singular voice but leans toward patterned lyricism that can flatten urgency under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce momentum. "Dawning hush" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "certain beauties refuse the sun's scrutiny/refuse the sun" cycles within two paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("blooms into vast murals that seemed to breathe," "flowers that opened only in darkness, petals that caught moonlight like memories") without clear escalation or payoff, triggering overwriting friction. Several beats restate the same content: Mara paints at night because daylight "would have been wrong" is echoed by "nocturnal blooms," "activate in darkness," and "bloomed at night because…harsh edges softened." Aggregate pattern-artifact penalty and loop deductions apply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—an artist discovers hidden postcards and learns a secret lineage of night-bloom painters—offers a fresh angle on inheritance and artistic transmission. Specific choices (amber resin mixed into pigments, the loose panel's exact placement, the cathedral custodian's permission) ground the conceit. The final image (postcards hidden for the next seeker, Mara walking with stained fingertips) feels earned in hindsight. One friction: the emotional arc and mural-within-mural structure echo familiar "artist discovers secret tradition" templates; transformation arises more from lyric texture than from a non-obvious moral calculus or high-stakes choice that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara frames the opening, drives the painting work across seasons, and makes the final choice to hide the postcards. Her decisions (working by candlelight, mixing amber resin, painting the tending hands) alter tactics and shape the ending. She appears in setup, development, and closure. One friction: much of her arc is contemplative summary rather than on-page choice under pressure; the solstice realization is conceptual, not forced by a reversal. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The postcards are handled in setup (spread on the floor), referenced in development (their pigments guide her mixing technique), and hidden in closure (tucked behind the panel). They shift meaning from mystery to instruction at the solstice. Two friction points: mid-story they appear primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice, and their final reprise is gesturally charged but does not dramatically alter Mara's tactics in the ending beat. Early signal, closure linkage, and lyric resonance support mid-6s; lack of middle constraint and swappability (any inherited art object could serve) limit upward reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears three times as a recurring phrase marking transitions and the final image, but it functions as atmospheric label more than a concept that changes options on the page. It signals tone and theme without constraining a choice or forcing a trade-off. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development and causal pressure are absent. Ornamental reprise without beat involvement or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is named once in the opening third and implied by Mara's patient work across seasons, but it remains label-only without an on-page moment where this trait enables or forecloses a choice with visible cost. The trait colors her behavior (returning nightly, layering secrets) but does not create friction or a dramatized tradeoff. Setup is present; middle constraint and closure cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears once as the commission's stated purpose and governs Mara's mural work, but the verb itself is conceptual rather than dramatized as a distinct on-page action. The process of reckoning (painting, layering, realizing) unfolds across beats, but "reckon" as a specific move does not redefine options or shape a turn. It frames intent without forcing a choice. Early signal and thematic linkage are present; causal pressure and irreplaceability are weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-glass origin is mentioned in the opening as backstory (where Mara found the postcards) but does not return or constrain her pavilion work. The method of discovery is setup only; it neither enables middle choices nor participates in closure. Swappable with any hidden location. No development or closure presence; ornamental setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion anchors all action, its copper roof and weathered floor ground sensory detail, and its loose panel enables the final hiding of the postcards. The pavilion's dual nature (daylight/night) mirrors Mara's thematic work and its seasonal cycle structures escalation. It participates in setup, development (the amber resin supply), and closure (the panel). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the amber resin's luminescence is unique to this site). One friction: the pavilion's interior mechanics (how visitors move, how candlelight works) remain abstract; micro-setting detail that would sharpen tactics is light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe spans winter's melt → spring → summer → autumn → winter solstice, structuring Mara's seasonal work and providing a narrative clock. Each season marks a phase of her mural's completion, and the solstice triggers her final understanding. Time is signaled early, tracked in development, and grounds closure. One friction: the pace is elastic (months compress into summary) without on-page pressure that a deadline would impose; time marks phases rather than tightening decisions. Setup, development, and closure participation are present; causal urgency is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to understand the night-bloom mystery is named early and governs her mural choices, but it operates as thematic frame more than dramatized friction. She pursues the question through painting, but no on-page beat shows her want conflicting with cost or fear. The motivation is told and illustrated, not tested. Setup and closure linkage are present (she "understood" at the solstice); middle friction between wants and costs is absent. Lyric resonance without causal struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is cohesive and sustained: lyric, nocturnal, patient, shadowed. "Umbral tenderness" reads in the diction ("soft as petals," "quiet hours," "shelter of shadows") and modulates subtly with seasonal shifts. The tone charges the final image (Mara walking through snow, the pavilion holding "summer and darkness in equal measure"). One friction: the tone remains static across turns rather than tightening or breaking under pressure; the same gentle cadence pervades crisis and calm, slightly flattening escalation. Coherence and closure charge are strong; pressure modulation is light.</comment>
