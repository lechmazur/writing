<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kenji's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—folding lace, tracing knots, standing at shore sending thoughts—and his slow-spoken teaching voice is consistent with his grief-driven year of silence. Internal conflict operates clearly: his desire to reach Yuki clashes with his paralysis, shown in the gap between nightly shore rituals and the decision to write only "tomorrow." The final choice to teach the student while planning to write carries visible cost (another day of severance), though the renunciation feels more implied than viscerally earned. Minor slip: "the color of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat" reads as over-articulated for peak emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—lace, compass, juniper, shore—that reweight Kenji's stance from paralyzed grief to readiness to write. Closure is Charged Poise: "Tomorrow, he would write" crystallizes the decision with undeniable emotional cost (the year-long severance persists today). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when the compass needle stops spinning and points toward "the exact shade of cerulean," forcing Kenji's internal shift. Cost is legible in the phrase "forgive me, I was afraid" and the persistence of his silence through today.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The post-rain islet, weathered porch, and harbor provide grounding with selective sensory detail (salt, green moss, silver droplets). The juniper functions as micro-setting, its wild growth mirroring Kenji's scattered grief and enabling the teaching beat that parallels his unspoken reconciliation. The lace and compass are handled across multiple beats, anchoring choices. Spatial choreography remains clear. The breezy islet does not strongly constrain a key choice but charges the final teaching moment through proximity to the harbor where Yuki departed, holding it just below the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation with Yuki after severance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the student's pruning lesson, which parallels Kenji's internal work, culminating in his decision to write tomorrow. One meaningful tightening: the compass needle's stop and the impossible cerulean color force Kenji's internal shift from nightly ritual to planned action. Cost is legible (another day without contact, the year-long silence) but the parallel between tree-pruning and emotional reconciliation occasionally feels overly allegorical, slightly diluting immediate stakes. No antagonist required under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (compass arrival) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—words unsaid anchor children who leave, communication encoded in care and craft—emerges from the lace's encoded instructions, Kenji's shore rituals, and the grandmother's parallel loss. The final image of teaching the student "how branches learn to bend without breaking" answers the central question through concrete action rather than assertion. Subtext operates in Kenji's measured cadence and the compass's symbolic weight. The fifth-row lace instruction ("To diffuse anger, first diffuse light through tears") borders on thematic echo but is framed as the grandmother's voice, not authorial intrusion. Recurring motifs (lace, compass, tide) reweight without becoming checklist symbols.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kenji with consistent psychic distance. His perceptual signature—slow, teaching cadence, attention to knots and roots—is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the student's questions advance the parallel lesson. Filter verbs ("studying," "watching") appear frequently but fit the contemplative register. One slip: "the exact shade of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat when someone struggles not to cry" over-articulates an insight Kenji would feel rather than taxonomize mid-grief. Diction remains largely within Kenji's lexicon, though occasional elevated phrasing ("diffuse and desperate," "laden with the cargo") tilts slightly literary for a man in silent grief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and the opening/closing images anchor voice and stakes. Figurative language is dense—"silence stretch like morning mist," "roots remember everything the tree forgets," "thoughts scattered by grief"—and mostly cohesive, though the cerulean passage mixes color, anatomy, and emotional state into near-opacity. Two paraphrase loops: "the pattern his grandmother called 'the tide's return'" followed immediately by "reading his grandmother's hidden message" repeats the lace-decoding concept; "the sea churned with its eternal rhythm, bringing things to shore and taking them away" summarizes what the tides metaphor already established. No major scaffold or template cadence, but density of metaphor in consecutive lines occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief encoded in craft across generations, slow reconciliation through teaching and pattern—feels specific and earned. The lace-as-encryption, ghost-ship compass, and bonsai-as-emotional-work are combined with care, avoiding mere checklist presence. The "color of unspoken apologies" offers a fresh inflection on regret. Risk: the accumulative, reflection-heavy structure succeeds in charging the final teaching beat. Two frictions hold it from higher bands: the parallel between tree-pruning and emotional healing occasionally becomes too explicit ("how branches learn to bend without breaking"), and the premise (estranged parent preparing to reconcile through objects and teaching) follows a familiar template, though the specific cultural detail (wartime lace encryption, bonsai tutelage) transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Master Kenji is present throughout, his teaching choices frame the narrative, and his decision to write tomorrow is the closure unit. His slow-spoken cadence constrains how he processes grief (shore rituals instead of direct calls) and shapes the student's pruning lesson, which in turn prompts his internal shift. The character is signaled early, involved in teaching and memory beats, and his final resolve participates in closure. Cost: the year-long silence and one more day of delay are visible. Not indispensable—another solitary craftsperson could serve—but well integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: introduced on the table with spinning needle (early setup), handled by Kenji who feels its unnatural weight (middle), and given to the student when the needle stops and points toward cerulean (closure participation). Its properties—pointing toward unsaid words, carrying ghost-ship cargo—constrain Kenji's hope and enable the final gesture of release. Specific mechanics (the needle's spin, impossible color) shape the ending. Swappability: another charged heirloom could function similarly, but the ghost-ship's undelivered letters provide specificity. Cost linkage is present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is named in the final third and operates primarily as thematic gloss rather than on-page constraint. Kenji's nightly shore rituals embody tidal rhythm, and the lace pattern is called "the tide's return," but the concept does not narrow options or alter tactics in a key beat—it describes what is already happening. The metaphor charges atmosphere and unifies imagery but remains largely ornamental. Present in closure via "the tides of remembrance that no severance could stop," but the line asserts rather than dramatizes cost. Functional thematic connective tissue, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is embodied in Kenji's teaching cadence ("letting silence stretch like morning mist"), his measured instructions, and his nightly shore rituals. The trait enables his year of non-verbal communication and constrains his ability to call Yuki directly (he sends thoughts "as placid as his teaching voice"). Cost: this rhythm prolongs the severance. The attribute shapes two beats (teaching lesson, shore ritual memory) and is mirrored in the grandmother's "patient encryption." Not irreplaceable—another temperamental constraint could serve—but it drives his coping method and is paid off in the student interaction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears in two senses: the juniper's branches "diffuse and desperate" after Kenji's year of silence, and the lace instruction "To diffuse anger, first diffuse light through tears." The action shapes the pruning lesson metaphorically (gathering what has spread too far) but does not drive a discrete plot turn—the teaching happens regardless of which verb describes it. The word choice enriches theme and ties to light/tears imagery, but swapping "scatter" or "disperse" would not break story logic. Present and functional, not pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lace instructions are established early ("Each loop and knot contained instructions she'd encoded during the war"), actively read in multiple beats (third row, fourth row, fifth row), and their content directly shapes Kenji's realization ("When children leave, they take their parents' unsaid words as anchors"). The method—encoding meaning in craft to survive dangerous times—parallels Kenji's own encoded shore communication and provides the template for his planned letter. The grandmother's wartime loss mirrors his own, and the lace's "patient encryption" models the slow reconciliation path. Mechanics matter: reading the patterns triggers insights that prepare the final decision. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "breezy islet after rain" is signaled in the opening line, provides sensory grounding (salt, moss, silver droplets), and the breeze lifts the lace in two beats, enabling Kenji to see the harbor. The post-rain setting establishes a clearing-after-storm atmosphere that subtly parallels emotional state. The islet's isolation supports the severance's spatial dimension (Yuki took a mainland ferry). Setting participates in closure when "the breeze stilled" precedes the impossible bell and tomorrow's resolve. Functional but not irreplaceable; another remote workshop could serve. The breezy condition does not strongly constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames all action, creating a persistent pressure (one year of silence, Yuki's 34th birthday today, three days since the compass washed ashore). The timeframe tightens the decision by marking today as the threshold: Kenji will write "tomorrow," making this teaching day the last before action. The severance is the dominant stake's clock. Cost: every day of delay compounds the rift. The temporal frame appears in setup (forty years since grandmother's gift, one year of silence), shapes middle reflection, and charges the closure choice. Not a live ticking countdown, but the accumulation of time lost drives urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire "to find the color of unspoken apologies" is dramatized when the compass needle stops on "the exact shade of cerulean...the color of every word he'd failed to say." This moment crystallizes Kenji's yearning and prompts the decision to write. The motivation is signaled via the lace ("apologies never delivered") and embodied in his shore rituals (sending thoughts he cannot voice). Friction: the specific phrasing "color of unspoken apologies" appears late and feels slightly imposed as prompt-language, though the underlying want (reconciliation, finding words) drives the piece from the start. Costs: year-long silence, another day of delay. Present across all gates with some ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" coheres through imagery: silver droplets, morning fog, the sea, and culminates in "the exact shade of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat when someone struggles not to cry." Tone is quiet, contemplative, weighted with loss, and modulates appropriately—reflective in teaching beats, sharper when the compass needle stops. The color-word and mood charge the final image and unify atmosphere without becoming monotone. The phrase "cerulean regret" itself does not appear, but the blue-toned sorrow saturates description and peaks in the closure beat. Strong tonal control that elevates the ending's resonance.</comment>
