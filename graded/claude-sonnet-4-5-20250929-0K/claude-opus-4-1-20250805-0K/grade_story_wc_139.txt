<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her "cursed honesty" manifests in precise micro-choices (working restoration cream, threading needle) that reveal hierarchy of values. The father remains vivid through backstory filtered through present action, and Wei's transformation from "inherited rage" to trembling acceptance is embodied. Internal contradiction appears ("subtracting his sins from her love") but could deepen if dramatized earlier; the final calculation feels slightly imposed rather than discovered through prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page via Resonant Reconfiguration (Maya's final calculation "Everything") that reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the prep-room confrontation narrows options through Wei's decision to accept both offerings. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3). One meaningful tightening occurs when Maya reveals the envelope's contents, altering Wei's stance. Minor causality slip: Wei's entrance feels under-motivated—how did he know to come now, three days after the father's death?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prep room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: steel counter, fluorescent light, formaldehyde air, and embalming tools anchor every beat and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("chemical-sweet air," "deathly vitality"). The vintage ink pot—small object as setting—recurs with reweighted meaning (mercury-like fluid → ashes). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The room's transformation function (endings into beginnings) subtly mirrors thematic work without over-symbolizing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (acknowledgment of debt versus revenge) is signaled early and tightens when Maya reveals the envelope, narrowing Wei's options. One meaningful reversal: Wei's rage liquefies into confusion, then acceptance. Agency is clear—Maya's preparation of the body and offer of restitution drive the turn. The cost is legible: Wei takes money and pot but must abandon inherited rage; Maya buries her father with his sins itemized. Escalation is smooth but relies heavily on exposition (the seventeen families, compound interest) rather than additional dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (honest accounting of inherited debt) emerges from concrete action—the embalming as both literal and metaphorical preparation. The ink pot's transformation (ink → ashes → apology medium) carries thematic weight without stating a moral. Final image ("Everything") offers resonant answer to the central question of fair trade mathematics. However, the theme occasionally approaches direct statement: "Death couldn't be conned" and the cancer-as-honest-books metaphor edge toward allegory. The father's meticulous record-keeping strains credibility as character choice versus thematic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during embalming work, pulling back for exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent—Maya sees equations and mathematics throughout. Dialogue carries subtext (Wei's "That's not enough" / Maya's "No" exchange) and advances plot efficiently. Voice has distinct texture in the prep-room professional register blended with Maya's analytical bent. Diction remains mostly within POV lexicon. One slip: "liquefying into confusion" and "dissolving" feel slightly imposed by the prompt's "liquefies rigid thinking" requirement rather than organic to Maya's mathematical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies appropriately; opening line anchors voice and object. Information density is high in the prep-room action beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in figurative cluster: "liquefying," "dissolving," "liquefaction" of Wei's emotions within three paragraphs reads as pattern-forced rather than varied. The "stroking/massaging/threading" embalming sequence is concrete and propulsive. Clarity is mostly strong, though "deathly vitality" (prompt element) lands as oxymoron without sufficient setup. One scaffold phrase: "precise and deliberate" is generic where specific gesture would sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The funeral-home frame offers a fresh angle on restitution narratives, and Maya's profession as literal truth-work against her con-artist father is a strong synthesis. Emotional specificity in the embalming details (massaging joints, closing lips) avoids generic template. However, the core premise—honest child of a con artist making amends—follows a recognizable redemption arc. The meticulous records kept by a dying con artist strain plausibility as character logic versus plot convenience. The "mathematics" metaphor recurs but doesn't fully transform into fresh insight; it remains more thematic label than lived particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya (con artist's honest child) drives every key turn: she waits for Wei, reveals the envelope, offers restitution, and performs the final calculation. Her decisions alter Wei's tactics and enable the closure. Setup in paragraph 2 ("cursed with honesty"), development throughout the confrontation, and payoff in the final act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vintage ink pot appears in beat one (beside instruments), beat three (Wei demands it), and the crucial revelation beat (opened to reveal ashes). It returns with reweighted meaning (theft object → apology medium) and shapes Wei's final choice. Present in closure image as he takes it. Strong causal role across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Political asylum is setup in paragraph 1 (father "fled to America seeking political asylum") and referenced in paragraph 9 ("gained political asylum but lost his soul"). It provides backstory motive but doesn't constrain present choices or shape tactics in the prep-room confrontation. Functions as context rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is enacted when Wei's "decades of inherited rage" begins "liquefying into confusion" and "Years of rigid thinking...dissolving." The trait enables the turn from revenge to acceptance. However, the language feels imposed (three liquid metaphors in close succession) and the mechanics are more told than shown through micro-choices. Present in the key middle beat but could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Breach" appears twice: the door breach (paragraph 4) that brings Wei into the space, and Maya's statement about breaching "the wall he'd built with lies" at closure. The door breach creates the confrontation; the metaphoric breach frames the resolution. Redefines options by forcing the encounter. Could be swapped for "enter" or "break" with minor loss, but the reprise charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is setup in paragraph 4 ("Maya didn't flinch; she'd been waiting actively") and demonstrated through her continuous embalming work during the confrontation—she never stops preparing the body. The method shapes her tactics (calm disclosure while working) and differentiates her from passive waiting. Mechanics matter: her hands-on task grounds the philosophical exchange.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Funeral home prep room is established in line 1 and anchors every beat. The steel counter holds both instruments and ink pot; fluorescent light catches the fluid; formaldehyde air affects breathing; the table holds the father's body as central prop. Setting supplies resources (embalming tools as concurrent action) and pressures choice (the strange energy of transformation space). Indispensable to tone and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is stated explicitly in paragraph 9 and dramatized through Maya's calculation of compound interest, her offer of both pot and money, and her final subtraction equation. The desire is conflicted—she loves her father but cannot excuse his thefts. Friction between emotional cost (burying him) and mathematical honesty drives the confrontation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is named in paragraph 10 ("the strange energy of a space where endings became beginnings") and enacted through the prep-room's dual nature (death work as truth work, decay as restoration). Tone modulates between clinical (embalming steps) and philosophical (debt mathematics) without breaking coherence. However, the phrase itself arrives late and feels more asserted than built through accumulation. Charges the setting but could integrate earlier.</comment>
