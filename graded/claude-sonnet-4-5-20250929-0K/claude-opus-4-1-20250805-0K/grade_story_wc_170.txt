<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clearly rooted in her daughter's coma and expressed through concrete painting actions. The borrowed heartbeat metaphor drives her persistence, though the piece leans heavily on summary ("Three months ago...") rather than dramatizing micro-choices under immediate pressure. Interiority is often poetic but somewhat abstract ("perceptively calm despite the urgency"); embodied contradiction appears more in description than in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment—setting down the brush as the sparrow sings—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost, though the cost itself (waiting, hoping) is more felt than concretely foregrounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates painted messages across the city, building toward a final resonant image where the sparrow sings Sophia's lullaby back and Maya completes the painting. Orientation anchors (terrace, dawn, Maya at easel) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the borrowed heartbeat grows stronger, doors open in possibility-space, and Maya's campaign of painted maps reaches a charged endpoint. Cost is conceptual and felt (three months of elusive painting, the hush she engineered, the trembling fingers) rather than a decisive physical loss. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sparrow responds, reweighting prior accumulation. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terrace is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: rain-slicked stones, prism parapet trapping rainbow fragments, echoing acoustics. Sensory selection is strong (water droplets, brush whisper, humming) and filtered through Maya's focus on light-bending possibilities. The prism parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains her method (painting after rain to capture refracted light) and charges the final image when the sparrow lands there with "rainbow mist." The cathedral's jammed bell mechanism and the city waking below provide temporal and spatial pressure. Setting details recur with shifted meaning (the parapet's rainbows at start, the sparrow on it at close), meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reach Sophia through painted possibility-maps. Pressure accumulates through the ticking dawn (bells about to ring), the quickening borrowed heartbeat, and Maya's faster brushwork. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sparrow sings back, narrowing the question from "will the messages work?" to "Sophia is responding now." Agency is present in Maya's campaign of paintings and her choice to paint the jammed bells yesterday, though that retroactive detail feels slightly convenient. Cost is conceptual (three months of elusive work, the hush engineered, fingers trembling) and the resolution hinges on external validation (sparrow, heartbeat) rather than a protagonist decision that narrows options with visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—art as bridge between waking and dreaming, possibility over fixed reality—emerges organically from Maya's method and the prism-parapet imagery. The piece resists overt moralizing; the final image (sparrow singing, borrowed heartbeat steadying, invisible doors opening) offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the coded lullabies and the phrase "mirrors she'd taught to dream." The painted-spring door motif recurs with shifted weight. One slip: "possibilities becoming paths" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. Overall, the ending reweights prior material (the terrace as map, the lullabies as code) without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maya's painter's perception (cerulean, dusky harmony, violet shadows/golden promises). Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrator's way of noticing—light, color, acoustics—feels character-specific. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("perceptively calm," "credible endurance") that reads more authorial than Maya's lived experience. The prism-parapet metaphor and the borrowed-heartbeat refrain recur purposefully. No dialogue on the page; the lullaby fragments function as sung interiority. Sentence rhythm varies but leans toward uniform lyric cadence in places ("not quite night, not quite day, but something between"), which supports tone but risks monotony under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with vivid imagery (rainbow fragments, cerulean, indigo depths/coral hope) and good sensory density. Several instances of paraphrase loops and elevated diction muddy momentum: "perceptively calm despite the urgency" is abstract; "borrowed heartbeat" appears four times with minimal variation; "dusky harmony" and "violet shadows held golden promises" border on purple without clear propulsion. The phrase "infinite grace, her fingers trembling only slightly" hedges emotional charge. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("with invisible doors opening, with possibilities becoming paths"). These artifacts dull immediacy in peak beats, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—painting possibility-maps to reach a comatose daughter—offers a fresh synthesis of art-as-bridge and metaphysical communication. The prism-parapet detail (rainbows trapped in balustrade) is specific and visually striking. Execution leans on familiar motifs (mirrors, lullabies, spring return, the sparrow messenger) without fully transforming them through lived complication or non-obvious moral calculus. The borrowed-heartbeat conceit is evocative but remains somewhat decorative; removing it would not fundamentally alter Maya's painting campaign. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure is commendable but not bold enough to warrant bonus adjustment. Transformation test: the emotional arc (mother reaching lost child through art) could transplant to other media without significant rework.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her choice to paint this final message drives the closure. Setup: established early. Development: her decision to work faster as time contracts is a micro-choice; her past choice to paint the jammed bells is recounted but not dramatized. Payoff: setting down the brush with "infinite grace" caps the sequence. The "elusive mirage painter" label does flavor her method (painting possibilities), but the elusiveness itself does not constrain a key choice. Two gates clear, closure linkage present, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism parapet is introduced in the opening sentence with functional detail (rainbow fragments trapped) and returns at closure when the sparrow lands on it "its feathers still damp with rainbow mist." Setup and payoff clear; middle development: the parapet's light-bending quality teaches Maya her method (light can split/recombine), constraining her approach. Three touches across beats, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong (the sparrow moment). Irreplaceability high (prism logic is specific). Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is mentioned four times but functions primarily as metaphor and emotional signpost rather than shaping on-page tactics. Setup: present by paragraph three. Development: the quickening heartbeat signals Sophia's response but does not alter Maya's method. Payoff: "borrowed heartbeat growing stronger, finding its way home" appears in the final paragraph. Two gates, lyric reprise, but no middle choice constrained by the heartbeat's mechanics. Theme claim without causal pressure. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is asserted in paragraph two ("perceptively calm despite the urgency") but not dramatized through a choice where calmness enables or costs. Setup present, but the trait remains label-only. Maya's working faster under time pressure contradicts the calmness, yet no trade-off is shown. No middle or closure beat where this attribute alters tactics. Ornamental. Score: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Grace appears twice: "Her brushes moved with such grace that observers often mistook her movements for dance" (paragraph two) and "Maya set down her brush with infinite grace, her fingers trembling only slightly" (penultimate paragraph). Setup and payoff present, but grace does not drive a turn or constrain a choice; it flavors description. The closure gesture (setting down the brush) would work identically without the grace modifier. Lyric reprise without causal work. Score: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are introduced early (paragraph four: "Mirror, mirror, made of rain...") and recur in paragraph five and seven. Setup clear. Development: the method shapes Maya's campaign ("leaving these painted messages...each one hummed with the same coded lullabies") and the sparrow's response at closure validates it. Payoff: the sparrow sings Sophia's favorite lullaby, confirming the code worked. Three beats, causal pressure moderate (the lullabies are the transmission mechanism), closure linkage strong. Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is anchored in the opening line and its spring dawn timing frames the entire action. Setup immediate. Development: the terrace's acoustics amplify Maya's humming; its prism parapet supplies her method; the blooming-doors painting at closure depicts "the terrace as it existed in potential." Payoff: "The terrace echoed with invisible doors opening" charges the final image. Three beats, causal and closure pressure high, specificity strong (echoing, rain-slicked, prism-equipped). Score: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hush before bells ring is signaled early (end of paragraph one) and governs urgency throughout. Setup clear. Development: Maya works faster as the hush contracts; the jammed cathedral mechanism (painted yesterday) extends the window. Payoff: "Soon the bells would remember how to ring, but for now, in this eternal hush, Maya felt her daughter's borrowed heartbeat growing stronger." Time tightens decisions moderately but does not impose a hard visible cost. Two gates, causal pressure moderate. Score: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The desire to "persuade mirrors to show possibilities" is stated in paragraph five and restated in paragraph eight ("she'd taught [mirrors] to dream"). Setup present by midpoint. Development: this motivates the three-month painting campaign but is told rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure. Payoff: mirrors are invoked in the closure paragraph. Two gates, but the friction between want and cost is summarized ("three months ago...") not shown on the page. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named once (paragraph six: "layers of dusky harmony—not quite night, not quite day") and the tone of liminality (dawn, hush, between-states) is sustained throughout. Setup by midpoint. Development: tone modulates as urgency rises (shorter sentences, "worked faster now") yet remains contemplative. Payoff: the final image holds the same liminal quality ("eternal hush," "invisible doors opening"). Coherent modulation, charges the ending, though static in affect range. Score: 6.7.</comment>
