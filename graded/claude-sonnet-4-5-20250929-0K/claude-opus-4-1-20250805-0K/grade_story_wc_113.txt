<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and his interiority shows embodied connection to the music and space. His choices to return nightly and transcribe alone demonstrate agency. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned—his understanding of Elisabetta's need arrives suddenly ("Marcus understood then what she needed") without prior internal conflict or contradiction. The final state where he's "perfectly dry" holding a "restored" program reads as convenient reversal rather than visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Situational lens with accumulative pressure building through the water-revealed notation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when anchored promptly). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed note and dual-signed program, but the cost is unclear—Marcus suffers no visible loss or foreclosed path. The "perfectly dry" restoration and simultaneous dating feel like reward rather than reconfiguration with cost. The causality of the ghost orchestra appearing, playing, then vanishing lacks consequence that alters Marcus's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded pit with oil lanterns creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes Marcus's isolation and the acoustic transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (knee-deep, chest-deep progression) and the water functions as both constraint and instrument. The recurring floating violin case and dissolving program are tracked consistently. The setting directly enables the climactic moment where Marcus must stand chest-deep to finish the piece, demonstrating genuine environmental pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing Elisabetta's interrupted composition—is signaled clearly and drives Marcus's nightly returns. The progression from discovery to transcription to performance provides escalation. However, the tightening lacks felt cost: Marcus's isolation from others is mentioned but not tested, and the final performance resolves smoothly without trade-offs. The water reaching his chest suggests physical risk, but the "perfectly dry" ending erases that price. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus realizes she needs completion, not remembrance, but the execution feels more like permission than genuine narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of liminal spaces and unfinished conversations between living and dead emerges clearly through concrete particulars: the pit as "in-between space," the water revealing hidden notation, the moment "between drowning and playing." The final dual-signed program offers a non-literal answer about collaboration across time. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some spaces were meant to remain in between") where the image could stand alone. The impossible note that "continued without him" provides genuine resonance, though the restoration mechanic undercuts the cost that would sharpen the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV distance remains stable throughout with Marcus as clean focalizer. The prose carries distinct texture through musical vocabulary and perceptual specificity ("the friction creating harmonics that shouldn't exist"). The voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to intensified closure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Psychic distance is controlled and the narrative stance fits the character's expertise. Minor slip: "miraculously dry in its waterproof shell" tells function rather than shows, and some phrases edge toward explanatory ("not a ghost but an impression, like the music notation") where image could carry meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is generally strong, with details doing double duty (floating case as "patient dog" conveys both fact and Marcus's relationship to his instrument). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "in-between space, neither quite stage nor audience" is restated as "liminal space between performer and performance" later. The phrase "the water-damaged program showed a composition emerging line by line—not written but revealed, as if the flood were developing a photograph in reverse" stacks three explanations of the same phenomenon. "Wordless conversation" and "wordless exchange" repeat the same concept across paragraphs without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of water damage revealing hidden music offers a fresh angle on ghost-musician stories, and the flooded pit as instrument shows specific invention. The dual-authorship program dated to both eras provides a concrete, non-obvious synthesis. However, the ghost-completing-unfinished-work template remains recognizable underneath, and the restoration ending ("perfectly dry," program restored rather than destroyed) retreats from bolder implications. The piece commits to its premise through the middle but hedges at closure by erasing physical cost. The musical notation mechanics and the specific historical figure ground the concept, lifting it above pure template, but transformation feels incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his choices drive all major turns: returning nightly, transcribing alone after dismissal, opening his case to play, stepping deeper to stand where Elisabetta stood. His decisions alter tactics (working alone when others won't listen) and shape the closure directly (playing the revealed composition to completion). Setup clear, development across multiple beats, payoff central to ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The program appears in paragraph one (setup), is handled and transcribed in the middle (development constraining his time as it dissolves), and returns transformed in the final beat dual-signed and restored (payoff that reweights meaning). Its dissolving state creates urgency ("just threads of fiber floating") and the water-revealed notation drives the entire escalation. The final restoration charges the closure image with the impossible dual dating, making the element indispensable to proof of contact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "in-between" concept is named early ("in-between space, neither quite stage nor audience") and structures multiple choices: Marcus's position in the pit, the moment "between drowning and playing, between past and present, between silence and sound," and the final recognition that "some spaces were meant to remain in between." The concept directly shapes the climactic positioning and charges the closure image. However, it operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—removing this exact phrasing wouldn't break the plot logic, though it would flatten the resonance significantly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once in paragraph two ("Marcus felt lately inspired by the transformation") but doesn't constrain or enable specific on-page actions with visible cost. His inspiration motivates his returns but functions as general backdrop rather than trait that creates friction or trade-offs. The label tells state without showing how recent inspiration differs from prior relationship to the space or creates a specific cost. Functional mention, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears in the key line "The music didn't disrupt the silence so much as give it shape," framing how Marcus's playing functions. This moment shapes the climactic performance and the way the ghost orchestra joins. However, the action could be described as "fill" or "voice" without major structural loss. The specific word "disrupt" matters less than the act of playing itself. Present at a crucial turn, but swappable, placing it in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Water damage is the mechanism from paragraph one and its specific operation (dissolving the program to reveal notation) drives all escalation. The method shapes Marcus's tactics (transcribe before it dissolves completely), creates urgency, and enables the discovery. The closure returns to this mechanic by reversing it—restoration where damage should exist. The method's unique properties (revealing rather than destroying) are irreplaceable to the story's logic. Strong setup, development, and payoff with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with lanterns is established in the opening line and sustained throughout. The water's depth constrains Marcus's movement and creates the acoustic transformation that enables the climax. The specific requirement to "step deeper" and stand "exactly where Elisabetta had stood" with "water reached his chest" makes the setting essential to the closure beat. The flickering lanterns going out simultaneously marks the completion. The setting supplies resources (altered acoustics) and imposes costs (physical risk, isolation) that alter outcome. All three gates met strongly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" and "the moment before the conductor's baton fell" frame a suspended temporal quality but don't function as a live clock that tightens decisions. The three-night return pattern is mentioned but doesn't escalate pressure—night one would work as well as night three. The dissolving program creates some urgency, but that's the object's state rather than the timeframe element itself. The timeframe establishes mood more than constraining tactics, trending functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus's desire to "unravel" or complete what the ghost left is dramatized through his transcription work and final performance. The motivation drives his isolation from the dismissive director and skeptical musicians, creating friction. However, the want faces little internal conflict—Marcus never doubts or struggles with the interpretation. The realization "what she needed" arrives cleanly without competing impulses. The motivation is present and functional across beats, shaping the ending, but lacks the contradictory pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" appears in the title and is enacted through Marcus's humming "without sound," the ghost orchestra that "played together, though only Marcus's violin made sound," and the "wordless exchange" in the final paragraph. The tone of silent communication remains coherent through turns and modulates appropriately (contemplative to urgent to reverent). The final note that "continued without him" charges the image with this tone. The tone constrains the mode of interaction and is woven through action, not just asserted.</comment>
