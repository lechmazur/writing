<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to shed her masculine disguise and wade toward Cetacea emerges from consistent interiority about performing masculinity as protection-turned-prison. The transformation moment ("The bindings she'd worn felt suddenly absurd") lands with embodied specificity. However, the transformation comes swiftly after acquiring the scrimshaw without meaningful internal contradiction or cost—the disguise simply dissolves when convenience demands. Secondary characters (Torven, the assembled seekers) apply thematic pressure but remain largely emblematic rather than forcing Mira into difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira encounters the scrimshaw, Torven arrives with context, the whale calls, Cetacea manifests as others gather. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dock worker, morning's catch, sublittoral fringe). The closure—Mira diving toward the island as it becomes "eternally found"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: we see clothes abandoned, not a legible forfeiture of relationship, livelihood, or specific capability. The Pacification backstory (violence stopped twenty years ago) sets rules but doesn't constrain Mira's choices on the page, functioning more as thematic coloring than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe—kelp forests over underwater cliffs—recurs and directly enables the closure (Mira wades into phosphorescent surf). The scrimshaw as object-setting constrains Mira's attention and charges the final image when it's left "still warm, waiting" on the pier. Sensory details (bioluminescent beaches, whale's call vibrating through bone) are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dock, rocks, and water. The Pacification's "muscles locking in painful rebellion" detail is vivid but does not materially shape Mira's on-page actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding authentic selfhood versus maintaining protective disguise—is signaled early and tightens when Mira begins unwrapping bindings under Torven's gaze. The scrimshaw pulses, the whale calls, and the island appears, creating an accumulative intensification rather than a causal reversal. However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than earned by protagonist agency: the island "becomes" rather than Mira *making* a costly choice to reach it. The cost of abandoning her livelihood and disguise is gestured at (clothes on rocks) but not dramatized through a moment of renunciation with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of shedding constructed selves to access authentic community emerges through image and action (bindings unwrapped, island manifesting, others arriving). The scrimshaw's function—unlocking guarded hearts—integrates organically. The final image of the scrimshaw "still warm, waiting" reweights the opening without stating a moral. However, the Pacification premise offers a ready-made utopian frame ("authentic souls had no need for [violence]") that edges toward thesis statement rather than earned ambiguity. The barnacle metaphor ("detach from our constructed selves like barnacles from a ship's hull") borders on explicit thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's embodied experience ("rough hands grabbed less often at those who slipped away like tide"). The narration carries a lyric, myth-inflected register that suits the material without register drift. Torven's dialogue ("Please. My grandfather carved that") and Mira's terse responses feel distinct. The phrase "combative tenderness" as descriptor of Torven's voice reads slightly over-articulated for the moment. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the whale-call sequence; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The dock worker moved like water itself" versus the shorter beats during the whale-call sequence). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or thematic pressure. Two minor loops: "The scrimshaw seemed to pulse with warmth" / "The scrimshaw grew hot in her palm" repeats the warming motif without added pressure; "detach from their false selves" / "detach from our constructed selves" is near-paraphrase within a few paragraphs. Figurative language (sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent beaches) remains coherent and advances atmosphere. No major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The combination of trans identity, maritime mythology, and post-violence utopia offers a fresh synthesis. The sublittoral-fringe setting and whale-call mechanism are specific rather than generic portal-fantasy tropes. However, the core premise—marginalized person finds magical refuge by embracing true self—follows a recognizable template; transformation comes through the scrimshaw's enabling rather than Mira's costly rejection of safety. The Pacification's body-rebellion detail (muscles locking) is inventive but underutilized. The ending's utopian certainty ("eternally found") retreats from the riskier question of what Mira sacrifices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira evades Torven's grab, studies the scrimshaw across multiple beats, begins unwrapping her bindings, and dives toward Cetacea. Her choices (studying, unwrapping, diving) drive the story's movement. However, the island's manifestation and the whale's call do much of the causal work; Mira's agency is reactive—she responds to the scrimshaw's heat and the call rather than forcing the turn. The unwrapping beat is the clearest on-page decision with visible cost. Present in setup, middle choice (studying/unwrapping), and closure (diving); eligible for mid-band. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in beat one (pulled from nets), returns when Torven claims it, pulses during the whale-call sequence, and appears in the final image on the pier "still warm, waiting." It unlocks the island by heating in Mira's palm and is causally active across at least three beats. Its reweighted meaning at closure (now a beacon for the next seeker) charges the ending. Strongly integrated; specificity (whalebone, etched cliffs) matters. Gates: setup (first scene), development (pulses/heats), payoff (left on pier). Closure linkage and beat involvement justify upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cetacea as the island that "appeared only when violence left the world" shapes Mira's longing from childhood and becomes the story's destination. Its manifestation—rising from the waves as "people of every kind" arrive—provides the closure image. However, the island's mechanics (it exists "between truth and possibility"; it becomes visible when hearts unlock) remain abstract; it does not constrain Mira's tactics in the middle or force a trade-off. Gates: setup (Mira's childhood dreams), development (shimmers at sublittoral fringe), payoff (manifests and becomes "eternally found"). Present across all three; moderate causal pressure; closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" functions as the scrimshaw's mechanism: it glows, heats, and enables the island's visibility. Torven describes the grandfather's belief ("only those who could detach from their false selves would find it"); Mira's understanding ("The scrimshaw didn't reveal the island; it unlocked the guarded hearts") articulates the attribute. However, this is label-heavy summary rather than on-page dramatization of cost. The attribute does not visibly constrain Mira's choices; the unlocking happens to her via the scrimshaw's heat. Gates: setup (Torven's exposition), development (scrimshaw glows/heats), payoff (Mira's realization). Functional but cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Detach" appears as Torven's quote from his grandfather ("we must detach from our constructed selves like barnacles") and is enacted when Mira unwraps her bindings. The unwrapping beat is the story's key physical manifestation of the action and drives the emotional turn. However, "detach" could be swapped for "shed," "release," or "abandon" with minimal structural impact; the specificity lies in the bindings, not the verb. Gates: setup (Torven's exposition mid-story, late for setup gate), development (Mira unwraps), payoff (she dives free). Late signal; strong beat involvement and closure linkage push it into upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("A sound rose from the depths—low, mournful, beautiful") and recurs ("The whale's call intensified," "wrapped around them, ancient and welcoming," "The whale sang on"). It enables the island's manifestation and shapes the closure atmosphere. However, its mechanics are atmospheric rather than tactical: the call doesn't force a choice or constrain Mira's approach; it accompanies rather than complicates. Gates: setup (first call from depths), development (intensifies during unwrapping), payoff (wraps around arriving seekers). All three gates met; moderate causal role; closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe—"where kelp forests swayed in the shallows above underwater cliffs"—is the specific location where Mira stands, the scrimshaw heats, and Cetacea rises. It recurs across the story's key beats and provides the spatial logic for the island's emergence (shallow meeting deep). The setting constrains access (Mira must wade into phosphorescent surf) and charges the final image. Gates: setup (mentioned early as where Mira saw the island shimmer), development (Mira stands there at night), payoff (she dives into the surf). Strong beat involvement, causal constraint, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Pacification timeframe ("twenty years ago when humanity's capacity for violence simply... stopped") provides world context and explains why Mira's disguise is now "prison" rather than necessity. It contextualizes the story's utopian closure (authentic souls have no need for violence). However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a clock; it functions as static backstory. Torven's "thirty years" of searching and Mira's childhood dreams gesture at duration, but no urgency or deadline shapes tactics. Gates: setup (exposition in paragraph four), development (implicit in "this gentled world"), payoff (thematic coloring at closure). Functional context; low tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find freedom by embracing her true nature is dramatized through her interiority ("performing masculinity," "disguise had protected her once, but now... had become her prison") and the unwrapping beat. The motivation drives her choice to study the scrimshaw, stand at the fringe, and dive toward Cetacea. However, friction between want and cost is muted: the island appears and welcomes her; the cost (abandoned livelihood) is gestured at (clothes on rocks) but not deeply felt on the page. Gates: setup (interiority early), development (unwrapping choice), payoff (diving). Clear motivation with moderate conflict; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is explicitly named in Torven's voice ("The combative tenderness in his voice struck her") and modeled in the exchanges (Torven's gruff claim softening to "Please"). The tone recurs in Mira's internal contradictions (grace learned from necessity, disguise as protection-turned-prison) and the story's accumulative structure (threat melting into welcome). It charges the final image of the scrimshaw "still warm, waiting" and Torven taking Mira's hand "not romantically, but as fellow travelers." Coherent through turns; modulates with pressure. Strong thematic and atmospheric integration.</comment>
