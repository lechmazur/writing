<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's transformation is established through three years of tending, and her refusal to engage with media pressure is embodied (silencing phone, staying in sanctuary). However, the "protected vulnerability" interiority veers toward label-speak ("soft enough to honor the hurt"), and her decision to teach Marcus arrives without visible internal resistance or cost—she simply "nods" after his request. The amber pendant functions more as a generational symbol than a constraint on present choice. Marcus's arc from witness to gardener is gestured but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (converting witnesses into gardeners) with thematic cost legible in the shift from viral visibility to "quiet revolution." Causality holds: viral confession → Marcus arrives → Kira offers cutting → teaching begins. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (moss garden as accreted meaning, viral story as texture), and the final image reweights the opening sanctuary frame. One structural slip: the three-year backstory and the viral-yesterday frame compete for primacy in the opening third, creating minor orientation friction before the present scene stabilizes around Marcus's arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moss garden is richly specific (concentric circles from ice-drip, species differentiation by rack, cooling systems channeling rainwater) and constrains Kira's entire emotional geography. The server-rack-to-garden conversion is tactile and purposeful, each detail chosen through her priorities. Spatial choreography is clean (doorway, rack C-7, deeper corridors). The amber pendant and phone are handled with clear proximity. Minor cap: while the garden shapes the closure image, no single environmental constraint forces a tactical choice in the present scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kira's healing through reclamation versus the viral confession's demand for public response—is signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful pressure point: Marcus's arrival tests whether she'll remain solitary or extend her practice. However, no cost is visible when she agrees to teach him; the "slow work" is promised but not begun with friction. The viral story functions more as backdrop texture than active antagonist. The ice-pattern metaphor deepens thematic weight but does not narrow tactical options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the moss-garden particulars: transformation of institutional harm into living growth, silence as deliberate speech, generational resilience encoded in objects (quilts, gardens, moss). The final image—"her garden held memory: transformed, persistent, alive"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One thematic echo issue: "grafted new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly in dialogue, a prompt-label intrusion that should have remained implicit in the garden's existence. The three-generation frame (grandmother's quilts, mother's gardens) is purposeful but borderline expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single tight third-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Kira notices light on moss, sound textures, growth patterns). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality. Two dialogue exchanges feel natural and carry subtext (Marcus's apology, Kira's cutting-as-answer). Minor register slip: "protected vulnerability she'd cultivated" and "marriage of technology and nature" tilt toward essay idiom rather than Kira's embodied thought. Filter verbs ("She'd been tending," "she'd learned") are frequent but voice-motivated for reflective distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and strong imagery (honeyed hush, emerald tapestries, concentric moss circles). Information density is high in the garden description. Two artifact patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops in the opening (moss "claimed everything" / "nature reclaimed" within three sentences) and template cadence in the final paragraph ("this transformation," "this quiet revolution," "this—this quiet revolution"). The phrase "Her story might be viral now, but this—this quiet revolution—would outlast any headline" is serviceable closure rhetoric but leans on scaffold repetition ("this—this") rather than fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moss-garden-in-server-room premise is visually fresh and the three-generation frame (quilts/gardens/moss) adds thematic depth. However, the core arc—wounded professional finds healing through nature-based reclamation after workplace trauma—follows a widely used template, and the viral-confession-as-inciting-incident is a contemporary stock frame. Transformation is present but modest: the teaching invitation at the end shifts the story from solitary healing to mentorship, yet that move feels predictable rather than inevitable-in-hindsight. The ice-drip pattern is a lovely specific, but it functions more as metaphor than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira observes moss patterns and remembers her three-year practice, but her key choices (silencing phone, offering cutting, agreeing to teach) are reactive rather than dream-driven. "Watchful dreamer" as a character type is present in her long-term vision but does not constrain or enable the present beats beyond general contemplation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber pendant appears in three beats: opening (catching sunlight), mid-scene (gift from grandmother who survived silencing), and closing (warming against skin, holding light/memory). It primes the generational-resilience theme and charges the final image. However, it is never handled or used tactically; Kira does not touch it or make a choice informed by its presence. The pendant is thematically active but not causally so.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" is named twice and shapes the sanctuary's emotional texture. Kira's refusal to break it by engaging with reporters is a stated priority. The concept charges the tone and the final teaching scene unfolds within that same quietness. It does not narrow tactical options but does establish the stakes (preserve stillness vs. respond to noise) and is present in the closure mood.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is told in exposition ("She'd been quietly proactive about her healing, never announcing her transformation") and demonstrated in the three-year garden cultivation. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost in the present scene. Kira's decision to teach Marcus is quiet but not shown as requiring effort or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The proffering of the moss cutting is the story's pivotal gesture: Kira extends her practice to Marcus with formal intimacy, and the cutting is specific (from the ice-pattern circles). This action shifts the story from solitary healing to shared practice and directly enables the teaching frame that closes the piece. The verb "proffer" is used on the page ("she proffered it to him with both hands"), and the moment is charged with thematic and relational weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ice-drip pattern is discovered at rack C-7, explained (concentric circles of moss growth), and revisited when Kira offers Marcus a cutting "from the pattern the ice left." She articulates its metaphor on the page ("Where things freeze and thaw, they leave marks. But those marks can become the richest soil"). The method shapes her insight and the closure's "circle by circle" spreading image. However, the pattern does not constrain her attempts or alter tactics; it functions more as symbolic proof than procedural method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden is essential: it is Kira's three-year project, her sanctuary from the viral confession, and the site where she teaches Marcus. The setting is richly detailed (server racks, cooling systems, backup generators) and its conversion supplies the story's central metaphor. The final line ("her garden held memory: transformed, persistent, alive") depends on this exact location. Removing the setting would collapse the story's logic and thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The viral confession "yesterday" establishes urgency (phone buzzing, reporters seeking comment) and motivates Marcus's visit ("I saw the news"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the present scene; Kira's choice to stay in the sanctuary and teach is not shown as time-pressured. The "after" frame is more thematic backdrop than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira's desire "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly in dialogue and demonstrated through three years of garden-tending. The motivation drives the entire moss-garden project and her refusal to engage with media. The teaching decision at the end extends the grafting practice to Marcus. Minor friction: the phrase is delivered as a thesis statement rather than emerging purely from action, but the garden itself dramatizes the motivation across the full arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Protected vulnerability is established through Kira's sanctuary-seeking, the "soft enough to honor the hurt" description, and her willingness to teach despite past harm. The tone modulates subtly (quiet opening, Marcus's weighted arrival, formal intimacy of the cutting exchange, soft closing promise). The amber pendant and garden both embody the tone. However, the phrase "protected vulnerability she'd cultivated" is told rather than purely shown, and the tone remains somewhat static rather than sharpening under the Marcus encounter's pressure.</comment>
