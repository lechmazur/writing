<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and embodied ("new heart beating unfamiliar rhythms," feeling himself "growing heavier" with stories), but his internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—he moves smoothly from questioning to acceptance without visible struggle. The final choice to "transform" stories feels arrived at rather than earned through competing desires acting on the page. Chen is present but functions as a guide delivering wisdom rather than applying pressure that forces Kael into a difficult trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative lens: Kael receives instruction, the morpho wing's meaning deepens, and the final image reweights his task from "hold" to "illuminate/transform." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ending crystallizes his new stance with felt cost ("iridescent caution against his palm"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Chen reveals the donor's identity and the heart's magnetic burden, narrowing Kael's options from wondering to needing a method. The cost is conceptual and felt but could be more visceral on the page; the phrase "feeling its iridescent caution" makes pressure undeniable but leans abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, sun trails, and morpho wing constrain choices and charge the closure image. The wing is handled twice (Chen holds it, Kael lifts it) and returns in the final beat, reweighted from "first collection" to a working tool/reminder. Spatial choreography is clean (veranda, table, valley below) and the tea house's drift mirrors thematic motion. Sensory detail is purposeful—"tea that sparkled with suspended starlight," "chains of woven light"—and filtered through Kael's dye-master lens. The sun trails function as both navigation mechanic and atmospheric anchor, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning to bear the story-magnetizing heart) is signaled early and tightens when Chen names the donor and the burden. One meaningful turn occurs: Kael shifts from absorbing to illuminating stories, and the morpho wing demonstration reweights his approach. Agency is present but passive—he asks "Teach me" and receives instruction; no on-page refusal or competing desire tests his commitment. The cost (stories "growing heavier") is told rather than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a live option. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient but gentle; a visible price paid in the moment would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, flow vs. accumulation, beauty as warning) emerges organically from the morpho wing, dye work, and donor heart without overt statement. The final image—wing in pocket, "iridescent caution" as reminder—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how to bear inherited burdens. Subtext operates cleanly in Chen's demonstration and Kael's realization that "some gifts require not gratitude but continuation." One subtle slip: "quietly explosive" in the final paragraph edges toward meta-commentary on the text itself ("the most beautiful transformations often come with the quietest explosions"), a faint thematic echo that nearly states the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (dye-master lens: colors "spoke," indigo "spoke of deep ocean trenches"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("valley-mist wonder, soft yet penetrating"). Two slips: "iridescent caution" appears as both wing property and authorial descriptor without full dramatization, and filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("could feel himself growing heavier," "felt his new heart settling") during what should be higher-pressure moments. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and advances plot without distinct speech rhythms to differentiate Kael from Chen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are strong in most beats, but overwriting appears in clusters: "stories were said to gather like moths to flame," "colors had begun speaking to him in whispers," and the final paragraph stacks three metaphors (quietest explosions, fluid dye, sun trails drawing new paths) that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence in backstory: "The indigo spoke... The vermillion hummed..." (parallel stems without escalation). Minor paraphrase loop: "stories need to flow through us, not settle in us" is then restated as "not to hold them but to transform them." High information density elsewhere ("chains of woven light that only appeared when touched by morning sun") keeps the piece propulsive. Apply −0.6 for figurative density in peak beats and template stems, total −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The donor-heart premise is familiar (organ transplant carries donor traits), but the dye-master lens and "story magnetism" as inherited burden offer a fresh synthesis. The morpho wing as teaching tool and the floating tea house create memorable specificity. Two frictions: the core emotional arc (apprentice receives wisdom from elder, learns to transform burden into gift) follows a well-worn template, and "iridescent caution" as governing concept feels more poetic than lived—its mechanics (beauty = danger signal) are told rather than tested in a choice. Transformation is present but incomplete; the ending would survive unchanged with a different craft and metaphor set.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his observation (tracking sun trails, noticing colors speaking) frames the journey. His key choice—"Teach me"—initiates the lesson, and he performs two distinct actions (lifts the wing, tucks it in his pocket). However, these are instructed rather than autonomous decisions under competing pressure. The "watchful" trait signals early but does not constrain a high-stakes choice; his dye-master skill informs metaphor but does not enable a tactical move with visible cost. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but the causal pressure is instructional rather than conflicted. Two beats (asking, final reflection), moderate causal role, closure linkage via the pocket gesture; cap at mid-band for passivity under instruction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The morpho wing appears in beat one (Chen holding it), beat two (Kael lifts it to see the light-scatter demonstration), and beat three (he tucks it in his pocket as talisman). It is handled on the page, its properties (microscopic scales, light refraction) enable the teaching moment, and it returns with reweighted meaning (from donor's "first collection" to Kael's working reminder of "iridescent caution"). The wing directly shapes the middle turn (demonstration of illuminate-not-absorb) and charges the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high (no other object could teach the same lesson via light-scatter). Minor friction: its final use is symbolic rather than instrumental in a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is introduced explicitly when Chen explains the wing ("how beauty sometimes means danger, how the most brilliant displays often signal 'stay away'") and reappears in the final line. It frames Cheng's lesson (stories as dangerous beauty) and the donor's fate (heart grew too heavy), shaping Kael's stakes. However, it remains thematic rather than tactical—no on-page choice hinges on recognizing caution versus acting boldly. The concept appears early and at closure but does not constrain a middle decision or alter options with visible cost. Two gates (setup, payoff), lyric reprise, but ornamental in the middle; cap near 5.0 for concept that themes without forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears once as descriptor of Kael's dye work ("his work had become quietly explosive") with narrative elaboration (dyes release "tiny narratives"). The trait signals his transformed output but does not constrain or enable a choice under pressure—it describes result rather than method. It returns obliquely in the final paragraph ("the most beautiful transformations often come with the quietest explosions"), a thematic echo rather than a tactical use. Present in setup and closure, but the middle beats do not hinge on managing or leveraging this quality. One functional beat, lyric reprise, no visible trade-off; mid-band for label-only trait with thematic resonance but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is introduced as the core lesson ("She learned to illuminate rather than absorb") and demonstrated via the morpho wing's light-scatter. Kael's final stance crystallizes around this action: "His task was not to hold them but to transform them... into something that could color the world while remaining fluid enough to flow." The verb shapes the story's resolution and charges the ending image. However, the action is received instruction rather than a choice Kael enacts under competing pressure on the page—he is told to illuminate, shown how, and resolves to do so, but does not perform the act with visible cost in a specific beat. Setup, development (demonstration), payoff (resolve); strong thematic role, but swappable with "refract" or "channel" without structural loss. Three gates, closure linkage, but causal pressure moderate; cap below 7.0 for instructional rather than enacted turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" appears once in the opening ("Kael had been tracking sun trails since dawn, following their golden paths through the mist until they converged here"), establishing how he reached the tea house. The method signals early but does not recur or shape any subsequent choice—once he arrives, the sun trails function as atmospheric detail (Chen uses one to demonstrate the wing, and they "drew new paths" in the final image) but not as a means Kael employs. Setup gate only; the mechanics do not constrain middle or ending moves. One beat, early signal, no development or payoff as method; replaceable with "followed the chains" or "climbed at dawn" without impact. Functional in setup, ornamental thereafter; mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house anchors the entire scene and provides the elevated vantage that mirrors thematic transcendence. Its physical properties (swaying, tethered by light-chains, drifting higher) are handled across beats and the final moment ("The floating tea house drifted higher... above the valley mist") charges the ending image. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it is a backdrop and symbol rather than a constraint or enabler. Spatial choreography is clean (ladder, veranda, table, valley below) and the setting returns reweighted at closure. Setup, payoff, strong closure linkage, but no middle development where the setting shapes a decision; cap mid-6s for charged reprise without causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After receiving the donor heart" anchors the timeframe early ("Three months after receiving the donor heart") and establishes the stake (unfamiliar heart, new story-magnetism). The three-month marker does not recur or tighten decisions; no countdown or deadline pressures Kael's choices. The donor's identity is revealed mid-story (development), but the time since transplant does not function as a constraint or escalation mechanism. Setup gate present, weak development (revelation of donor), no payoff where time itself forces a choice. One beat, moderate setup, no causal use of duration or deadline; replaceable with "since his transformation" without loss. Mid-low band for framing element without tactical role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("to learn why some people magnetize stories" is paraphrased as Kael's question "How did she bear it?") and drives the central sequence: he climbs to the tea house in response to Chen's summons, asks for instruction, and receives the lesson. However, the desire is not dramatized as conflicted—no competing want (e.g., fear of the burden, wish to return the heart, cost of learning) tests his commitment on the page. The motivation initiates the action and resolves in acceptance, but friction between want and cost is told ("stories had weight," "he could feel himself growing heavier") rather than forcing a visible trade-off. Setup, development (lesson), payoff (resolve); moderate causal role, but low friction and no on-page choice that sacrifices an alternative. Three gates, closure linkage, but desire is smooth; cap near 6.0 for motivation that frames without conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" is embodied throughout: "tea house drifted above the valley like a dream," "chains of woven light," "tea that sparkled with suspended starlight," "her voice carried valley-mist wonder, soft yet penetrating." The tone is coherent, modulates gently with the lesson's gravity, and charges the final image ("sun trails drew new paths through open sky"). It remains consistent under the Accumulative lens and supports rather than tensions the concept. However, the tone is static—gentle wonder throughout, no sharp pressure shift when stakes tighten (donor revelation, the weight of stories). Strong setup, present in every beat, strong closure charge, but no modulation under peak pressure; cap mid-7s for coherent, static tone that charges ending without dramatic shift.</comment>
