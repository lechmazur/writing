<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's core motivation—excavating truth—drives his initial investigation and final choice to scatter evidence while reburying the diamond. The internal conflict between exposing the conspiracy and preserving the sanctuary is dramatized through concrete action (digging, reassembling letters, walking away). However, the pivot from debunker to preserver feels under-earned; the story tells us he "understood now" without showing the precise moment his values shifted. The final choice carries cost (leaving the wasteland, abandoning full exposure) but the emotional progression from skeptic to protector compresses too quickly in the climactic paragraphs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (letters → understanding → choice). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus buries the letters as scattered seeds and reinters the diamond, crystallizing a stance between exposure and preservation with visible cost (returning to the poisoned world, withholding full truth). The cost is legible in "walked back into the wasteland" and "uncomfortable truths waited to be excavated." One meaningful tightening occurs when the reconstructed letters reveal deliberate suppression, narrowing Marcus's options from simple debunking to a moral calculus. Minor issue: the transition from letter assembly to final decision compresses several beats (dawn assembly, walk to center, dig, decision, scatter letters, walk away) into a rushed sequence that slightly weakens causal spacing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard's stillpoint field and the Geiger counter's shifting clicks anchor the radioactive wasteland concretely. Dust storms bookend the piece (opening laziness, closing envelopment) and the ancient apple tree at the orchard's center becomes the spatial anchor for the climax. The diamond's physical flaw ("frozen lightning bolt") charges the final image when Marcus re-buries it. Spatial choreography is clear: tent outside orchard, fallen tree with metal box, center tree. Minor gap: the tent's exact location relative to the stillpoint boundary is vague, and the mechanics of how Marcus digs "multiple holes throughout the orchard" in the brief window before the dust storm aren't fully visualized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to expose the conspiracy or preserve the sanctuary. The story tightens once through the letter revelations, which transform Marcus's mission from debunking a myth to confronting suppressed lifesaving knowledge. The final choice—scattering evidence while reburying the diamond—narrows options and carries visible cost (he returns to the wasteland; truth remains incomplete). Agency is clear in the climactic actions. However, the escalation compresses: the pivot from "worldview tilting" to the final decision lacks an intermediate test that forces Marcus to weigh competing costs on the page. The dust storm's approach adds urgency but doesn't functionally constrain his choice (he completes the work before it arrives).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the diamond's flaw imagery: imperfection enabling protection, truth vs. preservation, lies that shelter versus lies that harm. The final image—"flawed diamond that held paradise in its broken heart"—resonates without moralizing, and Marcus's shift from debunker to curator of ambiguity answers the central question through action rather than statement. The scattered letters function thematically as "seeds" without overstatement. Minor slip: "sometimes the greatest truth was knowing which lies protected something worth preserving" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis articulation, though it's cushioned by being in past-tense summary rather than present declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Marcus. Voice carries a measured investigative quality ("sharply observant nature," "methodically shredded documents") that fits a debunker's mindset. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the letter reconstruction, pulling back slightly for the final walk. Two minor issues: "He understood now that some truths were more complex than the lies built around them" and "sometimes the greatest truth was knowing which lies protected something worth preserving" slip into slightly elevated summary register that doesn't quite match the grounded tactical voice elsewhere. The prose stays clean overall, but these reflective moments feel like the narrator explaining rather than Marcus experiencing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; information density is high (letter content, stillpoint mechanics, orchard history compressed efficiently). Opening and closing images (lazy clicks vs. fading clicks) frame the arc without force. Two micro-issues: "His sharply observant nature had saved countless people from scams, but this place defied explanation" uses filter-like summary where a concrete observational detail would sharpen; "The conspiracy theorists had been right about the stone but wrong about the curse" states the irony rather than letting the action carry it. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—debunker discovers real conspiracy, chooses preservation over exposure—offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The flawed diamond as stillpoint generator combines myth and science freshly. The scattered-letters-as-seeds solution feels earned rather than convenient. However, the core template (investigator finds hidden truth, must decide whether to reveal) is well-worn, and the orchard-as-sanctuary and cursed-gem-with-real-power beats echo familiar post-apocalyptic and artifact-mystery tropes. Transformation is present but partial; the execution elevates the material without fully transcending the genre furniture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's debunker role drives setup (traveling to investigate), middle beats (assembling letters, discovering suppression), and closure choice (scatter evidence, rebury diamond). His observational method enables the letter reconstruction and his shift from exposing hoaxes to preserving ambiguity creates the story's central tension. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The diamond appears early (paragraph 2 rumor), is unearthed at the climax with physical handling ("fist-sized, clouded with that distinctive flaw"), and is reburied in the resolution, charging the final image. Its unique flaw—"frozen lightning bolt" inclusion—creates the stillpoint effect that explains the orchard and frames the thematic core. The object's specific properties (47-meter field, crystalline structure) drive tactics and the ending would collapse without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept is introduced early (paragraph 2 via local whispers), explained via letters ("field extends exactly 47 meters"), and demonstrated on-page (orchard thriving, trees untouched in dust storm). It shapes Marcus's understanding and informs his final choice to preserve the sanctuary. However, the stillpoint functions more as setting-explanation than as a live constraint that alters Marcus's tactics during the investigation itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is stated early but demonstrated primarily through the letter-reassembly task rather than constraining choices. The trait enables the investigation but doesn't create visible tradeoffs (e.g., noticing details others miss while missing emotional cues, or observation delaying action under time pressure). It's functional but closer to a skill than a costly attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears once at the climax: "Holding it, he could intuit the stillness it created." This moment of understanding influences his decision to rebury the diamond, but the action is more stated than dramatized—we don't see the intuition process or feel its cost. The verb itself is generic; swapping it for "sense" or "feel" would not alter the narrative meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled early (metal box with paper strips, paragraph 4), occupies a full beat ("matching edges and ink patterns by lamplight"), and produces the seventeen letters whose revelations drive the middle turn and inform the closure choice. The method's mechanics matter: the tedious reconstruction creates the slow disclosure of conspiracy details. Removing this exact method would require a different revelation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is established in the opening line and functions throughout: the thriving trees create the mystery, the 47-meter stillpoint field explains survival, the dust storms bookend and pressurize the narrative, and the central ancient tree marks the diamond's location. The setting provides both the story's puzzle and its sanctuary, directly shaping Marcus's final choice to preserve it. Geography and atmosphere are integral to every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Six years after the liquidation" anchors the timeframe early and the letters are dated "three days before the reactor breach," creating before/after temporal structure. The approaching dust storm adds urgency to the ending. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten Marcus's tactics in a way that forces tradeoffs—he completes his investigation and decision comfortably within the available window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to excavate truth from comfortable lies" is dramatized from the opening (traveling 300 miles to investigate) through the middle (letter reassembly revealing uncomfortable truth) to closure (choosing which truth to bury, which to scatter). The friction between exposure and preservation creates the story's central conflict. The cost—returning to the wasteland with incomplete revelation—is visible on the page. Strong causal role across all three gates.</comment>
