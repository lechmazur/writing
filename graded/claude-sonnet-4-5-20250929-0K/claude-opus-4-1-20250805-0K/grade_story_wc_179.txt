<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—his "scheming mind already three moves ahead" reads as label rather than embodied tension. The Magistrate's arc from rage to weeping occurs via transmitted cellular memory rather than on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Vera exists as a convenience mechanism with no interior contradiction or cost to her fragmentary existence. The closure choice (releasing the grip) is told through metaphysical exposition rather than earned through prior causal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague: the sanctuary "existed between heartbeats" and communication flows "through touch and intention" without concrete anchoring of who, where, when by ~120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—Magistrate's cellular memory rewrite—lacks visible cost on the page; his son's fever "would break within the hour" is Marcus's assertion, not dramatized consequence. Causality relies on metaphysical mechanics (cellular memory, reality warping) introduced as givens rather than earned through scene pressure. The inferred lens is Situational-Accumulative Hybrid, but the ending summarizes transformation rather than staging it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is described atmospherically ("where sound had never existed") but does not constrain Marcus's tactical choices—he would pursue the same plan in any setting. Spatial choreography is abstract: "pressed the box into the Magistrate's hands" occurs without clear positioning or movement. The music box as micro-setting does recur and charges the final image, but the sanctuary itself remains ornamental backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (saving the Magistrate's son / teaching release of resentment) is signaled early, but escalation is absent—Marcus "had been waiting for this confluence" and executes a pre-formed plan without reversal or tightening. The Magistrate's arrival should complicate, but Marcus is "ready" and transmission of cellular memory resolves instantly with no visible trade-off. Cost is declared ("releasing its stranglehold") but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or paid price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated: "resentment is a melody that plays whether we listen or not, poisoning our blood until we choose silence over repetition" reads as authorial thesis rather than emerging from scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("the greatest scheming was against our own nature") instead of offering a resonant image. Cellular memory functions as symbolic convenience introduced to harvest thematic closure rather than earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Omniscient distance is consistent and the voice carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("violence lived not in fists but in the grip we keep"). However, Marcus's certainty ("His son's fever would break within the hour, Marcus knew") violates POV modesty—he cannot know future outcomes. Diction remains elevated and coherent throughout, though some phrasing trends generic-profound ("every object remembered its purpose, just as every person carried the echo of who they might become").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching: "reality bent like water," "rage filled the soundless space like smoke," "heirloom poison," "stranglehold," all cluster without functional pressure differentiation (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "cellular memory" is restated across multiple beats without new detail. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "new seekers, new cellular memories to unlock, new resentments to release" (−0.4). Information density is moderate; many lines do thematic work but not plot work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise (cellular memory as mechanism for inherited trauma release) is familiar from genre templates and the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0). The Magistrate's arc follows a predictable redemption path: violent authority figure arrives, wise pacifist transmits lesson, healing occurs. The soundless sanctuary and Sister Vera's fragmentation read as atmospheric convenience rather than fresh synthesis inevitable to this story.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and labeled "scheming" twice. His plan to use the music box as teaching tool appears in paragraph 4, and he executes it at the climax by guiding the Magistrate's fingers to the broken pin. However, his choices do not create key turns—he waits for confluence and executes a pre-formed strategy without adaptation. Setup clear, middle beat present, closure participation clear, but causal pressure is low; he orchestrates rather than decides under friction. Two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability (any wise teacher) −0.6 and no visible cost tied to scheming −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Music box cylinder pin introduced paragraph 1 ("pin snapped clean through"), handled by Marcus in paragraph 2, becomes the teaching tool in paragraph 4, and the Magistrate cradles it in the closure. Three-beat involvement +1.4, setup +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (broken pin as metaphor for releasing old song) +0.5. However, the pin itself is passive; Marcus uses it rather than the pin constraining his tactics. Swappability moderate (any broken object might serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" appears twice as a phrase: paragraph 7 ("grip began to loosen with shifting grace") and thematically in the final paragraph ("grace was possible"). It describes the Magistrate's transformation but does not shape Marcus's tactics or stake structure on the page—it is the outcome label rather than a mechanic. Present and thematically coherent, but ornamental to the causal chain. No setup signal, no middle development; closure mention only, and summarized rather than dramatized. Missing setup cap 4.6, missing development cap 3.4, decorative −0.3, label-only −0.3 cumulative applied within remaining band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera "reappears when needed" (paragraph 3) and "would reappear when needed" (paragraph 9). The trait is stated twice and drives her arrival at the inciting moment, but no on-page cost or constraint is visible—she simply flickers in and out as plot requires. Setup present +0.5, one beat (her arrival and transmission) +0.4, but no middle development or closure return. Swappability high (any messenger) −0.6, no cost connection −0.4, summary-only trait −0.4. Missing development cap 3.4 applies, but small positives push within that band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Convince" is the named action throughout: Marcus must convince the Magistrate, and the closing line states he "had convinced another soul." The action structures the dominant stake and drives the Magistrate's transformation in the climax. However, the convincing occurs via metaphysical transmission (cellular memory contact) rather than dramatized persuasion with visible friction. Setup +0.6, closure participation +1.0, two beats (plan formation, execution) +0.9, but swappability moderate (teach, heal, convert are near-synonyms) −0.5 and summary-only execution (told transformation) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is introduced paragraph 2 ("metal's cellular memory"), explained paragraph 4 ("living repository of cellular memory"), and activated paragraph 6-7 as the transmission mechanism. It appears in setup, middle, and closure—all three gates—but functions as a given metaphysical rule rather than a means that shapes Marcus's attempts or costs. The mechanics are declared rather than tested. Three gates met so eligible >6.0 baseline, but purely expository role and no causal friction: the method solves the problem it did not help create (−1.0), late functional explanation mid-story (−0.3), swappable with any mystical touch-healing (−0.7). These frictions collapse score well below gate eligibility, demonstrating the method is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary is named in the title and paragraph 1, and communication constraints are described ("words were impossible here") in paragraph 6. It frames the entire story and returns in the final image ("In the Soundless Sanctuary..."). However, the sanctuary does not pressure Marcus's tactical choices—he would use the same music-box transmission anywhere. Setup +0.7, closure mention +0.4, but missing middle beat where silence constrains action, and largely ornamental role: postcard atmosphere rather than micro-setting that alters moves (−0.8). Swappability (any sacred space) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" appears as backdrop throughout: "reality bent," "reality rippled," "reality settled into its new configuration." The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint. The Magistrate arrives "at dawn" but no urgency tied to that deadline is dramatized—Marcus is already prepared. Setup present, thematic closure mention, but no middle beat where shifting reality tightens his window. Time does not constrain tactics; it is a metaphysical setting detail. Missing development cap 3.4, ornamental use −0.7, restored slightly by closure participation +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to "teach resentment to release" is stated paragraph 1 ("violence lived... in the grip we keep") and paragraph 4 ("they would use the broken music box as their teaching tool"), and shapes his plan and execution through closure. Setup +0.7, two beats (plan, execution) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2. However, the motivation is declared and pursued without internal friction or competing want—Marcus never doubts or sacrifices. Told-only interiority rather than dramatized choice under pressure (−0.8), no visible cost tied to teaching (−0.4).</comment>
