<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of transformation" remains abstract and label-only; her interior never embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The prophesied transformation unfolds passively—she opens bottles and "feels it then" without active choice or visible cost that forecloses a path. The thirty-year arc of "calculated generosity" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the climactic dissolution reads more like cosmic event than earned character change. Therapy-speak ("cellular structure," "consciousness") flattens what should be embodied crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines; no penalty applies. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern build toward a final transformation—but the closure effect lacks visible cost: Elara's "metamorphosis" is asserted through elevated diction rather than a choice that forecloses options. The storm detour, volcano eruption, and dream operate as coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational-lens discipline. The ending reconfigures premise conceptually but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Black sand, volcanic heat, lava streams, and planetary alignment create vivid sensory anchors filtered through an elevated, somewhat detached POV. The bottles function as micro-setting and constrain the opening choice (arranging them); the beach setting pressures the transformation ritual at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image ("black sand held her imprint"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but some details (Jupiter-Mars alignment tugging the ocean) feel ornamental rather than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete tightening or trade-off narrows options under pressure. Elara's agency is passive: she "orchestrates" coincidences unconsciously and opens bottles without resistance or cost. The transformation itself is cosmically granted rather than earned by protagonist choice. No visible price is paid after any turn; the volcano and planets act as convenient enablers. The escalation reads as thematic accumulation without a decisive on-page choice that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as texture, generosity as prerequisite to metamorphosis—emerges from image and action rather than overt moralizing, and the final image (imprint in black sand, empty bottles as monuments) offers a non-literal reconfiguration. However, the prophesied transformation and "calculated generosity" remain largely told rather than dramatized in scene, weakening earned resonance. The lightning bugs as recurring motif constrain one choice (releasing them) and charge the closure, but the thirty-year arc of giving lacks specificity. The story resists easy morals and invites reflection, yet "giving everything away was the only way to become everything" edges toward stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries a consistent elevated, slightly archaic register ("destitute by choice," "the old woman in the market"). Perceptual signature is selective but generic—elevated diction ("vibrant hush," "gritty smoothness") reads more lyric than character-particular. Filter verbs ("She understood now," "She felt it then") appear at peak beats, dulling immediacy. Under peak stress (transformation), the prose sustains its elevated texture without compression or embodied breakdown, reducing realism. No dialogue present; voice distinction bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (e.g., "ancient glass bottles" + bioluminescence + lava competition). However, elevated diction saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silk becoming iron becoming starlight," "gritty smoothness of change itself," "vibrant hush" cluster densely and create register drift from any plausible POV lexicon. Paraphrase loops appear ("transformation not as an event, but as a texture" / "the texture she'd sought to understand"). Minor scaffold ("Now, destitute by choice") and filter-verb stacks at closure ("She understood now," "She felt it then") dull propulsion. Cumulative artifact load: baseline −0.8 in Q7; figurative density in peak beats adds −0.4; total adjustment −1.2 within non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—philanthropist orchestrates coincidences to fulfill prophecy and undergo transformation—echoes familiar mystical-journey templates without sharp transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The volcanic beach, planetary alignment, and lightning-bug release combine logically but feel checklist-assembled rather than inevitable. The "giving everything away to become everything" formulation is philosophical but not particularly fresh. Elevated prose style distinguishes voice, yet the transformation itself (corporeal dissolution into dispersed consciousness) follows well-worn transcendence tropes. Derivative premise adjustment: −0.7 within Q8 for template reliance without sufficient lived-detail grounding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "destitute philanthropist" status is established early (setup gate met) and her past generosity is summarized, but on-page she arranges bottles and opens them without significant choice-driven turns. Development gate weak: her decisions do not alter tactics under pressure. Closure gate met marginally: she is present in the transformation but passive. Causal pressure minimal; the role is more vessel than agent. Present across all three gates but involvement is observational and swappable with a generic "seeker" archetype. Score: setup +0.5, closure presence +0.4, causal pressure weak +0.2, swappability −0.6, passivity −0.4. Band ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lightning bugs in bottles appear early (setup gate met), are handled in two beats (arranging them, opening each bottle), and return in the closure image (scattered essence, freed consciousness). Development gate met: opening the bottles enables the transformation. Payoff gate met: they charge the final image and carry her consciousness forward. Causal pressure moderate: their release is the key action. Specificity solid: bottled bioluminescence is irreplaceable. Cost connection present but oblique: freeing them costs her corporeal form, though this is coincident rather than trade-off driven. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, oblique cost +0.3, total ~4.1 baseline; strong closure role elevates to mid-6s. Band ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "vibrant hush" / "whispering hush" concept appears mid-story ("not quite silence, not quite song") and again in the ending paragraph, meeting setup marginally (late first third) and payoff gates. Development gate weak: the hush does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. It functions as atmospheric description and thematic echo rather than on-page stake-shaper. Lyric reprise (hush → "vibrant hush that followed") reweights mood but not options. Score: late setup −0.3, lyric reprise +0.6, theme-only use −0.5, no causal pressure −0.6. Band ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara "orchestrates coincidences" unconsciously; the trait is described in summary ("she simply moved through the world with such pure intention that reality rearranged itself") but never shown constraining or enabling an on-page action with visible cost. Setup gate met (described early). Development gate failed: no middle choice demonstrates the trait. Payoff gate weak: the transformation is enabled by cosmic timing, not by her orchestration. Label-only without dramatized use. Score: setup +0.4, label-only −0.8, no causal beat −0.7, swappable with "destined" −0.5. Band ~3.8, capped for missing development at 3.4 per gate rule. Final 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "detour" (storm-forced ship redirect) is mentioned in summary as past event; it does not occur on the page and no turn traces to it in the present action. Setup gate failed (off-page backstory). Development and payoff gates failed. Ornamental mention only. Score: off-page summary −1.0, no causal involvement −0.8, swappable with any "arrival mechanism" −0.6. Band ~2.9, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation per gate rule. Final 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "fulfilling prophecies accidentally" method is described in the opening third (old woman's prophecy, Elara's "unconscious preparation") and recurs at closure ("fulfilling the old woman's prophecy without meaning to"). Setup gate met. Development gate weak: the method is asserted but not shown shaping tactical choices. Payoff gate met: the ending hinges on the prophecy's fulfillment. However, the mechanics remain vague ("unconscious" orchestration) and do not visibly constrain attempts. Score: setup +0.6, payoff presence +0.5, mechanics vague −0.6, summary-only development −0.5. Band ~4.6, capped for missing middle development at 3.4 per gate rule. Final 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Black sand beach at volcano's foot anchors setting early (setup gate met), provides tactile detail (crunching sand, volcanic heat humming bottles) that affects micro-choices (arranging bottles, opening them in heat), and the beach imprint becomes the final image (payoff gate met strongly). Development gate met: volcanic heat accelerates the bugs' flashing, enabling synchronization. Causal pressure moderate: the environment enables transformation. Closure linkage strong: "black sand held her imprint" charges the final image. Specificity high: volcanic black sand is irreplaceable. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, total ~4.7 baseline; strong closure role elevates to low-7s. Band ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Planetary alignment (Jupiter-Mars convergence, seventy-three-year cycle) is described early (setup gate met) and recurs in the transformation paragraph and ending ("planets continued their eternal dance"). Payoff gate met. Development gate weak: the alignment "pulls at the ocean's edge" and later "at the transformed particles of her being," but the gravitational effect is asserted rather than shown tightening a decision or altering tactics. The timeframe operates as cosmic backdrop, not a live clock that pressures choices. Score: setup +0.6, payoff presence +0.5, ornamental use −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.6. Band ~4.1, capped for missing development at 3.4 per gate rule. Final 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to understand the texture of transformation" is stated early (setup gate met) and drives her arrival at the beach and bottle-opening. Development gate met: the desire motivates the key action (releasing bugs). Payoff gate met: the ending claims she "finally understood." However, the desire remains abstract and label-only; no on-page friction between want and cost dramatizes internal conflict. The transformation is granted cosmically rather than earned through choice with visible price. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, payoff presence +0.7, label-only interiority −0.8, no friction −0.6. Band ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" as tone appears mid-story and recurs in the ending, framing the transformation with a coherent mood of charged stillness. Setup gate met marginally (mid-first-third). Payoff gate met: "vibrant hush that followed" charges the final image. Development gate weak: tone does not modulate with tactical pressure; it remains static elevated lyricism. Tone coheres but does not escalate or deepen under stress. Score: setup +0.5, payoff presence +0.8, coherence +0.6, static mood −0.5, no modulation under pressure −0.4. Band ~6.4, eligible up to ~6.3 per lyric-reprise allowance; strong closure presence lifts slightly. Final 6.4.</comment>
