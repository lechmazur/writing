<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emil's interiority is concrete and embodied through craft and silence; his seven-year muteness earns the singing climax through prior particulars (grandfather's melody, fragment discovery). The choice to sing is motivated by accumulated pressure rather than sudden epiphany. Minor slip: "understanding dawning like sunrise through fog" edges toward stock phrasing, and the final promise to "teach the horses to sing" risks sentiment, but the core arc of silence-to-song holds with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Emil's song transforms the oasis and reweights his craft from futile preservation to active resurrection. Orientation anchors smoothly (carousel carpenter, train cars, morning fog). The fragment discovery → stumble → garden → angel → song sequence builds causal pressure within an accumulative frame. Cost is felt (seven years of silence broken, voice "rusty from disuse"), and the ending image recharges earlier motifs (silence as possibility, grandfather's melody). One meaningful deepening through the angel encounter suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The train-car workshop, hidden garden, and angel carousel constrain Emil's path and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: sawdust through light, fog breathing, moss on painted horses. The fragment's light and wind bells' extended chime supply concrete environmental pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (third car workshop → corridor → curtain → circular garden). The garden functions as micro-setting that enables the singing turn, qualifying for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Emil's craft and silence as "possibility—a canvas waiting for the right sound." The fragment discovery tightens options; the stumble redirects; the angel encounter forces the choice to sing. One meaningful pressure point (fitting the fragment, which invites speech) escalates under the accumulative lens. Agency is decision with visible cost: breaking seven years of silence, voice cracking. The oasis arrival involves coincidence (stumble, hidden curtain) but complicates rather than resolves; the singing choice is Emil's.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as door, brokenness singing, quiet persistence over grand gesture. The fragment and angel function as recurring images that shift meaning. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "some resurrections require not grand gestures but quiet persistence." Minor slip: "a door waiting to open" and the final "listening to the music only he could hear" edge toward sentiment, and "courage to let brokenness sing" risks abstraction, keeping this just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is selective (carpenter's focus on craft, silence, light). No head-hopping. Voice modulates with pressure (short beats during singing). Minor register drift: "some resurrections require not grand gestures but quiet persistence" feels more essayistic than character-filtered. "Whispering gleam" and "misting hush" recur but occasionally lean ornamental. Distance control is clean; elision of seven years is purposeful and efficient.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high (fragment embedded in wood, angel's missing piece). Minor overwriting clusters: "memories refusing to settle," "understanding dawning like sunrise through fog," "light spread like water, not harsh but whispering." These phrases in the garden sequence blur into decorative accumulation rather than propulsion. Paraphrase check passes; no template cadence. Propulsion slows slightly in the oasis description but recovers at the singing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silent carpenter who sings, fragment in wood, hidden garden grown from ruin offer specific synthesis. The circus-train-as-workshop and nature-reclaiming-carousel transform familiar "artist in exile" material through grounded detail. Emotional arc (silence to song) relies on a known template but executes it with specificity (grandfather's wordless melody, halo fragment). Risk: the oasis and angel feel slightly convenient, and the thematic closure ("brokenness sing") approaches platitude, limiting fresh inflection. Still, the synthesis feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emil present from opening; his choices drive the narrative. Discovery of fragment (early beat), follows impulse to last car (middle), stumbles through curtain (causal turn), fits fragment (peak choice), sings (closure action). His silent craft and decision to break silence shape all major turns. Irreplaceable: story hinges on his seven-year silence and choice to sing. Cost visible: voice cracking, years of isolation ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fragment embedded in wood (setup), recognized as halo piece, pocketed (early beat), pulls Emil toward last car (middle pressure), fitted into angel's halo gap triggering light and invitation to sing (closure catalyst). Three distinct beats; causal throughout. Specific properties (size, gleam, origin) matter. Closure directly shaped by fitting the fragment. Only minor swappability (another sacred object could substitute with moderate rewriting) keeps this below 9.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Misting hush" introduced early ("morning fog rolled through broken windows," "misting hush hung heavier than usual"), returns in garden ("misting hush here felt alive, breathing"), and charges final image ("patient fog"). Shapes atmosphere and Emil's perception of silence-as-possibility. Development: the hush in the garden "felt alive," reweighting Emil's stance. Closure: "whispering its gleam through the patient fog" ties concept to ending tone. Functional across beats but more atmospheric than constraining; could be replaced by another ambient silence motif without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent in his craft" stated early, demonstrated through seven years of carving horses "that would never spin again," staying after others fled, continuing work until noon. Enables middle action (follows impulse, approaches angel with patience). Constraints visible: persistence through isolation, patient approach to angel. Cost implicit: years of solitary work. One strong beat (carving through years) and closure linkage (persistence rewarded). Swappable with "stubborn dedication" or similar trait; specific phrase less essential than the behavior.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singing is the climactic action and closure unit. Setup: grandfather's melody mentioned, Emil's silence established for seven years. Peak turn: "For the first time in seven years, Emil opened his mouth. What emerged wasn't words but song." Consequence: carousel horses shimmer, train transformed, Emil's future craft will carry the song. Irreplaceable: no other action delivers this exact closure (speaking would not carry the wordless-melody link; silence continuing would negate the arc). Felt cost on page: "voice, rusty from disuse, cracked and whispered." Three gates plus high causal and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Wrong turn signaled early: "his foot caught on a loose board. He stumbled left instead of right, pushing through a curtain he'd never noticed before." Mechanics clear and specific (loose board, directional stumble, hidden curtain). Consequence: discovers garden, which enables the angel encounter and singing. Setup and middle development solid; payoff is the entire oasis sequence and closure. Slightly reduces score: the stumble feels mildly convenient (coincidence complicates but borders on resolving the impasse of isolation). Still, the method is causal and specific, shaping the central turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Train cars established early (opening paragraph), workshop in third car detailed with sawdust and light. Train supplies Emil's craft space, wind bells that trigger the impulse, corridor to garden, and final image ("abandoned circus train held its breath around him"). Setting pressures choices: isolation enables silence, workshop proximity to last car creates spatial logic, hidden garden accessed only via train structure. Closure: train becomes witness and vessel for resurrection. Micro-setting (workshop tools, wind bells) alters tactics. Essential: removing the train setting would break spatial logic and thematic container.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wind bells he'd hung throughout the train began their daily symphony" at noon; "today their chiming stretched longer, each note suspended in the fog like a held breath. Inside this elongated moment, Emil felt time soften." Time dilation cued and tied to Emil's perception. Closure: "whispering gleam of afternoon through leaves" anchors return to normal time. Setup and development present; constrains Emil's movement (impulse triggered by extended chime). Payoff: time resumes after singing. Functional but more atmospheric than mechanically urgent; could be replaced with another triggering event (e.g., a sound, a shift in light) without fundamental breakage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated early: "believing that silence was not emptiness but possibility—a canvas waiting for the right sound." Demonstrated through seven years of carving. Middle: fragment and angel "invite" him to break silence. Climax: sings, fulfilling the interpretation. Closure: "silence was not an ending but a door waiting to open." Two beats (carving, singing) plus closure linkage. Cost visible (years alone, voice breaking). Slightly abstract phrasing ("possibility," "door") and told alongside shown; more integrated dramatization would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" introduced early: "fragment gleamed with its own light." Recurs: "light spread like water, not harsh but whispering," "whispering gleam of afternoon through leaves," final image "whispering its gleam through the patient fog." Tone coheres (soft, liminal, sacred) and modulates with pressure (fragment's gleam intensifies at angel encounter, dims to afternoon calm). Charges final image. Slightly ornamental in middle beats but purposeful reprise at closure. Distinct texture throughout; removing the tone would flatten the sacred-quiet atmosphere essential to the ending's charge.</comment>
