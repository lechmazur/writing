<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's arc from rushed apprentice to patient cultivator is legible, with her sensitive nose functioning as more than decoration—it guides work choices and enables detection of threats. However, her transformation hinges on a single reflective moment ("the breakthrough came at the turning of the tide's thought") rather than on-page struggle with contradictory impulses; the insight arrives as epiphany rather than through micro-choices under fire. Internal conflict remains largely summarized across weeks rather than dramatized in scene pressure, and the final stance—"rooted at last in understanding"—reads as claimed rather than tested by a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative lens: weeks dissolve, details accrue, and the breakthrough reweights Mira's earlier rushing. Orientation anchors (Whisperwood canopy, suspended garden, Mira's arrival three moons ago) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. However, the closure unit—Mira standing amid the bloom, "rooted at last in understanding"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or choice visibly narrows her options at the ending beat. The causality of her transformation relies on summary ("days dissolved into weeks") and one reflective turn rather than because/therefore linkage in scene, and the final image reconfigures meaning primarily through metaphor ("swayed with it, rooted at last") without a concrete price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid and functional: rope bridges, platforms around trunks, mist rising "like steam from a witch's cauldron," and the suspended garden with lightning-struck soil all ground the world in tactile specifics. The setting pressures Mira's choices—she must learn to "find stillness while perpetually swaying," and the canopy's motion becomes a metaphor that reappears at closure when she "swayed with it, rooted at last." Dew collected from spider webs at dawn, the highest platform, and the village's constant creak under wind are filtered through her olfactory focus and her need for serenity. Minor: spatial choreography of other apprentices and Master Thorne's exact proximity remains vague, and the village's social structure (how elders enforce patience, why mockery doesn't escalate) is under-explored, but the micro-setting of soil and suspended garden clearly constrains her cultivation work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to pass her herbalist test by cultivating the corpse flower—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through her sensitive nose detecting threats (soil acidity, fungal risk, seed germination) and through the plant's slow growth cycle. However, escalation is largely summary-driven ("days dissolved into weeks") rather than a visible on-page tightening that narrows her options; the breakthrough moment is reflective rather than a tactical choice under fire, and the mockery from other apprentices never complicates her work in scene. The bloom itself arrives as culmination rather than climax—there is no reversal, no moment where success threatens to slip away. The cost of her patience (time, isolation, enduring mockery) is implied but not dramatized as a trade-off that forces a hard choice at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—patience as embodied practice, wisdom flowing "beneath action like sap beneath bark"—emerges organically from the treetop setting's constant sway, Mira's olfactory attunement, and the flower's seven-year cycle. The corpse flower's stench as "not corruption but communication, not death but transformation" reweights the opening revulsion and avoids tidy moralizing. The journal-of-drawings motif, linking generations, charges the ending when "the flower lived forever" in sketches. However, Master Thorne's direct articulation of the theme ("knowledge flows beneath action like sap beneath bark") and the final phrase "rooted at last in understanding" approach thematic echo; the insight is more stated than embodied in a non-literal final image that reweights prior material through pressure rather than summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; her olfactory signature is consistent and filters world details (she "could smell when the soil grew too acidic," "smell its dreams," "smell its readiness like thunder before rain"). Diction suits a focused apprentice herbalist without register drift, and psychic distance modulates purposefully when summarizing weeks versus slowing for the breakthrough. Master Thorne's brief dialogue ("The corpse flower blooms once every seven years...") carries his authority and the village's ethos without feeling expository. Minor: the narration occasionally front-loads explanation ("Here, where earth barely touched their feet, the herbalists learned to cultivate serenity within motion") that tells before showing, and the voice in reflective passages ("She understood then that the flower's notorious odor wasn't corruption but communication") slides toward interpretive summary rather than staying rooted in Mira's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly ("The corpse flower seed arrived wrapped in brown paper..."). Imagery is often vivid ("mist rose from the forest floor far below like steam from a witch's cauldron") and sensory detail balances across sight, smell, and touch. However, several prose artifacts dull momentum: "days dissolved into weeks" is summary scaffold; "the breakthrough came at the turning of the tide's thought" stacks abstractions without concrete image; "overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible" is a label list rather than embodied perception; and the phrase "rooted at last in understanding" repeats the root/sway metaphor mechanically. Filter verbs ("she could smell," "she understood," "she discovered") cluster in the second half without voice necessity, and the final paragraph's syntax—"breathing deeply despite her sensitive nose, finding serenity within the chaos of sensation"—relies on participle stacking that flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The treetop herbalist village and the corpse flower's seven-year bloom offer fresh specifics, and the family custom of sketching on seed wrapping adds textured inheritance. Mira's olfactory sensitivity (smelling the seed's "dormant potential," the flower's "dreams," fungal threats) is concrete rather than token, and the corpse flower's odor reframed as communication rather than corruption is a purposeful inversion. However, the mentor-gives-test-to-impatient-student frame is widely used, and Mira's arc from rushing to patient stillness follows a predictable apprenticeship template without a bold structural or moral complication. The breakthrough arrives as reflective epiphany rather than through a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior stakes, and the ending's "rooted at last in understanding" metaphor, while thematically apt, feels anticipated rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is the sole focalizer and her choices drive the plot: she plants the seed, collects dew, detects threats with her nose, and adjusts soil. However, most key decisions (watering schedule, sketching practice, managing acidity) occur in summary across weeks rather than in dramatized beats where options narrow under pressure. The breakthrough moment is reflective ("realized her lines had begun to mirror the village's sway") rather than a tactical choice that alters stakes. Her ambition is stated early but not tested by a visible on-page dilemma at closure. Present across all beats and causally linked to the flower's growth, but the lack of a high-pressure choice that forecloses a path keeps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is handled in multiple beats: arrival wrapped in sketched paper, planting in suspended garden, watering with spider-web dew, olfactory monitoring of germination and fungal threat, emergence of the shoot, towering growth, and the final bloom. Its putrid-sweet scent drives Mira's nose-guided work and reappears at closure when "the entire village gathered...to witness what Mira had cultivated." The seed's seven-year cycle frames the patience theme and the bloom's stench as communication (not corruption) reweights its initial revulsion. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; the cost (enduring mockery, slow progress) ties to the seed's demands. However, the seed itself does not force a hard tactical choice—Mira's care is methodical rather than dilemma-driven—so it stops short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" is articulated by Master Thorne ("knowledge flows beneath action like sap beneath bark") and echoed in the theme of patience versus rushing. It shapes the story's moral calculus: Mira must learn to move slowly, mirror the village's sway, and let understanding emerge over time. However, the concept remains largely thematic rather than tactical; it does not constrain a specific on-page choice or create a visible trade-off. The breakthrough realization ("her lines had begun to mirror the village's sway") interprets the concept but does not dramatize a cost tied to it. Present across the arc and reinforced at closure, but functional rather than indispensable—removing the phrase "undercurrent of wisdom" and keeping "patience" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's olfactory sensitivity is used in multiple beats: she detects the seed's "dormant potential through its wrapping," smells when soil grows too acidic, senses fungal threat, detects "the precise moment when the seed began its secret germination," and later "could smell its dreams" and "its readiness like thunder before rain." At closure, she breathes deeply "despite her sensitive nose" during the bloom's stench, demonstrating endurance as cost. The trait enables her cultivation work and differentiates her from mocking peers. However, the sensitivity never forces a hard tactical trade-off (e.g., overwhelming stench that threatens her ability to continue, or a choice between proximity and safety). It functions as a professional tool rather than a constraint with visible on-page friction, keeping it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Journalizing—sketching on the seed's wrapping paper in the "old way"—appears in three beats: evening after receiving the seed, adding to ancestors' drawings, the breakthrough realization when her lines mirror the village's sway, and at closure when "in her journal of drawings, the flower lived forever." The action links to the family custom, frames the breakthrough as embodied practice (not just thought), and charges the ending by making the flower permanent. However, the act of sketching does not force a major plot turn or constrain a choice; Mira could cultivate the flower without journalizing, though the thematic resonance would weaken. Solid beat involvement and closure presence, but the action is more meditative accent than causal pivot, placing it in upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The family custom of "botanical sketches—a family custom the Aethwyn herbalists had maintained for centuries" on wrapping paper interiors is signaled in the opening paragraph, reappears when Mira sketches that evening ("her drawings joined those of her ancestors"), and recurs at closure when "in her journal of drawings, the flower lived forever." The custom provides the journalizing method and ties Mira to her lineage, adding thematic weight. However, the mechanics of doodling on wrapping paper do not shape her cultivation tactics or create a cost; she could sketch on any surface with the same effect. The custom charges the ending by making the flower "live forever" in family tradition, but it remains a thematic layer rather than a tactical necessity. Solid setup and closure presence, but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "mysterious treetop village" (Whisperwood, rope bridges, platforms around ancient oaks, suspended garden with lightning-struck soil) is present throughout: it frames the opening, pressures Mira's need to "find stillness while perpetually swaying," provides the highest platform for planting, and supplies resources (dew from spider webs, special soil). At closure, "the entire village gathered, swaying in their treetop world," and Mira "swayed with it, rooted at last"—the setting's constant motion reweights her understanding and charges the final image. The village's physical constraints (height, sway, remoteness from forest floor) shape her cultivation method and embody the theme. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure (she must adapt to the sway), and closure linkage. The "mysterious" quality is more atmospheric than plot-functional, and spatial choreography of other villagers remains vague, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought, that liminal moment when understanding shifts from intellectual to embodied" appears once, marking Mira's breakthrough. It is a metaphorical timeframe rather than a tracked clock or deadline, and it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The seven-year bloom cycle frames patience but is not a live countdown in this story window (Mira cultivates over weeks, not years). The breakthrough moment is reflective rather than time-constrained. The phrase charges one beat with poetic weight but does not alter tactics or pressure; it could be omitted without breaking story logic. Present but ornamental, with no causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early ("Here, where earth barely touched their feet, the herbalists learned to cultivate serenity within motion") and drives her arc from rushing apprentice to patient practitioner. The motivation is tested by other apprentices' mockery, the slow growth cycle, and the need to mirror the village's sway. At closure, she achieves it: "finding serenity within the chaos of sensation...swayed with it, rooted at last in understanding." However, the friction between her initial ambition and the need for patience is largely told in summary ("days dissolved into weeks") rather than dramatized in a scene where the competing wants force a hard choice. The motivation shapes the arc but the cost (time, endurance of mockery) is implied rather than viscerally paid in a single high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone—quiet, meditative, patient—is established early ("his voice carrying the wildflower hush that permeated this place") and sustained through the village's gentle sway, Mira's careful sketching, and the accumulative weeks of tending. The tone modulates slightly at the bloom ("overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible") but returns to serene closure ("swayed with it, rooted at last"). However, the tone remains largely static; there is no sharp tonal break or intensification that mirrors escalating pressure. The hush supports the theme of patience but does not charge the final image with new emotional texture—it simply continues. Coherent and purposeful, but a single steady mood rather than a tone that reweights under stress, keeping it in mid-6s.</comment>
