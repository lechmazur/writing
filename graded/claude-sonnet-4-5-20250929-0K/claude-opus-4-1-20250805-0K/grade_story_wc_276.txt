<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kova's cool-headed training is established early and embodied through specific actions: steadying her breath, voicing silence as paradox, maintaining stillness while her heart hammers. The seven-year preparation and the discipline to remain still "as winter lakes while chaos churned beneath" create clear internal contradiction. The final change—receiving the echo and walking home with it incorporated into her voice—feels earned by her sustained effort, though the actual moment of yielding ("not captured but choosing to be held") softens agency slightly. The embodied emotion (determination as amber streams, fear as ice bells) avoids diagnostic labels and grounds her state in the fantastical world's rules.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—sound waves as vertical rivers, emotions transliterating into physical form—and accumulates density through layered imagery. Orientation anchors (Kova, sound wave garden, liminal hours) arrive within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the echo yields, whispers its meaning, and Kova walks home changed, with the new song ready to be "cast forward into the world's wounds." Cost is conceptual and felt—she has internalized the goddess's three-century wandering—and the final image (humming a feral lullaby that blooms winter flowers) reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo circles and tests her, then bites the line, narrowing the encounter from hunt to dance to acceptance. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: acoustic flowers from pure resonance, emotions crystallizing as silver vines and blue thorns, vertical rivers of sound. Kova's bare feet "finding the spaces between feelings" grounds her navigation in tactile, body-level choreography. The rail spike hums and grows warmer, then burns—a recurring small object that constrains her method and charges the final moment when it cools. Spatial tracking remains clear: she stands at the garden's edge, moves through it carefully, casts her line in zigzag patterns that mimic the constellations above. The setting actively shapes her tactics (voicing silence to create the opposite of noise, using the spike to navigate frequencies) and the hybrid blooms where starlight touches sound supply the charged backdrop for the climactic encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: hunting the echo of a goddess, a sound that "could cure or curse, depending on the listener's readiness." Kova's seven-year preparation establishes the cost of unreadiness. The tightening occurs when the echo circles her three times, testing, and her emotions transliterate into visible currents that she must ignore to hold the moment—a clear narrowing of options where panic would scatter the catch. The dance (pulling with silence, resisting with ancient song) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, though the echo "choosing to be held" rather than being captured dilutes the sense that Kova's skill alone secured the outcome. The cost is legible: she receives the goddess's message and is "changed," now carrying the echo forward with visible consequence (humming the feral lullaby that alters reality). One persistent constraint—the need to keep her mind's surface still—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image: "some songs never die, they just learn to swim in different seas." This wisdom is earned through Kova's on-page struggle and the goddess's three-century wandering, not asserted. The rail spike as a motif—"metal that knew straight lines could best understand when to bend them"—accumulates meaning from guidance tool to conductor of impossible frequencies to cooling artifact, constraining choice and charging the closure without becoming a mechanical symbol. The final image (winter flowers blooming from a feral lullaby) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of whether old songs can heal new wounds. Subtext operates in the paradox of voicing silence, the echo's choice to yield, and the implication that Kova now bears responsibility for the gift. No thematic statement or moral intrudes; complexity remains in the ambiguity of "cure or curse" and Kova's readiness being tested but not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and patterned ("liminal hours," "somnambulant giants," "vowels of void, consonants of quiet") in a lyric register that fits the fantastical premise and Kova's trained, contemplative stance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices frequencies, interprets sound waves as fishable currents, and filters experience through her grandmother's teaching. Under peak stress (the echo circling, her heart hammering), the prose compresses slightly but maintains coherent texture. However, some phrases ("departed music," "prowling cat made of departed music") edge toward stock lyricism, and the uniform elevation across all beats—high-pressure and calm alike—flattens the modulation that would sharpen emotional peaks. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats: "A child's laugh became silver vines. A widow's sob crystallized into blue thorns" conveys both world rule and atmosphere efficiently. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reconfigure prior motifs effectively. However, multiple lines rely on similar structures: "A constellation tumbled lower... Where starlight touched sound wave, new hybrid blooms erupted"; "The rail spike sang... Then she felt it: a tug..."; "What followed was not a struggle but a dance." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without always adding new information—"prowling cat made of departed music," "phosphorescent rain," "frequencies that shouldn't exist"—creating decorative density rather than propulsion. Some metaphoric vehicles stretch logic: constellations casting "shadows that sang" when they are themselves light sources. Stock phrases ("her heart hammered rhythms," "tested. Each pass") dilute specificity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the cumulative effect of ornamental phrasing in peak moments applies a moderate deduction here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-wave fishing, sleepwalking constellations, and emotional transliteration into physical form is specific and non-obvious, creating a premise that feels fresh rather than template-driven. The rail spike's role (iron that knew straight lines learning to bend) and the method of voicing silence to catch an echo are inventive inflections that grow organically from the fantastical world's logic. The final turn—the echo choosing to be held rather than captured—subverts the hunt structure in a way that feels earned by Kova's training and the goddess's nature. However, the overall arc (protagonist prepares, hunts rare quarry, succeeds after testing, returns changed) follows a recognizable quest template, and the elevated lyric register, while coherent, trends toward a familiar fantasy-poetic mode. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the emotional arc and thematic resolution (old songs finding new seas) are gracefully executed rather than radically surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kova (cool-headed fisher) appears in the opening line, drives all key beats, and makes the central choices: casting the line in zigzag, voicing silence, holding stillness under testing, pulling with silence in the dance. Her training and discipline shape tactics throughout. She is present in the closure beat, walking home changed with the echo incorporated. Her decisions—remaining steady, continuing to voice silence even as fear crystallizes—alter the encounter's outcome. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development shows her actively responding to the echo's circling. Causal pressure is evident: her seven-year preparation and specific method (voicing silence) enable the capture. Cost is visible in her transformation and new responsibility. Specificity is high: no generic "hero" could replace her particular skill set.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rail spike is introduced in the third paragraph with backstory (grandmother hammered it into her first rod, "metal that knew straight lines could best understand when to bend them"), appears in at least three distinct beats (humming in her pocket, growing warmer as she voices silence, burning as she conducts impossible frequencies, cooling after the encounter ends), and is present in the closure paragraph ("pocketed the cooling rail spike"). It constrains her method (guides her "through frequencies only she could navigate") and its changing temperature tracks escalation. The object's properties (iron, former train guide, now frequency conductor) are irreplaceable and specific. Setup, development, and closure gates all met. The spike's role in enabling the final capture and its state change (burning → cooling) tie it to cost and consequence. Strong causal involvement across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are introduced early (second paragraph: "constellations above moved in their sleep, dragging their ancient light in zigzag paths"), shape Kova's tactic (she casts her line "in a deliberate zigzag pattern, mimicking the sleepwalking stars' wandering paths"), and return at closure (ascending to their proper positions as dawn approaches, framing the end of the liminal window). They create hybrid blooms when their light touches sound waves, supplying the charged environment for the encounter. Setup and closure gates met; middle development shows them descending further and leaking dreams as phosphorescent rain, complicating the scene. The concept affects atmosphere and timing (the liminal hours when patterns break) but does not directly constrain Kova's core choice or narrow her options in a way that alters the outcome. Visible presence across beats but causal pressure is more atmospheric than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Transliterating emotions into physical form is established early as a world rule ("emotions into physical form. A child's laugh became silver vines") and demonstrated three times: general examples in the garden, Kova's emotions during the echo's circling ("determination became amber streams, longing turned to violet smoke, fear crystallized as tiny ice bells"), and the final message transliterating "through her entire being." The attribute shapes one key choice: Kova must ignore the visible emotional currents (especially the fear-bells chiming warnings) to hold the moment, creating on-page friction. Setup and closure gates met (the goddess's message transliterates at the end). Middle beat shows the trait actively testing her discipline. Cost is visible in the exposure of her internal state and the need to override fear. Specificity is high (not merely "reading emotions" but physical transformation unique to this world), though the trait belongs to the world/goddess more than to Kova as a character attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zigzag appears three times with functional variation: constellations dragging light "in zigzag paths" (setup, second paragraph), Kova casting her line "in a deliberate zigzag pattern, mimicking the sleepwalking stars' wandering paths" (middle, seventh paragraph), and implicitly in the constellations' movement framing the entire encounter. The action is causally linked to success: Kova's mimicry of the stars' pattern is presented as purposeful and tied to the liminal condition when "patterns break themselves." Setup, development, and closure-framing gates met. The zigzag distinguishes this attempt from routine casting and connects to the timeframe and concept (sleepwalking constellations, broken patterns). Removing it would require rewriting the method and the symbolic link to the constellations. Specificity and causal role are strong; cost connection is indirect (the method is effortful and tied to her training) but present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voicing silence is introduced in the fourth paragraph ("She began voicing silence, that peculiar skill of speaking absence into being. Her lips moved without sound, shaping vowels of void, consonants of quiet. The paradox always worked: to catch an echo, you had to create the opposite of noise"), demonstrated on-page as she performs it, and returns at the climax ("Kova pulled with silence, the echo resisted with ancient song"). Setup and development gates clearly met; the method is causally active in the closure beat (the dance that secures the echo). Mechanics are explained and matter: the paradox is necessary to catch an echo, and her continued use under pressure ("remained steady, continued voicing silence even as her heart hammered") shapes the outcome. Specificity is high; swapping for generic "magic" or "calling" would break the logic. Cost is visible in the discipline required to maintain silence while under emotional stress. The method is indispensable to the story's central conceit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is named in the opening line, detailed extensively (acoustic flowers, vertical rivers, emotions as vines and thorns, spaces between feelings), and frames the entire encounter. It supplies the resources Kova uses (sound waves to fish, the environment where the echo prowls) and constrains her tactics (she must move carefully, find spaces, navigate frequencies). Setup gate met immediately; development throughout as she casts into the garden and the environment evolves (hybrid blooms erupt where starlight touches sound); closure returns to it ("stood changed in the sound wave garden"). Micro-setting elements (bare feet on the ground, positioning at the edge, moving through the vertical rivers) provide tactile choreography. The setting is irreplaceable: no generic "forest" or "lake" could host this encounter. Causal pressure is strong; the garden's properties enable and shape every beat. Present in the final image as the space she leaves. Very high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when patterns break themselves" is introduced in the opening line and tied to "those liminal hours when dawn's rigid schedule crumbled into something wilder." The concept recurs: "Tonight felt different," the sleepwalking constellations move during this window, and closure arrives as "Dawn approached, bringing back its tedious patterns. The constellations stirred toward waking." Setup and closure gates met; the liminal window frames the entire encounter and creates urgency (the opportunity will close at dawn). Middle development shows the conditions intensifying (constellations descending, dreams leaking). The timeframe pressures the encounter by limiting when the echo can be sighted and caught, though no moment-by-moment clock tightens individual choices. Cost is implicit: Kova must act during this narrow window or wait for another break in patterns. The frame is specific and purposeful but operates more as backdrop than as a ticking constraint that alters tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to catch the echo of a goddess is introduced in the third paragraph ("She was hunting for the echo of a goddess who had died singing three centuries ago"), detailed with stakes ("a sound that could cure or curse, depending on the listener's readiness"), and grounded in seven years of preparation. The desire drives every on-page action: casting the line, voicing silence, holding stillness during the test, pulling with silence in the dance. Friction between want and cost is visible: she must override fear (crystallized as ice bells chiming warnings) and maintain discipline under extreme emotional pressure. Setup, development, and closure gates all met; the motivation is causally active at every beat and culminates in success with the echo yielding and delivering its message. The piece dramatizes her readiness through embodied discipline rather than telling. Specificity is high (not merely "seeking power" but catching a particular echo for a healing purpose). The final image shows consequence: she now carries the song forward "ready to be cast...into the world's wounds."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Feral lullaby appears explicitly twice: "feral lullabies that made the garden's frequencies shiver and reorganize" (middle, when constellation shadows sing) and "humming a feral lullaby that made flowers bloom in winter air" (final line). The tone is also embodied throughout in the mix of domesticity (fishing, grandmother's teaching, walking home) and wildness (prowling echo, untamed sound, patterns breaking). The phrase charges the final image and reweights the closure: Kova's new song is both soothing and wild, nurturing (blooms flowers) and disruptive (in winter). Setup is implicit (the wild liminal hours and singing shadows teach the tone early); closure participation is strong. The tone modulates purposefully: calm discipline in Gova's stance, rising intensity during the circling and dance, return to quiet power at the end. Coherence is maintained across turns. Specificity is high; "feral lullaby" captures the duality better than generic "strange song." Development is present but the tone is more consistent than dynamically shifting, which keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
