<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to translate isolation into independence is stated clearly but remains abstract through most of the piece. The realization "We weren't preserved to recreate the past... We're here to coexist with its absence" arrives as declared insight rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Her interior life relies heavily on exposition about past lives and dormant memories rather than embodied contradiction in the present scene. The final stance crystallization lacks visible cost—she sets down the sundial and finds purpose, but no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the stone circle's hum, the brass sundial, and scattered anachronisms building toward a thematic reconfiguration. However, closure relies on Kira's epiphany ("not the isolation of being the last, but the independence to choose coexistence") delivered as internal realization rather than a decisive image or action with felt cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (Tidal Library, Kira, post-memory awakening), and the two-shard structure (interior reflection → Marcus dialogue → final understanding) holds coherence. Cost remains conceptual and oblique; the "brittle awakening... settling into something stronger" is told rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Tidal Library is vividly realized with atmospheric tides, glass floors over clouds, and the stone circle below, creating a distinct spatial signature. The brass sundial functions as a charged object across multiple beats, warming under touch and reflecting fragmented selves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Kira's decision to set the sundial on the ledge is symbolic rather than tactically forced by setting elements. The body and tool (sundial) participate meaningfully but the final image's resonance is thematic rather than environmental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kira translating her crushing isolation into bearable independence—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure accumulates through the hum intensifying and the sundial warming, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. Marcus's arrival and tea offering provide a conversational beat but no opposition. The resolution (understanding that anachronisms coexist with absence) arrives as insight rather than through a choice that forecloses a path, meeting the Accumulative lens minimally but without the felt cost that would elevate into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of coexistence versus isolation emerges through concrete images—the mammoth herder knowledge, the scattered tribe of anachronisms, the sundial's reflections. The final realization avoids overt moralizing but relies on stated understanding rather than a non-literal answer embedded in action or image. The sundial casting its first shadow is a strong closing symbol, but the preceding epiphany ("We're here to coexist with its absence") edges toward thesis statement. The piece invites reflection on extinction and memory, yet the thematic payoff leans declarative where a charged particular would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Kira's perceptions throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with phrases like "atomically reflective surface" and "brittle awakening... settling into something stronger," though some constructions edge toward elevated register ("epochs," "anachronisms," "coexist with its absence"). Marcus's brief dialogue feels functional but not strongly differentiated in voice. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative certainty matches Kira's knowledge. Minor slips in diction during peak reflection (therapy-adjacent phrasing like "crushing isolation" and "emotional aftereffect") slightly flatten immediacy, but the perceptual signature remains anchored in memory and sensory fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory anchors (clouds beneath glass, brass warming, stone circle glowing). However, figurative language clusters densely in reflective passages without clear payoff: "cracked her open like an egg," "brittle of transformation—the moment before ice becomes water, before coal becomes diamond," and "atomically reflective" repeated without mechanical grounding. The final paragraph stacks metaphors (measuring time in space between lost and found, weight of memory and lightness of becoming) that blur rather than sharpen the image. Minimal loops or scaffold, but elevated diction in peak beats ("anachronisms," "contemporary with extinction itself") drifts from the POV's embodied voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—reincarnated extinct-species experts living in the modern world—offers a fresh synthesis of memory, extinction, and temporal displacement. The Tidal Library above clouds and the brass sundial as impossible artifact provide specific, non-generic anchors. However, the emotional arc (isolation → independence through coexistence) follows a familiar self-actualization template without sharp trade-offs or moral complexity. The scattered tribe of anachronisms (cave painter in Tokyo, auroch hunter at Oxford) reads as intriguing setup but remains ornamental rather than causally integrated. The transformation test is borderline: swap mammoths for another extinct species and the arc holds unchanged, suggesting the freshness is more cosmetic than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kira as "contemporary of extinct species" is present throughout and her reincarnated mammoth-herder identity frames her isolation and final understanding. However, her choices remain abstract—she reflects, touches the sundial, and realizes her purpose, but no on-page decision alters tactics or stakes. The character element is functional and thematically load-bearing but does not create a key turn through action. Missing middle development where her extinct-species status constrains a choice; present at setup and closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in multiple beats: Kira presses her palm against it, watches her reflection fragment, feels it warm, lifts it, and finally sets it on the ledge where it casts a shadow. It serves as a charged object across the arc and participates in the closure image with reweighted meaning (first shadow in months). However, the sundial does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—it remains symbolic rather than tactically essential. Strong setup, present in closure, but missing middle development where handling it alters options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" is explicitly named and metaphorically developed ("brittle and sharp," "brittle of transformation—the moment before ice becomes water"). It shapes the dominant stake (Kira's awakening three months ago that "cracked her open") and the resolution describes the brittle settling into strength. However, the concept operates thematically rather than constraining on-page choices—no decision hinges on brittleness as a tactical property. Present at setup, developed in reflection, and participates in closure understanding, but does not change options through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" is applied to the sundial's surface (showing fragmented reflections, time itself, faces across lives) and later to the stone circle. The trait enables the visual motif of reflection and connection but does not constrain or enable an action with cost—Kira looks into it rather than using the property to solve a problem or face a trade-off. Present at setup, consistent through middle description, and mentioned at closure (stone circle glows with same reflection), but swappable with "magically reflective" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the story's conceptual fulcrum: Kira's realization shifts from isolation to coexistence with absence, Marcus affirms it, and the mammoth-herder memory models harmony. The action shapes the major turn ("We're here to coexist with its absence" redefines her purpose) and is inseparable from the thematic closure. Early signal in mammoth/human harmony, developed through the scattered tribe of anachronisms, and decisive at closure. The verb itself drives the final reconfiguration, though the turn is declared rather than enacted through a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "hum of an ancient stone circle" awakens reincarnation memories, intensifies throughout ("hums louder today," "resonance is shifting"), and softens to match Kira's heartbeat at closure. The hum shapes the inciting incident (memory awakening three months ago) and participates in the final beat as it synchronizes with her, signaling resolution. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how the hum works or why it calls now is not dramatized, and it does not constrain a middle choice. Present at setup, mentioned in escalation, active at closure, but the means itself does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Tidal Library is essential to tone, isolation, and the vertical geography (above clouds, anchored to mountaintops, stone circle visible below through glass floor). It provides the space where Kira flees to translate isolation and where the hum resonates through the building's structure at closure. The setting enables her solitude and positions the sundial on the ledge for the final shadow image. Strong setup, middle use (atmospheric pressure shifts walls), and closure participation (library breathes with her). However, it does not constrain a choice with cost—Kira could reach the same realization elsewhere with minor edits, making it essential for atmosphere but not irreplaceable for plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" is signaled early (awakening three months ago) and frames the present struggle—Kira learning to live with newly awakened past-life knowledge. The timeframe provides context for her brittle state and the journey toward stability. However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the piece operates in a reflective present without a live clock or countdown. Present at setup, shapes the character's state throughout, and the closure understanding represents progress within this timeframe, but time does not pressure tactics or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is explicitly stated and drives the narrative arc from crushing isolation to finding purpose in coexistence. Kira's desire is clear and the climax delivers the reframing she seeks. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through choices—she reflects and realizes rather than acting under competing pressures that test the desire with visible cost. Strong setup (fled to library to translate isolation), thematic development, and closure delivers the translation, but friction between wants and costs remains abstract rather than enacted in scene.</comment>
