<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The analytically intuitive trait remains label-only; we never see her detect patterns in scene under pressure with visible cost. Her past as an arsonist and her ancestral connection are summarized retrospectively without embodied choices that test commitment. The final "volcanic tenderness" момент lacks genuine internal conflict—she simply memorizes, with no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when adequately (Mira, Prague monastery archive, present day after three years off-grid). The dominant stake—rescuing ancestral memory technique—is signaled but never meaningfully tightened; she simply finds everything she needs without opposition or cost. The closure is a Charged Poise attempt (she will emerge as keeper of imperishable memory), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: no on-page sentence shows what she sacrifices or forecloses by choosing this path. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of clues → revelation), but the ending doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it merely promises future action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive setting supplies concrete details (limestone corridors, carved shelves, copper taste, textile fragments) and the tapestry fragment constrains her attention. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the environment doesn't force a consequential choice or alter tactics; Mira moves through it without resistance. The body and tools (her hands, the weaving pattern) are present but ornamental until the final beat, where memorization begins—a micro-setting function that slightly charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescue ancestral technique) is signaled early but never escalates through genuine opposition. Mira's journey is a treasure hunt without meaningful reversals; each clue leads smoothly to the next, and the archive holds "enough fragments to reconstruct the entire technique" with no visible scarcity or trade-off. The promised future conflict (emerging to preserve truth) is off-page. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with cost; she will "master what had been hidden" without dramatized friction or price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. falsification, memory as preservation, destruction/creation unity) emerges from particulars rather than direct statement. The "volcanic tenderness" motif recurs and the final image attempts resonance by unifying destruction and creation in her hands. However, the ending asserts rather than dramatizes this synthesis; Mira's internal arc (arsonist → keeper) is told as fait accompli without showing the genuine friction or ambiguity that would make the transformation earn weight. The promise of imperish­able memory remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries some specificity ("anachronistic paper fibers," "ultraviolet light," "molecular structure") that suits an analytically intuitive character. However, several phrases—"volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive mind," "genetic memory... like dormant seeds"—lean toward elevated, thesis-adjacent register that abstracts rather than embodies. The prose at peak moments (discovering her own face, understanding her purpose) tells emotional state rather than enacting it through perception and micro-choice. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs weaken propulsion: "The lending library arsonist had been... Mira Volkov wasn't proud... but each fire had been..." uses stacked past-perfects in adjacent sentences; "all depicted the same woman, all deliberately damaged" is synonym churn. "Volcanic tenderness" appears three times without evolving meaning. The final paragraph recycles "volcanic tenderness" and "promise" in a summary-like rhythm rather than concrete image. Stock metaphors ("dormant seeds," "lava cooling") and filter-verb stacks ("had been," "had understood," "had been leading") dull immediacy. Proofreading is clean, but information density sags under retrospective exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise—arsonist who burned forgeries to uncover ancestral memory technique—offers a non-obvious synthesis of detective procedural and heritage quest. The vandalized-portrait-as-map conceit is inventive. However, execution leans on familiar tropes: hidden archive beneath ancient monastery, protagonist discovers she's the prophesied descendant, the explanation-heavy final act that delivers all answers without cost. The twist that defacements were instructions rather than vandalism is clever but arrives late and is told rather than discovered through dramatized choice. Emotional beats follow a tidy arc (compulsion → understanding → mastery) that evades genuine ambiguity or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her past arson creates backstory pressure. However, her on-page choices are minimal: she examines fragments and begins memorizing. The key decisions (which libraries to burn, following the trail) occurred off-page. She observes and understands but does not face a consequential fork that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present after 0%, involved in one on-page beat (memorizing the pattern), but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to a choice she makes in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the opening third (her trembling fingers, her own face), recurs as she examines the archive's fragments, and is touched again in the final line ("She touched the faded tapestry fragment once more"). It shifts meaning from clue to instruction to symbol of unified destruction/creation. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains an object of contemplation rather than a tool that alters outcome. Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure lyric reprise) with charged specificity but no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced in paragraph three as backstory (Budapest library) and explained as a map under UV light. It seeds the trail mechanic but does not appear on-page as an object she handles or a choice she confronts in the archive scene. Its function is retrospective exposition rather than live pressure. Present in setup via summary, shapes the premise, but does not constrain middle action or closure. Swappable with "encoded manuscript" or similar without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is declared in paragraph two but never enacted on the page. We are told she "detected patterns others missed" in the past; in the archive she examines fragments and understands their meaning, but the mechanics of her dual-mode perception (analytical + intuitive) are not dramatized through a visible choice or tradeoff. Label-only use without cost or on-page constraint. Ornamental trait that supports backstory but does not enable or complicate present action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Portray" appears once: "Thread by thread, she began to portray the full image from the scattered fragments." The action is conflated with reconstruction/assembly rather than artistic creation. It drives one beat (revealing the molecular structure encoded in the weaving) but the verb itself is replaceable with "reconstruct" or "assemble." The broader act of decoding and memorizing carries more weight than this specific verb. Present in middle beat with causal role in one turn, but not indispensable as phrased.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The trail (fresco, mosaic, cave painting, UV-revealed map) is recounted in paragraphs three and four as completed backstory. It shapes Mira's arrival at the archive and proves she is the intended heir. However, the method itself is not enacted on-page; we do not see her decode a clue under pressure or choose between routes. It frames the premise and explains how she reached the archive (setup, development via summary) but does not appear in the closure beat. Functional but largely retrospective.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archive setting is anchored early (limestone corridors, carved shelves, copper air, textile fragments) and supplies the fragments Mira needs to reconstruct the technique. The environment enables her goal (discovery) and the spatial details (shelves, tapestry) recur in the final image. However, the archive does not resist or constrain—she has "all the time needed" and "enough fragments." It provides resources without friction. Present across all three gates (setup, middle examination, closure touch) and tied to the ending image, but lacks the pressure that would push it into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After going off the grid for three years" anchors backstory and implies fugitive status, but time does not tighten on-page decisions. Mira has "all the time needed to master" the technique; no clock pressure, deadline, or pursuit. The timeframe explains her arrival but does not constrain tactics or accelerate closure. Present in setup, mentioned in closure assertion, but vague and untracked in the middle. Swappable duration without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The promise—to rescue her ancestors' memory-preservation technique—is named repeatedly and frames the entire quest. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Mira's desire is univocal; no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of this commitment against another path (relationships, safety, moral ambiguity of her arson). The motivation shapes the premise and is present in the ending assertion, but friction between want and cost is absent. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears three times: paragraph five (examining fragments), paragraph seven (memorizing the pattern), and the final line (touching the tapestry). The phrase attempts to unify destruction and creation, but its meaning is static—each use asserts the same duality without modulation or cost. The tone does not shift under pressure or charge the closure through rhythm or cadence change; it remains a repeated label. Present across beats with thematic intent but lacks the specificity and evolution required for high integration.</comment>
