<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—her trembling from memory, the lie about the wrong bag that she immediately recognizes as pattern. The contradiction between her vow and her deeper knowledge drives the choice to climb and teach. Mira is less developed; her fistiness is asserted more than enacted in pressured micro-choices. The final bridge moment feels slightly neat given the brevity of their reconnection, but the cost of isolation versus transmission is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal undertones. The closure—Elara teaching Mira, mending the eyes together, explicitly letting the vow fall—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (transmission replaces isolation) with felt relational cost. Orientation is clean by the third paragraph. The "wrong bag" moment is a micro turn that reweights her stance. One meaningful deepening (realizing wisdom requires teaching) suffices at this length and the cost is legible in her choice to share the tools.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and specific, recurring across multiple beats and charging the final glow. The quartz eyes as suspended fruit constrain the mending work spatially. Micro-setting (the tools, the tuning fork's tone, the branches) enables and shapes the repair sequence. The cathedral transformation anchors who/where/when early and evolves with the mending, satisfying the constraint test for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the seeing stones—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elara chooses to climb and teach rather than refuse, foreclosing isolation as a path. Agency is clear (decision to mend and transmit), but the convenience of the "wrong bag" softens escalation slightly. The cost is present (abandoning her protective vow, defying the Council) but more relational than material. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom through transmission versus isolation—emerges from concrete actions (the mending, the ribbon, the tools passed on) without overt statement until the final exchange, which remains grounded in image. The deciduous-vows metaphor recurs purposefully, reweighted at closure. The orchard as organic growth amid rigid structures is specific and non-generic. The final image (tools humming, ready to be passed on) offers a resonant answer without moralizing, satisfying the non-literal closure test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; Elara's perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, crystal knowledge) is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Mira's directness contrasting Elara's measured reflection. The "deciduous vows" opener and "accidental wisdom" line carry slight authorial flourish but remain voice-plausible. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally at key beats. The prose rhythm varies with pressure, and quote mechanics are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in "her weathered hands trembling not from age but from memory" (slight overwriting) and the double explanation of the bag ("forgotten in her haste" then "I packed the wrong bag"). The "deciduous vows—like autumn leaves—were meant to fall" construction is slightly on-the-nose. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Information density is high and the final image is clean, but the mild figurative density in the opening and the convenience-reveal keep this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral fusion and quartz eyes as suspended fruit are specific and fresh. The deciduous-vows frame transforms a familiar reconciliation arc through the mending-guild world logic. The "accidental wisdom" thesis—that the forgotten bag reveals no accidents—risks being too neat, but the particulars (tears under a full moon, tuning fork, ribbon as bridge) ground it. Proximity to mentorship-reconciliation templates holds this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band; the emotional arc would survive with different setting details, per the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender is signaled in the title and opening, frames the entire conflict (restore the eyes), and drives the climactic choice to teach Mira the mending arts. Elara's occupation is causally active across all three beats: the vow, the climb, the mending lesson. The resolution depends on her specific skill set and her shift from isolation to transmission. Removing this exact role would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blue ribbon appears early (Elara touches it in her pocket, connecting it to her daughter), recurs in the middle as emotional anchor, and returns at closure when Mira ties it in her hair as a bridge symbol. Two distinct beats plus closure reprise. The ribbon reweights the generational link at the end, but its causal pressure is thematic rather than tactical—it does not constrain a choice or alter an outcome mechanically. Solid lyric-resonance use but shy of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Deciduous vows frame the opening and closing, shaping Elara's arc from rigid adherence to seasonal release. The concept constrains her initial stance (sworn never to return) and is explicitly reweighted at closure ("their deciduous vow...falling away"). It appears in three beats and charges the final image. However, the core plot—restore the eyes, teach Mira—would function with a different vow metaphor. The concept enriches rather than drives the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is labeled "endearingly feisty" and described with "knobby elbows and fierce determination," but these traits constrain only one visible action: her insistent urging that opens the conflict. Her hands-on-hips stance and defiant grin are gestural, not causal. The ribbon-tying at the end reflects inherited determination but does not create a tradeoff or cost. Present across beats but more atmospheric than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Persist is explicitly named at closure ("proof that some breaches could become doorways if one simply persisted") and demonstrated throughout: Mira's three-day pursuit, Elara's climb despite her vow, the patient mending work. The action redefines the breach-as-doorway option and charges the final image. Two beats (Mira's insistence, Elara's teaching) depend on persistence as method. Swapping to "endure" or "commit" would require tonal edits, but not full restructure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forgotten bag appears mid-story, contains the mending tools (tuning fork, tears, daughter's tools), and enables the climactic repair. Elara's recognition that "there were no accidents" reframes the convenience as pattern. The method is signaled, used on-page (applying tears, tuning crystals), and shapes two beats (discovery, mending). However, the bag arrives after setup and the "wrong bag" convenience softens causal tightness. Functional and closure-linked but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters is introduced early, recurs across all beats (the trees, the suspended eyes, the branches Elara climbs), and directly constrains the mending work—she must navigate the canopy to reach the eyes. The setting charges the final glow image and embodies the theme (growth through broken structures). The spatial challenge is dramatized and outcome-affecting. Removing this exact setting would require full reconfiguration of the repair sequence and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the breach of contract" anchors backstory (twenty years ago) and Mira's urgency (contract breached three days ago). It frames the opening conflict but does not tighten choices during the mending sequence—no live clock pressures Elara's work. The historical distance charges the theme but does not alter tactics on the page. Functional setup, minimal middle pressure, thematic closure accent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to bridge generational wisdom is dramatized through her decision to teach Mira, explicitly named ("She knew that wisdom isn't preserved through isolation but through teaching"), and tested against her protective vow. The motivation drives two key beats (the climb, the lesson) and resolves at closure with visible cost (defying the Council, releasing control). The friction between preservation-as-isolation and transmission-as-risk is enacted, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom is named at closure ("The best wisdom usually arrives by accident") and demonstrated through the "wrong bag" moment and the organic orchard metaphor. The tone remains wry and contemplative across beats, modulating gently rather than sharply. The final image (tools humming, ready) charges the theme. However, the tone is more thematic echo than pressured texture—it colors rather than constrains choices. Coherent and closure-linked but not indispensable to structure.</comment>
