<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior life is richly embodied through her painting ritual and mechanical movements, and the grandmother's cave discovery creates a meaningful reframing of her isolation. The final choice to continue both lives shows earned understanding. However, the epiphany arrives through convenient discovery rather than Marina's own contradictory impulses acting in scene—she absorbs wisdom passively. The "intimately aloof" attribute remains more told than demonstrated through on-page micro-choices with visible costs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early (recurring shells, painting ritual) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina gains the sanctuary and reweights her life's work without abandoning either practice. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. The cracked mirror trigger feels slightly convenient—it's declared prophetic in the grandmother's journal rather than earning its force through Marina's prior causality. Cost is present (the daily return to ghosthood) but the discovery sequence relies on coincidence more than protagonist agency to unlock the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal setting moves from mechanical familiarity (quay stones, ropes) to the phosphorescent cave network that charges the final image. The cave's natural shelves and blue-green light constrain Marina's new ritual and anchor the grandmother's hidden practice. Spatial choreography through the passages is clean and the cave functions as micro-setting that enables the closure choice. The quay detail is vivid but largely atmospheric in the opening; the cave does heavier causal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her artistic isolation and her grandmother's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens when Marina finds the shells and journal. The discovery deepens her understanding of "temporary eternities" and forecloses the path of simple quay repetition. However, the escalation is driven by passive discovery rather than Marina's tactical choices under pressure. The final decision to maintain both practices shows agency, but the turn itself arrives via coincidence (wrong turn, hidden cave) rather than protagonist-forced narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "loving something completely while letting it go" emerges organically from Marina's painting practice, the grandmother's hidden work, and the seashell motif that shifts meaning from tourist souvenir to sacred document. The final image (Marina's shell beside her grandmother's collection) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "Temporary eternities" as both infinite and fleeting is earned through concrete action. Minor demerit: "The art of loving something completely while letting it go" in the penultimate section borders on thematic echo, though it's filtered through Marina's realization rather than authorial declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable, intimate-distant, with perceptual signature rooted in Marina's painter's eye ("pearl-white spiraling into shadow," phosphorescent glow). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to the grandmother's journal without head-hopping. The prose texture is consistent and lyric. Small demerits: "both tender and distant, the way one might handle old love letters" leans slightly generic, and the grandmother's journal voice converges with Marina's narrator voice more than expected for a separate writer. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and information density is high in the cave sequence. Clarity and momentum are strong through the discovery. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "temporary eternities" / "infinite and fleeting" / "brief forever" cycle across paragraphs without added nuance, and "Each shell…" structures repeat. "Permanent in its impermanence" in the final section is a stock paradox that dulls the closure beat slightly. The opening's "spider-webbing" is vivid, but "carried the secret…like a shell holds the sound of the sea" is a mixed metaphor (shells don't literally hold sound). Apply −0.6 for loops and metaphor muddle touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist discovers ancestor's secret practice in hidden cave—is familiar, but the specific inflection (seashells as temporary eternities, the cracked mirror as inherited sign) offers freshness. The "intimately aloof" framing and Marina's doubled sanctuary show non-obvious synthesis. Risk is present in the quiet, lyric closure and the choice to honor impermanence rather than resolve all threads. However, the prophetic journal entry ("when her mirror cracks") and the cave discovery itself follow a template structure (hidden legacy revealed through convenient object) that limits originality. Transformation is present but not fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's choices—walking past her usual spot, entering the cave, beginning the new shell, committing to both practices—shape all major turns. Her observation of the quay life and the discovered shells leads to decisive action at closure. She is present in every beat and her decision to continue both lives forecloses the path of solitary quay painting with visible commitment. Early signal (paragraph one), multiple beats (quay routine, cave entry, painting the new shell, final dual-sanctuary decision), and closure linkage are all strong. Minor cap: her choices in the middle third are somewhat passive (following the path, discovering rather than seeking), but the final commitment is earned agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The seashell appears in paragraph one (tourist souvenir drying), recurs as hundreds in the cave with reweighted meaning (sacred documents of temporary eternity), and is handled in the closure beat (Marina paints a new one, places it beside her grandmother's). It moves from generic craft object to thematic anchor with visible ritual cost. The shell's properties (paint surface, drying time, shelf placement) constrain Marina's choices and charge the final image. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the story's logic depends on this exact medium). Slight reduction: the shell in paragraph one is setup but not causally active until the cave discovery; middle development is discovery-based rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named in the grandmother's journal and operationalized through the seashell practice: each shell captures a fleeting moment in permanent form, and Marina's life has been enacting this paradox unknowingly. The concept shapes the dominant stake (understanding impermanence as a practice) and the closure choice (continuing both rituals honors passing rather than preserving). However, it functions more as thematic lens than tactical constraint—it reweights meaning but doesn't alter Marina's options on the page in a concrete, high-pressure choice. The phrase "brief forever" and similar variants do conceptual work but remain somewhat abstract. Moderate causal pressure, strong closure linkage, but lacks the on-page cost-forcing specificity for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is declared by the fishermen ("ghost painter, always present but never quite there") and restated at closure ("being intimately aloof…the only way to love something you know will end"). It frames Marina's stance but remains more label than dramatized constraint. We see her mechanical distance and her tender handling of paints, but no on-page moment where this trait forces a visible tradeoff or enables a tactic with felt cost. The trait colors her character but does not drive a key turn. Present in setup and closure but lacks middle development with cost; swappable with "solitary" or "detached" without structural loss. Score accordingly: functional but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reveal—Marina finding the grandmother's painted shells and journal—is the story's central turn, reframing forty-three years of painting and the grandmother's disappearance as parallel practice rather than abandonment. It directly enables the closure choice (Marina embracing both sanctuaries). The reveal is prepared by the cracked mirror and wrong turn, occupies the story's center, and all subsequent action (reading the journal, painting the new shell, deciding to return daily) traces to it. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Slight reduction: the reveal is discovery-based rather than Marina forcing it through her own contradictory impulses, and the prophetic journal entry slightly diminishes earned surprise. Not easily swappable; the story's logic depends on this exact moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "wrong turn" leading to the hidden cove is signaled early (paragraph four) and its mechanics matter: Marina's departure from routine opens the path, the narrow track between cliffs is traversed, and the cave entrance frames the sea. The method enables the discovery that drives the entire second half and closure. However, it functions as coincidence-complication rather than protagonist-forced navigation—Marina follows her feet rather than making a choice under pressure. The means is present in setup and enables development/closure, but it could be replaced with another discovery mechanism (a fisherman's tip, a storm-driven detour) without deep structural loss. Moderate causal work, clear closure linkage, but not irreplaceable in its specifics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave network with phosphorescent walls, natural shelves, and connecting chambers provides the spatial structure for the grandmother's hidden archive and Marina's new ritual. The cave's specific properties—glow that casts "ethereal" light, shelves that hold decades of shells, passages worn smooth—directly enable the closure action (Marina painting and placing her shell). It contrasts with the familiar quay and charges the final image. Early signal (paragraphs 4–5), strong beat involvement (exploration, discovery, painting scene), and indispensable closure linkage. The setting constrains choices (Marina must navigate passages, the cave "remembers") and supplies the sanctuary that defines her dual life. Cannot be swapped for a generic hidden space without losing thematic and spatial specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mirror cracks" is signaled in the opening line and referenced in the grandmother's journal as a prophetic trigger. It frames the entire narrative and the journal's final entry ties back to this moment. However, the cracked mirror functions more as symbolic setup than active constraint—it doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics during the story. The narrative clock is loose (Marina's walk, cave exploration, painting unfold without urgency), and we don't feel time pressure shaping her choices. Present in setup and named at closure, but lacks middle development where the timeframe forces a visible cost or tactical shift. Functional but not causally active enough to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—to keep painting "the permanent things, even when they wash away"—is inherited from her grandmother's whispered promise and dramatized through her forty-three-year quay practice. The motivation is present in paragraph two, drives her daily routine, and is fulfilled at closure when Marina understands the promise's true meaning and commits to the cave sanctuary. Visible friction: her isolation versus her tender ritual, her ghosthood versus her devotion. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and is tested in the final choice to maintain both practices with their inherent costs. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Minor reduction: the motivation is somewhat passive (fulfilling an old promise) rather than arising from Marina's own conflicted wants in the present scene.</comment>
