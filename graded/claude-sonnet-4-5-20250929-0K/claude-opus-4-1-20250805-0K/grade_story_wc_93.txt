<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yann's interiority shows constraint through precognition ("trapped between knowing and doing"), but her emotional landscape relies heavily on summary and abstract philosophical framing rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The grandmother relationship remains told rather than dramatized in present micro-choices. Her final understanding feels declared ("She understood now why her gift felt like a curse") rather than earned through embodied struggle with visible cost. Internal arc exists but lacks the contradictory pressure and visible forfeit that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Keeper Yann, tidal bluff, aurora). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-laying deepens through stone placement, star dust scattering, and eel arrival, culminating in Yann beginning new patterns for her apprentice—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she accepts the covenant's continuation. The closure reweights her role from cursed herder to pattern-keeper with conceptual cost (decades of tending ahead). However, the cost remains asserted ("decades hence") rather than felt on the page through a specific forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora provides vivid sensory anchors ("borrowed dawn—neither true sunrise nor honest darkness") and the painted rocks constrain Yann's ritual action across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear through stone placement and eel emergence. The star dust pouch's warmth signals environmental response to the pattern. The final image of new stone-placing charges the setting with continuity. The aurora's descent and touch materially enable the eel revelation, linking environment to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding sacred patterns/grandmother's promise) is signaled early and tightens through stone placement → dust scattering → eel contact → revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lead eel floods Yann's mind with three-million-year history, reframing her curse as time-transparency and her role as covenant-keeper. Agency manifests in her choosing to place new stones for the next apprentice. The escalation reads under Accumulative lens as pattern completion forcing stance crystallization. Cost legibility is weakened: "decades hence" is asserted future burden rather than on-page forfeiture or visible price paid now.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (transition from friction to frictionless existence; guardianship through pattern-keeping) emerges through concrete images (eels as motion equations, star dust, fibonacci spirals). The grandmother's promise frames the thematic question and Yann's final stone-placing offers a non-literal answer about continuity and covenant. However, the piece edges into thematic echo territory: "The frictionless world wasn't broken—it was returning to its original state" and "she was seeing through time's new transparency" read as meta-commentary that states rather than enacts. The closing aurora acknowledgment ("pulsed once, acknowledging the covenant") over-articulates symbolic meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with lyric register ("borrowed dawn," "motion learned to live again") that suits the mythic premise. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters through Yann's precognitive lens. The piece teaches its pattern of poetic compression early and sustains it. Minor register drift occurs in exposition-heavy passages ("The frictionless world wasn't broken—it was returning to its original state") where diction becomes thesis-like rather than character-filtered, but voice recovers and the compression remains purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is generally high. Several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("she saw herself three heartbeats forward" / "The precognitive flash struck: she saw herself three heartbeats forward"), conceptual redundancy in the middle third explaining what the eels "really are" and what precognition means, and filter-verb stacks ("She saw... She saw... She understood now"). The exposition block explaining the frictionless world's true nature reads as scaffold that slows momentum. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]... She [verb]" patterns during key beats. Artifacts touch but don't obscure closure; routing −0.8 here per Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of frictionless physics, eel herding, fibonacci patterns, and precognitive curse offers specificity, but the core frame (mystical guardian tending ancient patterns to shepherd world-transition) follows familiar chosen-one/keeper templates. The grandmother's deathbed promise and Yann's solitary vigil hit recognizable beats. Emotional specificity is present in the precognitive doubling, and the "borrowed dawn" phrase shows fresh vocabulary. The transformation comes through the particular mechanics (painted rocks, star dust, time-transparency) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric mode but doesn't subvert or complicate the guardian archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Yann (elusive eel herder) drives all on-page action: arranging stones (first third), scattering dust (middle), receiving eel revelation (late middle), and placing new stones for her apprentice (closure). Her choices shape all beats and the ending. "Elusive" remains label-only; her physical elusiveness isn't dramatized. Three beats of causal involvement and closure linkage qualify her for mid-band; strong integration but the attribute "elusive" isn't leveraged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Star dust appears in three beats: pouch warmth at stone thirteen (setup), scattering across stones to connect the pattern and summon eels (middle turn), and as the medium that transmits the three-million-year vision (closure participation). Its properties (from impact site, responds to configuration, transmits images) are irreplaceable and drive escalation. Cost connection is indirect: the dust enables revelation but doesn't impose visible price. Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity push it into the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"A lingering promise" (grandmother's final promise) frames the story in paragraph three, drives Yann's stone-placing, structures the revelation ("This is what you promised to show me"), and is explicitly completed before Yann begins her own promise to the next apprentice. The concept shapes stakes (understanding what was promised) and the closure pivot (promise complete, new promise begun). It constrains her action throughout and the ending reweights it from received covenant to transmitted one. Setup, development across beats, closure reweighting, and causal pressure qualify it for the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Precognitively cursed" is established early ("trapped between knowing and doing," "living each moment twice"), enables the mid-story action (she sees herself scatter dust three heartbeats ahead), and is reframed at closure as time-transparency rather than curse. However, the trait is more backdrop than constraint: it doesn't force a visible tradeoff or foreclose an option. The reframing is told ("understood now why her gift felt like a curse") rather than costing her something on the page. Setup, modest middle use, thematic payoff, but limited causal pressure and no felt cost: mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Harness" appears in the late-middle revelation ("the herders... were meant to harness this knowledge when the time came") and implicitly in Yann's final stone-placing to enable the next herder. The concept shapes the thematic turn and her acceptance of the covenant, but the action itself is more conceptual than dramatized—she doesn't actively harness in a high-stakes choice; the knowledge flows to her. The element charges closure by framing her new role but isn't the decisive action. Closure linkage and conceptual cost present; modest causal pressure keeps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences is signaled early (paragraph four), enacted on-page as the primary action of the first half (thirteenth stone triggers response), and repeated at closure ("began placing new stones... creating the pattern her own apprentice would need"). The method's mechanics matter: fibonacci spiraling pulls at consciousness, star dust settles into grooves, aurora responds, eels match the spiral. It drives two major beats and defines the closure action. Setup, strong development, closure participation, and irreplaceability (sequence specificity matters) place it firmly in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is anchored in the opening line, provides spatial coherence for all action (stone placement at bluff edge, eels rising from water), and supplies sensory pressure (aurora's descent, borrowed light). The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image ("tidal bluff where friction went to die and motion learned to live again"). It doesn't constrain choice as strongly as force a decision, but it supplies the stage and symbolic resonance throughout. Setup, continuous presence, closure charge, and purposeful early–final reprise justify low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" is established in paragraph two ("Three years had passed since friction vanished"), provides world context for eel behavior and Yann's role, and implicitly frames the universe's return to frictionless state revealed at closure. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics—Yann's actions aren't time-pressured; the frictionless condition is backdrop rather than constraint. Setup and thematic linkage present, but no causal pressure or closure cost tied to the time element. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To understand sacred patterns" is declared early (grandmother's promise), drives the stone-placing action, is fulfilled in the eel revelation ("Not how to herd them, but what they really are"), and transforms into transmission of patterns to the next apprentice at closure. The desire shapes stakes and the ending pivot. However, it's more told than conflicted in on-page choices—Yann doesn't wrestle between competing wants or pay a visible price for understanding. Setup, development, closure participation, but modest friction between want and cost keeps it mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" is introduced in the opening line ("This borrowed dawn—neither true sunrise nor honest darkness—perfectly suited her work"), modulates through the story as aurora light charges the ritual, and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("As the borrowed dawn grew stronger, real sunrise approaching behind aurora's veil"). The tone is consistent, lyric, and mythic throughout, and the final aurora image ("settled back into its eternal dance") resolves the tonal register. The reprise reweights the opening metaphor with covenant fulfillment. Coherent modulation and charged final image place it in mid-6s; no tonal break under pressure.</comment>
