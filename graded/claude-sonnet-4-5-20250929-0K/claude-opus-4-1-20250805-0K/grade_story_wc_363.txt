<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is rendered concretely through physical action (stringing the bead, working the loom) and embodied cost (memories disappearing). The choice to sacrifice everything for her daughter is earned by the lineage of similar sacrifices and dramatized through the weaving itself. Internal contradiction appears when she understands why her mother tried to break the chain yet proceeds anyway. Minor deduction: the emotional progression through memory loss could be more granular—the "something precious disappeared" is somewhat abstract where specificity would heighten the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Mei, forgotten orchard, present-day search). The causal lens holds: puzzle → orchard → bead → loom → weaving → rescue confirmed by new bead. Closure lands on-page with felt cost (Mei unable to tell her own name, but child found). Deduction: the "authorities found Mei weeks later" compresses the rescue confirmation off-page when showing even a fragment of the daughter's return would make the cost/gain trade more visceral and immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bamboo forest encroaching on the orchard functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it "conquered the orchard for good reason," creating the isolation necessary for the weaving work. The amber bead, loom, and silence operate as micro-setting elements that constrain choice. The "raveling silence" is sensory and purposeful, pulling apart sound to enable transmission. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting directly shapes the final choice by providing the necessary isolation and ancestral workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue the daughter) is signaled early and sustained. The escalation tightens through causal pressure: photograph → police failure → ancient craft as last option → weaving → memory sacrifice → message received. Agency is clear: Mei chooses to weave despite understanding the cost her ancestors paid. The price is visible on-page (losing her own name, but clutching proof of success). One meaningful tightening through the weaving sequence narrows options to this single, terrible method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: each generation's sacrifice (childhood, mother's face, husband's touch) escalates to Mei's self. The amber bead's shifting function—from ancient messenger to new proof—avoids symbolic convenience by appearing early and evolving causally. The final image (Mei smiling, nameless, holding the new bead) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: some distances require total expenditure. The "raveling silence" operates as both mechanic and metaphor without becoming thesis. No thematic echo or label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Mei. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory attention to threads, light, texture. Distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the weaving sequence, slightly wider for historical context. The phrase "stoically sparkling" recurs as a descriptor but stays within narrative register. Minor issue: "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" in paragraph three briefly elevates into poetic register that feels more authorial than character-filtered, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance situation or deepen stakes. Rhythm varies appropriately—short bursts during the weaving, longer sentences for backstory. However, several filter-verb instances ("she understood," "she could feel it testing") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. "Stoically sparkling" appears three times, creating mild repetition. The phrase "raveling silence" and variants recur but serve pattern-building. Propulsion is strong overall, though the "weeks later" summary compresses what could be a tighter ending beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core premise—weaving messages into reality at the cost of memory—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, magic system, and sacrifice. The amber bead holding silk thread, which then becomes Mei's hair, creates material continuity that feels earned. The matrilineal chain of weavers gives specificity. However, the "messages through woven cloth" concept echoes familiar fantasy templates (word-magic, craft-as-power). The transformation lies in the specificity of cost and the trafficking premise, which grounds the fantastical in urgent realism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's choices create every major turn: following the puzzle, recognizing the bead's purpose, choosing to weave despite knowing the cost, and completing the message. Present in setup (discovery), development (stringing the bead, beginning to weave), and payoff (final weaving sequence and its result). Causal pressure is high—her decision to sacrifice memory drives the entire climax. Cost is visible (loses her name). Strongly integrated across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber bead appears in at least four distinct beats: discovery among pears, examination in light, stringing onto loom, and as the final thread source. It evolves from historical artifact to active tool to proof of completion (new bead formed from tears). The bead's thread is literally used at closure to weave the daughter's name. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met with strong causal and material specificity. High irreplaceability—the story's logic depends on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "raveling silence" shapes tactics and stakes: it "crept closer, hungry," tests memories, and enables transmission by pulling apart ordinary sound. Present in setup (paragraph three), development (choosing which memories to feed), and payoff (the "expanding quiet" during weaving). It constrains Mei's method and makes the cost mechanism visible. However, its mechanical operation could be more precisely dramatized—the silence is somewhat atmospheric where showing it actively "taking" specific memories would increase causal sharpness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" describes the amber bead three times across the story. It signals endurance and continuity but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost—it remains primarily descriptive. The trait matches the bead's role as witness and vessel, but the adjective itself does not alter tactics or choices. Present in setup and payoff, weak in development. Functional but largely ornamental; swapping to another descriptor would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears explicitly when Mei understands she must "recommence the work they'd started, picking up stitches dropped when the last spinner fled." This action frames the entire weaving sequence and the decision to sacrifice. Present in development (the moment of understanding) and payoff (the actual weaving), though not in setup. The concept of resuming ancestral work drives the major turn. Causal role is strong, though the term itself could be signaled slightly earlier for maximum integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle appears in the second paragraph, provides the map to the orchard, and carries the cryptic message "She weaves what cannot be spoken." This discovery method initiates the entire quest. Present in setup and drives the inciting action, but does not reappear in development or payoff—once it delivers Mei to the orchard, its mechanical role ends. The puzzle's mechanics (water-stained, incomplete) shape the search but not the weaving itself. Two-of-three gates; lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" is present in setup (discovery), development (understanding why bamboo conquered it—to hide the weaving site), and payoff (the closing image of thickening bamboo). The setting's isolation is necessary for the work and its concealment. The bamboo "held its breath" during weaving, acting as witness. The orchard's abandonment and bamboo encroachment directly enable the story's magical logic. Strong causal and atmospheric integration; the setting pressures secrecy and provides the workspace Mei needs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears once as a poetic frame in paragraph three. The phrase evokes temporal layering (ancestors, generations) but does not function as a legible clock or deadline. The "weeks later" at the end gestures at elapsed time but compresses rather than dramatizes duration. Time operates thematically (generational continuity) more than tactically. Present conceptually but not as a dramatic pressure that alters moves. Lyric resonance without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation—to send a message across impossible distance to rescue her daughter—is dramatized in setup (photograph, police failure), development (choosing to weave despite cost), and payoff (completing the message, receiving proof). The desire is embodied in every weaving action and memory sacrifice. Friction between want (save daughter) and cost (lose self) is the story's engine. High specificity: the daughter's name is the last thing woven. Indispensable—remove this motivation and the entire narrative collapses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" is described explicitly: "not sudden heroics, but the slow, deliberate surrendering of self for another's salvation." The tone is established in setup (generational history of sacrifice), sustained through development (memory testing, "precious disappeared"), and charged at closure (smiling but nameless). Modulates appropriately—quiet dread building to the weaving sequence's intensity. The tone integrates with the matrilineal pattern and makes the ending's cost legible. Coherent and purposeful throughout all three gates.</comment>
