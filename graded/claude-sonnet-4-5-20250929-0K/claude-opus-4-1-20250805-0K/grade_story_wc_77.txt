<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to understand Fear is signaled early and drives her return, but her internal contradiction—drawn by "repulsive allure" yet seeking mastery—remains largely asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The clasp's fusion to her skin and Cornelius as peripheral guide offer specificity, but the final epiphany ("You're afraid of being afraid") arrives as sudden articulation rather than emerging from prior struggle. The transformation of Fear from monster to child feels conceptually clean but lacks the visceral cost or renunciation that would anchor the change in her body and choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The closure—Mara tricking Fear into self-revelation and containing it in the clasp—constitutes a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (Fear becomes "manageable, almost beautiful"), but the mechanics of the trick rely heavily on the paradox reversal occurring off-stage in summary ("spoke the paradoxical notes in reverse order") rather than dramatized pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirrors project her death and she recognizes Fear's loneliness, but the final containment feels convenient: Cornelius's role as guide-victim is revealed late without prior friction, and the clasp's warming signals resolution rather than a trade-off Mara enacts through choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funhouse's bioluminescent mold, mirrors, and olfactory signature (sweet rot/ozone) create vivid sensory grounding that constrains Mara's movement and charges her choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats—entrance, interior mirrors, confrontation with Fear—and the abandoned carnival's seven-year decay provides a credible timeline anchor. The clasp as micro-setting (body-worn object) shifts meaning from cold/photographing fears to warm/photographing joys, directly shaping the closure image and earning the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and mastering Fear—is signaled early and drives Mara's return each night. One clear tightening occurs when the mirrors project her death and she realizes Fear was lonely, narrowing her approach to empathy rather than confrontation. However, escalation relies on exposition (Cornelius urging "tell it what it needs to hear") rather than Mara testing and failing tactics that force adaptation. The resolution hinges on her verbal epiphany rather than a physical or renunciatory act with visible cost; Fear's transformation reads as responsive to her insight rather than a trade-off she enacts by forfeiting safety or control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—fear of fear as recursive trap, loneliness within terror—emerges organically from the funhouse's cursed mirrors and Fear's child-form weeping. The clasp's shift from photographing fears to joys offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the final articulation ("fear of fear is just another mirror. Break it") verges on thematic statement rather than image-driven resonance, and the "repulsive allure" motif, while present, does not deepen or shift meaning across beats—it remains a static descriptor of Mara's draw to the funhouse rather than a charged recurrence that reweights the premise at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (the ozone-rot smell she "couldn't stop inhaling deeply," the clasp's ice-cold pulse) anchors voice in specificity. Cornelius exists cleanly in periphery without head-hopping. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("unbosom the secret," "flooded through her like formaldehyde") that reads slightly above the established texture but remains legible. The phrase "tell it what it needs to hear" in climax dialogue is functional but generic, lacking the idiomatic specificity that would distinguish Cornelius's voice under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing images anchor well ("mirrors still held their light" / "carnival stood silent behind her, finally allowed its rest"). However, minor loops appear: "fear itself" and "Fear" as entity are cycled without added nuance, and the "photographically cursed" motif is restated ("photographing her memories," "photographically cursed walls") in adjacent beats without pressure change. Figurative density is high ("voice like silk being pulled through broken glass," "formaldehyde") but one mixed metaphor—formaldehyde floods rather than illuminates—muddies the closure beat slightly. Propulsion remains steady; no major scaffolding or template cadence, but synonym churn on "fear" (Fear, terror, afraid) across the final third dulls precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—protagonist died, returned with peripheral advisor, confronts manifestation of Fear in abandoned carnival—synthesizes gothic funhouse, resuscitation haunting, and recursive-fear paradox into a coherent whole. The clasp as living object and Fear as weeping child offer fresh inflections on haunted-attraction material. However, the core turn (empathy breaks Fear's grip) follows a familiar emotional-insight-defeats-monster template without transformation through world logic or moral calculus unique to this piece. The paradoxical dream dictionary and reversal mechanic arrive late and resolve too cleanly, reducing friction at the peak choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cornelius whispers guidance at three beats (entrance, clasp, dream dictionary reversal) and his reveal as Fear's first victim reweights his role at closure. His advice enables Mara's tactics but does not force a trade-off; she follows his cues without friction or cost tied to his choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clasp appears in four beats: stolen pre-death, fused to skin, pulsing with fungal glow, warming and photographing joys at closure. Its cold-to-warm shift and image change directly shape the ending's charge, and its fusion constrains Mara's embodiment throughout. Removing it would collapse the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is mentioned twice (opening, funhouse interior) as atmospheric descriptor but does not narrow Mara's options or change her tactics. The bioluminescent mold provides setting texture; the luminance itself remains ornamental rather than a stake or constraint that Mara must navigate or exploit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "photographically cursed" mirrors capture terror on loop, projecting Mara's death at the climax to reveal Fear's loneliness—a causal turn. However, the trait is introduced mid-story without prior consequence, and Mara does not pay a visible cost to trigger or endure the projection; it activates conveniently when the plot requires insight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unbosom the secret that fear itself was keeping" is declared as goal in paragraph four but never dramatized as discrete action. The secret is revealed via mirror projection and Mara's realization rather than through a beat where she enacts unbosoming with cost. The verb could be replaced with "discover" or "understand" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dream dictionary appears in two beats: pulled from the ticket booth with paradoxical notes, then read backwards per Cornelius's instruction to trigger the funhouse shudder. Its mechanics matter (reversal as method), but it arrives late (past midpoint) and resolves the problem it did not help create, functioning as convenient key rather than constraint Mara navigates across attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funhouse is present in all major beats: entrance (warmth/luminance), interior (mold/mirrors), confrontation space (Fear manifesting), and exit (silent, allowed rest). Its bioluminescent decay and cursed mirrors supply sensory pressure and the projection mechanism that reveals Fear's loneliness. Removing the funhouse would collapse both setting texture and the causal infrastructure of the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "after resuscitation" timeframe is signaled early (died seven years ago, brought back, nightly returns since) and frames Mara's advisor relationship and clasp fusion. The timeline motivates her repeated draw and Cornelius's existence, but within the single-night action, elapsed time does not tighten tactics or impose a deadline; the night's arc proceeds without time pressure altering choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to trick Fear into revealing its weakness" is named in the summary but not dramatized as conflicted pursuit on the page. She follows Cornelius's cues (show clasp, read backwards, tell it what it needs) without visible friction between wanting mastery and risking empathy. The trick succeeds via epiphany rather than through a choice where she foregoes safety or control to bait Fear into vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is embodied early (gagging yet inhaling deeply, nightly returns despite death) and modulates across beats: initial fascination, rising dread as mirrors pulse, wonder at Fear's child-form. The tone charges the final image of containment ("almost beautiful") and persists in the closing line's "repulsive allure remained, but now she controlled it," reweighting the motif with cost and mastery in the ending.</comment>
