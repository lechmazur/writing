<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus exhibits clear motivation rooted in guilt, with contradictory impulses evident in his oscillation between scientific documentation and emotional evasion. The interior work is strong—"daringly methodical even then, following his sampling protocols while a life slipped under"—and the final choice to write "Mile marker zero" with no map feels earned by prior causality. Minor weakness: the bellows action feels somewhat illustrative rather than fully embodied under pressure. The therapy-speak phrase "raw solace" in the final paragraph edges toward diagnostic labeling but is framed as Marcus's own observation rather than narratorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marcus accepts forward motion without absolution, foregoing the obsessive mapping with visible cost ("he drew no map"). The causal lens holds cleanly—medication withdrawal sharpens perception, graffiti wisdom triggers reflection, and the final act of opening a fresh page without a map reconfigures his relationship to guilt. Orientation anchors quickly (Marcus at the station, three weeks post-medication). One tightening: the graffiti discovery narrows his understanding and leads to the symbolic act of drawing himself at the bridge, then releasing the ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused station and ivy are vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "pressed his palm against the crumbling brick, feeling how the vines had worked their fingers into every crack." The bathroom graffiti functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Marcus's epiphany. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The bellows and notebooks ground Marcus's physicality. The ivy returns at closure to charge the final image: "green overtaking gray, nature reclaiming what humans had abandoned." Minor gap: the train whistle feels slightly ornamental rather than integral to the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding permission to move forward from paralyzing guilt—is signaled early and tightens through the graffiti encounter. The escalation is accumulative: Marcus moves from passive chronicling to active self-representation on the wall, then to releasing the map ritual entirely. Agency is clear in the decision to write "Mile marker zero" and abandon cartographic absolution. Cost is visible: he forecloses the obsessive documentation path that has structured his identity for five years. No reversals required under the accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—forward motion as release, rivers as metaphor for carrying guilt without resolution—emerges from concrete images rather than statement. The final paragraph edges toward articulation ("the current that carries us forward is the same one that teaches us to let go") but the insight is earned by the prior graffiti encounter and ivy observation. The ivy-as-transformation motif reweights decay without forcing symbolism. Minor slip: "raw solace" in the final line risks naming the effect rather than letting the image do the work, though the preceding sentence ("green overtaking gray") anchors it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "The Chronicle of Living Waters, he'd called his work once, back when the pills made everything sound noble instead of obsessive." Diction remains character-bound throughout. One register slip: "as if by recording every detail of every river he could somehow make up for the one detail he'd missed" reads slightly more polished than Marcus's stressed interiority warrants. The graffiti dialogue feels organic. Distance control is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("His obsessive chronicling hadn't been about the rivers at all") leans toward helpful-narrator syndrome.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong figurative work: "guilt had worked into his bones," "layers of graffiti layered the walls like sediment." Two friction points lower the score: paraphrase loop between "The river knows what the bridge denies" and the later explanation of what it means; and template cadence in the final paragraph with repeated "he'd" constructions across adjacent lines. The final paragraph also contains mild overwriting: "raw solace" and the extended river-current explanation could compress. Information density is high elsewhere, and no artifacts touch the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—guilt-stricken scientist seeks absolution through obsessive documentation—is familiar, but the specific synthesis (river chronicling + bathroom graffiti wisdom + accordion bellows) creates fresh texture. The graffiti-as-catalyst and ivy-as-transformation earn credit for non-obvious angles. However, the core emotional arc (trauma survivor learns to move forward) follows a well-worn template, and the final insight about rivers teaching release feels somewhat inevitable rather than transformed. The accordion bellows remains underutilized as a distinctive element, mentioned but not integral to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus as truth-seeking river chronicler frames the story and his obsessive mapping drives early beats. His decision to stop mapping and write "Mile marker zero" constitutes a key turn at closure. However, the chronicler role is more retrospective context than active on-page pressure; the station visit does not involve river work. Present in setup and payoff, shapes one closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bellows appears in two beats: retrieval from the pack and the dust-wheeze moment against the wall, then packing away near the end. The "taped patches catching the light like scales" offers texture. But the object is more illustrative of Marcus's history than causally active; it does not constrain or enable his epiphany. Swappable with any field tool. Present across beats but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Map references are central throughout: Marcus's notebooks full of hand-drawn charts, the graffiti map on the wall, his decision to draw his own map of the bridge moment, and crucially the final choice to write "no map." The concept shapes both his obsessive tactics and the closure act of releasing cartographic control. Early signal, middle development (drawing himself on the wall), and payoff (first page with no map). Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is dramatized in the flashback: Marcus followed sampling protocols while the boy drowned. The trait constrains his response in the past with visible cost (paralysis during crisis). However, the attribute is more retrospective label than active pressure in the present-tense station visit. It flavors his character but does not enable or block a present choice. One beat, visible past cost, but not active in present escalation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Allude" governs Marcus's entire relationship to the accident: "Even now, he could only allude to it in his journals, never writing directly." The story dramatizes this evasion repeatedly, and the climactic moment is his choice to draw the bridge and himself explicitly on the wall, breaking the allusion pattern. The action shapes the key turn. Present in setup and middle, drives one major beat, causal role in the shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bathroom graffiti wisdom is signaled early, explored across multiple fragments ("The river knows what the bridge denies," the crude map, "The only way through is through," "Forgiveness is a river"), and directly triggers Marcus's breakthrough. The method is not merely decorative; each piece of graffiti reweights his understanding and leads to his own drawing act. Early signal, middle development, shapes the epiphany. Essential means to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy anchors the story from the opening line and supplies the bathroom where the graffiti encounter occurs. The ivy functions as both physical texture and thematic image, returning at closure to charge the final realization about decay transforming into life. The setting pressures the introspective turn by offering a liminal, abandoned space. Setup, middle (bathroom), payoff (ivy reprise). Drives two beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Three weeks since he'd stopped the medication" is stated early and explains Marcus's sharpened perceptions ("the world had edges again"). The timeframe frames his vulnerability but does not create urgency or tighten decisions on the page. It is context rather than active clock. Present in setup, colors perception, but does not alter tactics. One beat, functional but not escalatory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to find a path to self-forgiveness is dramatized through Marcus's obsessive chronicling, his inability to write directly about the accident, and his conflict between numbness and guilt. The graffiti encounter and his choice to draw himself at the bridge externalize the struggle. The final act of writing "Mile marker zero" without a map constitutes a choice shaped by this desire with visible cost (foregoing absolution-seeking). Early signal, middle friction, closure participation with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Raw solace emerges through the accumulation of images: decay-into-life (ivy), patient conquest, the station's transformation. Tone modulates from guilt-laden at the opening to tentatively hopeful at closure without false resolution. The phrase "raw solace" appears explicitly in the final paragraph, which risks naming the effect, but the preceding images earn it. Coherent through turns, charges the final image. Purposeful modulation supports closure.</comment>
