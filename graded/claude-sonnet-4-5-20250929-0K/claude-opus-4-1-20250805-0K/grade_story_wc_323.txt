<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but not tested under pressure; she teaches, observes, and reflects without making a single difficult choice that would reveal character under duress. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through wonder and acceptance without friction. The students and the Depth Dweller remain passive agents who receive instruction rather than apply pressure that forces micro-choices. Torres's "balancedly curious" question is label-only; no visible cost or tradeoff dramatizes the trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when established by the transit-tube opening). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discovery and image toward a final reconfiguration. However, no decisive change occurs on the page—Elara ends in the same stance she began, simply witnessing and planning tomorrow's lesson. The closing image ("depths that held stars") recapitulates the premise without reweighting it or imposing visible cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows a foreclosed path or felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The benthic city is vividly rendered with bioluminescent pearls, transparent corridors, crushing darkness, and pressure as embodied constraint. Sensory hierarchy matches POV (sonar, pressure gradients). The chain link is handled twice but remains ornamental—it resonates and serves as metaphor without altering a choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not constrain a closure choice or charge the final image beyond mood, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching navigation by starlight—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara faces no opposition, renunciation, or live trade-off. The lesson proceeds smoothly; the alien affirms rather than complicates. No reversal narrows options or deepens cost. The ending ("tomorrow, she would teach...") defers agency off the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should accumulate and reweight; here it plateaus in exposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of navigation-as-dimensional-convergence emerges organically from the chain link, starlight-through-water mechanics, and alien cosmology. "Depth and distance are illusions" offers conceptual resonance. However, the final paragraph ("somber marvel...settled into her bones like pressure") veers into abstraction and near-moralizing ("what it meant to find one's way") rather than trusting the image. The penultimate line "unfolding endlessly into depths that held stars" works better as a non-literal answer; the extra commentary dulls it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature shows professional bias (sonar, pressure, magnetic fields). Diction is mostly apt, though occasional reaches ("balancedly curious," "unfolded horizons" as verb phrase) feel prompt-imported rather than voice-organic. Dialogue is present and functional; Torres's question advances plot, the alien's lines carry subtext about dimensionality. Filter verbs ("watched," "thought") are used sparingly and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and legible with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph cuts. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (e.g., chain link description conveys both object and alien philosophy). Template cadence appears in the middle section: "They learned to read...to interpret...The chain link served..." runs of parallel infinitives without variation. Minor synonym churn: "somber marvel" recurs without reweighting. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "pressurized transit tube" into "bioluminescent pearls" into "crushing darkness"—the pearl metaphor clashes with industrial realism. No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—underwater city as lens for stellar navigation via dimensional folds—is conceptually ambitious and specific to this premise. However, the emotional arc and instructional frame are generic: wise teacher, awestruck students, benevolent alien guide. The transformation test fails: swap "navigation" for any skill and "starlight" for any knowledge system, and the beat sequence holds unchanged. Proximity check: "depths that held stars" echoes space-opera phrasing without transformation. The piece hedges risk by staging exposition rather than conflict.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat as focalizer and instructor. She activates the display, presses the chain link, guides exercises, and reflects at the window—but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role is conduit for information rather than agent under pressure. Setup and development are present; closure participation is observational only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The chain link is introduced early (paragraph 3), handled in paragraph 5 (pressed against display, harmonics revealed), and returns in Elara's hand during the closing reflection. Two functional beats, but neither narrows options or imposes cost. Its properties (star charts, magnetic/gravitational sensitivity) are described rather than leveraged in a choice. Lyric reprise is present but does not reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" appears as a phrase in paragraph 8 and is echoed thematically in the closing image ("horizons...unfolding endlessly"). It frames the conceptual stakes but does not constrain a tactic or reshape a choice on the page. The concept is illustrated through exposition (alien dialogue, lecture content) rather than dramatized pressure. Late signal (appears past midpoint as explicit phrase) and swappable with "expanded possibilities" or similar abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Torres is described as "balancedly curious despite his obvious apprehension" when he raises his hand. The trait is label-only; his question ("how can we learn...") shows ordinary student inquiry without visible tension between curiosity and caution. No on-page cost or tradeoff tied to the trait. Single ornamental mention; no development or closure link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expand" appears in Elara's announcement ("Today, we expand our understanding") and governs the lesson's structure: expanding from sonar/magnetic navigation to dimensional-edge geometry. The action shapes the middle beat (exercises, alien demonstration) and is echoed in the closing image ("expanding horizons"). However, no turn traces to the act of expansion itself—Elara could "introduce," "reveal," or "demonstrate" with identical effect. Functional across beats but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is defined in paragraph 4 ("angles where dimensional planes intersect") and visualized on the display. The method is explained and illustrated via the alien hologram but never attempted by a character in a way that succeeds, fails, or narrows options. Summary-only: "they learned to read the geometric edges" tells the outcome without dramatizing the mechanics. Setup and thematic closure echo present; middle development missing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The benthic city is established early (paragraph 1: three kilometers deep, domes on cliffs, transparent corridors) and remains present throughout via viewports, bioluminescent creatures, observation windows, and "crushing darkness" as embodied constraint. Pressure is mentioned twice as shaping navigation methods. The city frames all action and supplies the lens metaphor ("oceans as a lens, focusing starlight"). It does not alter a tactic in a key beat, but its properties (depth, pressure, isolation) enable the premise and charge the final image. Setup, development (implicit constraint), and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("six months ago when the Depth Dwellers emerged") is established in paragraph 2 and contextualizes the curriculum change. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The narrative spans a single lesson with no clock pressure; "tomorrow" is mentioned at the end, but future plans do not count as on-page constraint. Setup only; no middle or closure pressure from the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 4 ("expand our understanding") and paragraph 5 (students learning to "navigate by starlight"). It drives the lesson structure and Elara's reflection. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost, resistance, or alternative want complicates the pursuit. Told and illustrated but not dramatized under friction. Setup, development (exercises), and thematic closure echo present, but absence of on-page cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is named in paragraph 4 and recurs in paragraph 8 ("The somber marvel of it settled into her bones"). The tone is consistent across beats: awe tempered by weight, wonder without exuberance. Diction supports it ("eternal night," "crushing darkness," "settled...like pressure"). The tone modulates slightly—opening transit-tube descent carries foreboding, closing reflection leans toward quiet resolve—and charges the final image of infinite depths. Coherent and purposeful, though reliance on the named phrase twice risks telling over showing.</comment>
