<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete, character-particular perception ("death's language," monitoring frequencies "for decades"). The captain's journal evolution from "confident strokes to increasingly frantic calculations" dramatizes his arc off-page but Marina's present choices—photographing, writing her own note, deciding what to preserve—are purposeful and grounded in her established expertise. Internal contradiction appears subtly: she understands "preservation and release are the same motion" yet still seals artifacts in a specimen container, a micro-tension that enriches without resolving neatly. Minor slip: her transformation feels more articulated than earned by on-page pressure; the insight arrives through contemplation rather than a crucible choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (Marina, Pacific depth, post-Earhart discovery). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (transmission, snow globe recursion, journal equations) and the closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the final image of the snow globe "catching phantom currents" reweights the premise of loss as frequency shift with undeniable conceptual cost (the library will flood, but the transmission continues in Marina). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina writes her own note, transforming from receiver to transmitter. Cost is legible: she surfaces knowing the library will be reclaimed within hours, and her act of sealing the journal both preserves and releases, crystallizing the thematic paradox in a visible choice.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sunken library functions as micro-setting that constrains Marina's choices: the contracting air pocket creates a ticking clock, the desk and journal are untouched by specific quirks of pressure architecture, and the brass handles' verdigris signals seventy-three years underwater. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Marina's professional lens: "darkness thick as centuries," "verdigris," "phantom currents." The snow globe's miniature recursion and the library's impending flood charge the final image directly. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent, interior exploration, and ascent without floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding the captain's transmission and the "physics of letting go"—is signaled early and deepens when Marina discovers the journal and snow globe. One meaningful tightening: the air pocket contracts, forcing Marina to decide what to preserve and when to surface. Agency appears in her choice to write her own note and seal the artifacts, accepting that the library will flood. The cost is visible (the library reclaimed within hours) and felt (transformation from mystery-solver to transmitter). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and the cadence shift at closure, though the escalation is more contemplative than crucible-driven; Marina's renunciation of total preservation (she leaves the library to flood) forecloses the path of complete recovery.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the snow globe's infinite recursion, the captain's entropy equations, Marina's decades monitoring frequencies, and the contrast with Earhart's "corroded fuselage in museums." The final image—snow globe turning in phantom currents, ocean accepting her return "with the quiet recognition of a long correspondence finally, perfectly, understood"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the physics of letting go without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Marina's act of sealing the journal while knowing the library will flood, embodying the paradox that "preservation and release are the same motion." The piece resists tidy resolution: mystery persists ("another impossible transmission was already beginning"), and the thematic question reweights prior material (Earhart's diminished mythology versus the library's enduring frequency shift) with specificity and earned melancholy.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable and controlled; Marina's perceptual signature is consistent and profession-specific ("death's language," "the physics of things falling apart," "calculated" air pocket contraction). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching Marina's decades of specialized work: "verdigris," "entropy," "frequency shift," "sophisticated melancholy of understanding." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the snow globe discovery and opening during reflective beats. Minor slip: one phrase—"she, first name basis with endings"—reads slightly self-conscious, a narrator wink that breaks immersion momentarily, though it recovers quickly and the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple layers (character, atmosphere, theme). Figurative language is controlled and apt: "darkness thick as centuries," "spines like tombstones," "membrane between stories." Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, moderate overwriting appears in the final third: "the sophisticated melancholy of understanding that preservation and release are the same motion viewed from different angles" and "each tiny book a world, each world a gentle argument against forgetting" stack metaphors without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces briefly: "She broke the surface... the sky the color... the ocean accepting..." uses parallel "the [noun]" constructions across three beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly in peak beats, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of deep-sea archaeology, Morse transmission through impossible depth, snow globe recursion, and entropy equations offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The juxtaposition with Earhart's discovery—crowds at corroded metal versus Marina's solitary descent to a breathing library—provides fresh contrast. The captain's equations mapping entropy and the snow globe as "model universe" avoid generic symbolism through specificity. However, the "lost transmission from sunken vessel" and "wise protagonist decoding a predecessor's message" lean on familiar adventure-mystery templates; the story transforms them through Marina's professional lens and the thematic recursion, but the core armature remains recognizable. Proximity check: "membrane between stories" and "frequency shift" echo common metaphors for death and memory without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marina is introduced as someone who has "translated death's syntax through countless recoveries" and is "first name basis with endings." This trait enables her to interpret the captain's transmission and journal ("Death and I have become colleagues"), constrains her choices (she seals artifacts knowing the library will flood, embodying acceptance rather than total preservation), and charges the closure ("death had noted her visit in its ledger"). The attribute drives at least two beats (journal discovery, decision to surface and seal) and participates in the ending's conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The snow globe appears at the pivotal discovery beat, is handled and examined ("Marina lifted the snow globe carefully"), its infinite recursion informs Marina's understanding ("each sphere protecting something smaller"), and it is sealed in the specimen container, a choice that embodies the theme. It returns with reweighted meaning in the final image ("turned slowly... catching phantom currents, each tiny book a world"). The object's unique property (miniature library containing tinier snow globe ad infinitum) is irreplaceable and shapes Marina's realization. Removal would collapse the story's central metaphor and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The "last transmission" motivates Marina's entire descent (she's been "monitoring deep-sea frequencies for decades" and follows "coordinates from a transmission that should have been impossible"). It constrains her tactics (she must reach the library before the air pocket collapses), reappears in the captain's journal ("The transmission will find someone who understands"), and reweights at closure when Marina becomes the next transmitter ("another impossible transmission was already beginning"). The concept is indispensable: without it, Marina has no cause to descend and no thematic recursion at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Marina's "quietly analytic" nature manifests in concrete actions: she "noted the air pocket slowly contracting," "calculated" flood timing, recognized equations as "attempts to map entropy," and "began photographing the pages." This trait enables her methodical documentation and constrains her response (contemplation rather than panic), shaping at least two beats (journal examination, decision to write her own note) and charging the closure with her calm acceptance. The attribute is not merely labeled but embodied in her professional approach under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Marina writes her own note in the captain's journal: "Received and understood. The physics of letting go..." This action occurs late (final third) but transforms her role from receiver to transmitter, enabling the thematic recursion at closure. It drives one key turn (her acceptance and articulation of the lesson) and participates in the ending's conceptual weight. However, it is somewhat swappable—she could have simply surfaced with the journal—and the major turn (decision to seal and surface) does not hinge solely on the note-writing. Late appearance caps at 4.6 normally, but the transformation and closure linkage elevate; still, causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Untangling threads" appears literally when Marina untangles her guide rope for ascent: "Each loop she freed felt like solving an equation the captain had started." The method is signaled, handled on the page, and charged with metaphorical weight (solving the captain's equation about dissolution). However, it appears only in the final section and does not shape earlier attempts or constrain tactics; the untangling is more lyric reprise than mechanical necessity. Present in closure but not developed across beats; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The forgotten sunken library pressures every choice: the seventy-three-year submersion creates the air pocket's precarious architecture, the contracting air imposes a ticking clock, the desk and journal are untouched by specific preservation quirks, and the breach allows Marina's entry. The setting enables the discovery, constrains her time, and charges the closure (library flooding within hours). Removal would erase the story's stakes, tactics, and thematic container. The library is not merely backdrop but the crucible that makes transmission, preservation, and release materially urgent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The Earhart discovery timeframe anchors the opening and provides thematic contrast (Earhart's "corroded fuselage in museums" versus the library's breathing preservation). It signals recency ("three weeks after") and frames Marina's mission as part of a pattern ("another legendary disappearance solved"). However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the timeframe is context rather than constraint. Present in setup and thematically purposeful, but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Marina's desire "to understand the physics of letting go" drives her decades of monitoring, her interpretation of the captain's journal, and her choice to write her own note articulating that understanding. The motivation is dramatized in her actions (photographing, sealing, surfacing) and faces friction: she must accept the library's flooding, forgoing total preservation. It shapes at least two beats (journal discovery, decision to surface) and charges the closure when she becomes the transmitter of this understanding. Cost is visible (library reclaimed) and the desire is specific, not generic curiosity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sophisticated melancholy suffuses the prose: "another mystery surrendered to time's patient archaeology," "books... like tombstones marking thoughts that outlived their thinkers," "the quiet recognition of a long correspondence finally, perfectly, understood." Tone modulates with pressure (tightens during the air pocket contraction, breathes during the ascent) and charges the final image (sky "the color of old brass," ocean's acceptance). The tone is coherent across turns, integral to voice, and elevates the closure without becoming static or sentimental.</comment>
