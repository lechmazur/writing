<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thorne and Amara display clear motivations rooted in seventeen years of watching oppression and enforcing unjust laws. The choices feel consistent with their roles, though their internal contradictions remain largely abstract—we're told of Thorne's vigilance and Amara's conflict but see few embodied micro-choices under pressure. The dialogue carries subtext and the meeting feels earned, but emotional progression leans toward stock revolutionary sentiment rather than character-particular friction. The embodied cost at closure (separation without farewell, quiet certainty) reads as posture rather than visceral sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening lines. The piece establishes a pattern of coded resistance that deepens through the sundial mechanics and Amara's entrance, culminating in a charged poise: the revolution is lit, roles are set, and Thorne returns to his post carrying quiet certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when Amara confirms the blackout was intentional, reweighting Thorne's prior surveillance into active rebellion. Cost is legible—Amara risks her rank, Thorne his safety—but felt more as conceptual repricing than visceral forfeiture in the final image. The closure reconfigures prior watchfulness into nascent fire, satisfying RR/CR under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fort's sandstone, bronze surfaces, and half-painted sundial constrain the signal method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: courtyard, sundial center, towers visible. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and tactical necessity, narrowing the window for coded placement. Sensory detail—bronze reflecting twilight, lamps flickering back—grounds the scene without catalog padding. The quill holder's hollow base and sundial angles serve as micro-setting anchors that enable the silent revolution's mechanics, pushing this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ignite a silent revolution without violence. The blackout creates urgency, and Thorne's placement of the quill holder at the sundial is the single decisive on-page action that narrows options and commits the network. Amara's entrance provides a reversal—she engineered the blackout—which deepens pressure and confirms shared risk. One meaningful tightening is present: the signal is set, watchers will read angles at dawn, and "a thousand small rebellions" will cascade. Cost is conceptual and deferred (the Chancellor suspects nothing *yet*), but the final separation and return to posts forecloses retreat with visible, if quiet, price. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "cradle of sparks" concept: revolution via accumulated small acts rather than grand violence. The sundial's coded angles, the quill holder's engravings, and bronze reflections function as motifs that reweight prior watchfulness into orchestrated defiance. Subtext operates in Amara's hand on her sword pommel and the "winking hush" signature. The final image—"tend its quiet fire until it consumed an empire"—risks overt statement but earns resonance through prior particulars. The piece resists moralizing in favor of operational specificity, though "death by a thousand paper cuts" borders on thematic echo. No prompt-language intrusion in the final paragraph; theme remains implicit enough to avoid the thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited on Thorne, with stable distance and controlled focalization. Perceptual signature is present: seventeen years of watching shapes his recognition of coded angles and his practiced silence. Dialogue between Thorne and Amara carries subtext ("The blackout was your doing" as recognition, not question) and advances plot without exposition. Diction remains consistent—formal but not stilted, befitting a sentinel. Psychic distance tightens during the quill-holder placement and widens slightly for Amara's entrance. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and internal voice stays coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is moderate: many sentences do double duty (bronze surface reflects walls *and* holds engravings). However, template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "Thorne moved... Thorne placed... Thorne stood... Thorne and Amara separated" across adjacent paragraphs, plus near-duplicate constructions for interiority ("knew better," "knew the truth"). Several stock metaphors: "pulse through veins like blood," "ripple outward, unstoppable as dawn," "consumed an empire." These patterns dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure image ("quiet fire" is serviceable but generic). Apply baseline −0.6 for template runs and stock phrasing, with an additional −0.3 for touching closure. No egregious clarity breaks, but propulsion sags under repeated stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The silent-revolution premise (coded signals, accumulated small rebellions) is familiar but given operational specificity through sundial angles, quill-holder placement, and the blackout as cover. The "cradle of sparks" metaphor and "winking hush" signature add texture, though neither feels indispensable to the arc. Emotional truth centers on weariness with tyranny rather than quirky detail. The transformation test is marginal: swap fort for palace, sundial for mosaic, and the arc holds with minimal edits. One fresh inflection: Amara's revelation that she caused the blackout reweights Thorne's solitary vigilance into coordinated defiance. No close echoes of famous lines, but the piece leans on stock revolutionary tropes (whispers, shadows, quiet fire) without bold subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thorne (vigilant lock sentinel) is present throughout and makes the key choice to place the quill holder at the sundial, aligning it with painted angles to signal the network. His seventeen years of watching enable recognition of the sundial's code and his practiced silence allows him to move undetected during the blackout. His decision to proceed despite risk and his final return to his post with "quiet certainty" bracket the arc. The role shapes two beats (placement, conversation with Amara) and drives the closure image. However, his vigilance is largely observational setup; the decisive spark comes from Amara's blackout and the sundial's pre-existing code. Causal pressure is shared rather than singular.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in four beats: opening (captured fire reflection, engravings), interior explanation (hollow base holds "cradle of sparks" concept), placement at sundial (alignment with painted angles), and final retrieval ("tucked beneath his cloak," will rest "innocently on his desk"). Its hollow base and engravings enable the signal method, and its dual nature (decorative desk object / revolutionary key) charges the arc. Removing it would require a replacement object for the signal mechanics. It participates in closure ("its true purpose... would ripple outward") but does not constrain the final separation or emotional stance. Strong integration across beats and ending, but not indispensable to the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" is introduced early as the concept inside the quill holder's hollow base: "a method of igniting change without violence." It recurs at closure ("The cradle of sparks had been lit"). However, it functions as thematic label rather than tactical constraint—the actual mechanics are the sundial angles and blackout cover. The concept echoes theme (accumulated small rebellions) but does not shape a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Swappable with "spark of resistance" or similar metaphor. Ornamental more than operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is attributed to the painter who encoded the sundial: "the painter had been calmly inventive, encoding messages in the angles." It explains the sundial's design but does not constrain an on-page action by Thorne or Amara. The trait is told in summary about an absent character and does not alter present tactics or cost. Label-only mention without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intrigue" appears in "This was how they would intrigue their way to freedom" and shapes the revolution's method: coded signals, selective blindness, misfiled documents. It informs Thorne's placement of the quill holder (a covert signal rather than overt action) and Amara's engineered blackout. The action is present in two beats (placement, conversation) and frames the closure image (quiet fire consuming an empire). However, it overlaps heavily with the sundial mechanics and silent-revolution concept; removing "intrigue" as a named method would not break the arc if the coded-angle mechanic remained. Functional but somewhat swappable with "coordinate" or "orchestrate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sundial's coded angles are introduced early ("encoding messages in the angles between painted and unpainted sections"), explained with specific correspondences (thirty degrees = eastern tower, forty-five = scribes' quarters, sixty = mess hall), and used in the key beat when Thorne aligns the quill holder with the painted angles to set the signal. The mechanics shape tactics (placement must occur during the blackout, angles will be read at dawn) and enable the revolution's coordination. The method is causally active in two beats (explanation, placement) and participates in closure ("by dawn, the sundial's coded angles would be read"). Removing it would require a replacement signaling system. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight frames the opening image (bronze reflecting sandstone walls "like captured fire") and returns in the closing beat ("tomorrow's twilight would illuminate a very different fort"). The courtyard, sundial, and towers provide spatial grounding, and the fort's administrative wing houses the lamp-lighters under interrogation, creating external pressure. Twilight as timeframe adds urgency (fading light, approaching darkness) and charges the bronze reflections that will signal at dawn. The setting constrains movement (Thorne's practiced silence, every stone's position) and supplies resources (the sundial, the blackout's cover). Strong setup and payoff with causal role in two beats, but the setting does not force a specific tactical trade-off with visible cost at closure. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced early ("unexplained blackout that had plunged the inner citadel into darkness") and creates the tactical window for Thorne's signal placement. Amara's revelation that she caused it adds a reversal and confirms coordination. The timeframe tightens decisions: Thorne must place the quill holder before power returns, and lamps are "beginning to flicker back to life" as he completes the task. The blackout shapes two beats (Thorne's covert movement, Amara's entrance) and the closure references "three hours" until the holder rests innocently on his desk. Time pressure is legible and affects tactics, though the exact duration and countdown are not tracked beat-by-beat. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to spark a silent revolution is stated early ("revolution would begin not with swords or shouting, but with whispers") and motivates Thorne's seventeen years of observation and Amara's blackout. The motivation is dramatized in two choices: Thorne's placement of the quill holder despite risk, and Amara's confession that she engineered the blackout. The final image ("tend its quiet fire until it consumed an empire") reiterates the goal. However, internal friction between want and cost is muted—both characters are aligned and confident, with no on-page doubt or competing desire. The revolution's stakes (Chancellor's paranoia, fear in people's eyes) are told more than felt in present action. Functional across beats but lacks visceral tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is named as "the movement's signature" when Thorne doesn't flinch at Amara's approach. The tone coheres through covert movement, coded signals, and the final separation "without farewell." Quiet confidence and restrained menace thread the arc. However, "winking" implies playful complicity that isn't strongly embodied in the prose—most beats lean serious and operatic ("consumed an empire," "pulse through veins like blood"). The tone modulates slightly (Amara's "lips curved slightly") but does not sharpen under pressure at closure. Present and coherent but static; does not charge the final image with distinct tonal weight.</comment>
