<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coachman remains observational rather than decisively choosing under pressure; his work is presented as already understood ritual rather than discovery with cost. Internal contradiction is absent—he moves through his task with settled purpose and no competing impulses. The final paragraph's "his work here was done" and "the promise that from its bones would rise something beautiful enough to make forgetting a mercy" edges toward therapeutic epiphany language without embodied struggle. Backstory dominates via exposition about plague seasons, grandmother's songs, and months of observation, but these reflections do not pivot a present micro-choice that alters his approach on this night.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory layering, dead-language invocations, and the gulls-as-translator conceit, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the final image reweights war/garden into a cycle of digestion and forgetting. Cost is conceptual—erasure as mercy—and felt in "no one would remember why anyone had thought this shore worth killing for," though the coachman himself pays no visible price and makes no on-page choice that forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seeds begin splitting in the closing paragraph, shifting from intention to irreversible process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jetty, twilight harbor, wild roses, and shrapnel-laden soil are vividly rendered and filtered through the coachman's professional lens (death-carts, plague seasons). The mirrored water creating "narrow vastness" and the gulls' phosphorus-nutrient observations ground the ritual in sensory specificity. The seed pods constrain his method—he must match plant to toxicity—and the final image charges when "roots reaching down toward the reef's calcium embrace" unites setting with closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the jetty, shore, and return path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—letting the garden consume the battlefield—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates texturally (density of language, invocation cadence) rather than through reversal or tightening choice. No on-page obstacle tests the coachman's resolve; he kneels, plants, and departs without friction. The seeds splitting at the end provides a micro-turn from intention to inevitability, but the coachman's agency is completion of a predetermined ritual rather than a decision that narrows options. Cost is projected (decades of forgetting) rather than paid on this page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—nature's digestion of violence into beauty, war transmuted into fertile soil—emerges from concrete images (heart-vine breaking fortifications, forget-me-spite) and the dead-language conceit without overt thesis statement. The recurring phrase "submerged concord" and the gulls' ancient tongue create a coherent symbolic layer. The final image offers a non-literal answer: forgetting as mercy, erasure as kindness, delivered through the seeds' split rather than declaration. Minor slip: "make forgetting a mercy" in the penultimate paragraph risks stating the theme aloud, though it remains image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains controlled. Voice carries distinct elevated diction ("narrow vastness," "viciously fertile," "green chaos") that fits a ritual speaker with archaic knowledge. However, register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction—"the submerged concord between species" and "promise of green chaos" read as authorial framing rather than the coachman's lived idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (gull-call translation, Akkadian labels) but the coachman's interiority reads more as mythic narrator than embodied individual under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"twilight bled," "liquid fertilizer," "choir of the extinct," "calcium embrace"—without pattern-teaching or pressure variance, triggering overwriting penalty. Mixed metaphor: "garden would eat the battlefield whole" personifies the garden as predator while seeds are passive agents, muddling vehicle logic. Template cadence surfaces in the penultimate paragraph: "Within a season... Within a year... Within a decade" is rhythmically purposeful but mechanically parallel. Paraphrase loop: "speak new life into being" (graf 9) restates "whisper Etruscan growth-songs" (graf 6) without added pressure. No severe loops, but density and occasional register drift lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead reef → nutrient cycle → language extinction → garden reclamation offers a fresh thematic braid. The coachman-as-translator and gulls-as-linguistic intermediaries provide a non-obvious angle on post-war regeneration. However, the "nature reclaims battlefield" premise is widely used; transformation here relies on the language conceit and the specific plant choices (heart-vine, forget-me-spite). The piece commits fully to its elevated, elegiac register. Risk-taking in density and lyric mode heightens stakes, though the coachman's passivity and lack of on-page friction limit boldness in character choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coachman frames all action and thought; he observes, translates gull calls, and plants seeds across three beats (arrival, prayer/planting, departure). His choice to fertilize is pre-scene; on the page he executes rather than decides. Setup clear, middle development via planting, closure participation via his final reflection and the seeds' split. Two gates met; causal pressure weak (no cost paid, no option foreclosed). Swappability moderate—another ritual figure could perform similar work. Band guidance suggests ~5.0–6.0; lift slightly for beat involvement and closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in graf 2 (labeled in Akkadian, rattle), graf 6 (withdrawn: heart-vine, memorial grass, forget-me-spite), and graf 8 (scattered). Setup, middle use, closure presence all met. The pods constrain method—he must match aggressive plants to metal/shrapnel—and the final beat shows seeds splitting, lending causal pressure. Specificity is moderate (plant names are invented but purposeful). Swappability low for the seed-selection logic, moderate for the satchel itself. Three gates plus modest causal role suggest ~6.0–6.5 range; cost connection weak (no tradeoff shown).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is named once in graf 4 and echoed in the final paragraph ("the submerged concord held"). Setup occurs mid-story; no middle development beat uses it to shape tactics. Closure reprise reweights the theme abstractly but does not alter the coachman's choice. The concept reads as thematic label rather than stakes-driver—swap "symbiotic restoration" and the plot holds. Lyric resonance weak; early seed not present. Two gates missing; primarily ornamental use. Cap at ~4.9; functional mention lifts slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dead languages appear throughout: Akkadian labels (graf 2), Sumerian prayer (graf 4), Etruscan growth-songs (graf 6), and the final "languages the dying had taught him" (graf 9). Setup, development (enables the planting ritual), closure participation (the translation logic persists to the end). The trait constrains method—he must use specific tongues—but no on-page cost or tradeoff is shown (he never fails, hesitates, or sacrifices to access the knowledge). Three gates met; causal pressure modest. Irreplaceability moderate (mythic gardener could use other ritual). Band ~5.0–6.0; beat involvement across three paragraphs lifts within range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fertilize" is the coachman's stated purpose (graf 3), executed in graf 6 (pressing pods into soil), and the seeds' germination in the closing paragraph completes the action. Setup, middle execution, closure participation all clear. The action is irreplaceable—swap "bless" or "commemorate" and the narrative's ecological premise collapses. Causal pressure strong: fertilization initiates the garden's takeover. Cost is projected (battlefield erasure) rather than paid on this page. Three gates, two beats, closure linkage, high specificity suggest ~7.0–7.5; lack of on-page price for the coachman himself prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Understanding bird calls is introduced in graf 4 ("patterns he had learned to read"), developed in graf 5 (gulls "answered in their ancient tongue, telling him where the earth hungered most"), and repeated in graf 7 ("gulls' calls shifting pitch... spoke of phosphorus"). Setup, middle use (shapes planting locations), closure echo (graf 9 mentions "bats clicking... owls announcing" continuing the translation frame). Three gates met. The method enables tactics—he places seeds where gulls indicate nutrients—providing causal pressure. Swappability low (direct soil-testing would flatten the mythic register). Cost absent. Band ~6.5–7.0; specificity and beat involvement lift within range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The jetty is anchored in graf 1 (twilight, harbor, wild roses, rotting planks), constrains action in graf 4 (mirrored water as setting for the prayer), and returns in graf 8 ("scattered the remaining pods across the jetty's broken planks"). Twilight appears in the title and graf 1; "blooming" seeds the closure image. Setup, middle use (the jetty's decay and reflection shape the ritual's tone), closure charge (planks as substrate for the first splits). Three gates, causal contribution (rotting planks = fertile substrate), closure linkage. Irreplaceability moderate (another ruin site could serve). Band ~6.8–7.3; micro-setting charge in final image lifts score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" frames the entire story (graf 2: "Three years had passed since the reef died") and recurs in graf 7 (phosphorus from "the reef's skeleton") and the final paragraph ("the dead reef one last gift"). Setup clear, middle reference provides nutrient logic, closure participation via "from its bones would rise something beautiful." The timeframe tightens urgency modestly—three years establishes ecological lag—but does not create a live clock that alters the coachman's moves on this night. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development weak. Causal role: enables the nutrient cycle but does not force immediate choice. Band ~5.5–6.2; thematic recurrence and closure linkage lift within range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is stated in graf 3 ("fertilize what remained"), dramatized in graf 6 (planting aggressive species), and affirmed in the final image (seeds splitting, vines to strangle gun emplacements). Setup, middle action, closure participation all present. Three gates met. However, the desire is told and executed without friction—no competing want, no cost paid, no renunciation. The coachman never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices. Causal pressure moderate: the motivation drives his actions but faces no test. Band ~5.8–6.6; three gates and beat involvement lift score, but absence of conflict or visible tradeoff caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" appears in graf 4 ("creating a narrow vastness that seemed to extend both up and down into infinity") and is echoed in graf 9 ("the narrow vastness between life and death"). The tone—compressed grandeur, elegiac weight—is stable across the piece and modulates subtly from arrival (purple twilight) to closure (star-watching, dissolution). Setup mid-story, closure reprise reweights the coachman's vocation. Two gates met; lyric resonance present. The tone charges the final image by framing forgetting as expansive rather than diminishing. Coherence high; modulation modest. Band ~6.5–7.0; charged reprise and thematic fit lift within range.</comment>
