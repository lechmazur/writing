<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her observational lens is character-specific, filtering the atrium through audiological and emotional-tracking expertise. However, the final breakthrough—understanding the memory theft—arrives through hearing-aid pulses rather than a dramatized on-page choice that closes off other paths. Interiority is vivid ("copper on her tongue") but the climactic realization feels more delivered than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "hadn't meant to be a hero" refrain reads as gentle authorial positioning rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors WHO (Mara Chen, contact tracer), WHERE (botanical atrium), and WHEN (twilight, three days after the Silence) within the first two paragraphs. The piece follows a causal lens: pulses guide → photograph warms/fades → Mara decodes the pattern → she runs to Willowbrook basement, and the final line reports that "seventeen hearts remembered how to speak," a decisive change with implied rescue. However, the cost of this closure is told retrospectively ("the mist began to lift") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or confrontation on the page, and the basement arrival is elided entirely, weakening the felt price at the resolution beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is rendered with layered sensory detail—amber light fragments, copper taste, orchids leaning away—that grounds Mara's movements and reflects her audiological focus. The photograph functions as a micro-setting object: it warms, faces fade, Mrs. Valdez's eyes track Mara, creating tactile pressure that narrows her search. Spatial choreography (atrium → green shadow caves → running into the night) is clear and the environment's moisture and twilight filter choices without becoming a postcard. The basement location is named but not entered, so the final constraint remains conceptual rather than physically dramatized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seventeen catatonic residents whose voices are stolen—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph's faces begin to fade, raising the urgency. Mara's agency is primarily observational: she follows pulses, interprets the photograph, and decodes the pattern, then runs toward the source. The story delivers one meaningful pressure point (the fading photograph) that narrows options under the causal lens, and the resolution reports a rescue with implied cost ("refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear"). However, the climactic basement confrontation is elided entirely, so the escalation's final turn and the visible price paid remain off-page, capping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—protection of vulnerable voices, the currency of final words, incidental heroism born from curiosity—emerges organically from Mara's profession and the harvesting premise. The photograph's fading faces and the "Happy Birthday" dirge carry symbolic weight without overt statement, and the closing image ("seventeen hearts remembered how to speak") offers a resonant answer to the central question of retrieval and witness. The "reeling hush of forgetting" phrase and the refrain about incidental heroism verge on thesis-statement clarity but remain anchored in Mara's specific choice to run toward the basement. Minor slip: "incidental heroism" is nearly articulated as a theme statement in the penultimate paragraph, reducing ambiguity slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and precise, filtering all sensory detail through Mara's audiological expertise ("copper on her tongue—the flavor of electrical interference"). Diction is elevated but consistent with a technical-professional narrator under supernatural pressure ("syncopated beat," "dirge," "telegraph of terror"). The hearing-aid voice ("They're taking our words") and Mara's whispered reply show clean dialogue mechanics with subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: the phrase "she'd learned that twilight was when the dead called loudest" in the opening leans slightly expository, but it establishes voice and stakes efficiently at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, pairing long atmospheric builds ("The mist curled through the glass atrium like breath through broken teeth") with short declarative beats ("She ran"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, two minor loops appear: "she'd been an audiologist, persistently curious" is followed immediately by "why some patients heard things others couldn't, when she'd discovered," creating a brief paraphrase stutter. The final paragraph's "refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear into the reeling hush of forgetting" stacks near-synonyms ("disappear," "forgetting," "hush") in a way that dilutes clarity at a high-stakes beat. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, and the closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for emotional contagions using a grandmother's hearing aid to track stolen memories—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative thriller and elegiac care-home horror. Specific details (syncopated "Happy Birthday" in a minor key, fading photograph faces, copper-taste interference) ground the concept in concrete sensation rather than generic mysticism. However, the "memory harvesting" antagonist and the audiologist-detective frame echo established urban-fantasy and care-facility-horror templates without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation. The incidental-heroism frame is signaled twice in similar phrasing, reducing ingenuity slightly. Solid originality within familiar genre territory, but not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as contact tracer for hearts is signaled early and shapes her interpretive lens (tracking emotional contagions, reading pulses). Her decision to follow the hearing-aid signal and run to Willowbrook drives the middle and ending beats. However, the climactic choice—decoding the theft and running to the basement—feels more like following a breadcrumb trail than a difficult fork with visible cost, limiting the causal weight of the character role itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photograph appears early, is handled physically (pulled from pocket, grows warm), and returns with escalating urgency as faces fade and Mrs. Valdez's eyes track Mara. It functions in at least three beats: initial description, mid-scene warming/fading, and the closing line reports faces returning as Mara runs. The object's changing state (fading → returning) directly alters Mara's understanding and tactics, and it charges the closure by literalizing the retrieval of stolen selves. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Incidental heroism is articulated twice on the page ("hadn't meant to be a hero," "heroism was incidental") as a thematic claim, but it does not constrain a major choice or create visible friction between wants and costs. Mara's curiosity leads her to act, but the story does not stage a moment where she chooses heroism reluctantly or pays a price for it; the concept remains more label than dramatized stake. Present and thematically coherent, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is named early and motivates Mara's original discovery of grief contagions, but on the page it functions more as backstory explanation than a trait that constrains a present choice under pressure. The decision to follow the pulses and decode the pattern reads as professional competence rather than curiosity creating a tradeoff or cost. The trait is mentioned but does not drive a beat where curiosity conflicts with caution or safety.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mara assures the dead ("I can help you… you need to show me what happened"), and this dialogue beat is followed by the hearing-aid shriek and the "Happy Birthday" dirge that guides her understanding. However, the assurance itself does not create a major turn; the pulses shift in response, but Mara's role as listener and decoder remains constant. The action is present and functional but could be replaced with another investigative prompt (asking, demanding, listening silently) without rewriting the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The decades-old hearing aid is introduced in the second paragraph, its mechanics explained (circuits attuned to frequencies modern tech ignores), and it delivers pulses, the SOS rhythm, and the "Happy Birthday" dirge across multiple beats. Mara follows these faint signals to decode the theft and locate the basement, so the method shapes both her tactics and the closure. The device is handled concretely (adjusted against her ear, crackles, shrieks, pulses) and its unique properties matter. Solid integration across setup, middle pressure, and ending, though the grandmother backstory is brief and could be deepened.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is rendered with layered detail (glass ceiling, amber light, orchids, green shadow caves, copper taste) and anchors the entire investigation sequence. The environment's windless air and thickening mist create atmosphere and Mara moves through it spatially (past orchids, deeper into caves, then out into the night), so the setting shapes her path and the closure's physical trajectory. However, the atrium does not impose a hard constraint (e.g., a locked door, a time limit tied to twilight ending) that alters her tactics under pressure; it remains more stage than active pressure agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Twilight is named as "when the dead called loudest," and the opening anchors the investigation in that window. However, the passage of time within the scene is vague (no clock, no urgency tied to twilight ending), and the closing "falling night" is mentioned but does not tighten decisions. The timeframe provides atmospheric coherence but does not function as a live constraint that forces choices or escalates cost. Present and logically consistent, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire to protect vulnerable voices is stated early (hired to trace grief outbreaks, prevent neighborhoods from falling silent) and the seventeen catatonic residents embody that stake throughout. The motivation drives her interpretive work and her decision to run to Willowbrook. However, the story does not dramatize a moment where this desire conflicts with a competing want (safety, doubt, exhaustion) or costs her something visible on the page; the closing triumph reports success without showing a tradeoff. The motivation is coherent and present across beats but lacks on-page friction or felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the penultimate paragraph as a phrase describing the forgetting Mara resists. Tone throughout is elegiac and hushed—mist, twilight, paper-thin voices, suspended gold—and the quiet intensifies as Mara moves deeper into the atrium. The final line's gentle lift ("the mist began to lift… seventeen hearts remembered how to speak") modulates the hush without breaking it entirely. The tone is coherent and supports the concept, but "reeling hush" as a specific phrase arrives late and does not recur or charge the closure image directly; it functions more as a one-time descriptor than a tonal motif that evolves across the arc.</comment>
