<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation—to harmonize the factions—is clear and drives her plan, but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than contradictory or embodied. The "trembling" moment labels recognition without showing conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's wisdom and the surveyor's-chain lineage provide backstory texture, but the final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Minor: no other characters appear on the page, so relationship dynamics cannot be evaluated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Mara's goal (repair floodgates, harmonize factions) and advances through her discovery of the dual-resin envelope, her mapping of new floodgate positions, and the leaving of carved plans—a coherent causal chain. Closure reads as Charged Poise: she departs with dappled resolve, the floodgates poised to teach interdependence; the cost is implicit (her anonymity, the risk of failure) but the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is prompt (name, amphitheater, volcanic basin by the opening lines). The inferred lens is Causal with lyric-accumulative texture; the ending holds under that lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "begins to tremble" and crystallizes her plan, narrowing options from general repair to specific choreography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's "breathing" via thermal expansion anchors the setting vividly and recurs across the story, charging the final exhalation. The surveyor's chain and the dual-resin envelope function as tactile, purpose-driven details that constrain her method. Spatial choreography is clean (amphitheater center, carved stones, night departure). The volcanic basin and dormant volcano provide thematic resonance—power held without destroying—but remain largely atmospheric rather than forcing a micro-choice. The chain and the amphitheater's stones both constrain her plan and charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling the factions via floodgate design—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mara moves from observation (discovering the dual-resin envelope) to agency (mapping new positions, embedding collaboration requirements). The plan itself narrows options: she commits to anonymity and indirect persuasion, foreclosing direct mediation. However, the escalation reads more as incremental execution than a reversal or deepening choice that tests her commitment under fire. The cost (her invisibility, the risk of rejection) is named but not viscerally felt on the page at the moment of decision. No antagonist appears to complicate her move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—interdependence, encrypted compassion, love masked as pragmatism—emerges organically from the floodgate choreography and the amphitheater's breathing metaphor. The final image ("The water would remember what the people had forgotten: how to flow together") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The surveyor's-chain lineage and the grandmother's wisdom ground the theme in specific particulars. Minor slip: "encrypted compassion" and "slyly heartfelt" occasionally read as prompt labels rather than fully dramatized insight, and the final paragraph's water-memory line edges toward thematic summary, though the image itself carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dappled resolve," "star-drunk night"), though occasionally elevated in ways that slightly exceed a machinist's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices thermal expansion, adhesive resins, and flow patterns. The "slyly heartfelt" voice is established and held. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext cannot be judged. Minor: a few phrases ("encrypted compassions," "the building breathing through centuries") read as thematic declaration rather than embedded perception, creating slight distance drift at those beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns accumulate: repeated "She'd" openers in early paragraphs, synonym churn around "breathing/exhale/inhale," and template cadence in the planning sequence ("She began to tremble… She carved… She designed…"). The phrase "encrypted compassion" and its variants ("encrypted compassions") appear multiple times without added pressure. "Slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" read as ornamental rather than scene-driven. The closure beat ("The floodgates would open in new patterns soon. The water would remember…") is clear and propulsive, but the accumulation of figurative language in the final two paragraphs ("star-drunk night," "dappled resolve") slightly obscures immediacy. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and synonym loops; escalate to −1.0 for ornamental phrase recurrence in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of floodgate engineering and generational surveyor lineage offers a specific synthesis, and the "encrypted compassion" frame provides a non-obvious moral calculus. The amphitheater-as-mediator and the dual-resin discovery are fresh inflections. However, the core premise—engineer devises technical solution to social conflict, hiding care inside mechanism—echoes familiar reconciliation templates. The transformation occurs through the surveyor's-chain particularity and the volcanic-patience metaphor, lifting the piece above pure derivative work. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric tone and indirect closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band lift (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as floodgate machinist is signaled early and shapes her method (understanding flow, designing dual-operator gates). Her genius for "understanding flow—not just of water, but of unspoken needs" drives the middle turn when she maps new floodgate positions. The final image references the floodgates opening in new patterns, linking her profession to closure. However, the "ingenious" quality reads more as competence than a specific clever leap under pressure; the plan unfolds as careful choreography rather than a surprising technical insight. Present across all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure reference) and tied to causal pressure, but swappable with "hydraulic engineer" or "water-systems designer" without major structural loss. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.5, minus swappability −0.6, minus ornamental "genius" label −0.3 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain is introduced early ("Mara unwound her great-grandmother's surveyor's chain") and used twice: once to stretch across the amphitheater center for mapping, and again at the end when she kisses and coils it. It carries thematic weight (four generations of women who "measured not just land, but the distances between hearts") and charges the closure image. The chain constrains her method—she uses it to map floodgate positions—and its lineage informs her indirect approach. However, its second use (kissing, coiling) is ritualistic rather than causally active. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, minus late-beat passivity −0.5, minus lyric reprise without mid-scene cost −0.6 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept "encrypted compassion" is named explicitly ("This was encrypted compassion: hiding care inside apparent strategy") and shapes Mara's tactic of designing floodgates that appear neutral while embedding reconciliation. It informs the dual-resin envelope discovery and the two-operator requirement. However, the phrase appears as thematic label rather than dramatized pressure; it describes her approach but does not narrow options in a scene where she must choose between open or hidden care. The concept is present in setup and middle development, and echoes in the closure note sealed with mixed resin, but its causal role is more atmospheric than decisive. Score: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.4, minus label-only use −0.7, minus swappability (could be "covert kindness") −0.5, minus summary-only −0.4 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "slyly heartfelt" is introduced via the grandmother's teaching ("this slyly heartfelt approach") and colors Mara's method. It describes her indirect, care-masked-as-pragmatism stance and appears in the grandmother's lesson. However, it functions primarily as a label rather than constraining an on-page action with visible cost. No scene shows Mara choosing "slyly heartfelt" over "openly compassionate" with a trade-off. The attribute is consistent with her plan but does not force a decision or narrow tactics. Score: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, thematic alignment +0.3, minus label-only −0.7, minus no visible trade-off −0.6, minus late first appearance (second half) −0.3 = ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mara's trembling marks the moment her plan crystallizes: "She began to tremble as her plan crystallized. Not from fear, but from recognizing the solution's elegant cruelty and kindness intertwined." This beat signals the shift from observation to decision and narrows her options to the specific floodgate choreography. The action is causally active and emotionally charged. However, it is a single internal beat rather than a repeated or escalating action; the trembling does not recur or shape the closure image. Swappability test: replacing "tremble" with "pause" or "freeze" would slightly dilute the visceral quality but not break the turn. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage (indirect) +0.3, specificity +0.4, minus single-use −0.4, minus minor swappability −0.3 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The method "analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope" is signaled in the discovery beat ("analyzing the leftover adhesive… revealed two types of tree resin") and informs her insight that someone had tried to bind both worlds. This discovery shapes her plan to use dual-operator gates and mixed-resin seals. The method is specific and irreplaceable (no other clue provides the same dual-symbol insight). However, it appears once in the middle and does not recur or constrain the closure beat; the final note is sealed with mixed resin, but the analysis itself is not revisited. Score: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.6, minus no closure participation −0.8, minus summary-only use −0.4 = ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is established early ("amphitheater's stone lungs expanded with the morning heat") and recurs throughout: Mara presses her palm against the wall, stretches the surveyor's chain across its center, carves calculations into its stones, and feels its final exhalation as she leaves. The setting's "breathing" rhythm provides the story's temporal frame and metaphorical spine. The amphitheater's history (five hundred years of debates, now crumbling) pressures her to act, and its stones become the medium for her plan. The final image ("The amphitheater exhaled one last time as she left") charges the closure. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, irreplaceability +0.6, minus no explicit constraint on a choice (she uses it rather than being limited by it) −0.3 = ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the building breathes" structures the story: "morning heat," "evening shadows," "night deepened," "Tomorrow, she'd propose." The amphitheater's thermal breathing provides a rhythm that tracks Mara's progress from observation to departure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or force a deadline; Mara's choices unfold at a contemplative pace without a live clock that alters tactics. The breathing metaphor is vivid and consistent but functions more as atmosphere than pressure. Score: early signal +0.5, recurs across beats +0.9, thematic alignment +0.5, closure linkage +0.4, minus no urgency or deadline −1.0, minus no choice altered by time −0.6 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to harmonize conflicting values" is dramatized through her floodgate plan: balancing the elders' sacred pools and the youth's irrigation, embedding both harvest festivals and moon ceremonies into maintenance schedules. The motivation is signaled early ("She'd come here to repair more than floodgates") and drives her middle turn (mapping new positions) and closure (leaving the note sealed with mixed resin). However, the motivation is stated more than tested; no scene shows her torn between appeasing one faction or risking failure. The friction is between factions, not within Mara herself. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, minus told more than shown −0.7, minus no internal friction −0.6, minus no visible cost tied to the desire −0.5 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone "dappled resolve" is named in the final paragraph ("carrying her dappled resolve into the star-drunk night") and reflects the story's texture: patient, oblique, blending light and shadow, care and strategy. The amphitheater's breathing, the dual-resin discovery, and the grandmother's lesson all contribute to this tone. The tone is coherent through turns and modulates subtly from observation (morning) to decision (trembling) to departure (night). However, "dappled resolve" appears as a label rather than emerging purely from rhythm and image; the phrase is asserted rather than felt. Score: coherent throughout +0.8, modulates with pressure +0.6, charges final image +0.7, specificity +0.4, minus label-only in final beat −0.7, minus minor ornamental quality −0.3 = ~6.1.</comment>
