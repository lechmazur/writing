<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior work is strong: her physical grounding (palm against salt crystal, coffee grounds ritual) and the hollow-face memory gap create genuine internal contradiction. The choice at the grave—to return most vials but keep one—shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (the desire to forget vs. the need to remember) and forecloses the path of total reclamation with visible cost. Minor slip: the "courage to remember" final beat edges toward therapeutic framing, but the embodied choice sequence holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina's decision to bury most memories again, keeping only one vial, forecloses total recovery with felt cost visible in "some memories deserved their burial, but others could be exhumed gently." The accumulative lens (coffee grounds → salt formations → vials → final lantern-bending) holds through a single meaningful deepening when she digs and discovers the memory cache. Cost is legible: she accepts ongoing grief management rather than full restoration. Orientation anchors (Marina, docks, three days post-whale) arrive within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber, coffee grounds, and cemetery function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the translucent coffin's discovery drives the pivot, and the gravity pockets physically embody the weight of extracted grief. The final image—flames bending toward cemetery and whale—charges closure by making the city's architecture of forgetting visible. Spatial choreography (docks → chamber → cemetery → grave) tracks cleanly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where deleted memories go) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Marina digs and discovers the vials. The choice at the grave—keep one, bury the rest—narrows options with visible cost: she forgoes total restoration and accepts managed grief. Agency is renunciation with on-page price. The whale's causal role (revealing fluctuations rather than causing them) reweights the city's system and deepens pressure without requiring a second reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (the weight and persistence of grief, the price of forgetting) emerges through concrete particulars: vials as compressed sorrow, gravity pockets as literal accumulated mass, the whale drawn by "forgotten sorrows." The final image—lanterns bending toward hidden graves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: memory and grief cannot vanish, only relocate, and recognition is the first step toward integration. The pressed wildflowers function as a charged motif without token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: Marina notices flame angles, coffee-ground spirals, gravity-pocket nausea—sensory cues filtered through her lantern-lighter expertise. Psychic distance remains stable; the narrative certainty about city founders' memory extraction reads as Marina's inference from physical evidence rather than omniscient intrusion. Diction stays grounded ("salt crystal coffin," "electromagnetic fields that leaked") without register drift. No dialogue present; interior voice is clean and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances plot, character, or atmospheric pressure (e.g., "the gravity pockets fluctuated mysteriously there, strong enough to make visitors nauseous, weak enough that cremated ashes sometimes drifted upward like snow" does triple duty). Rhythm modulates well between reflection and discovery beats. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line ("tomorrow's coffee grounds would show new patterns, and Marina would read them with eyes that remembered how to grieve") recharges the coffee-ground motif without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravity pockets as literalized repositories of extracted grief, coffee grounds as diagnostic tool, the whale as drawn mass—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The piece transforms the "forgotten memory" trope by grounding it in physics (gravity, electromagnetic fields, salt crystallization) and giving it civic-scale infrastructure. Risk-taking in the metaphysics (memories as mass, grief as gravitational weight) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The moral calculus (Marina's past self chose extraction; present Marina chooses partial reclamation) avoids binary resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina as lantern lighter is causally active: her occupation gives her the observational skill to notice flame angles and gravity anomalies first, frames her daily coffee ritual as diagnostic tool, and her route (docks → chamber → cemetery) follows her professional geography. The role shapes two key beats (noticing the pattern, navigating the docks) and her expertise charges the final image (lighting lanterns that bend toward the graves). Irreplaceable: a different occupation would not provide the flame/pattern observation that seeds the investigation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: pocket discovery with neighbor testimony, recognition in the vial (Marina teaching Elena), and final pairing ("tucking it beside its pressed twin"). The object bridges Marina's hollow memory and the recovered vial, providing physical proof of Elena's existence and a tactile anchor for the choice to keep one memory. The "resonated with" moment reweights their meaning from mere keepsake to twin-proof of extraction. Strong integration, though the flowers enable rather than constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gravity pockets shape every major beat: the whale's beaching disrupts them (inciting event), fluctuations guide Marina to the cemetery, the pockets' nausea-inducing strength signals memory-cache locations, and the final image depends on flames bending through altered gravity fields. The concept provides the story's physics and metaphysics: memories have mass, extraction creates gravitational debt, and the whale is drawn by accumulated sorrow-weight. The pockets constrain Marina's investigation (she must follow their patterns) and charge closure (she now "felt them respond to her presence differently"). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" governs the investigation: flames bending sideways, coffee grounds swirling in impossible patterns, and cemetery nausea all stem from unpredictable gravity shifts that Marina must decode. The attribute constrains her method (she cannot predict fluctuations, only read their traces) and enables the discovery (the whale's impact amplifies fluctuations enough to reveal the hidden system). The mystery is resolved with cost: Marina learns the city's founders weaponized these fluctuations for memory extraction. The attribute is causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exhumation is the story's hinge: Marina's digging discovers the salt coffin and vials, provides the key reversal (memories were extracted, not simply lost), and forces the climactic choice (break all vials or selective reclamation). The action redefines options from "find where memories go" to "decide whether to reclaim them." Without this exact action, the memory cache remains hidden and no choice is possible. The ease of digging ("the gravity pocket here remembered being disturbed before") adds causal texture and implies prior extraction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear in two diagnostic beats: morning spiral matching salt formations (discovery) and final paragraph promise of "new patterns" (closure charge). The method bridges domestic ritual and investigative tool, signals Marina's pattern-reading skill early, and the grounds' electromagnetic sensitivity provides plausible mechanics for detecting memory caches. The method shapes her approach (passive observation rather than active search) and charges the ending. Solid integration, though the grounds guide rather than constrain the exhumation itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber appears early ("Marina pressed her palm against the salt crystal chamber's wall, watching formations spiral upward") and its spiral formations match the coffee grounds, providing the first causal link. The chamber's translucent salt reappears at the grave as the coffin material, creating a purposeful callback. The setting supplies the story's visual/tactile signature (crystallized salt as memory container) and participates in closure when Marina understands salt's role in preservation. Strong setup and payoff, though the chamber itself does not constrain the cemetery choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The three-day timeframe anchors the inciting event (whale beaching) and implies urgency: the disruption is recent and ongoing, forcing Marina's investigation now. The timeframe shapes her pattern-reading ("this morning's coffee grounds") and suggests the city's founders' system has operated for much longer, giving scale to the discovery. The whale's presence as a ticking environmental problem (gravity instability) pressures the investigation. The frame tightens decisions and participates in closure logic (the whale revealed what was always hidden).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation ("to find where deleted memories go") is dramatized through every choice: studying coffee grounds, traveling to the cemetery, digging despite uncertainty, and the climactic decision at the vials. The motivation carries internal friction: she wants to know, but the knowledge forces a painful choice about whether to reclaim grief. The final cost—accepting that "some memories deserved their burial"—directly addresses the driving question with visible sacrifice (she keeps only one vial, not all). The motivation is inseparable from the story's emotional and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" modulates coherently: the salt crystal chamber's quiet, the cemetery's muted gravity, and "in the gleaming silence, Marina understood the choice her past self had made." The tone charges key turns (discovery, realization, renunciation) without becoming static, and the final image ("they sleep in salt and earth, waiting in gleaming silence for the courage to remember") reprises the phrase to reweight buried grief as patient rather than erased. The tone integrates luminous imagery (gleaming) with restraint (silence) to support the story's accumulative, meditative pressure.</comment>
