<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's interior exhibits contradiction between precision/memory and suppressed creativity, with embodied grief (charcoal under nails, chest cracking open). The move from reproduction to spontaneous creation is motivated by six months of loss stripping defenses. Maya functions primarily as absent catalyst rather than on-page pressure, which limits relationship-as-crucible depth. The final choice—drawing without remembering—lands with visible cost (work she can't recall) but the epiphany moment ("understood now why") edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens dominant: grief → cave journey → discovery → spontaneous creation. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra produces work outside her mental gallery, breaking the precision/memory lock with visible cost (she can't perfectly recall the creation). The broken lock motif pays off structurally: "permission to break the combination." Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. One tightening: the shift from observing to creating on stone narrows her former safety and forecloses the reproduction path with on-page evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cave setting actively constrains movement (narrowing passages) and supplies materials (crystal surface, moisture) that enable the climactic drawing. Sensory hierarchy filters through grief and artistic perception (cadmium yellow on purple, crystals humming). Spatial choreography tracks descent, discovery, creation, ascent without floating. The crystal surface itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final act: drawing directly on stone rather than sketchbook. Minor: "aurora of colors" at dawn generic rather than cave-specific reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking suppressed creativity—signaled early via broken lock and sister's note. One meaningful tightening: setting down sketchbook to draw on stone forecloses reproduction safety with visible cost (unprecedented work outside perfect recall). Agency clear in renunciation of memory-based method. Pressure accumulates through discovery sequence but the cave journey lacks a complicating reversal; each beat affirms rather than tests her readiness. Cost legible: she creates something she cannot control or catalog.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—art as release versus capture—emerges through sister's paintings and cave transformation rather than statement, though "Stop hiding behind memory. Create." borders on thesis. The broken lock evolves from literal object to metaphor for creative constraint with earned specificity. Final image (unprecedented work, dawn greeting) offers non-literal answer. Weakness: "rectify the imbalance between memory and imagination" in the penultimate paragraph explicitly states the thematic calculus rather than trusting the cave-drawing scene to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV stable; third-limited filtered through Lyra's artistic perception (colors have sounds, crystals hum). Perceptual signature clear: charcoal-stained fingers read stone like braille, cadmium yellow on purple registers immediately. Diction wobbles once: "rectify the imbalance" elevates into abstraction during peak emotional beat when embodied language would serve better. Filter verbs controlled. No dialogue to evaluate. Internal voice coherent under grief pressure with specific idiom (mental galleries, encoding into neural pathways).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density high; cave descent interleaves discovery and memory. Two paraphrase loops: "charcoal dust... permanent, like grief" restated as "charcoal would never leave her fingers" without added pressure; "understood now" followed by explanatory restatement of lock metaphor. Template cadence in middle: "The passage opened... There, propped... Lyra approached... Behind it, a second painting..." runs four consecutive subject-verb-object frames. Figurative language mostly clear but "geode's heart" and "cathedral of stone" stock. Micro-movements track without puppet-master excess. Opening and closing images anchor well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Core premise—artist unblocking through posthumous sister's guidance—reads familiar (grief-as-catalyst, hidden artwork pilgrimage). Transformation present: memory-as-gift reframed as cage, broken lock as liberation device, crystals that hum supplying synesthetic specificity. The cave itself and charcoal/crystal interaction offer textural freshness. Risk-averse middle: discovery sequence unfolds without setback or doubt, each painting affirming thesis. The sister's dual paintings teaching opposed lessons (color escaping page, "Stop hiding") feel constructed to deliver message rather than emergent from Maya's lived artistic struggle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra present throughout; choices drive descent (following pull), sketchbook set-down, and spontaneous drawing. "Charcoal-fingered" concretized through nails, stone-tracing, final creation. Mnemonically gifted trait (Q9 D) channels through her but the portrait-sketch specificity underused—she draws faces from memory but doesn't sketch one on-page. Decision to draw on stone rather than paper shapes closure. Mid-band: present and active but "portrait sketch artist" specialty doesn't constrain the cave-drawing beat; any visual artist could make that turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Broken lock introduced early (paragraph one), reappears in Maya's note explanation, and conceptually reprised at closure: "broken lock remained in the cave, its purpose complete." Three-of-four-dials detail (7-1-9 birthday) adds specificity. Metaphor payoff: "permission to break the combination that had kept Lyra's true creativity sealed." Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Cap shy of 8.5: the lock itself isn't handled in the cave scene; Lyra doesn't physically leave it there—narrative tells us it remained, weakening final tactile presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Inescapable callings" implicit in grief's pull, sister's posthumous guidance, and creative drive Lyra "could no longer ignore." Concept frames journey and final release but doesn't create on-page friction or tactical cost; Lyra doesn't resist or weigh competing obligations. The calling feels affirmed rather than wrestled. Present in setup (pull she follows) and payoff (releasing what could be) but middle development lacks a beat where the calling demands sacrifice or complicates another need.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mnemonically gifted concretized: "encoding life into permanent neural pathways," "every face... lived complete in mind's galleries," perfect recall as cage. Trait enables her reproduction art and constraints her creativity—tradeoff clear. Payoff: final work exists "outside her mental galleries, free from the museum of her perfect memory." Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure image. Mid-band: the gift doesn't alter a tactical choice during the cave sequence; it's backdrop for thematic shift rather than active story pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears once in the penultimate paragraph: "ready to rectify the imbalance between memory and imagination." Action = correct/rebalance creative mode. Payoff present but late (final third) and told rather than enacted—she's described as ready to rectify, not shown rectifying on-page. The cave drawing itself could embody rectification but the text labels it post-action rather than during. Swappable: "transform," "heal," "embrace" would work with minor edits. Concept-relevant but mechanically inserted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: sister's "final painting remained hidden... in these caves." Development: painting discovered propped against quartz, then second painting behind it with direct message. Method mechanics matter: the behind-painting reveal delivers Maya's instruction and reframes the journey. Payoff: "Gathering the paintings, Lyra began her ascent"—physical objects and their hidden structure drive closure choice. Two-beat involvement (discovery, message, gathering) with causal pressure. Strong but not indispensable: story could function with a single note; the behind-painting staging adds elegance but isn't structurally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cave constrains via narrowing passages, supplies materials (crystal surface, moisture for charcoal), and enables climactic drawing. Setup early: "crystal cave... where crystals hummed, where Maya had first pressed pigments." Development: cave opens, passages narrow, cadmium yellow on crystal discovered. Payoff: Lyra draws on cave wall, crystals resonate, "marks... seemed to wake the cave." Micro-setting (body + tool + surface) charges final image. Essential: remove cave and the transformation loses its material ground. Specific properties (crystals, resonance, childhood memory) irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last echo of laughter fades" frames temporal stance (six months post-funeral, grief's aftermath) but doesn't tighten on-page decisions. Timeframe = emotional season rather than live clock. Present in setup (paragraph two: "six months since Maya's funeral") and closure nod ("dawn approaching") but doesn't constrain tactics or create urgency during cave sequence. "Hours passed, or perhaps minutes" explicitly suspends time pressure. Lyric seed → reprise without middle pressure: caps at mid-4s per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Desire to uncork creativity drives every beat: ignoring the pull, following sister's clue, discovering paintings, setting down sketchbook, drawing on stone. Friction between safety (precision, memory) and release (spontaneous creation) dramatized in sketchbook vs. stone choice with visible cost. Setup clear: "hiding behind memory." Development: paintings challenge her method. Payoff: "drawing she couldn't perfectly recall making." Strong causal role across three beats. Shy of 8.5: the internal conflict feels more thematic than agonized; she transitions without on-page doubt or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow coheres: grief permanent as charcoal, cave as geode heart, violet refractions, final dawn aurora. Tone modulates from heavy (chest cracking open) to wonder (crystals humming) to release (drawing flies) without breaking register. "Sorrow" sustained through loss and sister's absence; "auroral" (dawn-like, color-shifting) present in sensory palette and closure image. Charges final paragraph: "dawn approaching with its aurora of colors." Present across story but not indispensable—generic grief-to-hope arc could carry the structure. Mid-7s: coherent and modulated but doesn't uniquely shape tactical choices or intensify pressure at peak beats.</comment>
