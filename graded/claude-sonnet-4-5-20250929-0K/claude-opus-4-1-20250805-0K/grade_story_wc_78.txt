<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation to transform obstacles into instruments is established, but her interiority remains abstract—we see "restless euphony" and her body "ringing with residual harmony" rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to stay and play feels predetermined rather than earned through visible struggle. Embodiment is gestural (mallet warm in hand, muscles aching) but emotional states are labeled ("no fatigue, only a restless euphony") instead of dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and eagerness for the next transformation flatten what could be a moment of genuine cost or ambivalence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—escape from the recursive current—is clear, and the piece follows a causal chain: Kessa discovers the harmonic property, strikes the wood systematically, disrupts the spiral, and the orchard is freed. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the orchard simply moves on to the next challenge with no path foreclosed, no renunciation, no felt price. The ending gesture ("She smiled, knowing...") reads as a thematic summary rather than a reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible with cost. The drive lens is Causal, but the resolution arrives through Kessa's competence without meaningful loss or constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard on interwoven driftwood is vivid and purposeful, with the wood's grain forming nodes that Kessa must strike—environment directly enables her action. The blue hour coloring, salt-kissed branches, and whales drawn by deep frequencies layer sensory detail that serves atmosphere and stakes. Spatial choreography is clear (orchard's edge, leeward side), and the driftwood platform's transformation into an instrument constrains her method. The setting charges the final image as the orchard "sailed on through the night," fulfilling the micro-setting test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking free from the recursive current—is signaled early and drives the single-scene action. Kessa's systematic striking of the wood nodes escalates in frequency and precision, and the spiral's wobble constitutes a tightening. However, the resolution arrives through her expertise without a meaningful trade-off or forfeited path; the whales' contribution feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causality. The ending announces the next trapped vessel, extending the pattern rather than closing this loop with visible cost. Escalation is present but the cost at closure is not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—transforming obstacles into instruments of freedom—emerges clearly from the premise and action, avoiding direct moralizing until the final sentence ("every obstacle the sea presented was simply an unplayed instrument"). The mallet's underwater century and the orchard's curse-as-salvation offer resonant particulars. However, the closing paragraph lapses into thesis statement ("she had learned to make freedom from the very chains that bound her"), replacing scene pressure with summary. The clouds forming coordinates and the restless euphony motif attempt thematic recurrence, but the ending's tidy satisfaction undercuts ambiguity and reduces complexity to a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kessa throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("sussurus," "dubbed over," "restless euphony") that feels voice-motivated for a tide prophet character. However, several phrases approach thesaurus-itis ("sketched resonance," "invisible architecture," "sonic engineering") without always clarifying their concrete meaning, and the final paragraph's thesis-like declarations ("she had learned to make freedom from the very chains") slip into authorial summary rather than Kessa's lived perception. Perceptual signature is present in how she reads cloud-script and interprets the wood's grain, but the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("the mallet grew warm in her hand, its ancient wood remembering its underwater years"). Information density is generally high, integrating setting, action, and atmosphere in single beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "restless euphony that demanded she continue" echoes earlier "restless" descriptions without added pressure; "sketched resonance—temporary sound-shapes" and "invisible architecture" describe the same phenomenon in adjacent clauses. The final paragraph stacks thesis statements ("every obstacle...was simply an unplayed instrument") that paraphrase the established premise rather than advance it. Template cadence appears in the whales paragraph where "drawn by" and "adding" constructions feel formulaic. These artifacts concentrate in the final third, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a floating orchard trapped in a recursive current, freed through sonic engineering—offers a fresh synthesis of elements. The underwater-grown heartwood mallet and fractal mathematics provide specific, non-obvious detail. However, the emotional arc is familiar: a lone expert solves a problem through specialized knowledge and perseveres to face the next challenge. The ending's announcement of "another trapped vessel, another impossible prison" signals a repeating pattern rather than transformation, and the closure's tidy satisfaction (problem solved, onward to the next) avoids genuine risk or cost. The piece executes its premise competently but retreats from bold choices that would complicate Kessa's mastery or question the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kessa as leeward tide prophet is present throughout and her interpretive skill (reading cloud-script, identifying harmonic nodes) drives the escape. She makes the key decision to stay when others fled and executes the striking sequence that breaks the current. However, her choices feel expert rather than conflicted; no moment forces a trade-off or reveals competing desires. She is introduced in the opening beat, her actions shape the middle escalation and the climactic release, and she is present in the final image. The character's role is functional and essential but lacks the internal friction that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is introduced early ("carved from heartwood of a tree that had grown underwater for a century"), used systematically across multiple beats (striking specific nodes, growing warm, pulsing "like a second heart"), and present in the final image where it "pulsed in her hand...eager for the next transformation." Its specific properties (underwater-grown heartwood, conducting vibrations) enable Kessa's method and shape the closure's charged image. The mallet's recurrence and tactile presence across the narrative elevate its integration, though it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it is always the right tool for the task.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is defined mid-story ("temporary sound-shapes that hung in the air like invisible architecture") and shown through Kessa's striking creating visible light-traces near the climax. The concept enables her escape method and shapes the mechanics of how sound disrupts the current. However, it is introduced well past the first third, arrives as exposition ("what she called sketched resonance"), and does not constrain her choices—she executes the concept without friction or cost. It participates in the middle escalation and the climactic break but is absent from the final image, limiting closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kessa's ability to interpret cloud movements is introduced in the second paragraph ("reading the cloud-script that only she could interpret") and demonstrated when she adjusts her rhythm to match shifting cloud formations. The trait enables her discovery that the curse is also salvation and guides her tactical adjustments mid-performance. However, the skill never constrains her or imposes a visible cost—her readings are consistently correct and enable rather than complicate her actions. The clouds forming coordinates at the end reuses the trait but as revelation rather than dilemma, keeping the score in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dubbing (layering the apple trees' sussurus over base tones) is mentioned once in the middle escalation as part of Kessa's sonic engineering. The action contributes to the accumulating sound that disrupts the spiral, but it is described rather than shown ("she carefully dubbed over the base tones") and is not revisited or reweighted. The term "dubbed" specifies a sound-layering technique that fits the xylophone and sonic-engineering premise, but the action itself is swappable with "layered" or "wove" without structural loss. Present in the escalation but not closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fractal generation is introduced early ("a fractal generating inward toward inevitable collapse") and shapes the orchard's trap mechanics. Kessa's solution explicitly disrupts "the perfect mathematics" with "interfering wave patterns," and the method of matching "fractal mathematics of their prison" with sound patterns drives her tactical approach. The concept frames the problem and the resolution method, appearing in setup, middle escalation, and the climactic break. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no scene shows Kessa calculating or adjusting fractals—keeping the element functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard afloat on driftwood is introduced in the opening line, provides the instrument Kessa plays (driftwood logs with grain nodes), and shapes every beat of the escape sequence. The setting's specific properties (interwoven driftwood worn smooth, forming natural nodes) enable her method and constrain her movements to the orchard's edge and leeward side. The driftwood platform's transformation from trap to instrument is the story's central mechanism. The setting participates in setup, middle escalation, climax, and the final image of the orchard sailing onward, fulfilling all three gates and demonstrating high causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Blue hour is named in the opening paragraph ("the blue hour painted everything in gradients") and mentioned twice more ("As the blue hour deepened"; "The blue hour was ending, stars beginning to pierce"). The timeframe provides atmospheric coloring but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—Kessa's work continues past sunset without urgency or consequence tied to the time window. The element is present across the narrative but remains ornamental, functioning as mood rather than constraint. No visible cost or tactical adjustment is tied to the passage of blue hour into night.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to turn obstacles into instruments is dramatized through Kessa's discovery that "the orchard's curse was also its salvation" and her systematic transformation of the driftwood into a playable instrument. The desire drives her decision to stay when others fled and shapes her entire on-page action sequence. However, the motivation is never conflicted—she pursues it without friction, cost, or competing wants. The final paragraph makes the theme explicit ("every obstacle the sea presented was simply an unplayed instrument"), but this is assertion rather than earned tension between desire and price. Present in all three gates but lacking the internal conflict that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Restless euphony is named twice ("a sussurus," "restless euphony that demanded she continue") and evoked through descriptions of sound layering, resonance, and harmonic frequencies. The tone remains consistent—lyric, elevated, wonder-inflected—but does not modulate meaningfully with pressure. The climactic break ("a sound like the world's largest string snapping") briefly shifts register, yet the final paragraph returns to the same restless-euphonic mood without reconfiguration. The tone supports the premise but does not charge the final image with a felt shift or cost, keeping it functional rather than integral to closure.</comment>
