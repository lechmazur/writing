<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is specific and consistent—she harvests emotions with "affectionate detachment" and resists consuming her merchandise—but the final choice to simply tuck the petal away and leave feels unmotivated by the inner pull she describes. The contradictory impulse to "subsume these emotions herself" is named but never dramatizes genuine friction; she invokes her "cardinal rule" without visible cost or hesitation. The widower client is introduced only in her thought, diluting the present stakes. Embodied moments ("static electricity crackling," hair standing on end) anchor perception, but the emotional arc lacks a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear (grotto, dusk, Vera's profession). The dominant stake—harvesting half-truths before the grotto seals—drives the middle beats, and the time constraint (transformation completing at dusk) tightens pressure. However, closure is a walkaway: Vera exits with her harvest intact, no decisive change or visible cost on the page. The final image ("carrying her harvest of incomplete truths, each one a small mercy") asserts thematic resonance but does not reconfigure options or enact a felt price. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in method but delivers summary instead of a charged final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vivid and functional: its walls transform at dusk, permeable "just enough to release what it had held," and static electricity mediates access. Sensory detail (burgundy streaks, crackling sparks, hair standing on end) is filtered through Vera's professional lens. The grotto constrains her work (time window, static discharge method) and appears in the final beat as she climbs the steps, but it does not charge the closure image with a new cost or realization—she simply leaves. Micro-setting (the petal, the carved steps) supports the action without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harvest emotions before the grotto seals—is clear and urgent. The transformation clock tightens ("perhaps another minute") and Vera must align the petal with her heartbeat to "fuse insight with empathy," a deepening that narrows her task. Yet the peak moment ("to understand not just what emotions to harvest, but which ones would truly serve her clients' needs") is a cognitive shift, not an on-page action with visible cost. The temptation to "subsume these emotions herself" is raised but never pressed; she simply declines without struggle. The widower's need is introduced late as a justification rather than a live complication. Escalation is present but the cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: "those merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself," emotions "honest in [their] incompleteness." The final image—"the parts they could bear to hold"—reweights the work without spelling a moral. The petal as vessel, static electricity as connection, and the grotto's transformation all serve the theme without heavy-handedness. However, the penultimate paragraph's direct statement ("sometimes the kindest thing wasn't to give people whole emotions, but to offer them the parts they could bear to hold") edges toward thesis-speak, reducing the resonance by a half-step. The widower example is told, not shown, softening the thematic landing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and texture-rich: "affectionate detachment," "severed sentiments," "those merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself." Diction matches Vera's professional precision without slipping into corporate jargon. The single line of dialogue ("There you are") is brief but voice-apt. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts upward ("subsume," "electromagnetic field," "truncated form") in ways that feel more expository than character-particular under pressure. The phrase "crystalline walls into pools of liquid gold" in the opening, while vivid, risks purple flourish. Free indirect style is clean and the perceptual signature—sensing through static, tasting emotions as colors—is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong images ("burgundy streak," "static electricity still tingled on her fingertips"). Information density is high in the grotto beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "half-truths trapped inside" / "emotions that were genuine once, but incomplete" / "honest in its incompleteness" rehash the same idea across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the harvest sequence: "A father's pride divorced from disappointment. A lover's passion without the subsequent betrayal. Joy untethered from its inevitable loss" is purposeful parallelism but borders on list. The penultimate paragraph's long reflection ("In her profession, she'd learned...") summarizes rather than propels, and the final clause ("each one a small mercy in a world that often loved too sharply") leans sentimental. Minor scaffold in "This was why her work succeeded" and "This was the crucial moment."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—harvesting half-truths from amber via static electricity at dusk—is specific and fresh, blending sensory trade (fragrance blotter) with speculative constraint (grotto transformation). The synthesis of counterfeit emotions, partial truths, and "merciful lies" avoids stock plots. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar renunciation-of-temptation path without surprise: Vera considers consuming the merchandise, invokes her rule, and declines cleanly. The widower client is a late add that could be swapped for any other bereaved person. The transformation test: the plot would function unchanged in a different harvesting profession (memories, dreams) with minimal edits. Risk is present in the premise; execution plays it safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and makes two decisions: to harvest specific emotions and to resist consuming them. The harvest choices (mother's love, father's pride) are described but not dramatized as dilemmas. The temptation to subsume emotions is named but she declines without on-page struggle or visible cost. Setup is immediate, middle beats involve her work, and she appears in the final image climbing the steps. However, her role is more observer-executor than agent under pressure; the key turn (fusing insight with empathy) is cognitive, not a choice that narrows options. Swappable with another harvester archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The petal is introduced early ("fragrance chemist's blotter petal"), used actively in at least three beats (pressing against amber, absorbing burgundy streaks, aligning with heartbeat), and tucked away in the closure sequence. Its function—capturing emotional resonances through static discharge—is specific and irreplaceable. The petal's state changes (darkens, fills) and its final use (alignment with heartbeat to fuse insight with empathy) is a distinct step. However, it does not charge the final image with a reweighted cost; Vera simply tucks it away. Strong causal presence but closure linkage is functional rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Half-truths are the premise and Vera's product; she harvests "emotions that were genuine once, but incomplete, missing their context or conclusion." The concept shapes her method (seeking protective love without letting-go) and is reiterated in multiple beats. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than live constraint: Vera does not face a dilemma where delivering a half-truth versus a whole truth has on-page cost. The widower's need for "laughter without the silence that followed" is told, not dramatized. The concept is present in setup, middle, and ending, but it does not narrow options or force a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is asserted in the second paragraph ("Vera had built her reputation on being professionally thorough") but not demonstrated through on-page action with cost. Her work in the grotto is methodical ("worked methodically, pressing the petal to different sections"), but no beat shows thoroughness constraining her (e.g., a rushed moment where she must choose speed over precision, or a detail she cannot skip despite time pressure). The trait is label-only and could be cut without altering any choice. Late penalty does not apply (introduced early), but swappability and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears once as a temptation: "Vera felt the familiar pull to subsume these emotions herself, to let them flow through her and complete their broken circuits." This is the story's sole moment of internal conflict, and it could drive a major turn. However, she declines immediately via her "cardinal rule" without visible struggle, cost, or change in tactics. The action is present in the middle third and linked to her motivation, but it does not redefine options or shape the ending. Swappable with "consume," "absorb," or "internalize" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Static electricity is signaled early ("static electricity crackling between her skin and the ancient resin") and used consistently: it mediates her sensing ("Through that electric connection, she could sense them"), enables the petal's function ("sparks danced across its surface"), and intensifies as the transformation progresses. The method shapes her tactics (she must time her work to dusk, press the petal to specific sections, align it with her heartbeat) and appears in the final beat ("static electricity still tingled on her fingertips"). However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure—no moment where the static fails, fluctuates, or forces a trade-off. Strong setup and development; closure linkage is present but not charged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is introduced in the opening line, its transformation (mineral to permeable at dusk) drives the time constraint, and Vera climbs its steps in the final beat. The setting provides resources (amber walls holding half-truths) and a live clock (sealing after dusk). The grotto's permeability at the "precise instant when day surrendered to night" is irreplaceable; no other setting would supply this mechanic. However, the grotto does not charge the final image with new cost or realization—Vera simply exits. Strong causal presence and closure participation, but the ending treats it as backdrop rather than active element.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"as the transformation completes"—is signaled early ("This was the beginning now, as it always did at this exact moment of dusk") and tightens midway ("perhaps another minute before they would seal shut"). The clock is legible and shapes Vera's urgency ("worked methodically"). However, the deadline is met without complication: she finishes her harvest, tucks the petal away, and leaves cleanly. No moment where the time constraint forces a choice (skip a section, rush the alignment, leave something behind). The timeframe is tracked and present at closure ("As the last light faded and the grotto sealed itself") but does not alter tactics or impose cost. Functional constraint, not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To fuse insight with empathy" appears once, midway: "This was the crucial moment—to fuse insight with empathy, to understand not just what emotions to harvest, but which ones would truly serve her clients' needs." The motivation is tied to her professional method and shapes the petal-alignment beat. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs. The widower example that follows (wanting laughter without silence) is a justification, not a live dilemma. The motivation is present in setup (her reputation for thoroughness) and middle (the alignment moment) but absent from the ending, where Vera simply carries her harvest. No friction between insight and empathy on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is established early ("she murmured with affectionate detachment") and sustained throughout: Vera is professionally engaged yet emotionally removed, resisting the "familiar pull to subsume these emotions herself." The tone modulates subtly—warmer when she identifies the burgundy streak ("There you are"), cooler when invoking her cardinal rule—without breaking character. The final image ("carrying her harvest of incomplete truths, each one a small mercy") sustains the tone: clinical care without personal investment. However, the penultimate sentence ("a world that often loved too sharply") tips toward sentiment, softening the detachment. The tone is coherent, present in all three acts, and charges the ending, though the very last line edges warmer than the established register.</comment>
