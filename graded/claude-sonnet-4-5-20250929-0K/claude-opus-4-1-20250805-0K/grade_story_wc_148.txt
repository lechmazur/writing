<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to clear his father's name is established early, but his interior life remains abstract. The hovering trait is mentioned but never creates internal contradiction or meaningful struggle—it's accepted without cost. The discovery of journals and bones provides plot impetus, but Marcus makes no difficult choices; he simply floats to the confessional and speaks. No on-page tension between competing impulses; the character executes a plan without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: copper light, lattice imagery, and the confessional motif recur and the ending reweights the premise through testimony rather than causal turns. Orientation is clear (lighthouse prison, Marcus in cell, evening). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lattice becomes testament, truth displaces lie—but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page. The supply boat's arrival and discovery are promised for "by morning," placing consequence off-stage. One meaningful deepening occurs (journal discovery → testimony), satisfying the lens, but the final image lacks visible price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, Devil's Tooth Reef, scuffed door, and confessional lattice anchor setting vividly. Copper light modulates through the piece, and the narrow door physically constrains Marcus's movement (he must hover through the widened gap). The lattice's shipwreck origin and maze-like shadows contribute to atmosphere. The sealed basement with wrapped bones charges the final stakes. Micro-setting (door scuffs, lattice) participates in the closure image when Marcus's words "hover-carve" into the wood, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: exonerate his father and reveal the true crime. However, pressure remains static; Marcus faces no opposition, doubt, or tactical adjustment. The door opens "another inch" after decades, but this isn't earned—it simply happens. The discovery of journals and bones is convenient rather than contested. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Marcus proceeds from discovery to testimony without friction. The ending promises consequences ("by morning") but delivers no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (journal → testimony) is present but lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus inherited lies emerges clearly through the boy-who-cried-wolf legacy and the lattice as repository of confessions. "Truth lives in the spaces between heartbeats" and "chasing hush" are evocative but veer toward abstraction. The final testimony scene attempts non-literal resonance (Marcus reclaiming "True-Tongue"), yet it's undercut by the explain-everything final paragraph that spells out discovery and vindication mechanically. The lattice transforming into testament is a strong image, but the closing summary flattens thematic complexity into tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric ("copper light," "hover-carved"), though some phrases edge toward overwrought ("threading his way into the corridor like smoke through a keyhole"). Marcus's perceptual signature is present but generic—no character-specific filter beyond the hovering trait. The lattice glowing and accepting threads reads as slightly florid metaphor rather than grounded perception. No dialogue present to evaluate. Voice is competent but lacks a sharp, embodied texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong imagery (copper light, lattice shadows, scuffed door). Some overwrought constructions: "threading his way...like smoke through a keyhole," "hover-carved itself into the wood." The phrase "chasing hush" recurs but remains abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: "copper light" appears three times in close proximity without added pressure. The final paragraph shifts into summary mode, listing outcomes rather than landing on a concrete image. No significant loops or template cadence, but density could tighten in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of lighthouse prison, inherited curse, hovering as sustained impossibility, and confessional lattice as truth-map offers a fresh synthesis. The boy-who-cried-wolf inversion (the liar's son vindicating truth) is a solid twist. However, the ease of Marcus's success and the convenient timing (supply boat "by morning") trend toward template plotting. The hovering trait feels ornamental rather than organically integrated with the curse or justice themes. The ending's mechanical resolution (bodies found, lattice transformed, truth revealed) follows a predictable vindication arc without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus, son of the boy who cried wolf, is present throughout and his inherited curse motivates the plot. However, his agency is passive: he reads journals, discovers bones, and speaks testimony without making a difficult choice. The wolf-son legacy shapes backstory but doesn't force a live dilemma on the page. He appears in the closure (hovering in the confessional) but the beat is summary-only ("by morning...they would find"). Two gates (setup, closure mention) but no middle beat where this identity constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confessional lattice is introduced early (through scuffs on the door), its shipwreck origin and maze-like pattern described at midpoint, and Marcus presses his palm to it, receiving visions. His testimony "hover-carves" into the wood, transforming it into testament. The lattice drives two beats (vision, testimony) and shapes the closure image. Specificity is high (salvaged from shipwreck, holds confessions, glows). Cost is implied (testimony becomes permanent record) but not felt viscerally. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is mentioned twice and defined as "that perfect silence before truth emerges" and "the pause before confession." It frames Marcus's goal but remains abstract; no scene dramatizes him pursuing or achieving hush through difficult action. The ending asserts he found it ("the hush he'd chased was his own heartbeat"), but this is told rather than shown. Present in setup and closure as theme, but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Functional but replaceable with "seeking truth."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" describes both Marcus's hovering and the lattice holding confessions. The hovering enables his escape through the narrow door (one causal beat), but no cost or constraint is attached—it simply works. The lattice sustaining impossibilities is metaphorical texture rather than a rule that shapes action. Label-only in most appearances; the trait is asserted ("defying gravity as casually as logic") without friction. One functional beat (door passage) but swappable with "small enough to slip through."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hovering is introduced early, used to pass through the door, and mentioned in the corridor and at closure ("hovering in the confessional"). It's Marcus's signature trait and differentiates him visually. However, it doesn't create a key turn or cost; he could walk through a wider door or unlocked gate with similar plot effect. The hovering charges the final image (floating in copper light) with lyric resonance. Two beats (door, closure) and closure participation, but swappable mechanics lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is introduced early as the means of escape. Marcus observes the scuffs in paragraph three, and the door opens "another inch" in paragraph six, allowing him to hover through. The method is specific and signaled, shapes one beat (escape), and is mentioned in the closure ("every scuff on the door...would spell out the real story"). However, the door's opening is convenient rather than earned, and the scuffs' role in spelling truth is asserted in summary. Two gates, one causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison on Devil's Tooth Reef is introduced in the opening line and anchors every beat. The highest cell, narrow door, corridor, confessional, and sealed basement all constrain Marcus's movement and hold evidence. The isolation creates urgency (supply boat timing). The setting's history (first warden's rituals, father's death in same cell) pressures the emotional stakes. The lighthouse as container of lies/truth charges the closure. Strong spatial choreography and thematic integration across all three gates with visible constraints on action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" and "the supply boat would arrive for its monthly visit" establish a time constraint. Sunset and copper light create temporal atmosphere. However, the clock is loose; no moment dramatizes Marcus racing against discovery or adjusting tactics as time runs out. The ending defers consequence to "by morning," placing resolution off-page. Time is present in setup and closure framing but doesn't tighten a middle choice. Two gates, purposeful but not leveraged for escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated explicitly and motivates Marcus's testimony. The father's journal obsesses over threading truth, and Marcus speaks "through the lattice...his voice finding the cadence of confession." The motivation drives the climactic beat (testimony) and is present in closure ("having threaded the labyrinth at last"). However, no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want; Marcus pursues it without doubt or cost. Three gates, strong at closure, but lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" manifests as "copper light from the setting sun" (paragraph four), "copper light grew deeper, richer" (paragraph eight), "copper light held everything in amber repose, peaceful despite the horrors" (paragraph ten), and "floating in copper light" (final line). The tone is consistent, atmospheric, and modulates subtly (deepening as Marcus approaches testimony). It charges the final image with calm urgency. However, it's largely descriptive; repose doesn't tension with the horror of child murder in a way that complicates Marcus's stance. Present across all three gates, strong lyric reprise.</comment>
