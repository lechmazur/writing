<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and her internal contradiction—destroying to preserve—operates consistently throughout. The amoral philanthropist trait functions on the page through calculated actions (buying out indigenous people, manufacturing drought). However, the interiority leans heavily toward articulate self-awareness ("she was their sole, terrible translator") that edges into diagnostic precision uncommon mid-crisis. The final choice to bury the egg is dramatized with visible cost (the crack she engineered), but earlier beats summarize destruction rather than showing micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pattern through burial imagery and manufactured catastrophes, reaching Conceptual Repricing at closure when "salvation looked exactly like destruction" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the egg cracks by design, transforming preservation into active fossilization. The closure effect lands on the page with felt cost (the egg's transformation, the diverted storm), though some key destructions (the three rivers, the indigenous displacement) occur off-page and are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is vivid and purposeful: "crystalline crust," "tons of salt," and "industrial salt pellets" create tactile pressure. The setting constrains the burial choice (acoustic properties, preservation matrix) and charges the final image ("cracks in the earth spelled out songs"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vera's priorities (climate-sealed case, drone feeds, tablet). The spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting qualifies: the egg case, salt crystals, and cracks function as setting elements that directly enable tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving extinct species through controlled destruction—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera cracks the egg, narrowing her choice to irreversible fossilization with visible cost (albumin penetration, permanent entombment). Agency is present: her satellite activation, her engineered heat wave, her encrypted map. However, the peak choice (placing and cracking the egg) arrives without on-page opposition or complication; the act proceeds as planned without friction, limiting escalation under pressure. The storm's diversion is a tactical move but doesn't test commitment because no counter-pressure emerges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions: the paradox of destruction-as-preservation is dramatized through drought engineering, egg burial, and salt fossilization rather than stated until the final lines. The closing image—"grace came broken, piece by hoarded piece"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The cracks-as-songs motif accumulates meaning and charges closure. Minor slip: "terrible translator" and "archive of absences" edge toward articulating the thesis in slightly prompt-like language, though they remain tied to specific action (the map, the burial sites).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices drone feeds, algorithms, tax write-offs—details filtered through her technocratic lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("manufactured catastrophe," "acoustic fossil beds"). No head-hopping. Minor register issue: "archive of absences" and "sole, terrible translator" briefly elevate into abstract literary diction that feels slightly external to the established voice, though not enough to break immersion. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure (tablet update vs. final glance).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong except for one moment: "The pattern of fissures, viewed from her drone feeds, revealed the migration routes"—the mechanism (how cracks encode flight paths) remains vague and borders on symbolic convenience. Minor figurative density in the final third: "chorus of extinctions," "language only the dead could read," "fractured grace" cluster without clear pattern-teaching, though they don't obscure the closure action. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological destruction as preservation archive is specific and non-obvious, avoiding simple eco-villain or redemption templates. The acoustic fossil bed concept and crack-map mechanics offer fresh angles. The amoral philanthropist who mourns through calculated catastrophe feels particular to this voice and premise. However, the piece lives entirely in Vera's comfortable execution; no on-page friction tests whether her logic holds under pressure from another character or an unexpected complication. Risk-taking is present in the moral ambiguity but could deepen through on-page challenge to her certainty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's amoral philanthropy drives every beat: engineering drought (opening), displacing indigenous people (middle), burying the egg (closure). Her choices create the key turns—purchasing the egg, weakening it, sealing the site. The attribute shapes tactics (shell companies, tax write-offs, encrypted map) and charges the final image (manufactured disaster funding conservation). Cost is visible: she destroys watersheds, displaces communities, diverts storms. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The egg appears in the opening (bio-foam case), is handled mid-story (placement into salt), and returns at closure (cracking, transformation). It enables the burial ritual and charges the final image ("silence joining the chorus"). The crack is purposeful and reweights the act from preservation to fossilization. However, the egg's turquoise shell and calcium carbonate resonance remain largely decorative; removing those specific details wouldn't break the burial logic. Two beats, closure linkage present, but specificity only partially matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Manufactured drought shapes every tactic: starving rivers to create the crack-map, using satellites to redirect storms, engineering heat waves to seal the site. It drives the opening situation, enables the middle burial, and charges the closure (storm diverted to cornfields). The concept is not merely thematic—it alters on-page options and creates visible cost (dried wetland, displaced people, diverted rain). Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage all strong. Removing manufactured drought would collapse the story's core mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" appears as a constraint in two beats: Vera "allowed herself this single act of preservation" and "allowed herself one glance back." It enables the egg burial and charges the helicopter moment. However, the trait is largely told ("sentiment was a luxury she couldn't afford publicly") rather than shown through visible tradeoff. The on-page cost is present but modest: she performs the burial alone, but no higher-stakes choice tests secrecy against exposure. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The release (placing the egg into salt, then cracking it to release albumin for fossilization) drives the central action and defines the closure. It enables the preservation-through-destruction paradox and charges the final image ("slow transformation into stone"). The act redefines options: Vera moves from museum-style preservation to geological entombment. Early setup, middle execution, closure payoff. Removing this exact action would break the burial logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the execution proceeds without complication.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crack-map method is signaled early ("pattern of fissures... revealed the migration routes"), enables the burial site choice ("convergence point her algorithms had predicted"), and charges the final image ("cracks in the earth spelled out songs"). It shapes tactics (drone feeds, site selection) and constrains where Vera can bury. However, the mechanics—how cracks encode flight paths—remain vague and edge toward symbolic convenience. Two beats, closure linkage present, but specificity is limited. Swapping for "satellite-generated map" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The salt flat drives every beat: its crystalline crust enables the burial, acoustic properties amplify the egg's resonance, mineral matrix preserves better than museums, industrial salt pellets seal the site. The setting constrains tactics (helicopter access, no footprints remain) and charges the final image (white expanse, cracks spelling songs). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high specificity: removing salt flat for "desert" or "tundra" would break the preservation logic. The environment is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thunder appears in three beats: opening ("thunder rolled"), middle ("thunder grew closer"), and closure ("thunder faded as her satellites activated"). It provides atmosphere and marks the storm Vera diverts, linking to the manufactured drought. However, the timeframe remains loose—"lull of distant thunder" suggests duration, but no clock tightens decisions. Vera's actions proceed on her chosen schedule without temporal pressure. The thunder is present and purposeful but doesn't constrain tactics or escalate urgency. Lyric reprise qualifies but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Preserving extinct birds' echoes drives the burial (opening goal), justifies the engineered drought (middle tactics: acoustic fossil beds, migration-route map), and charges closure ("chorus of extinctions," "promise that some things... could still be saved"). The motivation creates visible cost: displaced people, destroyed watersheds, diverted storms. Friction is present between preservation and destruction methods, though Vera's certainty faces no on-page test. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage strong. The exact phrasing "echo of extinct birds" could be more irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fractured grace operates throughout: "surgical precision" destruction, "desperate museum," "terrible translator," "broken, piece by hoarded piece." The tone is coherent—controlled devastation infused with elegiac restraint—and modulates with pressure (clinical in drought engineering, tender at egg placement, resigned at closure). The final lines crystallize the tone: "salvation looked exactly like destruction... grace came broken." The tone charges the closure image and holds without contradiction. Strong coherence and closure linkage; the tone is near-indispensable to the story's effect.</comment>
