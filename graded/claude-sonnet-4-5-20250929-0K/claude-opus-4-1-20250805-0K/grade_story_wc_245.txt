<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority remains abstract throughout—"she understood now why she'd been born blind" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than dramatized cost. Her choices (touching trees, following melody) never face contradiction or force a visible trade-off; the journey reads as guided tour rather than pressure-driven decision. Emotional progression is summary-only ("changed," "profound"), not embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The lack of micro-choices with felt consequences at closure prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: languages and sensory details accrue toward the stillpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara "carries the stillpoint within her" without forfeiting anything on the page or facing a constraint that narrows options. The ending asserts transformation ("changed," "never leave her") but does not dramatize what path was foreclosed or what price was paid. One meaningful deepening occurs (forest heart to stillpoint), but the RR requires felt cost that remains absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bark, soil, moss). The platinum compass ring recurs across beats and warms/spins as a constraint marker, shaping her navigation choices. However, the setting functions primarily as atmosphere rather than forcing a tactical trade-off at closure. The "perfect silence" at the stillpoint charges the final image but does not alter her available moves or foreclose an option, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the stillpoint to deepen her practice) is signaled early. The journey accumulates sensory input and tightens spatially as she approaches the forest heart. Yet no reversal or constraint forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price—she simply arrives, sits, and absorbs. The melodic trail guides without opposition. Agency at closure is reception, not decision or renunciation with cost, limiting escalation credit under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (navigation of inner depths, blindness as gift) emerges from concrete images—trees as languages, stillpoint as origin of maps. The final image ("she had become the compass") reprices the opening but lacks tension; the thematic answer arrives without contradiction or ambiguity. The phrase "quiet blaze of understanding" borders on abstraction rather than anchored particulars. No competing interpretation or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution, yielding competent but tidy thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic, touch-and-sound focus). Narrative distance remains controlled. However, elevated diction ("emotional cartography," "acoustic maze," "soul's architecture") drifts from embodied perception into essayistic register during peak beats, weakening immediacy. Psychic distance widens at closure when certainty exceeds what Elara can dramatize ("every map she drew from this moment forward")—a claim of future knowledge not earned on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "It wasn't a place but a presence" and "not through space but through the vast territories" repeat the not-X-but-Y template. Figurative language clusters heavily ("warm honey," "quiet blaze," "soul's architecture") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity in high-pressure beats. The ending paragraph stacks summary assertions ("changed," "would never leave," "would pulse") that tell rather than show the transformation, flattening propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The blind-synesthetic-mapmaker premise is fresh, but execution leans on familiar beats: mentor object (grandmother's ring), mystical forest, quest for hidden wisdom, transformative arrival. The stillpoint as "source of all maps" and Elara's realization that "blindness was her gift" echo template epiphanies without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived tradeoff. The melodic breadcrumb trail and convergent silence read as archetypal rather than irreplaceable particulars. Risk-taking is modest; the ending reassures rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession frames the quest, but her choices (touch tree, follow sound, sit) do not create reversals or foreclose paths. She observes and absorbs without conflict or cost. Setup and development gates met; closure gate missed because the ending transformation is asserted, not earned by a decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in beat one, recurs when it "grew warmer" and spins faster mid-journey, and "finally cease[s] its restless spinning" at closure. Three distinct beats signal setup, development, payoff. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it guides without friction. Specificity (vibrating, warmth, spinning) is good but causal pressure is low; swappable with any mystical heirloom compass.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stillpoint is introduced early ("tracking rumors"), sought actively (following melody, dowsing), and reached at closure where it is described and internalized. All three gates met. It shapes the dominant stake and reweights meaning at the end ("origin from which every journey...began"). However, reaching it imposes no visible cost or tactical constraint—Elara simply sits and absorbs—limiting causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Language absorption through touch is shown on-page (Portuguese from bark, Mandarin from oak, etc.) across multiple beats. Setup and development gates met. Yet the trait never constrains or costs her—it only accumulates advantage. No scene demonstrates a tradeoff (e.g., overload, confusion, pain). Closure gate missed; the languages "wove together" passively without a choice hinging on their use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dowsing appears once in mid-journey ("paused to dowse") and is immediately superseded by the musical trail. It does not shape a key turn or recur at closure. Setup gate met (first third); development and payoff gates missed. Easily swappable with any other detection method (scrying, compass reading). No cost or constraint tied to dowsing itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The melody trail is introduced early ("sequence of musical notes"), guides her progress ("following the sonic trail"), and completes itself in her mind at closure, teaching her "a song of navigation." All three gates met. However, the melody does not impose friction or choice—she follows it without error or cost. Specificity is good (fragments, ultrasonic, incomplete) but causal pressure is passive guidance rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is established in paragraph one, provides sensory input and languages throughout (trees speak, moss/stone offer dialects), and the "forest's heart" is the closure location. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The setting supplies resources (languages) and the "perfect silence" charges the ending. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—Elara navigates without obstacle. Strong atmospheric integration but low tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the pause of shifting constellations" is mentioned once in paragraph four and reprised in the final paragraph ("constellations resumed their ancient dance"). Setup and payoff gates met; development gate missed—no mid-story beat where time pressure affects her choices. The pause is poetic framing, not a live clock that narrows options or imposes urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Her motivation (chart uncharted emotional depths, find stillpoint to deepen practice) is stated early and frames the quest. Setup and development gates met. At closure she achieves the goal without friction or cost, so no choice between competing wants occurs. The desire is told and pursued but never conflicted on the page—no moment where navigation competes with safety, rest, or doubt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone blends sensory richness ("warm honey," "acoustic maze") with meditative calm. The phrase "quiet blaze" recurs (mid-story and ending), and tone modulates slightly as she nears the stillpoint (descriptions slow, metaphors deepen). Setup and payoff gates met via the recurring phrase. However, tone remains uniform under pressure—no tonal shift at a decision point. Coherent but static, preventing higher score.</comment>
