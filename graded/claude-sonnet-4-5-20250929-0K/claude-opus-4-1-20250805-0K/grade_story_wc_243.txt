<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior world is vivid and contradictory—her archival pride battles ethical revulsion in the three-day deliberation period, and the codicil solution embodies both impulses simultaneously. Eleanor remains thinly sketched, existing primarily to deliver exposition and enable Mara's choice. The final exchange ("Thank you" / nod / locket transfer) gestures toward emotional complexity but rushes past the weight it claims, and the "haunted euphoria" label appears more asserted than embodied through contradictory physical experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal discovery of the fire → accumulative ethical weighing → a final Resonant Reconfiguration via the codicil). Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Mara has acted, Eleanor receives peace, and the codicil ensures future reckoning—options are reweighted and a path foreclosed. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant (future archivists will know), not viscerally felt in the present exchange, and Eleanor's unawareness of the codicil softens the immediate pressure. The fire backstory and seventeen-year career are efficient setup, but the three-day reflection window is told rather than dramatized, creating a causality seam between discovery and decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is presented with layered sensory detail (wisteria perfume, amber light, violet-gold water) and recurs at closure to bracket the action. The portable ink set functions as a micro-setting/tool that enables the codicil decision on-site, constraining Mara's choice to act now rather than later. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara arrives, works at the jetty, Eleanor approaches through the bower. The walnut-ink stains and locket photo serve as recurring tactile anchors, though the photo's physical presence (breast pocket / Eleanor's hands / left behind) tracks less precisely than the ink.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve Eleanor's peace versus historical truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers Thomas's arson. The codicil offers a synthesis rather than a forced binary, which is thematically rich but mechanically convenient: no live option is foreclosed, no visible cost paid in the present scene. Eleanor never learns of the codicil, so Mara's agency operates in a consequence-free zone for this encounter. The fire backstory provides escalation in knowledge, but the three-day offstage deliberation diffuses pressure rather than concentrating it, and the final exchange unfolds without friction or surprise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the covenant as both mercy and reckoning, the "weight of small moments" embodied in named destroyed records, and the closing line's synthesis of remembering versus forgetting. The wisteria reprise and twilight imagery charge the ending without overt moralizing. The codicil itself is a thematically loaded image—preservation that indicts—though the story briefly over-explains its meaning ("Future archivists would find it"). The piece resists false equivalence: Thomas's crime is named, Eleanor's need honored, and the tension between them sustained rather than resolved into tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's archival idiom ("gently thorough," "walnut-ink script," "regenerated covenant"). Psychic distance tightens during the codicil beat with concrete sensory anchors (portable ink set, microscopic script, border placement). Eleanor's two lines of dialogue feel natural and carry subtext, though the exchange is brief. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that edges past Mara's demonstrated lexicon ("haunted and luminous as the twilight itself," "testament to the haunted euphoria"), and the final paragraph's summary statement ("understanding that some covenants regenerate…") narrates theme rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong in the opening (walnut-ink stains, wisteria cascade, boats bobbing) and the codicil beat, where syntax tightens and information density peaks. However, several passages loop conceptually: "weight of small moments" is named three times, "gently thorough" recurs without functional variation, and the closing paragraph paraphrases earlier material ("haunted euphoria," "gentle thoroughness of remembering everything"). The phrase "For seventeen years, she had been gently thorough" front-loads backstory in a way that reads more like scaffold than character-specific recall. The final two paragraphs contain multiple abstract thematic restatements that dilute the image's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The codicil solution—hiding truth in plain sight via microscopic border script—is a fresh synthesis of archival method and ethical conflict, and the fire-as-bankruptcy-cover backstory adds moral complexity to the restoration plot. The piece avoids the predictable "destroy or preserve" binary. However, the core frame (archivist discovers dark secret while restoring a document) is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (discovery → reflection → synthesis) follows a well-worn path. The wisteria and twilight imagery, while vivid, function decoratively rather than as irreplaceable elements of the stakes or closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create both the codicil turn and the decision to give Eleanor the covenant without disclosure. Her three-day deliberation and the on-page act of adding the border text are causally central. The research into proximate causes and the final handoff to Eleanor both flow from her archival role and ethical stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in three beats: Eleanor gives it (exposition), Mara studies it at the jetty (reflection), and Eleanor leaves it behind as a gift (closure gesture). However, the photo remains largely passive—it prompts reflection but does not constrain or enable Mara's key choice. Its meaning does not shift; it remains a symbol of Eleanor's love throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the story's engine: the restoration task prompts research, the research uncovers arson, the arson creates the ethical dilemma, and the covenant's completion enables Eleanor's peace. The codicil transforms the covenant from simple restoration into a dual-function document. Removing this concept collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is named explicitly and demonstrated in Mara's research, copying fidelity, and codicil solution. It enables the discovery of proximate causes and the meticulous border inscription. However, the trait is more often asserted than shown to constrain action under pressure—it describes method but does not force a tradeoff with visible cost in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Steep" appears twice: Mara breathes in wisteria "letting it steep through her lungs like the rare teas she brewed," and she sits "steeping in" the fire's implications for three days. The metaphor colors reflection but does not create a key turn; the three-day period is summarized, not dramatized, and the wisteria inhalation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is signaled early in Mara's research method and directly enables the discovery of Thomas's arson, which reframes the entire restoration task. The method is not merely decorative—it is the investigative path that uncovers the hidden stakes. However, the mechanics of the research are summarized rather than shown in scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty appears in the locket photo (linking past and present), frames the entire scene, and provides the charged atmosphere (wisteria perfume, twilight colors) that the closing image draws on. The jetty enables the portable-ink-set solution by being the meeting place. However, the setting could be replaced with another symbolic outdoor location without breaking story logic; it enriches but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When context changes" is embodied in the moment Mara discovers the fire's true cause—her role shifts from simple archivist to ethical arbiter. The timeframe also encompasses the seventeen-year career (setup), the three-day deliberation (escalation), and the twilight meeting (closure), creating a telescoping structure. The discovery beat is the hinge where context changes everything, as the text explicitly states.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to preserve "the weight of small moments" drives her decision to complete the covenant for Eleanor and to inscribe the codicil naming all erased records. The motivation is dramatized through the list of destroyed documents and the codicil act itself, though the phrase "weight of small moments" is repeated enough to edge toward theme-assertion. The friction between Eleanor's immediate need and historical justice creates the story's central tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named twice and gestured toward in the closing image (wisteria, darkness, shared understanding), but the tone is more asserted than modulated through the narrative. The "strange euphoria" sentence tells rather than embodies the feeling. The piece sustains a contemplative, elegiac mood more consistently than it delivers the contradictory charge of euphoria haunted by cost.</comment>
