<comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and character-particular in moments like "laughed, a sound like bark peeling from ancient trees," and her contradictory impulses—envy of her past self's certainty versus knowledge of inevitable chaos—act simultaneously. The choice to step outside and "begin by falling" feels motivated by accumulated pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Multiple iterations of Maya blur into a collective rather than individuated choices, which softens agency. The final renunciation (accepting she's "already soaring") earns its moment but lacks the sharp tradeoff that would push into higher bands.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the birch bark scroll recurs, reweighted each time, and the final image (Maya documenting flight while already soaring) constitutes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise of chronicling versus living. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, Maya, scroll) arrive early and remain stable. The cost is legible conceptually—she loses linear causality and selfhood—but the final beat's felt price is diffuse; the "unaware she was already soaring" lands as irony rather than a decisive foreclosure of options. One meaningful deepening (grave visit → flying contemplation → stepping outside) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<comment>The ranger cabin, birch bark, and mountain wind are concrete, recurring anchors that constrain Maya's archival work and charge the closure image. Sensory details—"scent of birch sap and something else—possibility, perhaps, or resignation"—filter through Maya's philosophical stance without catalog tourism. The birch bark as both tool and object recurs with purpose, shaping her choices to document and her final step outside. Spatial choreography (cabin interior, window, outside) remains clear and evolves with the emotional arc.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative order—is signaled early and tightens as Maya confronts the futility of linear documentation. The scroll's promise of flight and the memory of her grave create pressure that forces her final choice to step outside. Agency is present (she writes, she walks out, she accepts), though the renunciation feels more resigned than high-cost. The escalation under the Accumulative lens works: each reflection reweights her relationship to the archive until the final image reconfigures the premise. Cost is conceptual (she abandons the archive's promise of order) but the tradeoff lacks sharp physical or relational bite.</comment>

<comment>The theme—narrative as chaos in costume, the impossibility of fixing time through documentation—emerges organically from Maya's archive work and the birch bark scrolls. The final image ("unaware she was already soaring") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the feral nostalgia, the jealousy of past selves, and the line "every Maya who had ever been or would be spread their wings together." The piece avoids thematic echo in the ending, allowing the soaring image to reweight prior material. One small slip: "the only way to distill chaos into narrative is to accept that the narrative itself is chaos" slightly over-articulates the thesis on the page.</comment>

<comment>The voice is distinct and consistent—lyric, philosophically charged, with a perceptual signature that notices bark textures, temporal tangles, and mountain winds. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the scroll examination, wider during reflections on multiple Mayas. The non-linear time structure is taught early ("would write them—had written them") and held legibly through closure. Brief register elevation ("chronology tangled like mountain paths after an avalanche") fits the character's intellectual stance. No dialogue to judge. Minor pattern repetition in sentence openings ("Maya set down," "Maya laughed," "Maya smiled") creates slight template cadence but does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; most lines advance theme, character, or the temporal puzzle. Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the final beats where short sentences accelerate: "If she was going to soar, she might as well begin by falling." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "She'd written it after—before?—chronicling the dream" and "The boundaries had been negotiable even then" restate temporal confusion without adding pressure. Template cadence ("The Maya who'd soared," "The Maya who'd swum," "The Maya who'd spoken") clusters mid-story but serves thematic parallelism rather than artifact. Minor figurative muddle: "feral nostalgia clawed at her chest—not longing for a specific past, but for the very concept of linear time" mixes metaphors (feral/clawed with abstract concept) without full coherence. No major line-level opacity; clarity holds.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—a dream chronicler who loses herself across timelines via her own archive—offers a fresh angle on recursion and identity. The birch bark scrolls and ranger cabin ground the concept in specific, tactile detail. The risk-taking (non-linear time, multiple Mayas, philosophical interiority) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image (already soaring while documenting flight) feels inevitable in hindsight. Proximity check: the recursive, time-fractured narrator echoes Borges and Calvino, but the birch bark archive and feral nostalgia add distinct texture. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the lack of sharp physical or relational cost keeps it from the highest originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Maya's role as dream chronicler is present early (first paragraph: "chronicling the dreams of others") and shapes her dominant stake (distilling chaos into narrative). It constrains her choices: she documents rather than acts, envies past selves, and ultimately steps outside to fall/soar. The trait appears in the closure beat ("returned to the cabin to document the dream of flying"), reweighting prior material. However, the chronicler function is mostly context for her temporal fragmentation rather than a skill that alters tactics or forces a key reversal. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development is implied but not dramatized as a distinct choice. Cap eligible at ~6.0; lyric reprise justifies ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The birch bark scroll is introduced in the opening line, handled in beat one (unrolling, reading), and returns in the closure paragraph ("document the dream of flying" on bark). Its material properties (crackles, sap scent) ground the archive concretely. It enables her documentation practice and its presence in the final beat charges the image of recursive documentation. Three gates met (setup, middle pressure via the scroll's promise of flight, closure). Causal pressure: the scroll's content (flying) drives her decision to step outside. Cost connection: the bark embodies the futility of fixing dreams in narrative. Irreplaceable: the birch bark's organic, impermanent quality contrasts with "paper felt too permanent," making it specific to the character's logic. Score ~7.2.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly ("The feral nostalgia clawed at her chest—not longing for a specific past, but for the very concept of linear time") and shapes Maya's emotional stake: she misses linear causality, envies past selves, and mourns lost certainty. It inflects her decision to abandon the archive and step outside. However, the concept is stated rather than dramatized through a choice that trades one option for another. Setup and closure gates met (the nostalgia drives the final renunciation); middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The phrase "feral nostalgia" itself adds texture but is close to a label. Lyric reprise and thematic weight justify ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Maya's chronological confusion is introduced in the first paragraph ("the chronology tangled like mountain paths after an avalanche") and constrains every action: she cannot remember which scroll she wrote, when she saw her grave, or whether she's flying or documenting flight. It enables the archive premise (multiple timelines bleed together) and charges the closure image (unaware she's already soaring). Three gates met: setup (first paragraph), middle pressure (grave memory, "three days ago—or was it three years from now?"), and closure (the final lines hinge on temporal simultaneity). Causal pressure: the confusion drives her to accept chaos rather than impose order. Visible cost: she loses selfhood and certainty. Irreplaceable: remove the chronological confusion and the story's logic collapses. Score ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Soar" appears in the scroll's promise ("flying—no, soaring—above these very peaks"), drives Maya's envy of the flying self, and reappears in the closure image ("every Maya who had ever been or would be spread their wings together" and "unaware she was already soaring"). It shapes the final choice to step outside and fall. Three gates met (setup via scroll, middle pressure as desire, closure as realization). However, the action is more metaphorical than physical; Maya does not literally soar on the page, and the closure treats it as conceptual simultaneity rather than a decisive change. Causal pressure moderate; cost connection moderate (the action reweights her relationship to documentation). Score ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Maya's jealousy of past selves is named early ("She envied that version of herself, the one who still believed documentation could create order from chaos") and recurs structurally in the middle section listing other Mayas who had certainties she lacks. It drives her emotional stake and her final decision to abandon the archive's false order. Three gates met: setup (first-third envy), middle pressure (catalog of envied Mayas), and closure (stepping outside renounces the jealousy by accepting chaos). Causal pressure: the jealousy motivates her renunciation of linear narrative. Cost: she loses the fantasy of a singular, ordered self. The method is more thematic than tactical but shapes the arc. Score ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The ranger cabin is introduced early ("the dim lamplight of the ranger cabin") and serves as the archive's container. It constrains Maya's choices (the scrolls live there, she returns to document) and supplies the window through which she looks before stepping outside. The cabin's isolation on the mountain pressures her solitude and reinforces the stakes of her fractured timeline. Three gates met: setup (first paragraph), middle (she walks to the window, presses forehead to glass), closure (she returns to the cabin in the final line). Causal pressure moderate: the cabin is a stage rather than an active constraint. Specificity moderate: "abandoned ranger cabin" and "birch bark archive" add texture but the cabin itself could be swapped for another isolated structure. Score ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The grave-visit memory is introduced early ("Three days ago—or was it three years from now?—she'd stood at her own grave") and pressures Maya's awareness of mortality and recursion. It shapes her emotional stance (the youngest mourner's "insufferable expression") and primes the closure theme (she's already lived/died across timelines). Two gates met: setup (first third) and thematic closure linkage (the final image's temporal simultaneity echoes the grave's time-slip). Middle development is absent; the grave memory is referenced but does not constrain a mid-story choice. The timeframe is conceptual rather than a live clock tightening decisions. Lyric reprise justifies ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maya's motivation—"to distill chaos into narrative"—is named explicitly and dramatized through her archive work, her writing on fresh bark, and her final renunciation of that goal. It drives the dominant stake and every beat: she envies past selves who believed in order, catalogs dreams, and ultimately accepts that "the narrative itself is chaos, wearing the costume of order." Three gates met: setup (second paragraph: "chronicling the dreams of others"), middle pressure (writing the new scroll: "the only way to distill chaos into narrative is to accept..."), and closure (she documents the dream of flying while already soaring, renouncing linear narrative). Causal pressure strong; cost visible (she abandons the archive's promise). Irreplaceable: remove this motivation and the story loses its spine. Score ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Jaded wonder" is embodied throughout: Maya laughs "a sound like bark peeling," envies her younger self's certainty while marveling at temporal impossibility, and writes of "jaded wonder" and "exhausted amazement" explicitly. The tone modulates with pressure: resigned in the opening, sharper during the catalog of envied Mayas, breathless at the peak ("every Maya who had ever been or would be spread their wings together"), then quiet in the final line. It charges the closure image by holding contradictory emotional states simultaneously (cynicism and awe). Three gates met: setup (first paragraph's "trembling not from cold but from recognition"), middle (explicit naming and tonal shifts), closure (the final line's irony is jaded, the wings image is wonder). Coherent and purposeful. Score ~7.4.</comment>
