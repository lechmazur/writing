<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is textured—drawn to tenderness in technical notes, seeking beauty within isolation—and her motivations cohere around parallel grief and curiosity. The protagonist remains primarily observer until the final third; her choices (taking the diary, deciding to return tomorrow) feel more like confirmations than high-stakes reversals that foreclose options. The final "enkrypt her own [joy]" moment edges toward self-aware epiphany without sufficient dramatized struggle. Thorne's characterization is vivid through absence but never tested on the page, limiting dynamic tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: each floor adds a layer of discovery (goggles → coordinates → hidden text → diary). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Mira, elevator, spire, three years of service). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's understanding reweights the spire's meaning and her own ascent with felt cost—she now climbs toward preserved joy rather than mere duty. The cost is conceptual and emotional (isolation transformed into purpose) but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the diary and decodes it, narrowing her understanding and forecloses the "frozen by grief" myth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator mechanics (gears clicking like a grandfather clock, ice cracking from cables), and the observatory's panoramic windows create a coherent vertical world. Sensory details—frost-etched windows, misted breath, ice crystals in updraft—reflect Mira's emotional and physical ascent. The astrolabe functions as micro-setting: its placement constrains the diary's discovery and charges the final image when she sits in Thorne's chair. Spatial choreography remains clear across ten floors and the transition into quarters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Thorne's disappearance and its meaning for Mira's own isolation—signals early and tightens as each floor reveals more. One meaningful pressure point: the diary's message reframes "sorrow shared becomes joy discovered," forcing Mira to see her daily climb as parallel transformation rather than duty. Agency is primarily interpretive (decoding, realizing) until the final decision to return and "encrypt her own" joy; that choice forecloses ignorance but lacks a visible immediate cost or trade-off on the page. Escalation is more accumulative deepening than reversal-driven narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sorrow as teacher, preservation of beauty within loss, and the necessity of patient attention to decode hidden joy. The goggles and diary function as motifs that reweight at closure—"tenderness survives" lands without moralizing. The final image (touching worn leather, proof that tenderness survives) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "sorrow shared becomes joy discovered" reads slightly platitudinous in isolation, though the diary's encrypted structure earns it somewhat. Thematic coherence holds across the ten-floor structure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance modulates with discovery (close during decoding, slightly elevated during reflection). Diction remains character-particular: "Cloud formation resembles Martha's sleeping face" and "coordinates pointed to a specific location" anchor Mira's technical-meets-tender lexicon. The "not from excitement, but from recognition" construction and "encrypted not to hide but to ensure only someone who truly looked" rhythm create distinct perceptual signature. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she'd learned," "she understood") are voice-motivated and sparse. Minor denseness in the penultimate paragraph's explaining ("Like Thorne, she sought joy beneath anguish...") but voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; the floor-by-floor structure creates natural beat markers without mechanical repetition. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Two craft slips lower the score: (1) "Ninth floor. Ice crystals danced...each one catching light like suspended grief" stacks metaphor density without deepening pressure in that beat; (2) the penultimate paragraph summarizes theme ("sorrow needn't freeze us solid. Sometimes it simply teaches us...") where image would have been stronger. Grammar and tense are clean; no loops or scaffolding detected. Propulsion holds through the climb but softens slightly in the final two paragraphs with reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-in-goggles premise is fresh enough and the ten-floor countdown structure provides elegant constraint. The transformation of "frozen by grief" into purposeful departure ("I leave to find where wind begins") and the scattered-light reveal method show ingenuity. However, the airship-captain-in-abandoned-tower setup and the servant-finds-hidden-treasure arc echo familiar steampunk/mystery templates. The emotional truth—seeking beauty within isolation—feels earned and particular. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its lyric-accumulative mode without bold structural deviation. The synthesis is competent but not indelible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira appears in every beat, drives all interpretation, and makes the final choice to return and "encrypt her own" joy. Setup: early (paragraph one). Development: decoding coordinates and diary constrains her understanding mid-story. Payoff: final paragraph, she decides to climb again with new purpose. Causal pressure is moderate—her choices are mostly interpretive until the end. Cost is conceptual (ignorance → understanding) but not a high-stakes trade-off. Strong across all three gates but decisions trend observational until closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Goggles appear in beat one (pulled from apron), beat two (symbols etched inside), beat three (coordinates projected via scattered light), beat four (hidden ink unfurls), and final beat (touching worn leather, proof of tenderness). Setup: early. Development: the goggles' mechanics (lens, warmth, projection) enable the discovery. Payoff: "touching the goggles' worn leather" charges the final image. Causal pressure: high—without the goggles' specific properties (etched symbols, lens projection, hidden ink), the discovery fails. Felt cost: implicit (she now carries responsibility for Thorne's encrypted joy). Indispensable across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Encrypted diary discovery is the core stake and drives every beat from floor five onward. Setup: hinted at floor eight ("diary lies encrypted"), confirmed when she finds the journal. Development: decoding entries reveals Thorne's transformation of sorrow. Payoff: the final decision to "encrypt her own" joy directly extends the discovery. Causal pressure: strong—the encryption method (shorthand, star charts) shapes her understanding and final choice. Visible cost: she inherits the burden of preserving joy through patient encoding. All three gates met; the concept is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is demonstrated through Mira's drawn attention to tenderness in Thorne's notes and her patient decoding rather than labeled. Setup: implicit in "drawn to the tenderness hidden in his technical observations." Development: she decodes with care rather than haste. Payoff: warmth charges her final smile and decision. The trait enables discovery but does not create visible friction or cost—curiosity is never tested against competing urgency. Two gates (setup, payoff) met solidly; middle gate is implicit. Trait is coherent but does not constrain a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears literally (unfolding hidden ink via warmth) and structurally (unfolding layers of discovery floor by floor). Setup: implicit in the climbing structure. Development: the goggles' hidden text unfolds at floor eight, altering her understanding. Payoff: the diary unfolds Thorne's documented joys and her final stance. Causal work: moderate—the unfolding method enables discovery but is not irreplaceable (she could decode via other means with minor edits). Specificity is decent but swappability (e.g., "decode," "reveal") lowers the score. Two strong gates (middle, payoff); setup is structural rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is mechanically specific: the elevator's swaying lamp projects coordinates onto frost, enabling the behind-the-astrolabe discovery. Setup: signaled at floor five when light projects coordinates. Development: the method is used on-page to solve the spatial puzzle. Payoff: implied in the final image of "light scattered through unexpected lenses." Causal pressure: strong—without the scattered-light projection, the coordinates remain abstract. Felt cost: none directly tied to the method itself. All three gates met; the method is nearly indispensable to the discovery beat but does not charge the closure as strongly as the goggles or diary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire structures every beat: the ten-floor climb creates ticking escalation, altitude steals warmth (affecting the goggles' hidden ink), ice on cables signals danger, and the spire's verticality embodies Mira's search for meaning above isolation. Setup: paragraph one. Development: each floor tightens discovery and environmental pressure (narrowing walls, howling wind). Payoff: "The spire stood as testament that sorrow needn't freeze us solid" and her decision to climb again tomorrow. Causal pressure: high—the setting's mechanics (cold, altitude, verticality) enable and constrain discovery. Felt cost: endurance of cold and isolation. Indispensable across all three gates and deeply integrated into closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is announced, tracked beat-by-beat (first through tenth floors named on the page), and structures escalation as a ticking countdown. Setup: paragraph two ("First floor passed"). Development: each floor marker accompanies a new layer of discovery, tightening pressure. Payoff: arrival at the tenth floor delivers the diary and closure. Causal pressure: very strong—the timeframe creates real-time urgency and the reader experiences discovery in step with ascent. Felt cost: the climb's duration and physical toll (breath misting, cold intensifying) are embodied. The mechanic is irreplaceable; removing the floor count would collapse the story's rhythm and escalation structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is dramatized through Mira's patient decoding and her recognition that Thorne "documented beautiful moments between losses." Setup: implicit in her being "drawn to the tenderness" in his notes. Development: decoding the diary reveals joy preservation as tactic. Payoff: she decides to "encrypt her own" joy, adopting Thorne's method. The motivation is coherent but lacks on-page friction—no competing desire or obstacle tests her commitment. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of isolation's purpose) rather than a visible trade-off. Two gates met (development, payoff); setup is implicit. Desire is told and confirmed more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is sustained through lyric distance (the servant observing rather than emoting overtly) paired with warm particulars ("Martha's sleeping face," "ice formed like lace"). The tone modulates subtly: detached observation during ascent, warmer intimacy when decoding the diary, affectionate resolve in the final image ("She smiled, touching the goggles' worn leather"). Setup: established early in the controlled, accretive voice. Development: tone holds through discovery without sentimentality. Payoff: the final smile and "proof that tenderness survives" marry affection and distance cleanly. The tone charges the closure image and is consistent under pressure, though it does not create friction or cost. Strong coherence across all three gates.</comment>
