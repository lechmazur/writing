<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's prosopagnosia is established early and shapes her tactile method, but her interior life remains largely abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to keep the coin reads as thematically inevitable rather than earned through on-page pressure between competing wants. Embodied emotion is sparse; moments like "pressed her palm against the coin one final time" gesture toward feeling without specific bodily cost. The transformation from "couldn't see faces" to recognizing "the library had a face too" lands as epiphany-by-assertion rather than discovery under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers discovery (secret safe, coin map, light-portrait method) toward a final Conceptual Repricing that reweights prosopagnosia as "different kind of sight." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure unit—Lyra walking away "carrying the sky inside her own walls"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the library falls, her method must now live in memory), meeting the CR standard. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "faces were merely one form of identity," narrowing her tactics to spatial light-mapping. Causal linkage is present but elliptical; the coin's spiral pattern directly enables the mirror arrangement, satisfying motivated connection under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly particular: "carved shelves...worn smooth by generations," "ladder marks in the bark," "gaps" for moonbeam entry. Spatial choreography remains coherent across Lyra's movements from shelves to safe to mirror positioning. The setting constrains her final choice—she must work within the hollow's geometry to arrange light—and charges the closure image ("sky inside walls" becomes literal via the trunk's apertures). Sensory detail is weighted toward touch and sound ("wood's memory: whispered debates"), fitting the POV's professional filter. The 4:47 AM timestamp and demolition machines provide both urgency and a ticking environmental presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the library's essence before demolition—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when Lyra discovers the coin reveals "true purpose," forcing her to shift from charcoal/paint to light-craft. Agency is present but largely intellectual; her realization that "faces were merely one form of identity" feels more like thematic arrival than a decision that forecloses a live alternative. The final act (arranging mirrors, walking away with the coin) carries conceptual cost under the Accumulative lens: the portrait "existed now in memory and light," meaning physical preservation is abandoned. Pressure coheres but does not escalate through reversals; the piece deepens understanding rather than narrowing options under mounting opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—alternative sight, preservation through loss, identity beyond faces—emerges organically from the coin's spiraling map and Lyra's mirror-craft without overt thesis statements. The final image "carrying the sky inside her own walls" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how the library endures, reweighting prior material (the charter's "mirror the sky inside walls") with earned metaphorical closure. Subtext operates in the guild's choice of a face-blind artist and the coin's recursive carvings. Minor slip: "some things could only be seen by those who couldn't see" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though it remains woven into action. The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity—the library falls, yet persists conceptually.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Lyra reads texture ("faint indentations...like braille") and sound over visual cues—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register unmotivated by her tactile trade: "fractally precise detail," "crystalline clarity," "unbroken chain of human knowledge" feel more authorial than artisan. Dialogue (the scholar's closing whisper) is brief and functional. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully, shortening at 4:47 AM to mark completion. The piece teaches a contemplative, lyric cadence early and holds it; no jarring shifts. Filter verbs ("she'd already discovered," "she realized") are present but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with subject-verb structures in sequence ("She ran," "She'd already discovered," "She began to craft"). Two paraphrase loops: paragraph four restates "coin revealed...true purpose" across multiple lines, and paragraph eight recaps "her condition wasn't a limitation" after the realization was dramatized in paragraph six (−0.4). Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "cathedral of knowledge" clashes with "hollow trunk" in physicality. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. The final line "carrying the sky inside her own walls" lands cleanly without scaffold. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; minor redundancy prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia as artist's constraint offers a fresh synthesis, and the coin-as-portrait-map device is specific. However, the premise—artist memorializes condemned historic site through unconventional medium on deadline—echoes widely used writing templates without full transformation; the emotional arc (deficiency becomes strength) follows a familiar trajectory. The piece commits fully to its logic and avoids hedging, and the mirror-light method is inventive within the frame. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and lyric closure, which heighten thematic resonance without obscuring causality. Specificity in guild history and verdigris coin anchor the concept, preventing generic "everywhere" setting. The synthesis feels coherent rather than inevitable; one additional lived complication or non-obvious moral calculus would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and makes key choices: to explore the safe, to read the coin, to use mirrors instead of traditional media, to keep the coin. Setup is immediate (paragraph one). Development: her realization that "faces were merely one form of identity" (mid-story) shifts her method from charcoal to light. Payoff: she walks away with the coin, her prosopagnosia reframed as asset. Causal pressure is present but largely interior; her condition enables the tactile coin-reading but does not constrain a harder trade-off on the page. Two-gate minimum met (setup + payoff via lyric reprise); middle beat is contemplative rather than decisional. Band guidance: one distinct decision (method shift) + closure participation + early signal = ~6.0–6.5 range; specificity of coin-reading and final stance nudge upward slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Secret book safe appears in paragraph three (setup within first third). Development: Lyra discovers it, retrieves the coin, reads its map—two distinct beats (discovery, tactile reading). Payoff: the scholar gives her the coin to keep, and it becomes the vessel of preservation at closure. Causal pressure: the coin's spiral map directly enables her mirror arrangement, narrowing her method from abstraction to spatial geometry. Specificity: verdigris, faint indentations, centuries-old, faces spiraling inward—irreplaceable details. Closure linkage: the coin reappears in the scholar's hand and Lyra's pocket, charged as the story's final preservation token. Three gates met + two-beat involvement + causal constraint + closure charge = high 7.0–8.4 band. Minor limiter: the coin does not impose a visible cost or dilemma; it enables rather than constrains, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Core concept "discovering limits" is thematized in paragraph six: "Lyra discovered her limits and transcended them." Setup is implicit from the start (prosopagnosia as limit). Development: mid-story realization that "her inability to see faces had always defined her art" reframes the constraint. Payoff: "her condition wasn't a limitation but a different kind of sight" at closure. The concept shapes her internal arc but does not create on-page tactical friction—no moment where she hits a boundary, fails, adapts with cost. It operates more as reflective theme than pressure mechanism. Two gates met (setup as implicit frame, payoff as realization); middle beat is contemplative. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-5.0–6.9 range; lack of dramatized cost or decision-forcing caps it at lower 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise detail" appears twice: paragraph two (her craft ability) and paragraph eight (coin indentations). Setup: immediate, as trait label. Development: the trait enables her to read the coin's map "like braille" (one functional beat). Payoff: not visibly present in the closure image. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page choice where precision matters with cost—no scene where imprecision would fail or hyperaccuracy exacts a price. Swappability: "meticulous" or "tactile mastery" would serve nearly as well. Two-gate minimum (setup + one middle beat) met, but ornamental description without constraint or tradeoff. Band guidance: functional but replaceable = 3.0–4.9; one beat involvement + early signal nudge to upper 4.0s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Action "craft" is signaled in the commission (paragraph two) and executed in paragraph five (arranging mirrors, directing moonbeams). Setup: immediate. Development: the crafting method shifts from traditional media to light-sculpture mid-story, one key turn. Payoff: the light-portrait is completed at 4:47 AM; guild members "moved through the light-patterns...becoming part of the portrait themselves," charging the final image. Specificity: mirrors, moonbeams, spiral pattern, gaps in trunk—mechanics matter and are irreplaceable. Causal pressure: her realization about identity forces the method change. Two distinct beats (decision to craft light, completion) + closure participation + causal constraint = 7.0–8.4 band. Minor limiter: the action is described more than dramatized moment-by-moment; no tactile struggle or micro-failure visible on the page, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Method "through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin" is introduced in paragraph three and read tactilely in paragraph four. Setup: late first third. Development: the coin's spiral map "directed" her mirror arrangement—one causal beat where the method enables the solution. Payoff: the coin is handed to Lyra and carried away, reprising its function as memory vessel at closure. Specificity: the indentations form a map of faces, readable only by touch, irreplaceable to her prosopagnosia. Two-gate minimum met (setup + payoff); middle beat is functional. Causal linkage: without the coin's spiral, her light design lacks blueprint. Band guidance: one enabling beat + closure reprise + specificity = mid-6.0–6.9. Late introduction (second third) and lack of a second developmental beat cap at lower 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tree trunk library appears immediately and anchors every beat. Setup: paragraph one. Development: the hollow's geometry (carved shelves, gaps, curved walls) enables the mirror-light craft in paragraph five and constrains spatial choreography throughout. Payoff: the library's physical face (scars, patina, ladder marks) is the portrait's subject, and its demolition is the closure's cost. Causal pressure: the trunk's apertures allow moonbeam entry; its condemned state imposes the deadline. Specificity: four centuries old, hollowed by scholars, astronomy texts, reading nooks—irreplaceable micro-setting. Three gates met + two-beat involvement (exploration, light arrangement) + closure charge + visible cost (demolition) = high 7.0–8.4 band, near 8.5 threshold. Exceeds typical micro-setting function; the space is co-protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "hush just before demolition" is introduced in the opening line ("crew would arrive at dawn, but Lyra still had three hours"). Setup: immediate. Development: the countdown tightens decisions implicitly, though no mid-story beat shows her racing the clock or altering tactics due to time pressure. Payoff: "4:47 AM, Lyra finished" followed by "first demolition machines rumbled closer"—the deadline arrives and she departs, charging the ending. The "heightened stillness" tone supports the temporal frame. Two gates met (setup + payoff); middle pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Band guidance: early signal + lyric reprise at closure + tone contribution = mid-5.0–6.9. Lack of a second on-page choice forced by the ticking clock (e.g., abandoning a step to meet deadline) caps at lower 6.0s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to mirror the sky inside walls" is introduced in paragraph two as the guild's commission and the old charter's promise. Setup: early first third. Development: Lyra's light-craft in paragraph five literalizes the phrase—moonbeams through trunk gaps create the "sky inside." Payoff: she walks away "carrying the sky inside her own walls," metaphorically internalizing the mission. Specificity: the phrase is tied to the charter and enacted through spatial mechanics, not generic. Two-beat involvement (commission framing, execution). Friction: the motivation is pursued without visible conflict between want and cost—no moment where fulfilling it forces her to sacrifice an alternative desire. Band guidance: two beats + setup + payoff + specificity = 6.0–6.9; lack of on-page friction or trade-off caps at mid-6.0s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "heightened stillness" is established in paragraph two ("heightened stillness before demolition gave everything crystalline clarity") and sustained: "No birds sang; even the wind held its breath." Setup: early. Development: the tone modulates with discovery (coin reading) and creation (mirror work) without breaking into urgency, holding contemplative pressure. Payoff: the final paragraph maintains stillness ("walked away as the sunrise began") even as machines rumble, charging the closure with quiet rather than crescendo. Coherence across turns is strong; the tone reflects POV's meditative craft practice. Specificity: stillness is tied to the condemned space's liminal state, not generic. Three gates met + modulation under pressure + closure charge = 7.0–8.4 band. The tone is indispensable to the piece's emotional architecture, near upper threshold.</comment>
