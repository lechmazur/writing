<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's interiority is established through her ritual and process, but her emotional stakes remain abstract—we see careful invention without visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's clipboard and her developed system provide texture, yet no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with cost. The ending crystallizes her stance without dramatizing a path foreclosed or a genuine struggle that compels the reader to feel what she risked or renounced.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through chalk ritual, client backstory, and postal-truck choreography, but no meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options or alters knowledge on the page. The ending offers continuity ("tomorrow she would return") rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the final image restates the premise without reweighting it. No visible price is paid or path foreclosed at closure.</comment>

<comment>The golden arcade, brass fixtures, marble floor, and skylights are vividly rendered and filtered through Mira's professional focus. Spatial choreography (chalk sprawl visible from above, depot next door, entrance gate) remains coherent across the scene. The chalk and analog camera constrain her process, and the arcade's emptiness charges the final image of seed-carrying across the continent, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—crafting a pseudonym that gives the client a "true" identity—is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. Mira completes her work without obstacle, reversal, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, and no visible price alters her tactics. The piece accumulates texture (chalk, client backstory, postal trucks) but lacks the one meaningful escalation or deepening choice required to enter the 7-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—connection and identity in an age of algorithmic naming and rediscovered physicality—emerges from particulars (chalk codes, surface mail, antique-shop longing) rather than statement. The final image of "seeds of an older, newer world" leans toward overt metaphor but remains grounded in the postal trucks and Mira's vault. No epiphany or thematic turn reweights prior material with non-literal cost; the ending restates the premise without a resonant question or friction.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (professional attention to chalk symbols, inherited tools, analog rituals) is distinct and consistent. Diction is confident and purposeful ("juxtapose the authentic self against the performed one"), with rhythmic variation across paragraphs. Brief elisions (client's full backstory, chalk decoding mechanics) serve compression without harming clarity, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (each line advances setting, ritual, or theme), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, a paraphrase loop appears in the opening third: "Its brass fixtures catching the first light" and "The arcade's skylights began to glow gold" restate the dawn-light motif without added pressure (−0.2). A template-stem cluster in the middle ("She was…She had developed…She consulted") adds slight cadence monotony (−0.3). No loops touch the closure beat, capping deductions under the non-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—pseudonym creator for a surface-mail renaissance—offers a fresh synthesis of retro-futurism and artisanal identity craft, grounded in specific detail (chalk codes, analog camera, copper-stamped trucks). Yet the emotional arc and thematic question could function unchanged with a different craft; swapping "pseudonym" for "bespoke letterpress" or "custom wax seals" would preserve structure and tone. No bold risk or non-obvious turn deepens the stakes; the piece executes its concept without transforming it into an inevitable, irreplaceable vision.</comment>
