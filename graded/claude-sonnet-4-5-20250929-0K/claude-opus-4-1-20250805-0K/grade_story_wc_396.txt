<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("empathy could take root," "shadows into shields") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The keeper functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying immediate pressure through relationship dynamics. The final transformation—shadows becoming "invitation" rather than armor—is asserted through metaphor without a concrete on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice remains generically elevated throughout rather than degrading or sharpening under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/investigative lens: Mira arrives, explores, understands the orchard's function, and departs enlightened. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—she faces no opposition, makes no sacrifice, and her understanding unfolds as smooth accretion rather than through a pressure point that narrows options. The closure is a thematic restatement ("proof that even the most courageous anomaly could serve peace") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice floes is vividly established and the warmth-from-understanding conceit provides clear sensory contrast. The vintage store's mirrors and the apple trees are described with specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice—Mira moves through the space without spatial obstacles or resource pressures. The orchard's impossibility is told more than felt through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the temporal anomaly—is signaled early but never escalates into a dilemma that forces trade-offs. Mira encounters no meaningful opposition; the keeper is an ally who explains rather than resists. The merchant's backstory provides narrative texture but does not create present tension. No on-page reversal tightens options or deepens cost; Mira's departure with the apple is confirmation of understanding, not a choice with visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of empathy-as-transformation emerges clearly through the orchard's function and the merchant's failed harvest. However, the final paragraph summarizes the theme explicitly ("proof that even the most courageous anomaly could serve peace") rather than letting image and action carry resonance. The mirrors and apples recur but primarily as thematic tokens rather than particulars that constrain present choice. The piece gestures toward "violence breeds in groups, peace grows in solitude" but this insight is declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent register and POV control throughout; no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts. Diction remains elevated and fairly abstract ("shadow-woven uniform rippling with borrowed darkness," "emotional architecture") which fits a lyric investigative mode but lacks sentence-level variation under pressure. Dialogue, when present, serves exposition cleanly but without subtext or character-specific idiom. The keeper's speech ("Every tyrant's nightmare") and Mira's ("They're bridges") converge in tone and rhythm rather than revealing distinct perceptual signatures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>句Sentence rhythm is controlled and paragraph structure varies purposefully. However, multiple lines rely on abstract metaphor stacks ("shadow-laced," "shadow-woven," "gentle darkness") and elevated diction ("reconstituting," "crystallizes," "cartography of empathy") that create a consistent lyric wash rather than sharpening under pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "warmth generates from understanding" in the climax echoes "warmth pulse through wood" in the opening without added pressure. The final paragraph over-explains theme ("proof that...") where image alone would suffice. No hard artifacts touch closure, but density could tighten throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice and the vintage-mirror repository offer visual specificity, but the core premise—magical location teaches empathy to visiting investigator—follows a familiar template without transformation through character dilemma or non-obvious moral calculus. The merchant's shattered-crystal-ball backstory provides texture but remains offstage and explanatory. Mira's journey is observation and confirmation rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its lyric investigative mode but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira (shadow-laced peacekeeper) is present throughout and her role frames the investigation. However, her choices do not create key turns—she accepts the keeper's explanations, understands the merchant's failure, and departs enlightened. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup clear, closure participation present (she departs as "gardener"), but middle development shows observation rather than agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in paragraph two (Mira finds a shard in the tree trunk), returns in the vintage store where it "hummed in resonance," and is used in a key beat where Mira holds it up to see the merchant's final moments. Three distinct touches across setup, middle, and closure. However, the fragment's role is primarily revelatory (shows backstory) rather than constraining present choice or enabling a tactic with visible cost. The mechanics of how it reveals the merchant's moments are not explained, reducing causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named explicitly in the final paragraph ("proof that even the most courageous anomaly could serve peace") but functions primarily as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The orchard's anomalous warmth and temporal fractures are described, but Mira does not face a dilemma tied to the courage of embracing or containing the anomaly. Present throughout as concept, but not dramatized as a choice-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is demonstrated in Mira's movement through the shop ("her intuition reading the emotional architecture") and her smooth synthesis of understanding. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost—she never faces a moment where calm intuition fails or forces a trade-off. Label-plus-demonstration without friction or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" appears explicitly when the keeper explains how the orchard "reconstituted [the merchant's] rejected empathy through these mirrors" and again in the final paragraph ("mirrors continued their patient work, reconstituting broken hearts"). The action names the orchard's transformative function and links to the mirrors' role. However, it describes backstory (what happened to the merchant's shattered denial) rather than driving an on-page turn that Mira causes or navigates with cost. Present in setup and closure, but swappable with "transformed" or "reforged" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Via glimpses in vintage store mirrors" is the mechanism through which empathy is taught. The mirrors are introduced in the vintage store paragraph, shown holding "trapped glimpses" of compassionate acts, and Mira uses one to see her younger self and possible future. The method is signaled early, shapes the middle exploration beat, and charges the ending ("mirrors continued their patient work"). However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how the glimpses teach or alter action is told rather than shown through a concrete choice Mira makes differently because of what she sees.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes is vividly established in the opening and referenced at closure ("She descended toward the ice"). The contrast between impossible warmth and grinding cold anchors the central conceit. However, the setting does not pressure Mira's choices—she moves through it without spatial obstacles, resource scarcity, or environmental threats. The ice floes' "ancient dance" frames atmosphere but does not alter tactics. Setup strong, closure participation present, but middle development shows postcard use rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" appears once as metaphor in the keeper's dialogue paragraph ("that sacred pause where choice crystallizes") but does not function as a literal timeframe that tightens decisions. The story unfolds in a single continuous visit without time pressure or deadline. The phrase gestures toward a contemplative mode but does not constrain pacing or tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is Mira's implied mission and explicitly named by the keeper ("This orchard exists to map empathy onto action"). The motivation frames her investigation and is confirmed in the ending ("She would carry these fragments back...as seeds of transformation"). However, it is never conflicted—no moment shows friction between empathy and action, or a cost Mira pays to pursue this mapping. Told and thematically present, but not dramatized through struggle or trade-off.</comment>
