<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus's motivation to remain and understand is told rather than shown through consequential micro-choices under pressure. His frostbite recovery functions as atmospheric detail but doesn't constrain present decisions. Elena's return registers more as symbolic fulfillment than earned character agency—her seven-year absence and throat surgeries are summarized, not dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final exchange with the bolt feels like ceremony rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece employs an Accumulative lens: seven years of backstory accumulate toward Elena's return and the single note at closure. However, the closure unit—Elena playing "something new"—remains abstract and the cost unclear on the page; we're told the fortress walls warm but not what Marcus or Elena have foreclosed. The causal link between her kneeling at the staircase discoloration and her present choice to play is asserted, not dramatized. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) is gestured at but the felt cost is diffuse.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The cobalt fortress, frostbite, and the discolored seventh step are vivid and specific. The piano bench bolt and the bell tower's acoustic channels ground the world in tactile detail. However, the spatial choreography of Elena's seven-year journey to the bell tower and her daily kneeling is vague—how does she access a closed hotel? The fortress's warming at the end charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the micro-setting of the music room doesn't constrain the ending choice.</comment>

<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cost of unpardonable silence—is declared but never tested through a present tightening or trade-off. Marcus's seven-year wait and Elena's return happen in summary; no on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The ending's "single note" is told as transformative without showing what tactics or paths are foreclosed. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the pressure remains static from opening to close.</comment>

<comment>The theme of silence versus sound, and the cost of demanding performance over truth, emerges clearly from the choir incident and Elena's response. The piano bench bolt and the fortress's acoustic channels accumulate symbolic weight without becoming checklist motifs. However, the final paragraph's thesis—"safety wasn't found in silence or sound, but in the choice of when to offer each gift"—is stated rather than embodied in a non-literal image, lowering thematic resonance. The fortress warming offers a lyric answer but the articulation in Marcus's reflection dilutes it.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as focalizer; no head-hopping. The prose carries a heightened, slightly archaic register ("seraphically mundane," "transmuted into something else") that suits the gothic-romantic tone. However, phrases like "the agreement between sound and silence" and "frostbitten hope that beauty could survive" veer into authorial thesis rather than Marcus's perceptual signature. Elena's whispered line—"I had to learn to remain silent"—lands cleanly and advances the thematic question through dialogue.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several passages loop conceptually: "some silences were unpardonable" in paragraph one is restated as "unpardonable silence" in paragraph four and "the cost of safety in silence" in paragraph five—synonym churn without escalation. "Seraphically mundane" and "transmuted into something else" elevate diction beyond Marcus's blue-collar bellhop idiom. The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("frostbitten hope," "regenerating nerves singing with something that felt almost like music") in a single beat, muddying clarity. No paraphrase loops across adjacent lines, so the deduction remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of acoustic architecture, vocal trauma, and redemptive return is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—exile, self-punishment, return, and symbolic reconciliation—follows a familiar template without a fresh inflection in the ending. The fortress-as-sentient-witness (walls warming, stones humming approval) reads as convenient rather than earned through prior world logic. The piece commits to its gothic-romantic premise but the closure gesture (single note, warming walls) remains abstract rather than grounded in a non-obvious particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus as bellhop and sole returnee is present throughout. He carries luggage, keeps the bolt, and hands it to Elena—three beats. However, his agency is observational and facilitating rather than choice-driven; he does not face a dilemma or make a decision that alters tactics. His "understanding" is told in summary. Present across beats but his role could be filled by any witness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The piano bench bolt is seeded early (paragraph three), kept in Marcus's pocket as talisman (paragraph four), and handed to Elena in the penultimate paragraph—three distinct beats. Its presence enables the final beat (Elena at the piano). However, its specific properties (why this bolt matters mechanically) are not leveraged; it functions as symbolic key rather than irreplaceable object. Strong closure linkage and repetition lift it into mid-6s but swappability (any keepsake could serve) caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Unpardonable silence" is named in paragraph one and paragraph four, and the choir's permanent voicelessness literalizes it. The concept shapes the backstory stakes but does not constrain a present choice or alter tactics on the page. The ending reweights it thematically (Elena's new composition "embraces both sound and silence") but the cost tied to "unpardonable" remains abstract. Thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.1</grade>
<comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes Elena's pre-incident dedication to the Chopin nocturne. It characterizes her past devotion but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. The trait is mentioned once in paragraph three and does not return or generate a visible trade-off. Label-only use; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Marcus's choice to "remain" anchors his seven-year vigil and distinguishes him from other staff who fled. It is seeded in paragraph one and paragraph five and motivates his presence at closure. However, the act of remaining is completed in backstory; the present scene does not dramatize a renewed choice to stay or a cost tied to staying. The action is essential to setup but does not drive a turn in the present window.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The "discoloration on the seventh step" is introduced in paragraph two, explained as Elena's kneeling spot in paragraph five, and Elena pauses there again in paragraph six—three beats. It signals Elena's presence and primes her return. However, its mechanics (how kneeling creates discoloration, why it matters acoustically) are vague, and it does not constrain a choice. Lyric reprise that reweights but does not pressure; eligible for low-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt fortress is named in the opening line, its ice-glazed walls and acoustic channels are detailed, and the warming walls charge the final image. The fortress's "ancient acoustics" caused the choir's voice loss (paragraph four) and its stones whisper apology (paragraph five), shaping backstory causality. However, the fortress does not constrain a present choice; its sentient approval at the end is atmospheric rather than tactical. Strong closure linkage and specificity but no live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Seven winters" and "nerve regeneration" frame the timeline and Marcus's frostbite is mentioned in paragraphs one and five. However, the regeneration does not create a ticking clock or constrain present action; it functions as metaphor ("his regenerating nerves singing") rather than live pressure. The timeframe is told and static, not tracked or leveraged.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Marcus's desire "to understand the cost of safety in silence" is stated in paragraph five. It motivates his seven-year stay but is not dramatized through a present dilemma or conflicting want. The motivation is told rather than tested; no on-page friction between understanding and another cost. Declared but not embodied in choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>"Frostbitten hope" is named in the penultimate paragraph and the tone—melancholic yet redemptive—is coherent throughout. The fortress's cold isolation and Marcus's numb hands establish "frostbitten," and Elena's return and the warming walls establish "hope." The tone modulates from stasis to tentative renewal and charges the final image. However, the phrase itself arrives late (second-to-last paragraph) rather than being established early, and the tonal shift is told ("frostbitten hope") rather than embodied solely in image. Strong coherence and closure charge, but late explicit naming and summary articulation lower the score slightly.</comment>
