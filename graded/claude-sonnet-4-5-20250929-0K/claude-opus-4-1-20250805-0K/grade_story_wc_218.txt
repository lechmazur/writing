<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to bridge species and accept her terminal diagnosis is clearly rooted, and the tumor-as-electromagnetic-signature device is introduced early. However, her interior landscape lacks genuine contradiction—she moves through revelation and acceptance with remarkably smooth philosophical clarity ("brazen calm" becomes a shield against dramatized fear or doubt). The emotional progression feels more like enlightened acceptance than the messy, irrational layering expected under terminal pressure. Micro-choices exist (wire placement, diary documentation) but they illustrate a thesis rather than reveal competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure lands on the page: Mira understands her role as translator and stakes her final months on teaching the next caretaker, a Charged Poise configuration where options crystallize with felt cost (her death reframed as "appointment"). Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—copper network builds toward conceptual reweighting rather than causal reversal—and holds through the ending. The cost is conceptual and relational (she will die into translation; the orchard's patience continues) but the price is more stated than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when the network completes and she realizes the tumor's function, narrowing her path to teaching and documentation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The copper wire, oak branches, volcanic stone pillars, and orchard are vividly detailed with purpose-driven specificity: wire tension, spiral direction, and phosphorescence constrain her actions and charge the final image when she places her palm against the pillar. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's scientific attention (electromagnetic pulses, mineral phosphorescence). The temple orchard functions as micro-setting, supplying resources (diary, copper, root networks) that alter her tactics and reweights meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across her nighttime installation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent resort conversion by demonstrating interspecies communication—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the copper network completes and she grasps the tumor's role, foreclosing retreat and committing her to the translator path. However, the escalation feels more like revelation unfolding than genuine pressure: the orchard waits patiently, the trustees are offstage, and Mira's agency reads as philosophical acceptance rather than a choice that trades competing goods. Cost is present (she will die into this purpose) but the price is conceptual and future-facing rather than paid in the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—interspecies communication and the reframing of terminal diagnosis as sacred appointment—emerges organically from concrete particulars (copper wire, root networks, phosphorescing stone) rather than statement. The diary's closing line "to die at the correct frequency" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in image (leaves rustling without wind, stone glowing) and the orchard's "ancient patience." However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo when Mira explicitly names the temple's purpose as "monument to the possibility of interspecies respect"—a prompt-adjacent articulation that replaces scene pressure with thesis summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with clear focalization through Mira's scientific-yet-reverent perceptual signature: she notices electromagnetic pulses, mineral phosphorescence, and mathematical patterns. Diction remains voice-consistent ("gently systematic precision," "brazen calm") with selective technical vocabulary (electromagnetic signature, crystalline structures) anchored in her caretaker role. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure—shorter beats when the network completes, reflective rhythms during realization. One minor register drift: "monument to the possibility of interspecies respect" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, but the slip is brief and does not obscure the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing double work (e.g., "The diagnosis had arrived like salt spray on a windless day" anchors both terminal illness and island setting). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in the final section: "monument to the possibility of interspecies respect, built not by humans but by the slow collaboration of wood and stone, mediated by those wise enough to die into translation" stacks abstractions where a single concrete image would carry more force. The phrase "brazen calm" itself feels slightly writerly-precious when repeated without embodied dramatization of that contradictory state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—terminal brain tumor as electromagnetic bridge for interspecies communication—is specific and non-obvious, integrating botanical diary, copper wiring, and volcanic stone into a coherent premise. The transformation of "six months to live" into "appointment" and "translator" offers fresh inflection on terminal diagnosis narratives. However, the core frame (dying protagonist discovers hidden purpose, teaches next generation) follows a recognizable template, and the piece does not fully dramatize the moral calculus or lived friction that would make the premise feel inevitable rather than conceptually elegant. Risk-taking is present in the unusual premise but cushioned by Mira's frictionless acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive all key turns: accepting the caretaker role, wrapping copper wire through the night, completing the network, and deciding to teach rather than remodel. She appears in every beat and her final decision to document and demonstrate the conversation shapes closure. Her agency is clear and causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diary appears in the opening beat (given by the doctor), reveals the predecessor's discovery (middle justification for copper work), and is reopened at closure when Mira writes her own entry. However, its physical handling is minimal—mostly summary of what it contained. It enables her understanding but does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost; it functions more as exposition device than active object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Architectural secrets (living stone pillars fused with roots, temple as council chamber, electromagnetic translation via copper) shape the dominant stake: prevent resort remodeling by revealing the communication network. The concept drives her nighttime installation work and alters her final stance (teach recognition, not renovation). It is signaled early, developed across beats, and directly informs closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is illustrated through her wire placement ("each copper coil placed according to mathematical patterns," "exact angles, tension levels, spiral directions") and constrains her method—she cannot rush or improvise. However, no on-page moment shows the trait costing her something (speed, flexibility) or enabling a breakthrough another approach would miss. It reads as consistent characterization but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Remodel" is the inciting pressure (trustees expect plans), inverted at closure (she will show them the conversation, not building plans), and semantically repriced throughout (what needs remodeling is human perception, not the temple). It drives the central tension and is integral to the ending's conceptual reversal. However, the trustees remain offstage and the remodel demand never tests her with an immediate on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapping is signaled in paragraph two, detailed through the night's installation (angles, tension, spiral direction), and completes the orchard network that triggers the final revelation. The method is irreplaceable: diary specifies it, mechanics shape her tactics, and the completed circuit enables the phosphorescence and vibration that prove interspecies communication. It appears across at least three distinct beats and charges the closure image when she touches the pillar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Temple orchard with living stone pillars supplies the root networks, copper anchor points, and phosphorescing minerals that enable Mira's work. The setting is introduced early, detailed through her installation, and charges the final image (palm against pillar, feeling orchard patience). The volcanic stone's fusion with roots is irreplaceable to the premise. It pressures every beat and makes the closure tactile.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Six-month timeframe is stated in the opening, creates urgency ("Mira had six months"), and is repriced at closure ("six months wasn't a death sentence—it was an appointment"). The timeline tightens her choices (teach one person, document patterns) and the tumor's timing is integral to the electromagnetic signature mechanic. However, no on-page clock tracks elapsed days or forces a mid-scene tactical shift; time functions more as thematic frame than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interspecies respect is dramatized through her copper installation, the orchard conversation she decodes, and her final decision to demonstrate rather than remodel. The desire is embodied in action (making connections, writing documentation) and conflicts with the trustees' resort plan. It drives closure when she commits to recognition over renovation. Slight deduction: the motivation is more thesis-driven than internally conflicted—she embraces it smoothly without dramatized friction between self-preservation instinct and altruistic mission.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is stated twice and illustrated through her methodical wire-work under terminal pressure and her final act of writing with "brazen calm." The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (reflective in diary moments, focused during installation). However, the tone is more asserted than embodied: we are told she is calm and bold, but her interiority lacks the contradictory fear or rage that would make "brazen" feel earned rather than decorative. It charges the ending but doesn't deepen through the turns.</comment>
