<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marta's characterization rests primarily on assertion and occupational labels rather than embodied contradiction. Her "empathetically decisive nature" is told via narrator summary ("knowing exactly which book a troubled patron needed before they asked") without dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The climactic scene presents her conducting the elevators, but her internal conflict—if any—remains opaque; she executes a plan without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. Emotional states are declared ("her voice grew stronger, more vigorous yet tender") rather than shown through specific gesture or perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The closure effect—grain elevators singing and neighbors gathering to cooperate—is asserted rather than dramatized with felt cost on the page. The story summarizes the overnight transformation ("by dawn, the entire agricultural district was awake") without showing Marta's decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization that changes her options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in aspiration, yet the final image recycles the opening motif (elevators singing, languages interwoven) without reweighting stakes or imposing visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive late: we learn "choral librarian" and the tower's location only after extended metaphor, delaying clarity past the ~120-word window by roughly 200 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain elevators are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (brass gears, corrugated walls as vocal cords, glass dome). Spatial choreography is clear throughout Marta's climb and descent, and the cuckoo clock weight's arc provides micro-setting constraint. However, the environment remains largely a stage rather than shaping choices: the tower amplifies sound, but Marta's plan proceeds without environmental complication or resource scarcity. Sensory selection leans heavily visual and auditory; touch, taste, and proprioception are absent even during the stair climb and weight-rigging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rehabilitating the dying agricultural district—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Marta's plan succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost; the elevators respond immediately, neighbors emerge without resistance, and cooperation blooms overnight. No credible opposition or internal friction appears to narrow her options. The story declares escalation ("coaxing decades of isolation from the structures like drawing poison from a wound") but dramatizes only smooth execution, leaving pressure flat across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of connection versus isolation emerges clearly through the grain elevator metaphor and multilingual bridge-building. The final card ("Every voice matters in the choir") edges toward thematic statement but stops short of sermonizing. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing throughout ("construct bridges from silos," "rehabilitation begins not with demolition but with teaching old structures to speak") that reads as thematic echo rather than earned resonance. The ending offers a conceptual answer without dramatizing the cost or ambiguity that would deepen reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marta with purposeful narrative distance. Diction carries some perceptual signature ("practiced grace," "borrowed starlight") that suggests elevated register fitting a librarian's interior. However, under peak pressure the prose retains uniform lyricism without modulation: "vigorous, tender" appears as narrator declaration rather than POV-inflected perception. No dialogue appears on the page to test voice distinction. Psychic distance stays consistent, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("sentinel against the prairie sky," "acoustic bridges," "painting time signatures in the air") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum in high-pressure beats. Template cadence runs appear in the middle section: "The second elevator joined in... Then the third, the fourth—each adding..." Stock metaphors accumulate ("drawing poison from a wound," "cosmic dance") without fresh inflection. Paraphrase loops occur between adjacent paragraphs that restate the elevators' response and neighbors' emergence. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—singing grain elevators as rehabilitation tool—offers initial novelty, yet execution follows a predictable arc: magical solution introduced, applied without complication, and succeeds overnight. The multilingual element remains ornamental rather than integrated into causal pressure. Emotional beats rely on generic templates of community healing without specific, verifiable detail rooted in agricultural economics or social friction. The story's central turn is a convenience rather than an earned synthesis; removing the magical singing and replacing it with a more grounded community intervention would not alter the emotional or thematic arc, suggesting swappability at the core.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Marta is present throughout and frames the action, but her decisions are summary rather than dramatized; she executes a pre-formed plan without on-page choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Her choral librarian occupation is mentioned but does not constrain tactics or enable a pivot under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight appears in two distinct beats: hidden weeks ago, then attached to create the pendulum. Its swing "paints time signatures" and remains visible through the dawn scene. However, its function is largely atmospheric; removing it and using any pendulum or resonance device would not break story logic. The object does not return with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Grain elevators singing is the story's central conceit, present from discovery through climax. The concept shapes Marta's goal and the neighbors' response, and the elevators' voices carry linguistic and acoustic properties that matter on the page. However, the mechanics remain asserted rather than tested; elevators respond on cue without complication, so the concept does not constrain tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is introduced as narrator summary in the tower scene ("her empathetically decisive nature had always served her well") but never demonstrated through on-page micro-choice with visible cost. The attribute is label-only, mentioned once and not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" appears in the setup, frames the dominant stake, and is fulfilled at closure when neighbors plan cooperative harvests. The action drives the overall arc and is present in the ending image. However, the rehabilitation occurs via magical solution rather than through protagonist choices that trade one value for another, so the action does not impose felt cost or redefine options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is signaled early ("Escuchame... Hor zu"), demonstrated in the climactic conducting scene where each elevator responds to different linguistic frequencies, and remains active through the neighbors' multilingual recognition. The method shapes Marta's tactics on the page and appears in the closure frame. Removing this exact mechanic would require substantial rewrite of the middle and ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is present from the opening line, provides the resonance chamber and gear mechanism that enable Marta's plan, and frames both the climb and descent. Its glass dome, spiral stairs, and acoustics designed by monks constrain her approach and amplify the result. The setting appears in or shapes the ending when Marta descends to find neighbors gathered "at the tower's base." The tower is causally active across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" anchors the opening night scene and recurs in the dawn resolution ("above them the real stars faded"), but elapsed time is vague. No clock pressure tightens Marta's decisions; the night passes in summary ("By dawn") without tracking hours or urgency that would alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Construct bridges from silos" is stated in Marta's reflection ("she had discovered something remarkable: when the elevators talked... creating acoustic bridges") and reappears in the final paragraph as thematic summary. The motivation frames her goal but is not dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. Told-only dominates; we do not see Marta struggle with competing desires or pay a price to pursue this bridge-building.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" appears once as narrator declaration ("Marta's voice grew stronger, more vigorous yet tender") and is echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("vigorous, tender song of reconnection"). The tone is asserted rather than earned through modulating rhythm or diction under pressure. Sentences maintain uniform lyricism throughout; no coherent tonal shift occurs between setup and closure that charges the final image.</comment>
