<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's interiority is specific and purposeful—her decades of communion with the place and the careful shepherding of prophecy fragments show character-particular thinking. The work is solitary, so relationship pressure is absent, but her mentor's past teaching anchors her method with embodied memory. However, the final choice to disperse the prophecy lacks visible internal conflict; she executes her plan without competing impulses or genuine struggle, which flattens the peak moment. The competence is consistent but unchallenged by doubt or cost that would foreclose a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening lines (who, where, when). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the summoner gathers fragments, weaves silence, and disperses prophecy into the brook in a density-building sequence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she releases the prophecy and her nocturnal haven transforms at dawn, the footprints "soon smooth away" coding finality and acceptance. Cost is felt in the transformation of her haven from "less real" and the acceptance that "some truths were kindest when allowed to remain whispers." One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy's resistance fades and the wing crumbles, reweighting her night's labor into dispersal rather than destruction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is vividly anchored: brook-mist, flat stone, reeds, and the water's murmur all constrain and enable her ritual. The brook itself becomes a tool—she maps silence across the glade, uses water to carry prophecy fragments, and the final image of footprints smoothed by the brook charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her decades of communion; the morning light's transformation of the space into "something altogether different—brighter but somehow less real" reweights the setting at closure. The environment supplies resources (water's white noise, moth-thoughts, owl-dreams) and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the night-long working.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear early: silence a prophecy that threatens to become self-fulfilling. Pressure accumulates through the night as prophecy fragments struggle and she gathers each one, patient and methodical. The tightening occurs when "wars prevented, loves that would never bloom, a kingdom that would never fall" press against her barriers with "blazing potential energy"—the cost of dispersal becomes legible. However, the protagonist's agency is execution of a learned method rather than a choice under competing pressures; coincidence does not intrude, but genuine escalation through forced trade-offs is absent. The resolution is earned by her decades of preparation, but the final act feels procedural rather than forged in the crucible of the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: the cost of preventing futures, the paradox of silencing prophecy to preserve peace, and the kindness of allowing truths to remain whispers. The crane's wing and brook function as recurring images that shift meaning—the wing unfolds layers of forbidden futures, then crumbles; the brook carries destiny away, then resumes cheerful babbling. The final image reweights prior material: "some blazes were best experienced as ember-glow, and some truths were kindest when allowed to remain whispers" arises from concrete action rather than thesis. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic statement ("in that ignorance lay a peculiar kind of peace") where a pure image would have been stronger. The mentor's teaching "give them somewhere to go" anchors method in wisdom earned through prior experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the summoner notices constellations, shadow, and silence with practiced care. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven, with phrases like "terrestrially cosmic twin" and "invisible fruit" establishing a lyric register consistent with her vocation. However, elevated metaphorical density pervades even procedural beats—"prophecies were living things that grew louder with each telling" and "coded words trying to leap...in bursts of luminous script"—which occasionally prioritizes texture over momentum. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is stable. The prose reflects her mindset under pressure, though at peak intensity (unfolding wing, gathering fragments) the syntax does not compress or quicken as warranted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout: "invisible fruit," "jagged edges," "trillion smaller possibilities," "ember-glow." In high-pressure beats (the wing unfolding, prophecy fragments escaping), metaphorical layering slows propulsion rather than sharpening it—"blazing with potential energy" and "tranquil suspension" feel ornamental. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes, but several constructions loop conceptually: "she had learned" echoes across the piece, and "the summoner" / "she" toggle without clear rhythmic purpose. No paraphrase loops, but the density of vehicles (prophecy as living thing, silence as fruit, futures as blaze) occasionally muddles rather than clarifies. Information density is high, and grammar is clean; the final image is strong but preceded by a thematic summary that dilutes its charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—silencing a self-fulfilling prophecy by dispersing it into the sea—offers a fresh inflection on prophecy tropes. The summoner's method (mapping silence, enlisting moth-thoughts and owl-dreams, using the brook as conduit) is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc and stakes are procedural; the summoner executes a learned technique without personal transformation or risk that alters her in return. The nocturnal haven and decades of solitude are particular, but the ending's transformation ("brighter but somehow less real") and the erasure of footprints echo familiar closure gestures. The synthesis of elements is coherent, yet the story prioritizes lyric texture over bold narrative risk; the summoner's competence insulates her from genuine jeopardy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and her choices structure the night's work: she places the wing, maps silence, gathers fragments, guides the flow into the brook, and releases the boundaries at dawn. She makes tactical decisions (use brook-mist, enlist small consciousnesses) and the final act—walking upstream—closes her arc. However, her choices are methodical execution of a learned plan; no on-page turn is driven by a decision that narrows live options or imposes visible personal cost. Setup and development are strong; closure participation is present but procedural.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears early, thrums against her palm, struggles to unfold prophecy, and crumbles at dawn—three distinct beats. It is causally active: its unfolding reveals forbidden futures that she must contain, and its crumbling signals completion. The wing's properties (crystallized moonlight, impossible angles, coded prophecy) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure linkage is solid: the wing's disintegration and the brook carrying it away mark the prophecy's dispersal. Cost is tied to the futures it contained, though the wing itself does not impose a tradeoff on the summoner.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is echoed in "mapping silence," "pockets of concentrated quiet," "tapestry of smoothed hush," and the brook's resumption of "cheerful babbling" after carrying prophecy. It shapes her method and reappears at closure when she releases the silence-boundaries. However, "smoothed hush" as a phrase is lyric texture more than a causal constraint; it flavors her work rather than altering tactics under pressure. Early signal is clear, closure participation is present, but causal pressure is modest—removing "smoothed" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears in the opening line ("stars reflected in the water's surface created their terrestrially cosmic twin") and codes the blending of sky and earth that anchors her ritual space. It is descriptive setup but does not constrain or enable an on-page action; no choice depends on this doubling. The attribute is ornamental, establishing tone without causal weight. Late penalties do not apply (present in paragraph one), but no development or closure participation beyond the initial image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Flow" is the spine of the plot: she guides the prophecy's flow into the brook, the water carries coded words to the sea, and fragments dissolve. The action is signaled early ("water's constant murmur would be her foundation") and drives the middle work (gathering fragments, weaving silence) and closure (prophecy dispersed, brook resumes flow, footprints smoothed). Removing "flow" would require fundamental rewriting. The element is causally irreplaceable and charges the final image (brook as agent of erasure). Cost is conceptual—futures dispersed—but legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early as her method: she uses her staff to trace invisible boundaries, creates pockets of concentrated quiet, and gathers prophecy fragments into spheres of silence. The mechanics matter—her method is not generic spellcasting but a specific spatial practice. It shapes her attempts across the night (gathering, compressing, weaving) and at closure she releases the mapped boundaries. Two gates clearly met (setup, development); closure participation is present but the final image prioritizes the brook's flow over the silence-mapping itself. Causal pressure is solid; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is introduced immediately and supplies crucial resources: the water's white noise, flat stone for the wing, brook-mist to kiss its edges, and the spatial layout for mapping silence. The setting constrains her ritual (she needs this cultivated place, these known shadows) and at closure transforms ("brighter but somehow less real"). The brook is causally active—it carries prophecy fragments and will smooth her footprints. All three gates met; the micro-setting (stone, water, mist) alters tactics and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high; cost is the transformation of her haven's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears once in the backstory reference ("Years ago, amid whispered secrets of the old observatory, her mentor had taught her") and codes the past training that informs her method. It does not function as a live timeframe that tightens present decisions; the night's working unfolds without a ticking clock or escalating time pressure. The phrase is atmospheric setup without causal development or closure participation. Present but ornamental; swappable with "in the hidden archive" or similar with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation to silence the prophecy is dramatized immediately: it "had already begun whispering itself into existence through the dreams of children three villages away," creating urgency. Her choices throughout the night (placing the wing, gathering fragments, guiding flow) pursue this goal against the prophecy's resistance. Friction between want (prevent self-fulfilling harm) and cost (dispersing futures, transforming her haven) is legible. Closure validates the goal—prophecy dispersed, world continues in ignorance, "peculiar kind of peace" earned. All three gates met; causal pressure is strong; cost is felt conceptually and relationally (her haven's transformation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is a paradox the piece works to inhabit: the prophecy's "blazing potential energy" held in "tranquil suspension," "some blazes were best experienced as ember-glow." Tone modulates from nocturnal intensity (struggle, gathering) to dawn's quieter release and acceptance. The final image reweights the blazing urgency into calm dispersal. However, "tranquil blaze" as a phrase does not appear on the page; the tonal work is present but not linguistically anchored to these exact words. Closure linkage is solid (ember-glow callback), but the element is more thematic resonance than causal driver. Strong lyric reprise lifts this into mid-6s.</comment>
