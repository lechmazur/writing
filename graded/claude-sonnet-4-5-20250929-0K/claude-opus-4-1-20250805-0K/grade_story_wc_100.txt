<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silas's interior life is largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The insomnia curse is asserted but never shown constraining a choice or producing embodied struggle under pressure. His transformation at the end—finding rest by giving it—reads as thematic declaration rather than earned through on-page friction between want and cost. The Sleepless Librarians remain atmospheric devices without individual agency or pressure on Silas's decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens early (package → descent → library → transformation) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the timeline is legible. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Silas chooses to remain as undertaker-guardian, forecloses his surface life, and the library achieves rest. However, the cost is more asserted ("his mortuary stood empty") than felt in the moment of decision; the final beats summarize rather than dramatize the renunciation, weakening the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered with coral columns, floating books, and translucent librarians, establishing strong atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental detail (pressure, breathable grief mechanics, spatial layout) forces a tactical choice or complicates Silas's work. The "broken lighthouse lens" object does shape the descent and final transformation, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the closure image, which lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to the Sleepless Librarians and achieving his own—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure is more accumulative than escalating; Silas encounters no meaningful opposition, and the transformation unfolds as cooperative labor ("months, or perhaps minutes") without a visible tightening or trade-off. The closure reconfigures his existence, but the cost (leaving his mortuary, forsaking the living) is told in summary rather than tested in scene, reducing escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—rest as earned closure, the dignified burial of knowledge—emerges cleanly from the library-as-morgue conceit and Silas's ritual work. The final image of "silence bloomed like funeral flowers" and the note on the door offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, lines like "some spaces become possible only when we stop trying to escape them" veer toward thesis statement, and the thematic pivot lacks friction; Silas's epiphany feels more asserted than discovered through lived cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature: "rainbow ghosts," "breathable grief," "shadow—the peaceful darkness of earned sleep." Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chased stillness he'd pursued," "inadvertently stubborn insomnia") that feels more authorial than character-rooted, and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("The living would have to bury themselves") reads as narration stepping outside Silas's focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often evocative ("bubble of breathable grief," "funeral flowers"), but clusters heavily in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. Template cadence appears in the opening: "The package arrived... The weary undertaker set aside... Inside the sodden wrapping lay..." Paraphrase loops surface in the librarians' introduction: "They drifted... their eyes black holes of exhaustion" immediately followed by thematic restatement. The closure beat is charged but borders on overwriting ("silence bloomed like funeral flowers"), and the final note feels like scaffold rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The library-as-morgue conceit and the undertaker-protagonist offer a fresh angle on rest and closure themes. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes: the cursed insomniac, the mystical underwater city, the transformative descent, the magical object (lens) that solves the problem it introduces. The emotional arc—lonely craftsman finds purpose in impossible realm—follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious turn. Specific details (coral, jellyfish librarians, prism mechanics) add texture but do not transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his choices (following the lens, descending, staying as guardian) drive the plot. However, most key turns are recounted in summary ("Working with the Sleepless Librarians, Silas transformed...") rather than dramatized as on-page decisions with visible friction. His weariness is asserted but does not constrain a choice; the final renunciation (leaving his mortuary) is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lens appears in the opening, guides the descent (vibrating, coordinates etched in light), and transforms at closure into the cornerstone lighthouse. It is handled across at least three distinct beats and its "broken" state is reweighted ("whole through its brokenness"). However, its mechanics (breathable grief bubble, refracted consciousness) feel ornamental; no scene shows Silas choosing differently because of the lens's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Distress signals" frame the setup (coordinates, SOS from drowned civilizations) and echo thematically at closure ("where distress signals once echoed endlessly, silence bloomed"). However, the concept does not alter on-page tactics; Silas receives no competing signals, faces no choice about which to answer, and the "distress" becomes metaphorical decoration rather than a constraint or escalation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Insomnia is labeled "inadvertently stubborn" in the opening and mentioned as a forty-year condition, but it never constrains a choice or produces visible cost. Silas does not struggle to stay awake during the descent or transformation, and the trait does not shape his final decision. The attribute exists as backstory flavor rather than a force in scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears explicitly in the middle third ("He could revitalize it, not to its original purpose, but to something greater") and governs the transformation sequence. The action is central to the plot, but the execution is summarized over "months, or perhaps minutes" without showing Silas making a key tactical choice during the revitalization. Swapping to "repair" or "consecrate" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is introduced mid-descent ("breathable grief... occupying impossible spaces between water molecules") and mentioned again at closure ("some spaces become possible only when we stop trying to escape them"). The method enables the descent and thematically frames the ending, but its mechanics are asserted rather than tested; no scene shows Silas adjusting his approach because of the spatial impossibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The library is vividly described (coral columns, floating books, preserved air vaults) and houses the Sleepless Librarians who provide the story's central problem. It appears by the story's midpoint and shapes the transformation sequence. However, the setting does not constrain Silas's choices; no environmental detail (layout, access, decay) forces a tactical decision or complicates his work, keeping it in the mid-6s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe begins clearly with the package's Tuesday arrival and tracks "three days" for the descent. However, time becomes vague during the transformation ("months, or perhaps minutes") and does not tighten Silas's decisions. The temporal frame is present but does not create urgency or alter tactics, and the open-ended transformation window weakens its integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The desire "to give rest a permanent address" is articulated at closure and governs Silas's final choice to remain as guardian. It is seeded early (his mortuary work, his own insomnia) and drives the transformation. However, the motivation is more explained than dramatized in conflict; no scene shows Silas torn between this desire and a competing want, reducing the friction that would lift it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tone of "chased stillness" is established in the opening (weary, trembling hands, insomnia) and recurs at closure ("the chased stillness he'd pursued his whole life suddenly stopped running"). The tonal arc moves from restless pursuit to achieved rest, modulating coherently with the plot. However, the tone is more asserted through phrases like "chased stillness" than embodied in syntactic rhythm or sensory texture, and it does not shift under pressure in the middle beats.</comment>
