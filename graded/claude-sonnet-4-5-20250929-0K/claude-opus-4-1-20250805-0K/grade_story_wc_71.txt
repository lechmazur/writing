<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's observational trait is established and embodied through the journal and tracking details, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract. The motivation to witness "slow, sacred transformation" drives the journey, though the culminating realization about grief-houses feels told rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The final offering of the orris root is a choice, but it arrives smoothly without visible cost or internal friction that would elevate it into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered observation and pattern recognition. Orientation anchors (Marina, bay, spring evening, streetlights) land cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the bay "cradling its displaced treasures like prayers" reweights the entire pattern of migrations with conceptual cost (grief sanctified through slow loss). The causal chain from displaced objects → bay → houses learning to hold absence is legible, though the mechanics of how objects migrate remains somewhat elided. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina sees through the orris root and understands the offerings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bay at dusk is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("held breath," waves that "whisper rather than crash") and the orris root functions as a micro-setting tool that transforms perception. The streetlights' liminal flicker constrains the temporal frame. The shard of orris root—translucent, violet-scented, plant-stone hybrid—acts as a lens that charges the final image by revealing the bay's collection. The setting pressures Marina's interpretive stance and supplies the resource (the bay as repository) that enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marina's need to understand the displaced objects and what makes houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when she traces the migration path to the bay. One meaningful deepening occurs when she looks through the orris root and sees the temporal overlays, which reweights her understanding. The final act (placing the shard as offering) is a protagonist choice with conceptual cost: she relinquishes her grandmother's heirloom to join the sanctification cycle. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break under the Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains meditative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—how grief and love alter physical spaces into presences that hold absence—emerges organically from the displaced objects, breathing houses, and the backstories of loss (Henderson's daughter, Nakamura's son, Patel's parent). The orris root as "crystallized hush" and the bay as prayer repository are specific images that avoid direct moralizing. The final gesture (placing the shard) offers a resonant answer to the opening question without stating a thesis. Minor deduction: the phrase "inadvertently profound" in the setup feels like a thematic label rather than fully earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Marina's perceptual signature—noticing "small wrongnesses" and "imperceptible" drift—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction is controlled and literary without unmotivated register shifts. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (longer, meditative sentences in reflection; shorter phrases at the streetlight transition). The phrase "hush so complete it blazed through her consciousness" demonstrates purposeful figurative compression. No dialogue present. Minor density concern: occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") in the final third slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong figurative choices ("liminal hour," "quiet...burning away the day's accumulated noise like fever burning infection"). Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or understanding. Two mild loop patterns: "she'd come here following a pattern" / "she'd traced the path" near-paraphrase in adjacent paragraphs, and "she understood" / "Marina understood" repeated openings in the final third. The metaphor "hush...blazing" is bold but works. Sentence openings vary well. No major clarity breaks, but the loops and filter-verb stacks in peak beats prevent entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—objects migrate as offerings to sanctify grief-houses through a bay repository—is a fresh synthesis of haunting and memorial logic. The orris root as crystallized hush and the houses as breathing presences show specificity. The transformation test holds: swap names and the vision weakens. However, the "noticer witnesses hidden pattern" frame is familiar in literary circles, and the thematic resolution (grief sanctifies spaces) trends toward an expected payoff within this subgenre. The piece commits fully to its vision without hedging, which elevates it within band, but the core emotional arc—observer validates communal sorrow—does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina's trait of noticing "creeping normality" is established early (journal, gnome tracking) and drives her to trace the displaced objects to the bay, shaping the middle investigation. At closure, she places the orris root as an offering, a decision rooted in her observer role. Two beats: tracing objects, offering the shard. The trait enables the plot but does not constrain a costly choice under pressure; her observation leads smoothly to understanding without visible friction. Present in setup, middle development, and ending; causal involvement at two beats; modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orris root appears early (pocket, wrapped in silk), functions as a lens in the middle beat (looking through it to see temporal overlays), and becomes the climactic offering at closure. Three distinct beats with clear causal pressure: it reveals the bay's collection, it charges her understanding, and its sacrifice joins the sanctification cycle. Specificity is high—"crystallized hush," violet scent, plant-stone hybrid. The exact object is irreplaceable; no generic talisman would carry the same weight. Strong integration across all three gates with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is introduced as a metaphor when Marina realizes the orris root is "crystallized hush itself...quiet that exists between heartbeats." This conceptual frame reweights the bay as a repository of stillness and the houses as holding presences. The concept shapes her final understanding and is implicit in the closure image ("bay held its breath"). Two beats: revelation through the orris root, thematic repricing at the end. The concept enables the thematic closure but does not constrain tactical choices earlier; it functions more as interpretive lens than plot engine. Setup by midpoint, payoff at closure; missing distinct middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears as a thematic label in the phrase "in return received something inadvertently profound: the ability to hold life even in absence." It describes the houses' transformation but does not constrain Marina's choices or create visible tradeoffs on the page. The attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through action. Present as theme claim at closure but not as a trait that shapes tactics or bears cost. Missing setup and middle development; label-only use in final third trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is the verb that names the houses' transformation and Marina's final gesture. The houses "slowly sanctifying themselves through these small sacrifices" is the story's central mechanism, introduced at the two-thirds mark and paid off when Marina places the orris root as her own offering. The action redefines her role from witness to participant. Two beats: understanding the houses' sanctification, enacting it herself. Setup is late (second half), but the action is causally central to closure and irreplaceable. Cost is conceptual—relinquishing the heirloom.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is the method signaled early (swing, wind chimes, objects migrating between houses) and traced as a path to the bay. The mechanics shape Marina's investigation in the middle and ground the thematic revelation. At closure, her orris root becomes the next displaced object, continuing the cycle. Three beats: initial observation, tracing the pattern, joining it. The method constrains her inquiry and enables the final gesture. Specificity is moderate; the displacement could be swapped for other migration types with minor edits, but the exact pattern (household objects as offerings) is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is introduced in the first paragraph and becomes the destination and conceptual center. The bay's spatial presence—"held breath," whispered waves, curve of shoreline—pressures Marina's perception and supplies the resource (repository of offerings) that enables closure. Spring is noted but not leveraged as a seasonal constraint. The bay recurs in three beats: arrival, revelation through the orris root, final offering. The setting charges the final image ("bay held its breath...cradling its displaced treasures") with undeniable pressure. Essential to closure; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is rendered as the "liminal hour when their sensors couldn't decide between day and night" in the opening and returns at closure when "streetlights finally decided on darkness." The timeframe establishes mood and brackets the narrative but does not constrain Marina's choices or tighten decisions. The dusk setting is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live clock alters her moves. Present in setup and payoff with thematic coherence, but missing middle development as a pressure. Lyric reprise without causal cost trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is implicit in her tracking of "small wrongnesses" and explicit when she notes the houses "felt inhabited even when empty." The desire drives her to the bay and shapes her interpretive stance. At closure, her understanding is articulated ("each house had learned to be more than shelter") and enacted by joining the offering cycle. Two beats: stated motive, enacted resolution. The motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; she moves smoothly from question to answer without friction or cost that would elevate the score. Setup and payoff present; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" as tone is embodied in the oxymoronic phrase "hush so complete it blazed through her consciousness" and sustained through diction that balances quiet observation ("whisper," "held breath") with intensity ("burning," "fever"). The tone modulates subtly—meditative in the opening, revelatory at the orris-root beat, ceremonial at closure—without breaking coherence. The final image ("bay held its breath") maintains the hushed register while charging it with conceptual weight. Tone is integral to the story's texture and supports the thematic repricing at the end. Coherent through turns with purposeful cadence shift; charges the final image.</comment>
