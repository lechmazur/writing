<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marlowe's mechanical arm and three-year backstory provide concrete grounding, but her motivations remain abstract—"turning questions into destinations" is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The internal contradiction between public opposition and private alliance is mentioned but never tested on the page; we see intellectual performance, not genuine inner conflict. Reeves functions primarily as a catalyst for Marlowe's exposition rather than applying distinct pressure that forces her to choose between competing goods. The final gesture with the mechanical arm completes a pattern but doesn't foreclose a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when adequately and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through the angle-tracing motif. However, the closure unit—Marlowe's promise that "questions, properly asked, could indeed become destinations"—restates the premise without reweighting it through on-page cost or changed options. The "revolution being planned" remains abstract; no concrete stake is tested or altered. The needle card/sundial/light-trace trinity creates a pattern, but the final image recapitulates rather than reconfigures, yielding thematic echo instead of Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and mechanical arm anchor the scene with sensory specificity, and the needle card's perforations guide action across multiple beats. The brass fingers "leaving trails of light" that form geometric patterns integrates tool and environment into the philosophical duel. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric container than constraint—the brook and rainbows remain decorative, and no environmental detail narrows Marlowe's tactical options at the closure beat. The mechanical arm charges the final image but doesn't alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—encoding revolutionary messages through philosophical debate—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The duel itself unfolds as collaborative performance rather than genuine conflict; Reeves "sparkles with admiration" throughout, deflating tension. The escalation claimed in "intensified" and "breathing heavily" is asserted without on-page trade-offs or narrowed options. No reversal occurs; the "hidden overture to a revolution that might never need to happen" remains hypothetical, and the agreement to meet again forecloses nothing, leaving pressure flat across the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—questions as destinations, structured improvisation, intellectual resistance—emerges clearly from dialogue and the angle-coding motif. The needle card's perforations reappear with shifted meaning at closure, creating a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("that questions, properly asked, could indeed become destinations") rather than trusting the image to carry resonance, and "truth might find its way" offers tidy reassurance instead of ambiguity. The premise of philosophical dueling as coded resistance is intriguing but remains conceptually neat, lacking the friction of genuine ideological cost or personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Marlowe; perceptual filtering through her mechanical arm and philosophical lens is consistent. Dialogue between Marlowe and Reeves carries distinct idiom ("Forty-three degrees suggesting Aristotelian ethics" vs. "intellectual anarchy"), though both speak with similar elevated diction under pressure. The prose voice modulates purposefully between lyric observation ("dignified chaos") and technical specificity ("brass fingers clicking"). However, simultaneous speech ("they said simultaneously") and the phrase "diplomatically fierce" repeated verbatim for two different contexts suggest template reliance rather than organic voice evolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("brook that whispered," "trails of light"). However, multiple scaffold patterns accumulate: "The mechanical arm [verb]" opens three beats; "understood/understanding" and "revolution/resistance" cycle without added meaning; "hidden overture" and "secret negotiation disguised" paraphrase in adjacent lines. The phrase "diplomatic fierce" modulates to "diplomatically fierce" mid-story without motivation. "Dignified chaos" appears twice, once as tone descriptor and once as thematic claim, suggesting synonym management. The closure paragraph stacks three scaffold constructions ("promise: that questions... destinations, and that... chaos, truth") that dilute rather than propel the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—philosophers encoding revolution through debate angles—offers a fresh synthesis of academic setting and covert resistance. The mechanical arm's light-trace function and the needle-card cipher are specific and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc (allies performing public opposition for hidden goals) is not transformed through lived cost; the revolution remains abstract, and the final handshake to continue undermines the declared stakes. The "questions as destinations" motif echoes popular TED-talk phrasing without grounding it in Marlowe's particular struggle. Swapping the needle card for any other cipher or the sundial for another encoding device would require only minor edits, signaling surface novelty over deep integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marlowe is present throughout and her mechanical arm traces angles in multiple beats, but her choices do not create key turns—she waits, decodes, and performs the duel as scripted. The backstory of losing the arm "defending the theorem" is told rather than tested. At closure she agrees to meet again, a continuation rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The needle card appears in three distinct beats: discovery/decode, trembling during the duel, and held up to light at closure. Its perforations guide Marlowe's understanding of the invitation and reappear with reweighted meaning ("not just a code, but a promise"). However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it is read, then referenced, then contemplated, remaining an emblem rather than a lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" frames the duel's stakes and shapes Marlowe's framing of the exchange as "secret negotiation disguised as intellectual combat." It returns at closure as "hidden overture to a revolution that might never need to happen," reweighting the premise. However, the concept remains thematic and abstract; no on-page choice tests whether to reveal or conceal the overture, and no visible cost attaches to its success or failure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The phrase "diplomatically fierce" appears twice: once describing Marlowe's adversary three years ago and once as the tone she adopts in the duel. Both uses are labels applied to dialogue rather than traits that constrain or enable action with visible cost. No choice hinges on balancing diplomacy with fierceness, and no friction arises from the pairing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fence" is signaled early and frames the entire duel scene, shaping multiple beats as Marlowe and Reeves construct "carefully constructed syllogisms" with "thrust and parry." The duel's collaborative nature is the story's spine. However, the fencing is cooperative performance rather than contest; no reversal or defeat occurs, and swapping "fence" for "debate" or "joust" would require only minor edits to metaphor, leaving structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sundial's angles are decoded in the opening beat, guide the duel's light-trace geometry, and return at closure as part of the "trinity of coded resistance." The mechanics—angles corresponding to philosophical positions—matter across three beats. However, the method is explained rather than tested; no attempt fails because the angles were misread, and no choice depends on correcting or completing the sundial.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook anchor the scene and provide sensory texture ("rainbows," "whispered," "gurgled approval"). The setting is present in the opening, middle (brook's edge), and closure (shadows through glass walls). However, the environment does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—the duel could unfold in any quiet academic space with minor description edits. The brook remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marlowe is "waiting" at the start, and "morning sun climbed higher" tracks progression. The duel concludes with an agreement to meet "next week," bracketing the scene in time. However, time does not tighten decisions—no deadline looms, and the sun's movement is atmospheric rather than tactical. The "while waiting" frame is established but not leveraged to escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Marlowe's desire to "turn questions into destinations" is stated in backstory, voiced in the duel, and reasserted at closure as the story's thematic claim. The motivation frames her intellectual stance but is not dramatized through conflicted choice—she never faces a moment where pursuing this goal costs her another want or forces a trade-off. The desire is told and echo-affirmed rather than tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "dignified chaos" appears twice and the tone coheres through formal diction layered with energetic metaphor ("intellectual jazz," "verbal fence"). Tone modulates slightly as the duel "intensified," and the final image's "soft click" provides cadence closure. However, the tone remains static at one register—elevated, controlled—without degrading under stress or charging the final image with felt pressure. The "chaos" is asserted more than enacted in syntax or rhythm.</comment>
