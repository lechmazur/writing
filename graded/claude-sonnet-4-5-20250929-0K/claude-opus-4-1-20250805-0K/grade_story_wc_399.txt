<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The line walker's motivation is clear—preservation of wisdom—but her interior life remains abstract. The consecration decision arrives without internal conflict or embodied struggle; she "understood immediately" without the contradictory impulses required for high scores. The mask removal at the end gestures toward earned change but the scars are deployed as symbolic shorthand rather than felt cost. Marcus and the prophet function as exposition vessels rather than pressure sources.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story establishes orientation adequately (line walker, pavilion, post-prophet timeframe by paragraph two) and builds through the consecration sequence. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights the clearings as "gift to time itself" and the parapet as guard against forgetting. Cost is conceptual (the work will continue forever) rather than viscerally felt on the page, which limits the score. The because/therefore linkage between prophet's warning and consecration night is functional but the urgency ("must act tonight") is asserted more than dramatized through narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and whisperfield details create vivid atmosphere and the maps-of-light moment offers concrete spatial grounding. The parapet's "movements growing more purposeful" in response to consecration shows environment responding to action. However, micro-setting choices (fountain waters, spiral stairs, crystalline pillars) remain largely descriptive; none constrains a tactical choice at a peak beat. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is narrowly missed—the parapet participates thematically but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve wisdom echoes before they fade. The tightening occurs when the line walker declares "must act tonight" and the consecration sequence narrows the threat. However, the escalation is asserted ("faster than anticipated") rather than demonstrated through a reversal that forecloses options. No live constraint forces a trade-off; the group completes every clearing without visible cost, opposition, or failure. The work-continues-forever ending registers as Charged Poise conceptually but lacks the felt price or foreclosed path that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—preservation requires both motion and stillness, boundaries between revelation and concealment—emerges organically from the kinetic parapet and line-walker roles. The vessels/gift-to-time final exchange offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The mask removal at closure attempts to tie physical boundaries to thematic ones, though the scars feel somewhat convenient. "After the prophet arrives, nothing would ever be quite the same" borders on summary-statement but recovers by grounding the insight in the particulars of clearings and parapet. The wisdom-echo motif recurs purposefully but does not constrain choice, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but perceptual signature is generic—"her exposed eye tracking the horizon" and "through peripheral awareness" read as functional rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse; the prophet's "you understand" and the line walker's "we are the vessels" carry thematic weight but little subtext or goal pursuit. The register holds (no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak beats) but syntactic variety is limited, with many sentences opening on the subject. Voice reads competent but lacks the rhythmic control and distinct texture required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; no major loops or causality breaks. However, several sentences restate without adding pressure: "The clearings must become sanctuaries" after "consecrate the spaces between" is near-paraphrase. Template cadence appears in the consecration sequence: "Standing... began... speaking... shimmered... becoming." The phrase "strangely honest" recurs three times as a tic without dramatized meaning. "Murmuring" and "whisperfield calm" are invoked repeatedly but remain abstract. Information density is moderate; the pavilion descent and map-of-light moment advance atmosphere but not causal pressure. No figurative muddle, but the prose leans toward declarative summary rather than propulsive specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of line walkers, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearings offers surface novelty but the emotional arc—lone expert realizes true purpose, gathers allies, completes ritual, declares mission will continue—follows a familiar template. The mask removal and scar reveal feel obligatory rather than inevitable. "Preserve the echo of wisdom" and "boundaries between worlds" remain high-level abstractions without the lived-in detail or non-obvious moral calculus that would transform the premise. The prophet's arrival as inciting incident and theночь of consecration read as competent execution of a archetypal structure rather than a fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Half-masked line walker is present throughout and makes the consecration decision, but her choice arrives without visible internal conflict or cost. The mask removal at the end reweights her symbolically but does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. She drives the plot functionally but her agency does not create a meaningful turn under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet appears in three beats: opening description, mid-story explanation as "memory made manifest," and response to consecration ("movements growing more purposeful"). However, its mechanics remain abstract and it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The closure image includes it thematically ("guarding... against forgetting") but it is not causally active there. Present across beats but replaceable with another defensive/memory symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are the story's central stake: the line walker must transform them into sanctuaries to preserve wisdom. They appear early, shape the middle exposition ("vessels designed to preserve"), and drive the night's consecration work. The clearings-as-gift final line charges the closure image. However, the consecration itself is summarized rather than dramatized with tactical friction, limiting irreplaceability. Strong middle-to-closure integration but swappable with "sacred spaces" or similar vessel concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears three times: describing the prophet's riddles, the line walker's urgency, and (implicitly) her perspective. It functions as a tonal label rather than a trait that constrains action. No scene shows her honesty costing her or enabling a tactic; it is asserted, not demonstrated. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consecration is signaled early (prophet's directive to "consecrate the spaces between"), drives the middle exposition (line walker's realization), and structures the night sequence where the group acts. The consecration work is the story's major turn, transforming clearings from rest stops to repositories. It appears in the final image ("our gift to time itself"). However, the act itself is summarized in one paragraph without tactical friction or cost, preventing a higher score. Essential to structure but execution is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" appears twice: guiding others down stairs and (implicitly) sensing other walkers gathering. It functions as a label for her ability but its mechanics do not matter to any choice or tactic. The line walker could achieve the same result through ordinary perception. Present in two beats but swappable with "intuition" or "connection."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Murmuring pavilion is present in opening, middle (spiral stairs, maps of light), night departure, and dawn return. It provides spatial grounding and the maps-of-light beat offers concrete resources (tracking which clearings need work). The murmuring's register shift at night ("lower register that thrummed through bones") modulates atmosphere. Final approval scene occurs there. Strong spatial presence across beats and contributes to closure, though it does not force a tactical choice. Solid integration but shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" frames the opening and returns in the penultimate sentence. The three-day gap and "must act tonight" create urgency. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten tactics—no live clock forces trade-offs during the consecration work, which proceeds without time pressure or failure. The temporal frame signals change but does not constrain action. Functional bracket but replaceable with "after the revelation" or similar marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Preserving wisdom echoes is the dominant stake, introduced early via the prophet's warning and driving the line walker's realization and the night's consecration work. The motivation shapes the entire arc and appears in the closure image ("what must never be forgotten"). However, the desire faces no meaningful friction—no competing want, no cost that makes her hesitate. The motivation is clear and consistent but not dramatized through conflicted choice, limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears three times as a descriptor for the pavilion's atmosphere and the group's deliberation. It establishes a consistent tonal register (contemplative, purposeful) that holds through the night sequence. The murmuring's modulation under stress gestures toward tonal pressure. However, the tone remains static rather than charging the final image or creating meaningful tension with the stakes. Present and coherent but does not elevate closure.</comment>
