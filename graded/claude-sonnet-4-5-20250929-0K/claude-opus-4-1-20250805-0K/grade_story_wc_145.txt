<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margot's interior voice is consistent and specific, filtered through her atlas-editor expertise and dry wit. Her decision at the ending to share the research feels earned by prior beats (the falcon's herald, her mapping work, the condensation discovery). However, her motivations remain somewhat surface-level—we see her obsession but not the contradictory impulses that would deepen it. The inspector arrives conveniently late, functioning more as a plot receiver than a pressure source that forces Margot to weigh competing costs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (falcon, outpost, frozen lake) and follows a causal chain: empty message tube → chart work → condensation pattern discovery → inspector arrival → decision to share. The closure is a Charged Poise moment where Margot's choice to trust reconfigures her isolated obsession into shared risk, with the "held breath before a first spring thaw" image making the stakes legible. The cost is present but oblique—she risks her position and the research itself—though the exact price remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when she connects the phrasebook pattern to her condensation map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake with pressure ridges, rusted outpost, and frost patterns are vivid and specific. The condensation on the window functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Margot's key discovery, directly shaping the plot turn. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (window, desk, door, falcon perch). The setting charges the final image with "worrying tranquility" and "held breath," making the environment inseparable from the thematic question of buried potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source rivers—is signaled early and drives Margot's chart work. Pressure tightens when the inspector arrives seeking the same research, forcing Margot to choose between secrecy and collaboration. The reversal (rivers flow outward from beneath the lake, not inward) narrows options and reframes her three-month pursuit. However, the inspector's arrival feels more coincidental than causally earned by Margot's prior actions, and the final choice to share lacks a visible trade-off or immediate cost that would charge it more fully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: the singular convergence, condensation rivulets mirroring watersheds, the polyglot's marginalia, buried rivers waiting to return. The phrasebook functions as a rosetta stone without stating a moral. Margot's discovery that she'd been "looking at it backwards" offers a resonant answer to the central question of beginnings and emergence. The final image of the lake "keeping its secrets just a little while longer" reweights the premise with patient hope rather than sermonizing, and the inspector's line about "herald spring again" layers meaning without thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Margot's voice is distinct—dry wit as shield, atlas-editor precision, controlled observations. Her perceptual signature (noting asymmetric frost, dendritic patterns, "almost too convenient") is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext in the inspector's quiet "He believed the rivers would return" and Margot's careful hedging. POV distance is stable; free indirect style is clean. The phrase "subtly confident precision" in narration risks slight register drift, but the voice otherwise remains grounded in Margot's expertise and wary intelligence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("cataract eye," "dendritic pattern," "worrying tranquility"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, discovery, or character. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor issues: "a herald's gesture she'd learned to interpret" tells rather than showing the falcon's behavior, and "the kind that preceded avalanches" is a stock comparison. No loops or scaffolding, and the condensation-as-map beat is elegant. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting with "rosetta stone for reading the language of ice and time and patient water," but it stays voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—atlas editor discovers inverted hydrology beneath ice—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic cartography. The condensation-pattern discovery and phrasebook-as-cipher are specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its concept and follows implications without retreat. However, the "inspector arrives to check progress" setup is familiar, and the brother-connection reveal trends toward convenient symmetry. The transformation of "convergence" from abstract concept to literal map coordinates and then to human trust is earned, but the closing image of shared charts and rosetta-stone phrasebook edges toward tidy resolution rather than bold ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Margot drives two key beats: the condensation-pattern discovery that reverses her understanding, and the final decision to share the research with the inspector. Both are active choices that alter tactics and stakes. She is present throughout and her atlas-editor skills enable the central insight. However, the inspector's arrival is external coincidence, not caused by Margot's prior actions, which slightly weakens her agency at the climax. The "dry-witted" trait appears in dialogue and thought but doesn't create a visible cost or tradeoff that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the supply cache with dog-eared pages, use as a cipher to decode condensation patterns, and final offering to the inspector as proof and trust gesture. Its dog-eared pages are specific and causally active—they map the theoretical watershed and unlock the convergence mystery. The final image of it lying "between them like a rosetta stone" reweights its function from solitary obsession to shared key. Removing it would break the plot's central discovery mechanism and thematic link to the polyglot's research.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "singular convergence" shapes Margot's three-month pursuit, names the mystery the previous occupant chased, and provides the map coordinates where pressure ridges meet. It drives the discovery beat when Margot realizes the convergence point is beneath the lake, not feeding into it. The concept appears in or shapes the ending as the inspector and Margot stand over charts marking that convergence. However, it functions more as a search target than a constraint that narrows tactics under pressure; the story would hold with a different geographic or thematic focal point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears once in narration ("her hands moved with subtly confident precision") during the map-overlay beat, and Margot's nonchalant greeting of the inspector demonstrates it in action. It characterizes her approach but doesn't create a visible tradeoff or cost—confidence could be replaced with "methodical" or "determined" without structural change. The trait is present and consistent but not load-bearing for any key turn or the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The falcon functions as a herald twice: returning with an empty tube (inciting the scene) and ruffling feathers to signal the inspector's approach. These moments frame the action and transition between discovery and confrontation. However, "herald" could be satisfied by other signals (a radio call, footsteps, a visual sighting) with minor edits. The falcon's specific presence adds atmospheric texture and thematic resonance (spring, return, messengers) but isn't mechanically indispensable to the plot's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is set up early (Margot's breath on the window), used as the discovery mechanism (rivulets match her theoretical watershed), and directly shapes the central reversal when she overlays it onto her charts. The method is specific, visual, and tied to setting (cold outpost, frosted glass). It enables the "looking at it backwards" insight that reframes three months of work. The inspector's path across the ice confirms the pattern's validity. Removing this exact mechanism would require a wholesale rewrite of the discovery beat and weaken the story's use of environment-as-tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The outpost anchors all action and provides the tools (charts, window, cache) that enable discovery. The frozen lake supplies the visual pressure ridges that confirm Margot's theory and the inspector's approach path. The rusted desk, falcon perch, and frosted window are handled across multiple beats. The setting's isolation and "worrying tranquility" pressure the stakes (three months alone, hidden research) and charge the final image of the lake "keeping its secrets." The cold environment directly enables the condensation-pattern method. The setting is indispensable to plot logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe anchors the scene's start (falcon returns with empty tube) and provides a clear before-and-after marker. However, the story's internal clock is loose—Margot's three-month tenure is referenced but doesn't tighten present decisions. The inspector's arrival timing feels coincidental rather than causally linked to the falcon's return. The frame is present and functional but doesn't create urgency or constrain tactics; the same beats could unfold across a longer or shorter window without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Finding the source rivers drives Margot's three-month atlas work, her secret pursuit beyond the Commonwealth assignment, and the condensation-discovery beat. The motivation is dramatized through her chart study and the "obsession" label is earned by her actions. It creates friction when the inspector arrives, forcing her to choose between secrecy and sharing. The final line ("I can show you where the rivers begin") fulfills and reweights the desire by transforming solitary pursuit into collaboration. However, the motivation lacks internal contradiction—we don't see competing wants or fears that complicate her commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone is established early ("worrying tranquility," "oddly comforting" groan, "held breath before avalanches") and modulates appropriately: ironic during Margot's dry-witted observations, tense when the inspector approaches, and charged at the ending ("held breath before a first spring thaw"). The tone supports the piece's patient, observational mode and mirrors the buried-rivers theme. It charges the final image of the lake "keeping its secrets just a little while longer." The coherence is strong, though the tone occasionally edges toward over-articulated atmospheric description rather than letting pressure speak through action.</comment>
