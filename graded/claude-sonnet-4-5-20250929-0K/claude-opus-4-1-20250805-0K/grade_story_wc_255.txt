<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's colorblindness is integrated through her observation methods and the flower-language system, but her choices remain largely instrumental rather than forced by internal contradiction. The bartering dynamic and her reading of Enzo's grief show character-particular perception. Enzo's arc from burned letters to flower arrangement is clean, though his transformation occurs mostly off-page between scenes. The daughter's brief appearance at the end doesn't add pressure; she arrives as resolution rather than complication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the courtyard frame. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the teaching of flower language and Enzo's incremental acceptance, with the glass sculpture as the accumulative payoff. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (reunion facilitated by learned language), but cost is diffuse—Mira's three months feel more like elapsed time than sacrifice, and Enzo's shift from burning letters to arranging flowers happens in summary. The ending lands softly without a legible price paid on the page by either character.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is vivid and purposeful: kiln, workbench, potted herbs, and the glass sculpture all constrain or enable choices. Flower placements are tactile and specific (chrysanthemums in spirals, rosemary shifted left). The phoenix-ravaged city provides atmospheric stakes, though the ruins function more as backdrop than immediate pressure. The concertina reed tongue and glass sculpture physically shape the reunion, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira securing workspace, with Enzo's reconciliation as the secondary thread. The barter (painting for courtyard time, then flower-language lessons) tightens once when Mira offers the reed tongue and reads Enzo's grief. However, the escalation is mild: Enzo's acceptance feels assured once Mira demonstrates her insight, and the daughter's return arrives as coincidence (drawn by the sound) rather than a choice-driven turn. No visible cost or trade-off at closure; the reunion succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in brokenness emerges through Mira's colorblind perception, the concertina reed in glass, and the phoenix metaphor. The flower language becomes a concrete system for bridging estrangement. The final image—"broken instruments could still make music"—resonates without stating a moral, though it tilts close to summary. The piece resists tidy resolution in Mira's work but grants Enzo an unearned happy ending; the daughter's immediate embrace bypasses the work of reconciliation the story set up.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Her perceptual signature (gray tones, texture, movement reading) is distinct and voice-specific. Dialogue is functional and carries subtext in the opening exchange ("Useless to me," though his fingers twitched). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. The final paragraph's narratorial certainty ("proof that broken instruments could still make music") drifts slightly elevated from Mira's prior register but remains legible within the close-third frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor the frame. Information density is high in the flower-language passages. Minor scaffold: "She had seen him working late, trying to incorporate sound into his glass sculptures, failing each time" and "Being colorblind had taught her to find beauty where others saw only damage, imperfection where others demanded wholeness" restate ideas present elsewhere. The phoenix description and "awakening" recur with thematic intent but border on over-reliance. No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The colorblind painter who reads emotion through plant arrangements and grayscale perception offers a fresh synthesis. The concertina reed tongue in glass is a specific, tactile invention. The phoenix frame and barter economy are familiar post-disaster tropes executed competently but not transformed. The reunion plot follows a predictable arc: estranged parent learns symbolic language, daughter returns, reconciliation. The piece commits to its premise but plays it safely; the daughter's arrival feels engineered rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's colorblindness shapes her perception system (seeing through tone and texture) and her ability to read Enzo's grief. It drives the barter offer and her teaching of flower language. Present in setup, middle teaching scenes, and implicitly at closure when she paints the reunion. The trait enables her key moves but doesn't constrain them with visible cost; she experiences no friction from the condition itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue appears in three beats: Mira's barter offer, Enzo's incorporation into the glass sculpture, and the daughter's return drawn by its sound. It shifts from rejected object to functional beckoning device. Its musical properties matter causally and it charges the final image. Specific and irreplaceable; the daughter's instrument creates the reunion mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" appears as the frame (post-phoenix survival economy) and is named explicitly in Mira's reflection and the final paragraph. Mira barters painting for workspace, then flower-language teaching. However, "awakening" as a concept (versus simple barter or teaching) does not constrain tactics or create a distinct pressure beyond the functional exchange. The phoenix "awakening" and characters "awakening to new possibilities" remain thematic echoes rather than mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is attributed to Mira's voice in the opening exchange ("her voice carrying an innocently cunning undertone"). She leverages the reed tongue and arranges flowers to communicate Enzo's secret grief. The trait enables her persuasive tactic but is label-only; we don't see a cost or friction from appearing innocent while maneuvering. Present in setup and functional in one beat, but the duality isn't tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Awaken" recurs throughout: phoenix awakening, Mira "beginning to awaken to new possibilities," and the final paragraph's "awakening could be bartered." The verb frames the piece thematically and Mira's shift toward teaching. However, as a discrete action, no single "awaken" moment creates a key turn; the concept is diffused across reflection and metaphor rather than concentrated in a choice that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plant arrangements are introduced in the opening (chrysanthemums in spirals), explained as "the old language of flowers," and demonstrated twice on-page (Mira rearranging Enzo's herbs to tell his daughter's story, Enzo arranging peonies and jasmine by the gate). The method drives the middle teaching arc and the reunion mechanism. Specific mechanics (rosemary left, sage forward) matter; removing this element would collapse the reconciliation plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is the spatial anchor throughout: Mira paints there, Enzo works at the kiln and workbench, plants are arranged along the window and gate. It provides workspace (Mira's goal), proximity for teaching, and the stage for reunion. Functionally necessary but could be replaced by another shared workspace without major edits. The setting enables rather than pressures; no environmental constraint tightens a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Three months ago" and "after the phoenix incident" frame the timeline. Mira negotiates "three months in my courtyard," and "over the following weeks" marks the teaching period. Time shapes the stakes (post-disaster survival) but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; the weeks pass in summary. The timeframe is present and coherent but functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find beauty in imperfection is established through her colorblindness, her painting of the phoenix destruction ("the way broken glass caught light"), and her survival method ("reading people through their movements"). The motivation drives her choice to teach Enzo and is voiced in her reflection. It shapes her tactics but isn't tested by a competing cost or conflicting want; she pursues it without friction.</comment>
