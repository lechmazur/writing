<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is legible—her seven-year practice of tending to broken things—but her interior remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The boy is properly secondary, his loss clear, yet Mira's decisive teaching moment lacks visible cost; she offers wisdom without forfeiting a competing desire or enduring friction. Embodied emotion is present (kneeling, catching the feather) but the final stance feels arrived-at rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No orientation or filter issues; interiority is concrete and voice-consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and cadence shift; the kite-string snap provides a single meaningful tightening that reweights Mira's reflective practice with the boy's immediate loss. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the boy clutching the broken kite and Mira returning to her notebook crystallizes their shared recognition of beauty-through-brokenness, and the cost is conceptual (acceptance of impermanence) though not sharply felt on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Single continuous scene, one transition to dawn, coherent lens held to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, tidepool, mangrove roots, and wet sand anchor the scene immediately and remain spatially coherent. The drake's feather functions as micro-setting: Mira catches it, presses it into her notebook, tucks it behind her ear—each handling constrains a micro-choice and the final mention ("its broken shaft somehow making it more graceful") charges the closure image by reinforcing the thematic reconfiguration. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (iridescent greens, pewter sky, hammered gold water) without catalog excess. The setting breathes with the story rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's effort to harmonize discord between loss and remainder, signaled early and held throughout. The kite-string snap provides one meaningful tightening that narrows the boy's options (loss is irreversible) and deepens Mira's practice by forcing her to articulate it to another. Agency reads as attention and teaching rather than renunciation; Mira's response to the boy forecloses purely private reflection, yet the cost is muted—she shares her insight without visible sacrifice or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the cadence shift at closure reweights the stake, but the escalation lacks a second distinct beat or visible price that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (beauty-in-brokenness) emerges organically from the drake's feather, kite, and Mira's seven-year practice, not from declaration. The final written line—"Morning is not the absence of night, but the tender mending of darkness"—operates as Thematic Echo, articulating the thesis in prompt-like language within the final paragraph, triggering −0.6. The piece invites reflection and avoids pat moralizing elsewhere, but the echo and the boy's too-ready smile ("clutching his broken kite like a treasure") soften what could have been a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture (boy's frozen hands, Mira lifting the kite) but the ending over-explains rather than trusting image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Mira with clean distance control and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "symphonies in seaweed tangles," notices barbule detail, frames events through her poetic lens. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate ("liminal space," "burnished hush"), though phrases like "that particular light" and "study in loss" occasionally drift toward literary summary rather than concrete perception. Dialogue is brief, natural, and advances the moment. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; free indirect style is clean. A few filter verbs ("she thought," "she understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No register mismatch or voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Clarity and momentum are strong, though several lines carry mild overwriting: "each barbule a thread waiting to be woven into dawn" stacks metaphor without adding pressure; "that burnished hush that follows storms" leans decorative. The phrase "her weathered notebook balanced on one knee" and "warmly attentive eyes" feel slightly stock. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is good. The final paragraph's "Morning is not the absence of night, but the tender mending of darkness" reads as thesis statement rather than image-driven closure. Minor figurative density in a reflective piece, but no artifact that obscures causality or dulls the closure image beyond the Thematic Echo already scored in Q5. Proofreading clean; grammar solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—poet finds beauty in brokenness, teaches grieving child—is familiar workshop territory and not transformed by verifiable lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The drake's feather and kite are apt particulars, but the emotional arc (loss → recognition → acceptance) follows a well-worn template. Tone and voice are executed competently, yet the piece lacks a single bold, unexpected inflection that would shift it from competent to memorable. The seven-year anchoring detail and "harmonizing discord" phrasing offer specificity, but the core synthesis remains predictable in hindsight. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for template proximity without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, observes the kite, retrieves it, and offers interpretation to the boy. Her choices (catching the feather, walking toward the kite, helping gather remains) are gentle actions that enable the ending conversation, not decisions that alter her own tactics or foreclose a path with cost. She functions as guide rather than protagonist under pressure. Setup clear, middle development present, ending shaped by her teaching—two gates solid, third (causal pressure on her own stake) partial. Lyric reprise (feather in opening, feather in final notebook return) reweights meaning slightly but does not create a visible tradeoff for Mira herself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drake's feather appears in the opening tidepool, Mira catches it and notes its broken shaft, presses it into her notebook between stanzas, tucks it behind her ear, and it returns in the penultimate paragraph ("its broken shaft somehow making it more graceful") and final paragraph ("tucked between pages"). Setup, development (caught, handled, worn), and payoff (charges closure image by reinforcing brokenness-as-grace) all present. The feather enables Mira's reflection and visibly models the theme, yet it does not constrain a choice under pressure or impose a cost—it illustrates rather than narrows options. Three gates met; causal pressure modest; closure linkage solid but thematic rather than plot-decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" as concept appears in the opening ("each barbule a thread waiting to be woven into dawn"), Mira's incomplete poems "attempting to capture those moments just before sunrise when darkness and light existed simultaneously, woven together," and the final sunrise image. Setup present, thematic echo throughout, but the concept does not change on-page options or tactics—it is narrated philosophy rather than dramatized method. The weaving metaphor remains ornamental; Mira does not literally weave or make a tactical choice because of it. Functional at theme level, swappable at plot level.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" appears once as description ("warmly attentive eyes") when Mira watches the kite. The trait is shown through her patient observation, retrieval of the kite, and teaching, yet it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Mira's warmth enables connection but never competes with another impulse or forces a tradeoff. Functional as character coloring, replaceable as stake-driver. Setup implicit, middle use mild, payoff absent. No gate for causal pressure or closure participation; the trait supports but does not define a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tend" is Mira's stated purpose ("she had come here every morning for seven years, tending to this liminal space"), frames her handling of the feather and kite, and motivates the final collaborative act of imagining repair ("weave new paper through the gaps"). Setup clear, middle development solid (tending as retrieval and teaching), payoff direct (she returns to her notebook, "the world continued its patient work of harmonizing all its broken, beautiful pieces"). The action is not easily swappable—remove "tend" and the closure loses coherence. However, the tending itself is more curatorial than agonistic; it does not create a visible cost or narrow live options under pressure, keeping it shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is named early as Mira's purpose ("learning to harmonize the discord between what was lost and what remained") and echoed in the final line ("harmonizing all its broken, beautiful pieces"). The method is declared but not dramatized—Mira does not perform a specific harmonizing technique on the page; she observes, retrieves, and offers interpretation. Setup present, mechanics absent, payoff thematic only. The method could be swapped for "finding meaning in fragments" with minor edits. Ornamental at plot level, functional at theme level.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors the opening, provides the tidepool where the feather rests, the wet sand Mira kneels on, the shallows where the kite crashes, and the shore where dawn light turns water to "hammered gold." Setup immediate, development continuous (spatial choreography clear, environment supplies resources—feather, kite—that drive beats), payoff strong (the dawn light on water charges the final image and reinforces the woven-darkness-into-light theme). The setting pressures the encounter by collecting broken things and supplying the post-storm hush that frames Mira's practice. Micro-setting (tidepool, wet sand) alters tactics by placing objects within reach. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as a kite string snaps" is the story's inciting incident and sole sharp event, occurring at the midpoint and driving the second half (Mira retrieves kite, teaches boy). Setup occurs when the kite is first mentioned; the snap is dramatized on the page ("the sharp snap carrying across the water"); payoff follows as Mira and the boy gather remains and the piece moves to dawn. The snap tightens decisions by creating the boy's immediate loss, yet time itself is not a live pressure—Mira has no clock constraint, and the dawn arrives as poetic closure rather than deadline. Two gates solid (setup, snap event), third partial (time as atmosphere, not tactical constraint).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is demonstrated through her seven-year practice, her attention to the broken feather, and her teaching response to the boy's loss. Setup clear (seven years, incomplete poems), development solid (she catches, examines, and preserves the broken feather; she lifts the torn kite to show the boy new patterns), payoff direct (she helps imagine repair, writes the morning-as-mending line). The motivation is enacted rather than merely told, and it shapes her final choice. However, there is no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost—Mira's discovery is uncontested and her teaching costs her nothing visible. Lyric reprise (incomplete poems → incomplete feather → incomplete kite → "forever becoming") reweights meaning with modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" appears explicitly ("that burnished hush that follows storms") and governs the piece's acoustic and emotional register throughout: quiet lagoon breath, diminishing whispers, murmurs, soft percussion, the boy's soft declaration, Mira's voice "barely above the lagoon's murmur." Setup immediate, tone modulates subtly (tension during kite flight, break at the snap, contemplative resolution), and payoff strong—the tone charges the final image by sustaining the post-storm stillness through dawn. The hush never fractures under pressure, maintaining coherence. It enables rather than constrains, but it is indispensable to the story's effect; remove it and the closure loses resonance. Tone as method, not mere mood.</comment>
