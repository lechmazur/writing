<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and embodied throughout—"furiously tranquil" reads as a lived contradiction, not a label. Her decision to encode poems in light and plant seeds in negative space shows agency under pressure, and the final choice to seal the envelope with visible cost (continuing a dangerous vigil) feels earned. Minor slip: the reflection on censors living "below, trapped in the weather of their own making" edges toward abstract philosophical summary rather than character-bound perception in a high-pressure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Maya resets the timer, commits to the vigil with visible stakes ("revolution could be written in the grammar of storms"), and the final image of the turning dome reweights her entire resistance as patient and unstoppable. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through recurring motifs (timer, envelope, storm, stars) and a cadence shift at the end crystallizes meaning. One constraint: the lens wobbles slightly in the middle third between causal (her discovery of the envelope drives new work) and accumulative (density of metaphor), but it coheres at closure. Cost is felt: she remains in exile, isolated, risking discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice throughout: altitude above the cloud line becomes both literal vantage and tactical advantage, the storm drives others away to create the isolation she needs, and the darkroom's absolute darkness enables her light-poems. The timer, photographic paper, and sealed envelope function as micro-setting objects that shape her resistance methods. Spatial choreography is clean (dome, window, darkroom, drying line). The storm's "electric kiss" charges the final atmosphere and ties directly to her conceptual breakthrough about grammar of storms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: survive censorship by creating a coded resistance that evades detection. Pressure tightens through one meaningful escalation—her boldest poem yet, a "direct response" that plants seeds in negative space, raising the risk of discovery. The final act (sealing the envelope, resetting the timer) forecloses safer paths and commits her to continued danger with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from passive documentation to active poetic resistance sufficiently narrows options. Minor gap: we don't see a moment where safer alternatives are weighed and rejected in scene, only Maya's assertion of boldness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: censorship scars become a map, silence learns to speak, absence reveals more than presence. The final image—"revolution could be written in the grammar of storms"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to resist totalitarian erasure) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in every metaphor: "masks slip from their moorings" as revolution, "rarefied" language as tactical distillation. The cartography-of-scars concept charges the entire piece and pays off when she becomes "the mist that passed through" chains. No thematic echo or summary paragraph; the work remains concrete and image-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Maya's perceptual signature (astronomical terms, photographic process, poetic compression) remains consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "furiously tranquil," "rarefied," "cartography of scars." Register is appropriate throughout except for one slip: "They formed a constellation of fear, revealing precisely what the state couldn't bear to let its people imagine" reads slightly expository in an otherwise imagistic passage. No dialogue present (correctly, given isolation). The prose modulates with pressure—shorter syntax during the storm's peak, longer contemplative rhythm at the reflective close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Lightning struck the rod above, sending electricity crackling through the dome's metal frame. Maya remained furiously tranquil" delivers setting, action, and character state). Rhythm varies purposefully. Two issues lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop—"Each deletion had taught her the exact shape of what couldn't be said, and therefore, paradoxically, how to say it" restates the prior paragraph's "scars fascinated her more than the original words" without added pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "silver veins across the cloudscape" and "electric kiss" are serviceable but not fresh. Clarity remains high; no scaffolding or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of censorship-as-map, photographic negatives as poetic medium, and altitude-as-vantage is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar "artist under totalitarianism" material through concrete mechanics: light-poems exposed with a penlight, scars teaching the shape of the forbidden. The turn—learning to "rarefied" language and plant seeds in negative space—feels inevitable in hindsight and grows from prior beats. Risk: the accumulative structure and metaphoric density could have obscured clarity, but the piece commits fully and maintains legibility. One friction: "furiously tranquil" and "rarefied" carry faint echoes of high-literary diction that occasionally drift toward ornament rather than lived necessity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya drives every major turn: discovers the envelope, decides to respond with her boldest poem, plants seeds in negative space, seals the new work for the next finder. Her choices alter tactics (from passive documentation to active encoding) and the final reset of the timer crystallizes her ongoing commitment with visible cost. Present in setup (internal exile poet), middle (creating light-poems), and closure (sealing envelope, resetting timer). Causal pressure is strong; the story's logic depends on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The timer appears in the opening line, marks the vigil throughout ("three minutes," "sixty seconds," countdown), and is reset in the final beat to signal continuation. It functions as both literal tool (developing photographs) and metaphor (measured pause between exposure and revelation). The timer constrains her work rhythm, creates urgency ("The timer reached zero"), and the final reset charges the closure image with commitment to the cycle. Used across setup, middle beats, and ending with evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Vigil in pause" shapes the entire narrative structure: Maya works in the held breath between discovery and understanding, in the darkroom's pause between exposure and revelation, in the storm's interval when others have fled. The concept constrains her tactics (she must work in intervals, seal work for future discovery) and the ending crystallizes it: "another scar would become a star. The vigil continued." Present throughout and essential to closure, though occasionally the concept tips toward thematic echo rather than constraining on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears as a direct label ("Maya remained furiously tranquil") and is embodied in her steady breathing during the lightning strike. It describes her state under pressure but doesn't demonstrably constrain a specific choice with visible cost—she doesn't, for example, choose silence over outburst because of this trait. The attribute is present and consistent but more descriptive than causal. Mid-band: purposeful and apt, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Rarefy" defines Maya's core tactical innovation: distilling language until only essence remains, making words too pure for censors to grasp. The action drives her resistance method ("Storm" became "the breathing between spaces"), enables her survival, and is central to the thematic payoff ("rarefied to their essence, rose like vapor through every seal"). Present in setup (her discovery), middle (the mechanics), and closure (the successful encoding). Removing "rarefy" would require a complete rewrite of her method. Strong integration with slight swappability—"distill" or "compress" could substitute with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sealed envelope is discovered in the supply closet behind a bus timetable, contains the contraband negatives that teach Maya about censorship scars, and she uses the same method (sealing her work behind next month's timetable) to continue the chain. The method is signaled early, shapes her understanding of the resistance network, and structures the ending action. Two gates clearly met (setup discovery, closure repetition); middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The parallel bookend is purposeful but the method itself is somewhat passive—it's a container more than an active constraint on attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is indispensable: altitude above the cloud line provides literal and metaphorical vantage, the storm drives others away to create necessary isolation, the dome's turning follows stars (charging the final image), the darkroom enables light-poems, and the lightning's "electric kiss" charges the atmosphere with possibility. The setting pressures every choice (when to work, how to hide evidence, what she can see that censors cannot) and supplies the resources (photographic equipment, isolation, vertical advantage) that make her resistance possible. Present across all beats and inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When masks slip from their moorings" functions as Maya's encoded phrase for revolution and appears in the final beat: "marking time until all masks would finally slip." The timeframe is more conceptual than literal—it describes an awaited future moment rather than tightening present decisions. It primes the ending image and connects to the theme of exposure, but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics on the page. Present in setup (as coded language) and closure (as promise), but the middle lacks temporal pressure tied to this specific frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire to understand the cartography of scars is dramatized throughout: she studies the censors' red marks, learns from deletions, and creates new work that maps absences. This motivation drives her boldest poem (responding to the scars), shapes her method (planting seeds in negative space), and pays off in the closure image ("each scar would become a star"). The friction between wanting to speak and needing to survive is constant and costly—she remains in exile, isolated, risking discovery. Desire is shown through concrete choices rather than told, though the phrase "cartography of scars" itself edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: wonder at the universe ("stars that had been burning their messages"), charged tension during the storm ("Lightning struck the rod above"), and quiet determination in the ending ("patient and unstoppable"). The storm's electricity charges key beats and the final image of the turning dome watching eternal stars creates resonant closure. "Storm-kissed wonder" is embodied rather than declared—the tone emerges from concrete images (silver veins of lightning, electric kiss lingering, thunder like applause) that support pressure without flattening into static mood. Strong integration across setup, escalation, and ending.</comment>
