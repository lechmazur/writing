<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sage's motivation is clear—finding the lost child—and her sensory degradation ("no longer trusted her nose") creates character-specific constraint. The bloodhound courier ancestry provides backstory that tilts present choice, anchoring the magnetic-field intuition without forced epiphany. However, the emotional progression from seventeen years of corpse-tracking to hopeful summoning feels compressed; the shift from retirement to renewed purpose lands cleanly but the intermediate grief and loss remain told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Heap, shipping container, Sage's den) and the drive lens reads Causal: leaf → phonograph → grooves → map → journey → valley. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sage's howl summons the lost, transforming her role from body-finder to living-connector, with the cost felt in her ended retirement and new obligation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf's veins translate into routes. Minor slip: the valley's impossible fertility and the children's gathering mechanism arrive with minimal setup, creating a small causality softness that does not break the ending but reduces inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Heap is vividly particular—tower-stacks of automobiles, cracked earth where the Mississippi ran—and the scrapyard supplies the phonograph that unlocks the map, constraining Sage's means. The green valley hidden in a glass crater charges the final image with impossible contrast. Spatial choreography across the three-night journey remains clear. The micro-setting (shipping container den, phonograph horn) shapes key choices. One slip: the valley's autumn trees and fertile soil feel ornamental rather than causally prepared; their mechanics are asserted, not earned through prior world rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the child—is signaled early and tightens when the leaf reveals coordinates only Sage can read, narrowing her path to one magnetic compass. The journey costs three nights and visible solitude, and the closure redefines her purpose with the obligation to guide others, a felt price that forecloses her retirement. Agency is clear: Sage chooses to leave the Heap, follow the chromatic compass, and howl to summon refugees. One escalation: the leaf's translation forces her ancestral gift into use. The valley's arrival and the children's revelation land with stakes intact, though coincidence (other refugees arriving simultaneously) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through image and action: distance measured in grief, closeness through endurance, the waxed leaf as preserved promise bridging loss. "Distance isn't measured in kilometers but in grief" is slightly over-articulated but integrated into the valley's gathering logic rather than imposed. The final howl—summoning, not mourning—reweights Sage's seventeen-year search without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the child's choice of Sage ("those who've known real loss"), and the valley as earned sanctuary rather than miracle. No thematic drift; the premise (scent-tracker turned hope-guide) holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Sage's failing eyes and nose create character-specific sensory hierarchy. Kemp's "wild hush" voice and diction ("Heard you needed this") distinguish him briefly. The phrase "color-tinted revelations" and "chromatic compass" carry a consistent metaphoric logic tied to the grooves' text-as-vibration. One slip: "translate distance into closeness" and "sorrow transformed into hope" edge toward thematic summary rather than enacted perception at peak moments. Diction remains within Sage's plausible lexicon (bloodhound tracker, post-war survivor) with minor elevation ("scripture," "mythology") that supports rather than disrupts voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high: "tower-stacks of crushed automobiles," "retrofitted shipping container wedged between two mountains of scrap" do double work as setting and character history. One paraphrase loop: "The leaf contains coordinates" / "each vein became a route" restates the same mechanic across two beats without added pressure. Figurative density is controlled except in the phonograph scene, where "meaning pressed directly into her mind," "color-tinted revelations," and "microscopic etchings" cluster without a taught pattern. No copy errors or unclear action sequences; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bloodhound ancestral magnetism + phonograph groove-reading + waxed-leaf map—feels specific and non-obvious, transforming the tracker trope through sensory loss and vibrational decoding. The valley's impossible fertility and the children's gathering mechanic read fresh in combination. Risk-taking (grooves as microscopic text, veins as routes) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative element: the post-apocalyptic scrapyard settlement and resource-war backstory follow familiar dystopian templates; transformation comes through the phonograph/leaf mechanics rather than the wasteland itself. The emotional truth (loss-to-hope, retirement-to-renewal) avoids generic templates through the particular detail of courier-dog bloodlines and magnetic-field intuition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from line one. Development: Sage's tracking skills (seventeen years finding corpses) enable her to read the leaf's veins as routes and activate her ancestral magnetic gift, narrowing her path. Closure: her decision to howl and summon refugees transforms her role from body-finder to living-connector, with visible cost (ended retirement, new obligation). Causal pressure across three beats; irreplaceable (only a bloodhound courier descendant can read the chromatic compass). Cost tied directly to the character trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early as gift from the child. Development: Sage holds it to the phonograph horn, and "new grooves appeared... translating its preserved veins into readable paths"—constrains her means. Closure: "The waxed leaf glowed warmer in her paws, its preserved perfection no longer a relic but a promise" reweights prior material with felt cost. Causal pressure across three beats; the leaf drives the map mechanics and charges the final image. High specificity (wax preservation, vein translation) and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: present in the cylinder's grooves ("color-tinted revelations"). Development: each shade pulls Sage "toward magnetic north-northwest," altering her navigation tactics. Closure: the chromatic compass is implicit in the howl's summoning, though not foregrounded. Shapes two beats (phonograph reading, journey navigation) with moderate causal pressure. Specificity is moderate (tinted = color-coded meaning) but could swap for "encoded" with minor edits. Cost connection present but not maximized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in Sage's tracking history. Development: label-only until the journey, where "her awakening ancestral gift" and reading "every crack in the earth readable as scripture" demonstrate intuitive description enabling navigation. Closure: not visibly reweighted. Shapes one beat (the journey) with moderate causal pressure. Swappability moderate (could be "instinctive navigator" with edits). Cost connection weak (no visible tradeoff for intuition).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: the child whispers the leaf holds "a riddle, one that could 'translate distance into closeness.'" Development: Sage decodes the riddle via phonograph and leaf mechanics, unlocking the map. Closure: the riddle's answer (grief-measured distance → hope-bridged closeness) redefines her purpose. Causal pressure across three beats. Moderate irreplaceability (could be "puzzle" or "cipher" with minor edits, though "riddle" carries folklore resonance). Cost tied to decoding effort and journey.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: Kemp brings the phonograph early. Development: the cylinder fits perfectly, grooves hold microscopic text, and Sage uses the horn to translate the leaf's veins—constrains her means across two beats. Closure: the phonograph mechanics enable the entire map discovery, without which Sage cannot reach the valley. High causal pressure, high specificity (grooves as vibrational text, horn as translator), and irreplaceability. Visible cost: Sage depends on Kemp's single working player, tying her agency to scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: anchored early (Heap, tower-stacks, shipping container). Development: the scrapyard supplies the phonograph and frames Sage's solitude; the wasteland's cracked earth and glass craters shape her three-night journey. Closure: the green valley in the crater's heart contrasts the wasteland, charging the final image. Shapes three beats with moderate causal pressure. The Heap provides resources (phonograph) and the wasteland imposes navigation cost. Specificity high (cracked Mississippi bed, kilometer-spanning scrap).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "after seventeen years tracking corpses through the resource wars" and "the world before" anchor the post-war frame early. Development: the wars' consequences (scattered families, sterile craters, failed satellites) motivate Sage's journey and the valley's rarity. Closure: implicit (the valley as post-war sanctuary). Shapes two beats (backstory, valley discovery) with moderate causal pressure. Swappability moderate (could be "after the collapse" with minor edits). Cost connection present (wars created the loss Sage bridges) but not maximized in tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: the child's whispered riddle introduces the motivation early. Development: Sage's journey dramatizes the translation—"reading absence and make it presence"—with visible cost (three nights, solitude, ended retirement). Closure: the howl enacts the motivation, summoning the lost to bridge distance. Causal pressure across three beats; the desire drives every major turn. Friction present: Sage's initial skepticism versus her ultimate commitment. High irreplaceability (the motivation is the story's spine).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "that wild hush that infected everyone who'd survived the wars, as if speaking too loudly might summon back the bombers" teaches the tone early. Development: tone modulates with pressure—Kemp's hushed voice, Sage's quiet travel, the "wild hush of dawn" at closure. Closure: the howl breaks the hush purposefully, reweighting prior restraint with summoning urgency. Coherent through turns; the tone charges the final image by contrast. High specificity ("wild hush" = post-trauma restraint + instinctual caution).</comment>
