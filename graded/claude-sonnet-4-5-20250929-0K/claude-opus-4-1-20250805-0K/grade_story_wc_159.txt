<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is consistent and her systematic nature embodied through concrete actions (heating orchid stems, whispering the name repeatedly). The thirty-year search provides weight, but the actual choice at climax—capturing the name—feels inevitable rather than conflicted; no competing impulse complicates the moment. Interior life relies on poetic abstraction ("foxglove regret") more than embodied contradiction. The grandmother backstory anchors present stakes but the final choice lacks visible cost since Mira simply completes her life's work without foreclosing an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the cracked chime's widening, the song becoming clearer, and Mira's race against the bamboo's final split. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration—the name joins the constellation, shifting Mira's purpose from search to stewardship. Cost is conceptual (the object breaks, the search ends) but legible in "until she too became a name requiring preservation." One meaningful tightening (the crack spreading) drives the single scene to its cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library, crystalline walls, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo chime establish vivid, purpose-driven setting. The crack itself functions as micro-setting, creating the new resonance chamber that constrains Mira's window of action. Sensory detail is selective (dawn light, hollow melody gaining undertone, the orchid pulsing with light) and filtered through Mira's caretaker focus. The Wall of Lost Names as spatial anchor charges the final image. No occupational depth issues; the library's suspended state and the orchid preservation mechanics read plausibly fantastical and consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing her grandmother's name before the bamboo splits—is signaled early and tightens through one clear escalation: "The bamboo chime shuddered, its crack spreading like lightning." Mira's agency drives the scene (retrieving the orchid, heating it, whispering the name), and the ticking clock adds urgency. Cost is legible in the object's destruction and the end of her thirty-year search, though no competing want complicates her choice. The accumulative lens supports this single deepening; no reversal is required, but the resolution feels slightly frictionless since Mira encounters no internal or external obstacle beyond time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as rebellion against oblivion, memory as bridge rather than monument—emerges organically from the glass orchids, the Wall of Lost Names, and Mira's shift from searcher to eternal caretaker. The final image ("forever found") and the line "bridges to remembrance" answer the thematic question without moralizing. The cracked bamboo's transformation (damage creating new resonance) subtly reweights loss as generative. Subtext operates in "deserted marvels," the Great Forgetting, and Mira's eventual fate. No overt thesis or prompt echo in the ending; the orchid's glow and the name joining the chorus offer resonant closure tied to concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Mira's perception throughout. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Diction ("gently systematic precision," "foxglove regret") is elevated and lyric, fitting the library's ethereal register, though phrases like "methodical rituals" and "practiced grace" edge toward stock descriptors. The prose carries a distinct, formal texture that matches the setting. Perceptual signature is clear (Mira notices chimes, orchids, preserved sounds). No dialogue to assess. Free indirect access is clean. The final paragraph's "sacred work" risks slight sermonizing but stays within character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (the orchid-shaping sequence). Clarity is strong; no causal breaks. However, several passages loop conceptually: "deserted marvels" appears twice in similar phrasing, "gently systematic" / "methodical rituals" / "practiced grace" / "measured steps" / "characteristic measured steps" recycles the same trait across multiple beats without added pressure. "The opal library hung suspended" / "The opal library would continue floating" bookends without transformation. Figurative language ("foxglove regret, beautiful and poisonous," "constellation of soft luminescence") is dense but mostly coherent. Template stems ("She was," "She reached," "She carried") cluster in the middle third. Deduct −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; strong closure image mitigates further loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass-orchid memory repository and sound-as-object preservation offer a fresh synthesis of archival fantasy. The cracked bamboo creating new resonance is a specific, non-obvious inflection. However, the lone-caretaker-in-ethereal-archive and the search-for-lost-grandmother's-name are familiar templates. Emotional specificity (thirty-year search, the particular name "Solmieth") personalizes the frame. The ending's "until she too became a name requiring preservation" is quietly earned. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric premise without retreat but does not challenge genre expectations. Transformation is solid within the template; originality rests on execution and synthesis rather than structural boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, drives the retrieval and preservation sequence, and her choice to capture the name before the bamboo splits shapes the story's single escalation and closure. Her role is indispensable; removing her would collapse the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo appears early as the inciting object, its crack widens to escalate pressure in the middle, and it splits at the climax, forcing the final capture. The crack's resonance chamber is a specific property that enables the plot; a generic chime would not work. The object is handled and its state evolves causally across three beats, directly shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" is named twice and the emptiness of the library (visitors stopped decades ago) establishes tone and Mira's isolation. However, the concept does not constrain tactics or create a turn; the story would function identically if the library were occasionally visited. It enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental to the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is embodied in Mira's measured steps, practiced grace, and methodical orchid-shaping. The trait enables her successful capture of the name under time pressure. However, no visible cost or trade-off arises from this attribute—it is purely enabling, never a constraint or vulnerability that complicates choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lighting the ceremonial lamp is present in one beat and coincides with the crack widening, but the causal link is unclear—does the flame's heat widen the crack, or is it coincidental timing? The action does not drive a turn; Mira could have noticed the widening crack without this ritual. The lamp appears once and is not revisited.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echo/song is signaled early as the wind chime's changed melody, its mechanics (the crack creating a new resonance chamber) are explained, and it provides the grandmother's name "Solmieth." The song structures Mira's attempts (listening, then capturing) and delivers the climax. Removing the song would eliminate the plot's engine. The method is indispensable and shapes two beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opal library frames every beat and the Wall of Lost Names anchors the final image. However, the setting does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome—Mira's workshop and tools are mentioned but not shown limiting her. The suspended-above-clouds detail is atmospheric but functionally inert. The library is essential to tone and closure participation but not to causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" appears once as a descriptor of the library's nature, not as a timeframe. No museum visit or traversal occurs; the phrase functions as metaphor for the library's purpose rather than a temporal or spatial constraint. If "across" was meant to indicate passage through emotional states, it remains abstract and does not track time or tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is dramatized through Mira's thirty-year search, her immediate recognition of the song, and her urgent actions to capture it. The desire drives every choice in the scene and shapes the ending's shift from search to achieved stewardship. The motivation creates friction (time pressure) and pays a cost (the search ends, the object breaks). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Foxglove regret is named once and the tone of melancholy beauty pervades (translucent blooms, extinct beauties, the Great Forgetting). The tone modulates slightly—wistfulness shifts to urgency during the capture, then to quiet resolution at the Wall. However, "foxglove regret" itself does not recur or charge the final image; the ending leans toward gentle triumph rather than sustained beautiful poison. The tone is coherent and purposeful but the specific foxglove metaphor is underused.</comment>
