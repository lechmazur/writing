<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is mostly concrete and embodied through paint-stained hands and insomnia as creative state. The progression from creative drought to community formation is legible but moves swiftly through intermediate steps. The final gathering functions more as thematic payoff than as a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (insomnia as gift versus burden) but remains understated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered memory and kindness early, then deepens through painting and online response to rooftop gathering. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the greenhouse becomes a shared space; "some languages are never truly lost") with felt social cost implicit in the transformation from solitary artist to facilitator. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, smog, Mira) arrive cleanly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the online post sparks community formation, reweighting isolation into connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies both isolation and eventual communal space, constraining Mira's creative process and later enabling the gathering. Saffron smog, tomato vines, moon through glass, and herb garden steam ground the setting in sensory particulars filtered through Mira's artistic attention. The moon-tipped brush as micro-object charges the final tableau ("rested in a place of honor"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the painter's workspace, online realm, and populated greenhouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving that strangers remember kindness. One meaningful turn occurs when Mira posts the painting and messages flood in, validating the premise and narrowing her trajectory from solitary memorial to communal curator. Agency at closure is acceptance rather than decision; the greenhouse "became" a gathering place (passive construction). The tightening is legible but the cost—what Mira gives up or risks—remains implicit rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the painting's layered scripts, the old man's gift, and the cascade of memory stories. "Kindness leaves marks deeper than words" avoids direct moralizing by anchoring in the moon-tipped brush and shared seeds. The final image (painting under moon, insomnia as bridge) reweights prior isolation into purpose without stating a thesis. The concept of lost languages integrates tightly with the thematic question of whether care transcends translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "saffron-tinted," "silver lattices," "burnt saffron." Diction modulates appropriately from solitary reflection ("liminal space between waking and dreaming") to community warmth without unmotivated register shifts. The single line of direct dialogue from the old man ("For remembering") carries weight. Compression in the final section (weeks elided, gathering summarized) fits the accumulative lens without flattening voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing anchor with the greenhouse and moonlight. Information density is high in the painting sequence ("Each stroke was a memory"). Minor scaffold appears in the penultimate paragraph: "most moving were the stories" telegraphs its own importance. The phrase "methodically hopeful" feels slightly imposed in the painting beat. No paraphrase loops; figurative language (gauze, frost, seeds) remains coherent and sparse enough to avoid overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of visual art, lost languages, and kindness-as-memory offers a fresh synthesis. Execution is solid but the template of "artist discovers community through sharing work online" is familiar. The moon-tipped brush as inheritance and creative catalyst adds specificity. The greenhouse-as-gathering-place finale transforms Mira's isolation but the turn arrives quickly, summarized rather than dramatized in granular choice. The piece commits to its premise without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia frames the creative window and her role shifts from painter to facilitator, but key decisions (to post, to open the greenhouse) are narrated as outcomes rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Present in setup, middle painting sequence, and closure gathering; contributes to two beats but agency at turns is understated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears in three beats: gift memory, painting sequence where it "seemed to pulse with warmth," and final tableau "rested in a place of honor." Its pale bristles and lunar connection enable the painting and charge the closure image. Specific properties (moon-tip, frost-like bristles) matter; removing it would flatten the central memorial gesture and the inheritance thread.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lost languages shape the painting's content (scripts from bodega signs, dialects, symbols) and the online response reveals their social stakes. The concept alters Mira's tactics (what to paint) and charges the thematic resolution. Early signal, middle involvement (painting and posting), and closure participation (gathering where "lost and living" languages are spoken). Causal pressure is present but slightly abstract; the languages remain symbolic rather than creating on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named once ("roused something deep within her, something methodically hopeful") and describes her state during the painting sequence. The trait does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost; it labels her approach rather than creating a trade-off. Functional but replaceable with "patient" or "persistent."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in the painting beat ("The daydream roused something deep within her") and closure line ("wait for the right light to rouse them from sleeping"). The action describes internal awakening and thematic payoff. It frames the transformation but does not itself constitute a major plot turn; Mira's decision to paint and post drives the sequence. Purposeful reprise charges the final image; essential to the language-as-dormant metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moonlight is present throughout: opening image, painting sequence where "moonlight pooled on her workspace," and closing nights "when the waxing moon silvered the smog." The daydream occurs once ("letting the lunar glow seep through her eyelids"). The method shapes the painting scene and charges the atmosphere but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat. Early signal, closure participation, but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse isolates Mira from the city, supplies moonlight through glass, and later becomes the gathering space. It enables the painting (workspace, herb garden steam) and transforms into communal ground. Setting constrains the creative act and alters outcome; removing it would require a different space logic. Three-gate integration: setup, middle (painting location), and closure (gathering place).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The waxing moon frames the opening, painting sequence, and closing nights. Time does not tighten decisions within scenes; "three nights" of insomnia and "hours" before online response are mentioned but do not impose a clock. The moon's phase is atmospheric rather than causal. Present in setup and closure with lyric resonance, but middle use is passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to memorialize the old man and validate unspoken kindness drives the painting and posting. The online flood of stories proves the premise. The desire is stated ("For the old man...For everyone who spoke kindness") and tested on the page, but friction between want and cost is minimal—Mira succeeds without significant sacrifice. Early signal, middle action, closure validation; causal role is present but the stake does not force a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears in the opening (smog), middle (paint color), and closing line. The tone is consistent—contemplative, warm, nocturnal—and modulates only slightly between solitary and communal beats. It charges the final image but does not shift under pressure. Purposeful lyric reprise that reweights the opening atmosphere; functional but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
