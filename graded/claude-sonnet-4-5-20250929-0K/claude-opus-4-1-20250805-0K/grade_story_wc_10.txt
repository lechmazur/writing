<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—translating silence into thermal music—but her interiority leans toward elevated register ("rectify what the silence had stolen") that occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy. Internal conflict is present (grief over lost crewmates, tears at dawn) but could deepen through more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously rather than sequentially. The choice to document thermal patterns feels more like continuation than a peak decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices (selecting tuning forks, working through the night) reveal values but lack the friction of competing goods at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (conservatory, Arctic, three months post-accident, alone). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira builds a thermal dictionary through the night, culminating in the realization that she "hadn't lost music at all" but learned its secret language—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her deafness. Cost is conceptual (crewmates frozen, her own transformation) but legible in the final image of thermal symphony and frozen tears. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery that plants compose via heat) though it feels more like revelation than a choice-driven turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vivid and purposeful: transparent walls refracting aurora, thermal imaging system, frost vines responding to vibrations. The setting enables Mira's discovery (tuning fork against glass wall, plants visible through thermal camera) and charges the closure image (winterglass holding its breath, surfaces reflecting organism light). Sensory detail is filtered through her deaf POV (vibrations felt through the floor at 62 Hz, aurora as visual music). Micro-setting (tuning fork case, thermal monitor) constrains and enables her work throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating plant communication into thermal notation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the night's documentation work, with one meaningful deepening when she realizes "music existed beyond sound." The tightening is more epistemological than strategic; no live option is foreclosed with visible tactical cost. Agency reads as attention and documentation rather than a decision between competing paths. The conceptual cost (understanding her deafness as gain rather than loss) is legible but the escalation mechanism relies on discovery rather than choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—communication transcending human senses, beauty persisting after loss—emerges organically from Mira's thermal mapping without overt statement until the final reflection ("beauty finds new ways to be heard"). The Indigenous consultants' earlier claim about plant spirits resurfaces with earned irony. The closing image (winterglass conservatory holding its breath, organisms singing in temperatures) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "unshaken by the silence" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; Mira's perceptual signature (deaf scientist noticing heat signatures, vibrations through feet) is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate sensory frame ("prismatic symphonies," "capsize survivor turned thermal composer") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during reflection). No dialogue present. The prose reflects her scientific mind but sometimes polishes emotion ("frozen tears, tiny crystals") where rawer texture might sharpen urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; information density is high. Minor scaffold detected: "She had to rectify what the silence had stolen" reads slightly templated, and "silently expressive" recurs as a phrase-echo. Figurative density is controlled (frost patterns pulse, heat signatures bloom) but "unshaken marvels" in paragraph four feels forced. No loops or major clarity loss. The final paragraph's "silently expressive dance across the keys" mirrors earlier "silently expressive" without adding pressure—a micro-paraphrase that doesn't obscure but slightly dulls momentum. Overall propulsion is strong through the night's work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—deaf scientist discovers plants communicate via heat—is fresh and non-obvious, synthesizing deafness, Arctic botany, and thermal imaging into a coherent whole. The transformation of Kepler's tuning forks from auditory tools to vibration sources is purposeful. Risk is present (sensory substitution as theme, no conventional dialogue or antagonist) and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the emotional arc (loss → acceptance → discovery of new music) follows a recognizable recovery template. Specificity in thermal imaging and frost-plant response elevates the concept beyond generic "disabled scientist finds new way."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (capsize survivor) is present throughout and her survival shapes her current isolation and deaf state, which enables the thermal discovery. Her choices (working alone, selecting tuning forks, documenting patterns) create incremental turns. The survivor identity is signaled early (paragraph two) and returns at closure ("capsize survivor turned thermal composer"). However, the survival itself is backstory; her present choices are more observer-scientist than protagonist under conflicting pressure. She makes discovery-driven moves rather than high-cost decisions between competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in paragraphs two, five, eight, and ten—four distinct beats. It's Kepler's talisman, then a tool (432 Hz fork against cloudberries), then a closure anchor ("touched the tuning fork case once more... He would have marveled"). The case evolves from grief object to discovery instrument, participating causally in the thermal experiments. Strong integration, though the final mention is reflective rather than action-driven, keeping it shy of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named once (paragraph four: "the world's understanding of these unshaken marvels") as a descriptor for the plants. It's thematically apt—plants unshaken by silence—but doesn't constrain tactics or shape a turn; Mira could pursue the same thermal mapping if the phrase were absent. The concept is more label than driver. Present and resonant, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears twice: paragraph four ("her hands moved across the keyboard, silently expressive") and the final paragraph ("fingers moving in their own silently expressive dance"). It characterizes her work style and ties to her deafness. The attribute enables her keyboard documentation and final transcription, shaping two beats with consistent meaning. However, the second use is near-paraphrase without added cost or reweighting, and the trait could swap for "wordless" or "quiet" with minor loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rectify" is named once in paragraph four ("She had to rectify what the silence had stolen") and drives her documentation goal. It sets up the night's work and the final realization that she's building a new notation system. However, the action is more thesis statement than on-page turning point; the story could pivot on "document" or "translate" with similar effect. Present in setup and implied at closure, but swappable without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early (paragraph three: thermal imaging reveals heat patterns as "emotional landscapes"), demonstrated in the middle (Arctic willows flare crimson with longing, ice-plants pulse blue-white with joy), and shapes the closure (thermal symphony, degrees instead of notes). The method is mechanically specific (62 Hz vibration, two-degree Celsius spiraling pattern) and causally necessary—without it, Mira has no discovery. It constrains her approach (she must use thermal camera and tuning forks) and enables the final realization. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is named in the opening line, provides resources throughout (thermal imaging system, frost vines, modified cloudberries), and charges the final image ("winterglass conservatory held its breath"). Its transparent walls and Arctic location enable the thermal work and aurora backdrop. Removing it would require a full structural rewrite. Setup, development (glass wall as tuning-fork contact point), and payoff (closure image) are all present. Strong integration with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" frames the entire premise (three months post-accident, deafness as inciting condition). The timeframe is signaled in paragraph two and sustained through the night's work ("as dawn approached"). It tightens Mira's isolation and necessitates the thermal method. However, within the story's present action, time doesn't create urgency—Mira works through the night without a ticking constraint. The condition is essential; the immediate clock is loose. Strong setup and closure participation, weaker middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to translate silence into music is stated in paragraph four, demonstrated through her thermal notation work (paragraphs eight–nine), and resolved at closure ("music existed beyond sound"). It's dramatized via choices (selecting forks, documenting all night) and carries friction (tears, memory of Kepler and drowned crewmates). The want is coherent and drives all beats. Minor limitation: the friction is more elegiac than conflicted—she pursues one goal without competing desires that force tradeoffs on the page.</comment>
