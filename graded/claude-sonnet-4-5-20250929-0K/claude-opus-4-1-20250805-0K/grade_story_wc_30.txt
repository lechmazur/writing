<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaine's motivation to preserve wonder and her acceptance of mechanical/organic duality are established, but her choices feel contemplative rather than tested under pressure. The visitor's transformation is observed rather than dramatized through Kaine's active participation—she guides but doesn't face a meaningful internal conflict or cost. The titan-gear framework and moon-phase fluctuation are told as settled facts without on-page contradiction or stakes. Embodied emotion is sparse; "smiled, an expression that creaked slightly" leans ornamental rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and motifs (creel, furnace, tides) layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the visitor emerges "prismatic," Kaine returns to her work); however, the cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or trade-off crystallizes on the page. The woman's smelting is told in summary ("pulling memories...like silk threads") rather than dramatized with friction or resistance. Orientation is delayed: who Kaine is and what "after tomorrow disappears" means remain vague past the opening paragraphs, triggering a −0.3 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tidal atrium's glass walls and titan-gear harness anchor setting through recurring sensory cues. The furnace room and bamboo creel are handled in multiple beats, and the ocean's rhythm subtly mirrors Kaine's mechanical heartbeat at closure. However, the Q2 Orientation Test penalty caps Q3 at 7.0, and the setting does not constrain a choice—it atmospherically supports theme without altering tactics or imposing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder and guiding transformation—is signaled early but remains static. The visitor's arc unfolds without reversal: she arrives, smelts, and departs successfully with no meaningful friction or cost visible on the page. Kaine observes rather than acts; her own smelting is backstory. The moon reaching apex and the furnace roaring "without flame" are declarative rather than pressure-tested, and no tightening narrows options or raises stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—accepting contradictions, identity as constellation—emerges through images (creel, gears, prismatic edges) and the furnace metaphor. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "preserving wonder one paradox at a time" and "every identity a constellation of possibilities" verge on thematic echo. The visitor's "harmony" and Kaine's "serene acceptance" resolve neatly without ambiguity or lingering tension. The creel's return "empty but somehow heavier with purpose" is told rather than charged through a concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with purposeful compression ("After tomorrow disappears—that peculiar moment...") and a controlled psychic distance. Diction remains within Kaine's contemplative register. The visitor's dialogue is sparse but functional; "I've come to smelt" and her observation about Kaine's duality carry subtext. Elision of the visitor's name and backstory is purposeful and fits the Accumulative lens. However, "salt-metal tang of change" and "edges seemed uncertain, as if she couldn't decide which version of herself to be" lean slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and no major loops. However, "migrating," "fluctuates," "becoming," and "transformations" recur as thematic vocabulary without escalation. "The tidal atrium breathed with the ocean's rhythm" in the opening is echoed by "her mechanical heart beating in time with the tides" at closure—a charged reprise, but the metaphor doesn't tighten. "The wintersun cast long shadows through the atrium, each one a different story, each one true" is figuratively dense without advancing the beat. Minor template cadence in the final two paragraphs: "This was her gift...This was enough...This was enough."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tidal library with self-rewriting books and titan-gear harness offer fresh synthesis. "After tomorrow disappears" and smelting identities from contradictions are intriguing conceptual anchors. However, the mentor-guides-seeker-through-transformative-ritual template is familiar, and the execution does not transform it through specific conflict or cost—Kaine's role is steady, the visitor's arc is smooth. The creel and furnace function symbolically but do not surprise or complicate in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaine is present throughout and her choices (handing over the creel, instructing the visitor) enable the smelting. However, these are facilitative rather than stakes-altering decisions for Kaine herself. She does not face a dilemma or cost tied to her identity as librarian. The titan-gear framework is backstory; her fluctuation with moon phases is mentioned but not tested. She observes the visitor's transformation rather than undergoing one of her own.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The creel appears in three beats: introduced on Kaine's desk holding fragments, handed to the visitor to collect selves, and returned "empty but somehow heavier with purpose." Its function shifts from repository to vessel to symbol. However, the final reprise is told abstractly—"heavier with purpose" is asserted rather than shown through a concrete image or constraint. Removing the creel would weaken thematic coherence but the plot would stand.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Migrating identities shape the premise (books rewrite, Kaine's nature fluctuates, the visitor's edges waver) and the central action (smelting selves into harmony). The concept frames the visitor's problem and Kaine's solution, and the closure image of "prismatic" edges realizes it. However, the mechanics are told: "identity had begun migrating years ago, slipping between scholar and guardian" is summary. The concept drives stakes but not on-page tactical choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is introduced early ("becoming more mechanical during the new moon, more organic at full") and linked to the current night ("approaching fullness, she could smell the salt-metal tang of change"). However, it does not constrain or enable a choice. The trait is descriptive; no scene shows Kaine adapting tactics because of her current phase or paying a cost tied to it. It enriches characterization but remains ornamental to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Smelting is the central action: Kaine defines it, the visitor performs it in the furnace room, and the outcome (prismatic edges) is the closure unit. The action appears in setup, development, and payoff. However, the smelting itself is told in summary over "hours later" without on-page friction, reversals, or visible cost during the process. Removing "smelt" would break the story, but the dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is stated as the method ("requires one to accept contradictions rather than resolve them") and referenced in Caine's backstory ("tried to choose...The titan-gear framework had been her solution—accepting that she could be both"). The visitor's result—"not into one, but into a harmony"—echoes the method. However, the acceptance itself is not dramatized as a struggle or tactical choice during the furnace scene; it is narrated as complete. The method shapes the premise but does not alter on-page tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is introduced immediately and recurs: glass walls reveal ocean rhythm, the space "breathed," the walls become transparent at the moon's apex, and the final image includes "watching the ocean breathe through glass." The setting provides a coherent atmosphere and symbolic resonance. However, it does not constrain a choice—characters move freely between atrium, desk, and furnace room without spatial friction. The atrium charges the closure image but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is introduced early as a premise: the library exists in "perpetual state of becoming, neither fully here nor there." The concept establishes tone and world rules. However, it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No countdown or temporal constraint shapes the visitor's smelting or Kaine's choices. The phrase is atmospheric rather than mechanically active in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Preserving wonder in routine is stated as Kaine's motivation ("This was why she remained—to preserve wonder in routine") and demonstrated through her work (filing transformed books, tending the archives, guiding the visitor). The creel holding fragments and her patient waiting at closure embody the motivation. However, no on-page conflict tests this desire—Kaine does not face a choice between preservation and abandonment, or between routine and disruption. The motivation is coherent but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is named once in the penultimate paragraph and tonally present throughout: contemplative pacing, calm diction, Kaine's acceptance, the visitor's smooth transformation. The tone is consistent but does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—there is no contrasting urgency or friction to deepen the serenity. The final image ("her mechanical heart beating in time with the tides") sustains the tone but does not charge it with new cost or complexity.</comment>
