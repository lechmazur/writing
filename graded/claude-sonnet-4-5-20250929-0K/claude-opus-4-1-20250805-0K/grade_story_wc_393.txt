<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to bridge the chasm violence carved is clear and embodied through six months of searching, and Eliza's contradictory impulses—"He deserved worse than he got" alongside her choice to repair—operate in scene rather than summary. The interior work is concrete ("selecting her words like choosing the right gauge wire"), and the final choice carries visible cost: accepting her brother's guidance despite recognizing his capacity for destruction. Minor slip: Eliza's emotional progression moves quickly from skepticism to acceptance without a visible micro-choice inflection point mid-scene; the journey from "He always broke things" to actively following his instructions feels slightly telescoped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and follows a causal arc: Marcus delivers the journal and damaged heart → Eliza compares it to Thomas's sketches → the repair succeeds → the music plays, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Eliza chooses to "transform an apology into action" with the visible cost of accepting her brother's last gift. The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture, held cleanly to closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Eliza asks Marcus to stay and the companionable silence becomes shared work. Cost is legible: "maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever" articulates the foreclosed path of perpetual grievance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shop's dust motes, fractured light beams, and shelves of frozen dancers anchor spatial grounding and charge the final image when "light caught every brass surface, every crystal window." The clockwork heart's gears "smaller than rice grains" constrain Eliza's repair attempts, and Marcus's settling onto a worn stool tracks body placement through the work session. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "vibrant hush, like the moment before a music box spring releases" reflects Eliza's professional idiom. The environment participates in the closure: "flooding the shop with light" as the mechanism ticks to life makes the physical space witness and instrument of transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Eliza can accept Thomas's apology made tangible—is signaled early and tightens once when she opens the journal and sees his diagrams, shifting her options from refusal to participation. The escalation is driven by Eliza's agency: choosing to follow her brother's instructions is a visible trade-off between maintaining her grievance and attempting repair. Cost is felt: "He deserved worse than he got" names the moral calculus, and the final line confirms she's chosen to rebuild "even stronger than before" rather than preserve the break. The single meaningful deepening fits this length; no coincidence resolves the core tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—the broken clockwork heart, six months of searching, the patient repair process—without thesis statements until the final paragraph's "something beautiful and lasting" risks mild moralizing but is anchored by the preceding scene work. The music box's return with reweighted meaning (twenty years silent → "melody that emerged was simple, almost hesitant at first, then growing stronger") offers a resonant non-literal answer to whether repair is possible. "Maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever" carries ambiguity (acceptance vs. forgiveness) without false equivalence. The closing "clockwork heart beat on, steady as absolution, sure as grace" borders on thematic echo but is rescued by prior embodiment of the repair process across six hours.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV holds third-limited on Marcus throughout with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Eliza's dialogue ("Second opinions… Another perspective on sin, on forgiveness?") carries subtext and goal pursuit, and her speech pattern ("selecting her words like choosing the right gauge wire") distinguishes her professional idiom. Perceptual signature is present: Marcus notices "the same furrow of concentration, the same way of tilting the head" in Eliza's movements, filtering observation through his memory of Thomas. Weakness: the final two paragraphs shift into slightly elevated, authorial register ("blessing what was broken, celebrating what was whole" and "steady as absolution, sure as grace") that drifts from Marcus's established voice under peak closure pressure, triggering a −0.5 deduction for register drift in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The morning sun fought through dissipating storm clouds" vs. the short "You came"), and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Opening and closing lines frame stakes effectively. Minor loops appear: "broken shafts of gold" / "fractured beams" repeat the same image within two paragraphs, and "vibrant hush" recurs three times across the piece as a descriptor without added pressure each time. The final paragraph stacks elevated metaphors ("blessing what was broken," "steady as absolution, sure as grace") that blur into near-paraphrase and slightly dull momentum. Total artifact penalty: −0.6 for template recurrence and synonym churn in non-closure beats, plus −0.3 for figurative density in the closing image that risks overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—chaplain delivers a condemned man's learning notes to enable his sister's repair work—offers a specific, grounded angle on forgiveness narratives. The clockwork heart as literal and metaphorical object avoids pure symbolism by requiring mechanical skill and six hours of on-page labor. Eliza's speech ("He always broke things… But here, he's showing me how to mend") personalizes the arc. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the "estranged sibling receives posthumous apology artifact" template is widely used, and while the music-box repair adds occupational specificity, the emotional arc (grief → tentative acceptance → repair as metaphor) follows familiar beats. Transformation through Eliza's professional idiom and the具体 mechanics elevates but doesn't fully escape the template, justifying a −0.7 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's decision to spend six months searching for Eliza frames the story's inciting action, his delivery of the journal and heart drives the opening turn, and his choice to stay ("Will you stay?") enables the repair scene. His presence in the closing image ("Marcus watched the light continue its slow journey") participates in closure. Present in setup, middle choice (staying), and ending; drives two distinct beats with causal pressure; visible cost (six months of ministry beyond prison walls); however, the final choice is Eliza's, limiting his closure agency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clockwork heart appears in the opening beat (Marcus sets it on the workbench), is examined and repaired across the middle (Eliza compares it to diagrams, threads copper wire, follows instructions), and ticks to life in the ending, enabling the music box to play. Its mechanical specificity ("gears smaller than rice grains," "springs coiled tight") constrains Eliza's repair process, and its successful restoration drives the final image. Present in setup, developed through two major beats with causal pressure (repair attempt → success), and shapes closure directly; irreplaceable due to its unique properties (Thomas's notes, twenty-year break).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Second opinions" is named once in Eliza's opening dialogue and echoed in the final paragraph ("second chances and second opinions"). It shapes the middle beat when Eliza asks Marcus to stay for "another perspective," enabling his participation in the repair. However, the concept functions more as thematic accent than active stake-shaper; the repair could proceed without the "second opinion" frame. Lyric reprise (early mention → final line callback) with modest causal involvement elevates it to mid-band, but swappability and ornamental closure use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears as descriptor of Eliza's precision ("aptly deliberate precision, each twist calculated") in the opening and modulates the pacing of the repair scene ("companionable silence"). The trait constrains her approach—slow, methodical work over six hours—shaping the temporal arc. However, it's largely descriptive; no visible trade-off emerges where deliberateness costs her speed or requires sacrifice. Present in setup and middle; influences one beat (repair pacing); weak cost connection and some swappability (careful, meticulous would serve similarly) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Deserve" appears in Eliza's climactic line: "He deserved worse than he got… but maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever." This articulates the moral calculus at closure, naming the cost of her choice to repair rather than preserve grievance. The verb redefines the stakes from retribution to self-care. Present in the ending beat with strong causal pressure; charges the final image; irreplaceable in its ethical framing. Late first appearance (final third) triggers −0.4 penalty, but transformation of prior material and closure linkage elevate the score solidly into the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"By the way light breaks through storm clouds" is signaled in the opening ("morning sun fought through dissipating storm clouds, casting broken shafts of gold") and recurs at closure ("storm clouds fully parted by afternoon, flooding the shop with light"). However, the light functions as atmospheric texture rather than mechanical means that alters tactics or enables the repair; Eliza's work does not depend on the quality of illumination. Lyric reprise across setup and ending with modest thematic charge, but no middle development or causal pressure; swappable with other weather transitions without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique music box repair shop anchors spatial grounding in the opening, supplies tools and workbench for the repair process, and provides the music boxes lining the walls that witness and frame the closure. Eliza's professional environment enables her skill set and makes the repair legible. The shop's shelves of "silent mechanical dancers, frozen mid-pirouette" foreshadow and contrast with the final reanimation. Present in setup, developed through middle beats (workbench, tools, companionable silence), and charges the ending image ("every brass surface, every crystal window"); irreplaceable as the locus of Eliza's competence and the repair's physical site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"In the calm before realization" maps to the opening line ("morning sun fought through dissipating storm clouds") and the middle phrase "that calm before realization, where truth hovers unspoken but already known" when Eliza sees the journal. The timeframe is more tonal than structural; the story spans six hours of repair work, but no live clock tightens decisions. The "calm before" framing charges one beat (Eliza's pause before opening the journal) but doesn't constrain tactics or escalate pressure across the arc. Lyric function with modest causal involvement; swappable with other reflective windows.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To turn an apology into action" is named in Thomas's plea ("My apology needs to become something she can hold") and embodied throughout: Marcus's six-month search, delivery of the journal and heart, and Eliza's choice to follow Thomas's repair instructions. The motivation drives two major beats (Marcus's delivery, Eliza's repair attempt) and shapes the closure choice ("maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever"). Visible cost: Eliza accepts guidance from the brother who "always broke things." Present in setup, developed through middle beats with causal pressure, and participates in closure; friction dramatized via Eliza's contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" appears three times: in Eliza's voice ("carried a vibrant hush"), in the description "that vibrant hush between notes," and implied in the "companionable silence" of the repair scene. The tone modulates from skeptical quiet (opening) to shared concentration (middle) to resonant aftermath (ending), cohering through turns. However, "vibrant hush" risks oxymoronic opacity and isn't deeply integrated into the narrative mechanics; it decorates rather than constrains. Present across setup, middle, and ending with modest tonal coherence; charges the final image but remains somewhat ornamental, limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>
