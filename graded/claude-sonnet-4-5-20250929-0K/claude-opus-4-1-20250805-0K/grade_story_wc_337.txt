<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her craft drives the action, but interiority remains largely operational rather than contradictory. The spirits' gratitude "filled the space between heartbeats" edges toward abstraction where embodied tension would strengthen. Her final understanding that "tomorrow would bring another net" reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The work is competent but lacks the internal friction that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the unraveling process, each knot releasing fragments that accumulate toward the restoration. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the spirits settle, masks transform into monuments—with felt cost in Mira's acceptance of her perpetual inheritance. The lens holds, though the closure's cost reads more as continuation than transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary is vividly rendered with crystal walls fracturing moonlight and prisms humming at key beats. The setting actively constrains and enables: starlight focuses to illuminate masks, the sanctuary's hush deepens to mark spirit presence. The tapestry needle and hemp net function as micro-setting elements that charge the final arrangement. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the restoration sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Escalation operates through accumulation: each knot releases fragments, the interlaced hush deepens, spirits materialize. However, the process unfolds without reversal or meaningful complication; Mira's work proceeds smoothly from first knot to completion. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking the tightening choice or visible tradeoff that would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through particulars: silence accumulates, fragmented identities seek wholeness, the dead require witness. The hemp transforming from binding to mending carries thematic weight without over-statement. "This was her inheritance as a broken mask restorer: to sit in the space where silence accumulated" integrates purpose with image. The final vision of the sanctuary as a place "where every fractured thing could find its way back home" reweights prior material without didacticism, though it edges close to summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present in details like "tapestry needle between scarred fingers" and "lucid unrest." However, register occasionally drifts elevated: "no longer restless but radiant with recognition" and "sediment in still water" read slightly formal for the established voice. The spirits' translucence "like jellyfish made of starlight" works, but some metaphoric choices feel writerly rather than character-filtered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but several patterns accumulate. "Coiled like a sleeping serpent," "a sound like distant thunder swallowed by fog," "like jellyfish made of starlight"—the simile density clusters without always advancing pressure. "The interlaced hush—the weaving together of silence and sound, absence and presence" paraphrases its own concept. "Dissolved into the work" and "time folded" are stock phrases. Template openings appear: "The sanctuary's prisms..." recurs mechanically. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in mid-beats, warranting deduction in the −0.8 range for non-closure accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mask-restoration frame is specific, and the fisherman's net as both problem and solution offers a satisfying reversal. However, the core premise—restorer helps spirits find peace through craft—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "lucid unrest" state and prism sanctuary provide texture, but emotional beats (captain's nod, spirits fading at sunrise) track predictably. The piece executes its concept competently but doesn't surprise or challenge expectations in ways that would mark it as distinctive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira appears early, drives all key beats (exhuming the net, unraveling knots, arranging masks), and her acceptance of perpetual work shapes the ending. Her choices create the story's turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in the opening, is used to stitch masks with hemp fibers in the central sequence, and is placed at the circle's center in the ending image. However, its specific properties don't constrain choices—any restoration tool could serve similar function. It recurs but remains somewhat swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is defined explicitly as "the weaving together of silence and sound, absence and presence" and marks the spirits' approach. It deepens during the restoration and reaches profound weight before spirits rise. The concept shapes atmosphere and stakes, though its mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Silence accumulation is dramatized through the net's knots ("each knot held a drowned sailor's last breath, accumulating silence") and the deepening hush. It enables Mira to hear whispers and guides the restoration process. The attribute constrains her work to this specific location and method, with visible presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Exhuming the net from harbor mud (mentioned in paragraph two, dramatized as completed action) launches the entire restoration sequence. The story depends on this prior act to supply the material that becomes both thread and fragments. Without it, no masks, no spirits, no closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Unraveling knots structures the entire middle: each knot releases a fragment, the method is signaled early and shown in detail ("sliding the needle through its heart"), and the transformation of binding to mending charges the thematic closure. The mechanics matter throughout and shape Mira's approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary fractures moonlight in the opening, its crystal walls and prisms hum to mark pressure, and starlight focuses through the ceiling to illuminate masks at the climax. The setting actively enables the restoration and charges the final image of crystalline embrace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the sharing of their secret" frames the timeframe, and "hours dissolved into the work" marks duration, but the phrase functions more as atmospheric marker than tactical constraint. The secret-sharing occurs in Mira's vision rather than as dialogue or negotiation, making the timeframe present but not pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to ground restless spirits drives every beat from exhuming the net through final arrangement. The motivation is demonstrated through persistent work and her recognition that this is her inheritance. Friction appears in the perpetual nature of the task rather than internal conflict, but the want shapes all choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named explicitly and embodied through Mira working "fully awake yet moving through dream logic." The tone modulates from the opening's careful preparation through the vision's intensity to the final acceptance, maintaining coherence while charging the sanctuary's patient embrace at closure.</comment>
