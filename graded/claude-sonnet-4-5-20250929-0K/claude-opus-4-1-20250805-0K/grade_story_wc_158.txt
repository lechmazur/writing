<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is more contemplative vessel than agent—she proposes, teaches, shows, but rarely makes choices under competing pressures. Interiority consists largely of summary wisdom ("learned across centuries") rather than embodied contradiction. The "shyly unstoppable" attribute is asserted in labels but not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs something. The final renunciation or endurance lacks a visible forfeiture that would elevate character work into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers images (shell, postcard, half-sung lullabies) across centuries and trusts cadence shift and density to reweight the armistice premise. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "Beauty and pain learned to coexist… The shell holds them all." The cost is oblique—time dissolved, the postcard "nearly dissolved"—but conceptual heft is present. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. One persistent issue: the centuries-long timeframe compresses all escalation into summary, so no single tightening moment lands on the page with felt urgency; the piece teaches the pattern early and pays it off in tone, preventing a harder penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting and constraint: its acoustics transform broken voices, its pinholes cast new constellations from damage, its chambers grow crystallized music. These details recur and charge the final image ("still spirals, still breathes"). The galaxy postcard also acts as anchoring object. Sensory selection is purposeful (mother-of-pearl pulse, charcoal on walls, reef-shadow twilight) and filtered through the poet's priorities. The setting constrains her choice to remain and shapes the closure's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate's environment test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming suffering into sustainable beauty via the blossom armistice. The piece seeds this early and deepens it through accumulation (first one arrival, then dozens, then hundreds), but no single on-page moment dramatizes a tightening choice with competing goods or a visible price paid *in scene*. Agency is passive curation—she teaches, she shows the postcard—rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The centuries-long frame makes escalation summary rather than lived pressure, capping the score despite thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the shell's pinholes as damage-turned-illumination, the postcard's "slow waltz" collision, pain-seeds crystallizing into music. The final image—"imperfect music is still music, wounded light still illuminates"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. One slip: "She taught them the half-lullabies, how to let their voices crack and trust the wind" edges toward instruction rather than dramatized discovery. The armistice premise is conceptually rich and the ending reconfigures beauty/pain as partners, not opposites, with undeniable pressure even if emotional cost is oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is poetic and consistent: "reef-shadow joy," "fossilized forgiveness," "nutritiously complex." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ensconced," "permeates") that feels authorial rather than emerging from the poet's specific idiom under pressure. No dialogue, so subtext and voice-distinction tests are not applicable. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off at closure, but the voice lacks the grit or embodied texture that would charge peak moments more viscerally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in image-stacking beats. Two issues lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loops—"approached dancer" / "approaching disasters," "seed would be weapons no more" / "flowers would cease being grenades"—restate concepts without added pressure. (2) Mixed metaphor: "Seeds would be weapons… Flowers would cease being grenades of beauty that exploded in hearts, leaving shrapnel of longing" strains coherence (seeds ≠ flowers as grenade, shrapnel of longing blurs vehicle). Template cadence in the catalogue paragraph ("betrayals pressed… abandonments crystallized… deaths ground") triggers −0.4. No loops touch the closure beat, so the penalty is capped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—suffering as photosynthesis, a shell as greenhouse for pain-seeds, half-sung lullabies as spores—is specific and non-obvious. The galaxy postcard as fractal mirror (spiral arms echoing the shell) feels earned rather than decorative. Risk-taking in structure (centuries compressed, no protagonist decision arc) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the "war between those who created through suffering and those who created through joy" reads slightly abstract, closer to allegory stand-in than lived world detail. The ending's inevitability and the transformation of damage into illumination lift the score despite the allegorical framing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; proposes the armistice (setup), teaches arrivals (middle development), holds the postcard to the shell's opening in the penultimate paragraph (closure participation). However, choices are contemplative rather than decisive—she shows, she teaches, she remains—without a moment where competing pressures force a trade-off with visible cost. Swappable with "hermit sage" or "guardian curator" without major structural change. The poet's insomnia becomes "an advantage" but does not constrain tactics. Score reflects functional presence across all three gates but weak causal pressure and no irreplaceable specificity in the protagonist's agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "found it tucked between the ridges… when she first arrived." Development: she traces the spiral, tells each arrival "See? Everything turns." Closure participation: "hold the galaxy postcard to the shell's opening… tiny perforation cast a point of light… creating new constellations from damage." Appears in three distinct beats and its essence "permeates everything" in the final paragraph, charging the ending. The postcard's spiral mirrors the shell's architecture (specificity) and its message ("Even collisions can be slow waltzes") reweights the armistice premise. One friction: middle-beat use is primarily illustrative (she shows it) rather than enabling a choice under pressure. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage lift the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "blossom armistice had been her idea" (paragraph two). Development: "The blossom armistice held. Wars ended…" (paragraph eight). Closure participation: "The blossom armistice became permanent… Beauty and pain learned to coexist" (final paragraph). Present in all three gates and directly named in the ending. The concept shapes the dominant stake (transforming suffering into beauty) and the final image reconfigures it as coexistence rather than victory. One weakness: much of the armistice's work happens off-page in summary ("Wars ended… Former enemies discovered"), so causal pressure on protagonist choices is thin. The ending reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (time, dissolution, permanence through practice), but lack of on-page conflict over the armistice's terms caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "shyly, but unstoppably, they came" (paragraph six). Development: "shyly unstoppable, teaching each generation" (paragraph ten). Closure participation: the attribute appears in the penultimate paragraph as a summary descriptor. Present in two gates (middle/closure) with no setup in the first third. The trait is asserted in labels ("whispered shyly," "Slowly, shyly, but unstoppably") but not dramatized through a micro-choice where shyness constrains one tactic and unstoppability enables another with visible trade-off. Swappable with "quietly persistent" or "gently relentless." Late first appearance (second third) and label-only use trigger deductions; lyric reprise in the ending provides modest lift but cannot overcome the lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "ensconced herself here with only her verses and a single galaxy postcard" (paragraph three). Development: her ensconcement enables decades of composition, the shell's acoustics amplify her half-lullabies, and the space becomes "a greenhouse for this strange photosynthesis" (paragraph six). Closure participation: "The shell still stands… The poet remains" (paragraph ten). Present in all three gates. The action of ensconcing defines the spatial constraint and enables the armistice's slow accumulation. One friction: the act itself is static—she arrived and stayed—rather than a repeated decision under competing pressures. Swappable with "took refuge in" or "sheltered herself within" without major structural change. The shell's function as setting and the poet's permanence charge the ending, but the action's low cost and ease of substitution cap the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: implied in paragraph four ("half-sung lullabies began as accidents. Her voice, cracked from disuse…"). Development: "the shell's acoustics transformed these fractures into harmonies, and the off-key wind… carried them outward like spores. Other poets… heard them across impossible distances" (paragraph five). Closure participation: "the half-sung lullabies continue, carried on off-key winds to wherever someone needs to learn that imperfect music is still music" (final paragraph). Present in all three gates. The method's mechanics matter: broken voices + shell acoustics + wind transmission = transformation and recruitment. The "off-key wind" is specific and irreplaceable; substituting "melodious breeze" would flatten the premise. The method enables the armistice's spread and shapes the ending's charge. Strong causal pressure (the method recruits others, transforms damage) and closure linkage justify 7+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "lived inside the gargantuan shell for three lifetimes" (paragraph one). Development: the shell's acoustics transform fractures (paragraph five), its chambers grow crystallized gardens (paragraph eight), its pinholes cast constellations (paragraph nine). Closure participation: "The shell still stands, still spirals, still breathes its reef-shadow joy into the world" (paragraph ten). Present in all three gates. The shell is not postcard backdrop—it actively pressures choices: acoustics enable the half-lullabies, pinholes create new constellations from damage, the spiral architecture mirrors the galaxy postcard and teaches the lesson. The shell's specific properties (calcium spirals, mother-of-pearl pulse, reef-shadow twilight, aperture wind) are irreplaceable and constrain the poet's tactics. Strong causal involvement, closure charge, and specificity justify high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "three lifetimes now, though time moved differently here" (paragraph one). Development: "For decades, she composed" (paragraph four); "over the centuries" (paragraph six); "centuries of longing" (paragraph nine). Closure participation: "centuries of longing" appears in the penultimate paragraph, and the postcard "has nearly dissolved now" signals time's passage. Present in all three gates. The timeframe shapes the armistice's slow accumulation and the postcard's dissolution charges the ending with conceptual cost. One major friction: time is tracked in vague summary ("decades," "centuries") rather than as a live constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics in scene. The poet's insomnia makes day/night irrelevant, further loosening urgency. "Centuries of longing" is a thematic echo more than a pressure; swappable with "ages of yearning." Weak causal grip and summary-only tracking cap the score in low-6s despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: implied in paragraph two ("let pain become nutrients… let every tear photosynthesize into something that could sustain"). Development: "learning to transform damage into growth" (paragraph five); "strange photosynthesis, where suffering met light and produced something neither bitter nor sweet but nutritiously complex" (paragraph six). Closure participation: "teaching each generation how to photosynthesize pain into beauty" (paragraph ten). Present in all three gates. The motivation is dramatized through on-page actions—composing with charcoal from burned poems, teaching arrivals to let voices crack—and the ending reweights it as coexistence practice. One friction: the desire is asserted more than contested; no moment shows the poet torn between transforming pain and, say, numbing it or weaponizing it again. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and accumulates across beats, but lack of internal conflict or visible trade-off (choosing beauty costs her what?) keeps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "that reef-shadow joy where darkness wasn't absence but presence of a different kind of light" (paragraph four). Development: the tone persists through the catalogue of crystallized music and fossilized forgiveness (paragraph eight). Closure participation: "The shell… still breathes its reef-shadow joy into the world" (final paragraph). Present in all three gates. The tone is coherent and specific—melancholy beauty, productive sorrow—and modulates subtly with the accumulation of arrivals and the postcard's near-dissolution. One issue: "reef-shadow joy" is a vivid coinage but risks decorative lyricism when not anchored to a concrete micro-sensation; the piece trusts the reader to infer its feeling. The tone charges the final image and is irreplaceable (swapping it for "bittersweet peace" would flatten specificity), justifying mid-to-high-6s.</comment>
