<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's empirically intuitive gift is established early and his internal conflict between knowing and never journeying is clear, but the character's emotional progression feels too smooth—no genuine struggle against closing the shop after thirty years of routine. The grandfather's deathbed promise and Marcus's seven-year-old self are told rather than shown shaping present choices. The final transformation from "someone who only sold maps" to "someone who followed them" arrives as assertion rather than embodied cost; we don't see what he forfeits by stepping through.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights Marcus's identity from passive dealer to active guide. The creek-rising timeframe and ant-following method create coherent pressure. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The closure unit lands on the page, but the cost is oblique—Marcus exits the cavern unchanged in circumstance, only in self-conception, and the story tells us he's ready to guide others rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or tradeoff that makes the shift legible with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern with "impossible summer light" and luminescent formations charges the final image and the matrix chip constrains multiple beats (grandfather's gift, recognition, doorway activation). The dusty shop and limestone cliffs are anchored early. However, the kudzu curtain and warehouse district serve as transit decoration without altering tactics, and the cavern's glimmering map of unlived choices functions more as visual metaphor than as a space that pressures decision—Marcus's exploration inside remains frictionless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Marcus will finally follow rather than sell journeys—is signaled early and the creek-rising timeframe creates a ticking clock. The story tightens once when Marcus closes his shop and follows the ants, a meaningful break from thirty years of routine. However, the cavern sequence offers no resistance; the doorway opens easily, no tradeoff is dramatized between staying and going, and the final step-through is described as a shift in self-perception rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of promises outliving their makers and the topology of unmade choices emerges through concrete images—the matrix chip, the ants' precise lines, the map of unlived paths. The final image of Marcus ready to guide others when the creek rises again offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor penalty: "the lonely map dealer understood that some promises aren't about reaching destinations but about finally beginning journeys" states the theme rather than trusting the dramatization, and the phrase "ready to print new legends on blank paper" risks symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct register: "His empirically intuitive nature—that peculiar gift of knowing truth through touch rather than study—had made him wealthy but never happy." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider framing. No dialogue present. Minor slip: "The lonely map dealer understood" in the penultimate paragraph names Marcus by epithet mid-beat, a slight distance inconsistency, and the phrase "everything identical except for one crucial thing" tells the shift rather than showing perceptual change.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid—"memory, not light but memory. A promise, decades old, suddenly sharp as broken glass." Sentence structure supports momentum through the rising action. Deductions: the phrase "that peculiar gift" in paragraph one is a scaffold appositive that repeats the concept just named; "The lonely map dealer" epithet in the penultimate paragraph interrupts flow; and "everything identical except for one crucial thing: he was no longer someone who only sold maps. He was someone who followed them" is a paraphrase loop across adjacent sentences (−0.4 cumulative).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The matrix chip as both printing die and map-reading key offers a specific synthesis, and the grandfather's cryptic "follow the ants home" gains fresh inflection when literalized. However, the core premise—passive expert finds magical threshold and chooses transformation—follows a recognizable template without transforming it through Marcus's specific trade-offs or a non-obvious moral calculus. The cavern's doorway of decisions, showing unlived paths, reads close to familiar portal-of-regret imagery. The ending's safety-hedged promise that Marcus will guide others when the creek rises again defers concrete change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus the lonely antique map dealer is present throughout and his decision to close the shop and follow the ants creates the story's key turn. His empirically intuitive gift enables recognition of the matrix chip. However, his choices after entering the cavern are passive—he observes unlived paths, presses the chip, and steps through without dramatized conflict or visible cost that his dealer identity would specifically resist. The closing promise to guide others is stated intent rather than enacted decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The type foundry matrix chip appears in four beats: arrival Tuesday morning, Marcus recognizing it as his grandfather's gift, its warmth clarifying purpose in the cavern, and pressing it against the doorway to reveal the map. It enables the key turn (doorway activation) and is charged by the childhood memory. Cap: the chip's specific properties (nineteenth-century cartographic die, brass surface) are described but their irreplaceability is not tested—another inherited object with tactile memory could serve similar narrative function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lingering promise ("When the creek rises, follow the ants home") frames expectation in paragraph three, is recalled when Marcus follows on day four, and the story's closure hinges on fulfilling it—Marcus steps through, completing the decades-old debt. The promise shapes his decision to close the shop and follow. Friction: the promise's mechanics (why ants, why the creek, why this timing) remain abstract; we see Marcus honor it but not wrestle with competing obligations or doubt that would dramatize its cost as a lived constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The empirically intuitive trait (knowing truth through touch) is introduced in paragraph one and demonstrated twice: recognizing the matrix chip's authenticity and feeling the promise beneath its surface. However, after setup it does not constrain or enable later choices—Marcus's exploration of the cavern and decision to step through do not depend on his tactile insight. The trait functions as characterization flavor rather than causal lever; a non-intuitive mapmaker could follow the ants and use the chip with similar outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Glimmer appears when Marcus's fingers brush the brass chip ("something glimmered beneath his touch, not light but memory") and returns conceptually when paths "glimmered briefly before fading" on the doorway map. The initial glimmer triggers recognition of the promise, a key turn. However, the action itself (perceiving a shimmer) is observation rather than decision; Marcus does not manipulate or test the glimmer, and "glimmer" could be replaced with "pulse," "warmth," or "echo" with minimal structural change—it signals mystery but does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Following ants home is signaled in the grandfather's dying words (paragraph three), observed as carpenter ants trace lines (paragraph four), and enacted when Marcus follows them through the warehouse district to the cavern entrance (paragraph five). The method drives the middle turn and fulfills the promise. Friction: the ants' route is frictionless—no wrong turns, no moment when Marcus doubts or loses the trail—so the mechanics do not constrain tactics or generate cost; they function as a reliable guide rather than a challenging method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blooming cavern at midsummer appears in paragraph six with vivid detail (luminescent formations, crystalline pools, mineral-thick air, wrong-season warmth) and houses the doorway of decisions where closure occurs. The impossible summer light and "topology—the shape of choices not yet made" charge the final image. However, the cavern does not pressure Marcus's choices within it—no navigational puzzle, no cost to linger, no environmental hazard—so it serves primarily as atmospheric stage rather than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The creek rising is introduced in paragraph four ("rising for three days, fed by mountain snowmelt"), triggers Marcus's action on the fourth day when it crests its banks, and the closing line promises the creek will rise again, creating cyclical structure. The timeframe tightens the decision to follow and fulfills the grandfather's condition. Friction: once Marcus decides to follow, the rising creek does not impose further time pressure—his exploration of the cavern is unhurried—so it gates the opening move but does not shape tactics during escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find the doorway of decisions is dramatized: Marcus spent thirty years anchored behind his counter, the matrix chip reawakens the promise, and he follows the ants to the cavern where the doorway stands. The doorway reveals unlived choices and Marcus steps through, altering his identity. Friction: the desire is more discovered than conflicted—Marcus doesn't wrestle with fear of leaving the shop or doubt about the doorway's reality; he closes the shop and follows with little visible internal cost, so the motivation drives plot but lacks friction between want and fear.</comment>
