<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta's interior world is rendered through concrete actions (trimming roses, decoding threads with a pruning needle) and her care for the dead feels embodied rather than declared. The tapestry discovery motivates her sustained attention, but her emotional arc remains largely static—she begins tending graves with devotion and ends the same way, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The final decision to plant the fragment reads as extension rather than transformation. Minor penalty for the phrase "velveteen gloom that softened death's sharp edges" which edges toward label-speak, though it's integrated into her perceptual filter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates meaning through the tapestry's decoded threads, building toward a final image that reweights Marta's nightly work as part of a lineage of grief-tending. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat (cemetery, silo, night work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Marta understands her work as continuous with the tapestry's creator, and the decision to plant the fragment tomorrow charges the present moment with intention. Cost is conceptual—she becomes curator of a tradition rather than solitary gardener—but the final image ("humming to the dead who appreciated most deeply the shape of her intentions") makes the reweighting legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the threads and sees her work mirrored. No causality breaks, though the chess clock setup doesn't constrain later choices as promised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as workspace and echo chamber, its hollow throat amplifying the chess clock's final click. Midnight roses, starlight pooling, and the pre-dawn blue paint anchor the sensory world without catalog excess. The cemetery's spatial layout remains clear (silo behind, graves spread before) and the magnifying lamp, workbench, and pruning needle ground the decoding work in tactile detail. The silo's "velveteen gloom" recurs to charge the final image. The chess clock as physical object constrains her ritual but doesn't alter a choice at closure; still, the setting's particulars (grain tower repurposed as tool shed, metal walls rattling) feel lived-in and specific to this POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the tapestry's message and her own work's meaning. The unearthing of the sovereign case initiates inquiry; decoding the border threads deepens her grasp of grief-as-devotion. Pressure is textural rather than escalatory—each thread adds a layer, and the wind's rattle and star-wheel mark atmospheric intensification. The ending reweights her nightly rounds with new awareness, but no option is foreclosed and no visible cost appears on the page; she will continue tending graves and will plant the fragment "tomorrow." Agency is contemplative (she decodes, she understands) rather than decisional. One tightening: the tapestry's revelation that "loss transformed into tending" mirrors her existing practice, which is a deepening but not a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the decoded threads (grief transformed into devotion, memory encoded in matter) and the final image reweights Marta's cemetery work as participation in a lineage rather than solitary ritual. The tapestry's border as "map of grief transformed into devotion, loss transformed into tending" risks direct statement, but it's dramatized through the act of decoding and the decision to return the fragment to earth. The chess clock and sovereign case as vessels of time and memory support the theme without forced symbolism. The closing line ("the shape of her intentions") loops back to the opening's "tender precision" and the tapestry's lesson, offering resonance without moralizing. Minor proximity concern: "the shape of intentions" and "tender organization of love" edge toward abstraction, though they're grounded in the decoding action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtering all detail through Marta's gardener's perceptions: "root systems," "pruning needle," "forget-me-nots." Diction is controlled and consistent, with a lyric register ("starlight that pooled," "velveteen gloom") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is clear—she reads the world through care, preservation, and botanical metaphor. The phrase "uncharted echoes of meaning she couldn't quite grasp" and "intentions given form" approach abstract narration, but they're anchored to her hands-on decoding work. Psychic distance is steady; free indirect style is clean. One minor register drift: "creating what looked like intentional patterns rather than random decay" reads slightly analytic for the heat of discovery, but it's brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately, with longer contemplative sentences ("The fabric felt ancient yet alive…") and shorter beats at key moments ("Tonight felt different."). Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or thematic resonance. However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym clusters appear: "encoding memory into matter itself" and "woven this fragment to preserve not facts but feelings, not history but the tender organization of love" restate similar ideas without added pressure. "The shape of intentions wasn't angular or defined—it was circular, seasonal, returning always to the same essential act of care" explains what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence in the tapestry-decoding section: "The first thread spoke… The second told… Thread by thread…" Minimal figurative muddle, though "velveteen gloom" recurs three times, crossing from motif into slight overuse. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems in a non-closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—gardener decodes tapestry fragment to understand her own grief-work—synthesizes elements (cemetery caretaking, artifact discovery, encoded memory) in a plausible way. The cobalt silo as repurposed grain tower and the sovereign case as reliquary are specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (solitary tender finding kinship with past tender) and the closing gesture (planting the fragment to return it to earth) follow familiar lineages in literary cemetery fiction. The tapestry's "map of grief transformed into devotion" and Marta's realization that "every grave she'd ever tended had been teaching her the same lesson" feel like iterations of a known thematic move rather than a fresh synthesis. Transformation is present but modest; the core insight could transfer to other contexts (museum curator, quilter, archivist) with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marta (blithe cemetery gardener) is present throughout and her choices frame the narrative: she enters the silo, studies the tapestry, decodes the threads, and decides (off-page) to plant the fragment tomorrow. "Blithe" is signaled early in her humming and sustained attention to beauty (midnight roses, starlight). However, her decisions are contemplative rather than turning—decoding deepens understanding but doesn't alter tactics or foreclose a path. She ends as she began: tending graves with devotion. Setup clear, development present (decoding action), closure participation weak (decision deferred to tomorrow, no on-page cost). Two-gate eligible, mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case appears early ("weighed heavy in her apron pocket"), is handled and opened in the silo, and its tarnished engravings are noted as shifting in peripheral vision. The case functions as reliquary protecting the tapestry fragment, and Marta tucks it back at the end before walking out. Three beats: discovery mention, opening/study, closure reprise. The case enables the decoding action and its function (protecting knowledge until someone who speaks the language of gardens could decode it) charges the thematic resolution. Not indispensable—another container could serve—but its antique sovereign identity and the detail of engravings that shift contribute specificity and motif cohesion. Strong setup, clear development, closure participation present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears twice: the sovereign case's engravings create "uncharted echoes of meaning she couldn't quite grasp," and later "time moved differently in the presence of such discoveries, flowing backward and forward simultaneously like the uncharted echoes she'd been hearing all her life." The concept is present as theme and atmospheric texture, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—Marta's decoding work proceeds methodically regardless. The phrase functions as motif rather than constraint. Setup weak (abstract mention), no middle development, closure mention ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing setup in causal terms; score reflects ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears explicitly in the line "the tender organization of love that survives flesh" and is embodied throughout in Marta's "tender precision" and patient decoding work that separates threads "without breaking." The trait constrains her method—she uses her "finest pruning needle" and understands "that violence would destroy the very connections she sought to reveal." This carefulness shapes her approach and differentiates it from rougher handling. Cost is implicit (time, attention) but on-page. Setup strong (shown in opening precision), development clear (decoding method), closure participation modest (the trait is thematically reprised but doesn't charge the final image with new weight). Three-gate eligible, mid-upper functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Untangle" appears explicitly: "She began to untangle the border threads with her finest pruning needle, separating each strand without breaking it." This action is the mechanism by which Marta decodes the tapestry and discovers its message. The verb recurs conceptually in "untangled truths" held by the silo. The untangling is the story's central action—without it, no revelation occurs. However, the act itself is straightforward and could be substituted with "decode" or "separate" with minor edits; the specificity of "untangle" adds texture but is not irreplaceable. Setup (via preparation), development (the doing), closure (conceptual echo in final paragraph). Strong integration, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border—is signaled when Marta notices "frayed threads that formed a kind of script" and is enacted on the page: she uses her pruning needle to separate strands, and "as she decoded the sequence, letters emerged." The mechanics matter: each thread's dye shade creates patterns, and careful separation (not violence) is required. The method shapes her attempt and succeeds, yielding the thematic payload. Setup clear (border threads noted), development strong (decoding dramatized across a paragraph), closure linkage modest (the lesson learned persists but the method itself doesn't reappear). Three-gate eligible, upper-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars is present throughout: Marta enters it, the chess clock sits on its workbench, its hollow throat amplifies sound, metal walls rattle with wind, and it stands sentinel in the final paragraph. The open door frames stars overhead. The silo provides workspace (magnifying lamp, bench) and its acoustic properties ("echoing up the silo's hollow throat") charge moments. However, it does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—any workspace would suffice. The starlight and cobalt color contribute atmospheric cohesion and the silo's repurposed identity (grain tower to tool shed) adds texture. Setup strong, development steady (location throughout), closure reprise solid ("holding its own echoes, its own untangled truths"). Postcard risk mitigated by functional use, but constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The chess clock runs down at the story's opening: "Tonight she'd let it run down completely, the final click echoing up the silo's hollow throat." Marta then studies the tapestry without time pressure. At the end, "Marta rewound the chess clock but didn't start it." The clock marks a ritual (three hours exactly, white to black) but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the narrative present—its function is symbolic (time moving differently, grief measurement) rather than situational. Setup clear (clock mentioned, runs down), no middle pressure, closure reprise present but ornamental (she rewinds it, a gesture without cost). Two-gate eligible, but the timeframe "after the clock runs down" is static backdrop rather than live constraint. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; score reflects symbolic rather than causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of intentions" is explicit in the final lines ("who appreciated most deeply the shape of her intentions") and implicit throughout—Marta seeks to understand the tapestry's message and, by extension, her own work. The unearthing of the case and her decision to decode the threads dramatize this desire. However, the motivation is more contemplative than conflicted; no friction arises between want and cost—Marta's curiosity is rewarded with insight, and she plans to act on it (planting the fragment) without visible sacrifice. Setup clear (curiosity about the case), development strong (decoding action), closure participation solid (thematic reprise of "shape of intentions"). Three-gate eligible, but lack of on-page friction or cost holds it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone—"velveteen gloom"—is signaled early and sustained: night work, starlight, pre-dawn blue, gentle darkness. The phrase recurs three times, anchoring the mood. Diction choices (midnight roses, hollow throat, pearl to charcoal grays) maintain a soft, contemplative register even as Marta decodes urgent meaning. The tone modulates slightly with the wind's rattle and the star-wheel, adding atmospheric pressure, but remains cohesive. The final image ("simply garden in the velveteen gloom, humming to the dead") reprises and charges the tone with thematic weight—care enacted in shadow. Setup strong, development consistent, closure participation strong. The tone doesn't shift under pressure (remains elegiac throughout), which fits the accumulative lens but limits dynamic range. High upper-functional band.</comment>
