<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sarai's core motivation is clear and her internal conflict between guilt and purpose drives choices. The embodied emotion is strong in key moments ("weeping—not from sorrow, but from a strange, cold warmth"), and her decision to shift from restoration to transformation shows earned change. However, the old man functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying meaningful pressure, and some interiority leans toward label-speak ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical") that could be more dramatized through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens through vision sequences to a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Sarai's shift from restoration to creation is earned through the mosaic's acceptance and her retrocognitive visions, with the final image crystallizing new purpose. The cost is visible: she accepts her "curse" as invitation and commits to gathering the scattered with visible social risk from the Brotherhood. One small causality slip: the mosaic's addition of her name as the hundredth feels convenient rather than earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plaza, shattered sky, and tessera constrain Sarai's choices throughout—she must physically place each piece to trigger visions, and the mosaic's pattern shapes her understanding of transformation. Sensory detail is purposeful: "warm despite the frost," "chipped and blackened" stones, the "strange light" that will nurture "impossible plants." The final vision of the plaza becoming a garden directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves between kneeling, standing, and the old man's emergence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Sarai's compulsion to restore versus the Brotherhood's threat—tightens meaningfully when the mosaic accepts her, forcing a choice between continued hiding and public transformation. The escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each tessera placement deepens understanding until the final vision shifts from past to possibility. Agency is clear in her decision to "begin gathering the scattered" with visible cost (Brotherhood pursuit). One beat lacks full pressure: the old man's warning arrives but doesn't force an immediate tactical trade-off before her choice crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tessera work: mercy as transformation rather than restoration, and the mosaic's geometric patterns evolving to include Sarai. The final image offers a non-literal answer through "impossible plants" and new patterns from broken pieces. However, some thematic language becomes overt: "aberrant mercy," "Gentle Radical" as a spoken name, and "cradling empathy in arms of steel" verge on stating rather than embodying the question. The concept of retrocognition as invitation rather than curse provides genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic setting with strong perceptual signature: "warm coldness," "retrocognitively trapped but finally free." The dialogue between Sarai and the old man feels natural and advances plot through subtext. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates well under pressure: shorter syntax during the fire vision, expansive during the possibility vision. One slip: "Sarai, the Gentle Radical" as a mosaic inscription reads as authorial rather than world-organic naming.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance multiple elements. Rhythm varies appropriately with emotional beats. However, several lines exhibit ornamental intensification: "strange, cold warmth" and "warm coldness of necessary change" repeat the same oxymoronic register without adding pressure. "Retrocognitively trapped but finally free" is a conceptual loop stating the paradox twice. The phrase "something deeper than guilt" is vague scaffolding. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story phrasing occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of retrocognition curse, mosaic restoration, and "gentle radical" mercy creates a fresh synthesis. The shift from restoration to transformation offers a non-obvious angle on post-conflict reconciliation. However, several elements trend familiar: the "chosen one accepted by sacred artifact" beat, the persecuted healer hiding refugees, and the Brotherhood antagonist follow recognizable templates. The shattered sky and "impossible plants" gesture toward originality but remain under-developed. The piece commits fully to its premise and earns its emotional turns, elevating execution within a partly conventional frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarai's identity as gentle radical shapes the core conflict with the Brotherhood and drives her final choice to gather the scattered rather than hide. Present in opening context, tested when the mosaic accepts her, and crystallized in her closing decision to create rather than restore. Her specific brand of mercy—renaming, hiding, creating space—defines tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tessera appears in paragraph one (warm in her palm), triggers the retrocognitive vision in paragraph two when placed, reappears in paragraph five during the fire memory when she dropped it, and is present again when the mosaic shifts to include her name. Its physical placement enables each vision and its loss/recovery arc structures the narrative. Removing it would collapse the mechanism of revelation and transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aberrant mercy frames Sarai's backstory (hiding seventeen families) and surfaces in her dialogue ("mercy isn't about purity"). The concept drives the Brotherhood's pursuit and her decision to transform rather than restore. However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page tactical constraint—we see the results of past mercy but not a present choice where mercy conflicts with another live option that would alter the ending's shape.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Retrocognitive visions trigger in paragraphs two, five, and near the end, each showing past or possibility and driving Sarai's understanding. The trait constrains her work: she cannot simply restore without experiencing memory, and this cost ("curse") becomes reframed as "invitation" by the ending. The final vision of possibility rather than past marks a shift in how the trait operates, charging the closure. Removing it would eliminate the primary mechanism of revelation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Renaming structures Sarai's past mercy (she "renamed them with new identities scratched into clay tablets") and the mosaic's acceptance (it adds "Sarai, the Gentle Radical" as a new name among the ninety-nine). Her closing commitment is to rename the plaza "not through words but through action." The act of naming/renaming defines her method of transformation and directly shapes the closure's logic. Major turn traces to this: the mosaic's acceptance via new name authorizes her shift from hiding to gathering.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stepping stones' chipped mosaic patterns appear in paragraph four, and Sarai fits the tessera "into place" at the gap in paragraph two and five. The mechanism is signaled early: patterns spell the ninety-nine names, and their restoration triggers visions. The method constrains attempts—she must physically place pieces to access memory—and the pattern's shift to include her name is the pivotal acceptance beat. The mechanics shape every attempt and the final authorization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath shattered sky anchors every scene and supplies the mosaic stones that enable Sarai's work. The "perpetual twilight bleeding through cosmic fractures" creates pressure (the world is broken), and the plaza's transformation into a garden in the final vision directly charges the closure image. The setting's fractured state mirrors Sarai's task and provides both the problem (scattered tessera) and the canvas for solution. The Brotherhood's ability to find her here adds tactical threat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The great fire is past; the story occurs in its aftermath during nightly returns. This timeframe establishes the plateau of ruin Sarai navigates and motivates her compulsion to restore. The "before the great fire" vision in paragraph two and the fire memory in paragraph five use the timeframe to structure revelation. However, the present timeline is loose—"nightly" recurrence without a ticking clock—so time pressures choices thematically (post-catastrophe rebuilding) rather than tactically limiting moves within this single night.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated explicitly near the end as Sarai's synthesis: "strong enough to hold the weight of transformation, gentle enough to preserve what mattered." The desire is dramatized through her choice to hide families (past empathy) and her final commitment to gather the scattered (future empathy), but the "arms of steel" aspect—the strength to withstand Brotherhood threat—is more asserted than tested on the page. Her stance crystallizes around this motivation, yet no present choice forces her to trade empathy against another survival need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Warm coldness appears throughout: the tessera "warm despite the frost," "strange, cold warmth" of weeping, "warm coldness of necessary change." The oxymoronic tone coheres across beats and modulates with pressure—warmth in memory and acceptance, coldness in the ruined present and Brotherhood threat. The shattered sky's "strange light" and the final image of "starlight across the ancient plaza like a promise" carry the tone into the closure, charging it with paradoxical hope amid ruin. The tone is consistent and purposeful, though the explicit repetition of the phrase borders on overstatement.</comment>
