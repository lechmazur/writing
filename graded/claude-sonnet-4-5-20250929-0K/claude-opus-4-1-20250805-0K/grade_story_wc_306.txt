<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus shows embodied grief and the performance of "sincerely insincere" wealth, but the narrator remains more cipher than character—serving primarily as a mouthpiece for thematic insight. The daughter's absolute morality is told rather than dramatized through choice, weakening the emotional core. Internal contradiction appears in Marcus's protective vulnerability, but the narrator's detachment prevents full engagement with contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice—whether Marcus will "grow into his complexity"—is deferred rather than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (Causal-Accumulative) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: the hollow mirror finally reflects "gray spaces between what we intend and what we do," reweighting the binary morality premise. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (lighthouse, Marcus, Arbiter's arrival). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator deciphers the wind chimes and reveals Marcus's real books, narrowing his self-justification. Cost is legible but conceptual rather than visceral—Marcus must "choose to choose" without the comfort of absolutes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse at dawn, wind chimes, and hollow mirror shard work as micro-setting that charges the final image. The chimes constrain revelation (the narrator must decipher their song), and the shard's transformation—from showing nothing to reflecting gray space—anchors the conceptual closure. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional stance ("each combination of notes told stories the wind remembered"), and the salt air/October wind create atmospheric pressure without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's need to understand his daughter's suicide and his own complicity—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator reveals the real books and reframes the problem from "complexity killed her" to "simplicity killed her." One reversal shifts Marcus from seeking absolution to receiving a harder gift: the burden of perpetual moral choosing. The cost is clear but somewhat abstract: he must nurture nuance or shrink from it. No visceral trade-off forecloses a path on the page, keeping this in upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hollow mirror, wind chimes, and the Arbiter's methodology—moral flexibility as survival skill, not betrayal. The final image offers a resonant answer: conscience is "choosing to choose, again and again, in all the gray light dawn provides." No sermonizing mars the ending, though the narrator occasionally edges toward thesis ("Protection and preparation aren't opposites—they're dance partners"). The daughter's absolute morality breaking under complexity is earned through specific details (locked filing cabinets, safety violations) rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is controlled and textured—"conscience for hire sounds more honest," "expensive doubt," "performance dropped"—with a professional detachment that serves the Arbiter role. Marcus's dialogue carries subtext (the "sincerely insincere" tone), though his voice sometimes blends with the narrator's register. The rice-paper questions and wind-chime deciphering build perceptual signature, but occasional slips into thesis mode ("That's what we offer, we Arbiters") dilute the voice-as-action effect. POV remains stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("Rich men always dress their guilt in designer uncertainty"), but several runs suffer from template cadence: "I opened my case… I began burning… I moved toward." The "cloak of doubt" appears three times without functional variation, trending toward motif-token. Mixed metaphor: "wrapped in expensive doubt" versus "cloak of doubt" versus "performed vulnerability"—the metaphor vehicles shift without clear pattern. No paraphrase loops, and the final paragraph propels cleanly, but mid-story scaffold ("The wind chimes shifted to a minor key") adds minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Arbiter-as-conscience-for-hire premise and hollow mirror shard offer fresh angles on moral ambiguity, and the wind chimes as narrative device show ingenuity. However, the daughter's suicide and Marcus's guilt follow a recognizable template (wealthy father, ethical lapses, idealistic child), and the story does not transform it through lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The narrator's walking away rather than showing Marcus's next choice is a safe ending that avoids harder closure. Specificity in the wind chimes and mirror elevates mid-band, but the core emotional arc remains familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Arbiter/conscience-for-hire appears in setup, constrains the middle turn (deciphering chimes, reframing Marcus's guilt), and shapes the ending by withholding answers and offering "better questions." Two beats of causal pressure and closure linkage, but the narrator's passivity (observing, interpreting, departing) limits the score—decisions alter Marcus's understanding but not the narrator's own stakes. Early signal and closure participation met; causal work is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard is handled at setup (Marcus produces it), returns in the middle (narrator holds it to catch lighthouse beam), and transforms at closure (finally reflects "gray spaces"). Three beats, evolving use, and the transformation charges the final image with conceptual cost. Irreplaceable: the hollowness and final reflection are weight-bearing. Cost connection clear. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "cloak of doubt" appears three times: Marcus's expectations as cloak, the narrator's closing line about wearing complexity, and an earlier metaphor about "expensive doubt." Setup and closure participation met, but middle development is thin—it does not constrain a choice or narrow options. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (Marcus will "wear it like another cloak"), earning mid-band, but swappability (any metaphor for burdensome complexity) limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" is labeled early ("that particular tone wealthy clients perfect") and colors Marcus's dialogue, but it does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Present across beats (his opening line, his explanation of market necessities), but the trait remains observational rather than causal. No action turns on this specific contradiction. Mid-band for presence and consistency without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unhook" appears once in the narrator's diagnosis: "You tried to unhook her certainty." It reframes the problem (Marcus's complexity explanations failed) but does not drive a turn—the revelation arrives through wind-chime deciphering, not the unhooking action itself. Late middle use without setup or closure participation. Swappable with "dismantle," "erode," or similar verbs. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Wind-chime deciphering is signaled early (the narrator "learned to read" the patterns), used causally in the middle (reveals the daughter's discoveries and Marcus's real books), and recurs at closure (the chimes "rang a major chord" as the narrator leaves). The method shapes the key turn and charges the ending's emotional register. Mechanics are plausible within the story's logic. Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The breezy lighthouse at dawn provides the stage and charges the closure image ("all the gray light dawn provides"). The setting is signaled early, the wind drives the chimes (enabling the method), and the lighthouse beam catches the mirror shard at the climactic reframe. Three beats, causal involvement (wind → chimes → revelation), and the dawn light reweights the final image. Environment constrains and charges without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the campfire's last spark dies, when darkness feels absolute but dawn threatens" anchors the opening mood and licenses the purple-gray sky, but elapsed time is not tracked and no clock tightens decisions. The dawn arrives on schedule without altering tactics. Present in setup and closure (dawn's gray light), but it does not pressure choices. Lyric function without causal force. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marcus's desire to "welcome nuance into certainty" is stated directly and dramatized through his request for the Arbiter's help, his handling of the mirror shard, and his final choice to stand holding his daughter's reflection. The motivation drives the middle turn (seeking absolution versus receiving complexity) and shapes the ending (will he nurture it or wear it). Two beats, closure linkage, friction between wanting permission and needing burden. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" describes Marcus's stance throughout (the "careful balance between admitting harm and maintaining dignity") and modulates with pressure—his voice "cracked" when the performance drops, then returns to controlled admission. Tone is coherent across beats and charges the final image (Marcus holding the shard, learning). The narrator's detachment complements Marcus's guarded affect. Distinct and purposeful, though the tone does not decisively shift at closure. Strong mid-upper band.</comment>
