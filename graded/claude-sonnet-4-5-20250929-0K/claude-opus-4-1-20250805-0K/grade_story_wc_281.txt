<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's somatic markers provide a concrete interiority method, and her body-driven navigation through the studio shows embodied decision-making. However, David remains largely functional—his skepticism-to-wonder arc is told through summary ("his skepticism softening," "understanding flooding") rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final convergence feels unearned because we never see David struggle with competing desires or make a micro-choice that costs him something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation early and follows an accumulative lens: Maya demonstrates her discovery, David witnesses, understanding shifts. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (David's participatory wonder replacing skepticism), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The phrase "making permanent what chemistry had only glimpsed" gestures toward stakes but doesn't land a felt consequence that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The studio's prismatic light and projectors are handled across multiple beats, and the muscovite particles create spatial architecture that Maya navigates. The light-painted structures guide David's movement ("stepped into the light structure") and the geode sliver's refractive properties enable the final demonstration. While the studio constrains and shapes action throughout, it functions more as a stage than as an environment that decisively alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya's effort to make hidden pathways visible—is signaled early and sustained. However, pressure never meaningfully tightens: David's concern poses no real obstacle, and his conversion happens through witnessing rather than through a choice that forecloses options. The reveal that "human connection didn't require medication" arrives as exposition rather than as a discovery earned through struggle, and no visible cost accompanies the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of hidden pathways and connection emerges through concrete imagery (fractally precise light structures, somatic markers as compass), and the pharmaceutical-profit critique adds edge. The "willowglass hope" metaphor recurs with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("that the pathways to understanding each other had always existed") rather than letting the light-painted architecture speak for itself, and the opposition dissolves too cleanly without moral friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable, and Maya's perceptual signature—reading somatic markers, following invisible threads—is consistent and specific. Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext ("You know I adore you, but this is insane" balances affection with resistance). The prose maintains a distinct register with controlled metaphor density. Minor slips: "understanding flooding his expression" tells rather than shows, and the phrase "participatory wonder" arrives as a narrator label rather than emerging from David's behavior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing multiple jobs (the geode both refracts light and represents the recalled pills). However, several beats loop: "creating bridges between neural pathways" and "illuminate hidden pathways" and "pathways to understanding" recycle the same core image across three separate moments without escalation. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels: "Maya's willowglass hope had proven stronger than rigid certainty" restates what we've already seen. Filter-verb density in the middle section ("began to devise," "had begun to devise," "started to coalesce") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy pills + light art + somatic markers offers a fresh angle, and the pharmaceutical-profit critique grounds the speculative premise. However, the core arc—skeptic witnesses transformative art and converts—follows a well-worn template without a decisive twist. The "empathy made tangible" realization and the discovery that connection was always there feel familiar rather than inevitable-in-hindsight. The story commits to its premise but plays it safely through the middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>David appears in all three story thirds and his presence complicates Maya's demonstration (skepticism creates mild friction). However, his choices don't create key turns—he observes, questions, then accepts. His conversion happens to him through witnessing rather than through a decision he makes that alters tactics or stakes. His "participatory wonder" signals thematic alignment but not agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in the opening line, is held up to the projector beam in the demonstration beat, and continues to refract light in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("creating new passages with each subtle shift"). Its conductive/connective property links Maya's accident to the pills to the studio method. Removing it would require restructuring the causal chain, though a generic mineral could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is present in all three thirds: mentioned in the opening paragraph, crushed and used in the demonstration, and explained as revealing hidden pathways in the resolution. The recall shapes Maya's stakes (she's trying to make visible what the pills briefly revealed) and drives her studio method. However, the pills function more as backstory catalyst than as a present-tense pressure that alters tactics beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears three times: describing the geode's reflections, the patterns Maya sees post-shock, and the light structures. It characterizes the visual signature but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The precision could be replaced with "geometric" or "intricate" without altering any choice or consequence—it remains a descriptive label rather than a functional trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Devise a new method" is stated early ("Maya had begun to devise a new method") and demonstrated in the middle beat when she crushes the pill and projects the light. The studio demonstration is the story's central action and enables David's conversion. However, the devising itself happens offstage before the story opens; we witness application rather than invention, which lowers causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced early as Maya's compass post-shock and return in the demonstration ("Her body guided her movements now, each gesture following the pull of somatic markers"). The method enables Maya's navigation through the studio and is explained as teaching others to trust bodily wisdom. It shapes two beats and ties to theme, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—we see the effect (goosebumps transmitting David's awe) more than the cost or constraint of relying on this method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio is present throughout: Maya adjusts projectors, the particles hang in projected light, David steps into the light structures, and the studio is declared "my laboratory now" at closure. The setting supplies the tools (projectors, light beams) that enable Maya's demonstration and houses the fractally precise architecture. Removing this exact setting would collapse the method and the climax, though the causality runs through equipment use rather than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the entire story—Maya's somatic abilities and her recognition of the muscovite connection both stem from the six-months-prior accident. The timeframe is signaled early and referenced at key beats. However, it functions as backstory anchor rather than as a ticking clock; no urgency derives from how long it's been since the shock, and the "after" could stretch to any duration without altering present choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to illuminate hidden pathways" is stated explicitly and demonstrated through her studio work; she crushes the pill, projects light, and teaches others to see. The motivation drives all her on-page actions and ties to theme. However, we never see Maya conflicted about this goal—no competing want or fear creates friction. The motivation is pursued without internal resistance or visible cost, which keeps it in the functional-but-uncontested range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" appears twice as a coined phrase describing Maya's expression and her final stance. The metaphor (fragile and flexible, bending without breaking) coheres with the theme of transformation through yielding. However, the tone label arrives as narrator commentary rather than emerging from scene texture, and the story's overall register remains steady rather than modulating with pressure. The final invocation ("had proven stronger than rigid certainty") tells us the tone rather than letting it charge the image.</comment>
