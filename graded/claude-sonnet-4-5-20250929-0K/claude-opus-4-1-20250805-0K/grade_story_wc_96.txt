<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>October's monthly molting is established with interiority ("a small revolution against the permanence everyone else seemed to crave"), but the trait remains largely asserted rather than pressure-tested on the page. Marcus's recognition ("You're not running from yourself... You're multiplying yourself") offers philosophical insight without dramatized internal conflict between impulses. The final choice to complete the anthology feels inevitable given the setup, but no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges in the ending—October simply continues her work with a smile. Embodied emotion is thin; the protagonist remains composed throughout without contradictory feelings acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by ~120 words (vagrant poet, rusted library, moonlight). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: details of the anthology, the resistance network, and Marcus's influence layer toward a thematic closure. However, the ending offers only tonal affirmation ("a vagrant penny poet, working by moonlight") without a decisive change, visible cost, or reconfigured stance—October was already committed at the start and remains so. The final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it, missing the requirement for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens holds, but closure lacks the necessary pressure or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library with its absent copper roof and open starlight is vivid and consistent, shaping the work environment throughout. The coffee tin appears twice with purpose, its "dented surface creating a pattern of luminous fractures" linking to the tone. Moon and starlight guide the work, providing concrete sensory anchors. Spatial choreography is clean; October crouches, lifts pages, presses them into the manuscript. The setting charges the final image ("under the stars in her rusted library") and the moon/tin details constrain the nocturnal timing, satisfying the micro-setting gate for high-7s eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding the anthology as resistance—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or narrowing. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening alters October's options; she works steadily from first paragraph to last without a hitch. The backstory about Marcus and the resistance network is extensive but does not create present-scene pressure. Agency is limited to repetitive assembly actions ("lifted another torn page," "pressed another page") without a meaningful escalation or cost. Under Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake is required; here the work continues at constant intensity to an affirmative close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty forged from anarchy, resistance through multiplicity—emerges clearly from October's work and the anthology's hybrid structure. The closing image ("resistance blooms best in broken places") and the coffee tin's "luminous fractures" offer concrete correlatives. However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis overtly ("a vagrant penny poet, working by moonlight to remind the world") rather than trusting the image alone, trending toward thematic echo. The anthology itself is a strong non-literal answer, but the stated moral ("resistance blooms best in broken places") edges into summary. No counter-reading is invited; the piece commits fully to its premise without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, and October's perceptual signature—"liquid silver," "luminous fractures," poetic fragment selection—is consistent and apt. Diction remains elevated throughout ("molted personalities monthly like a snake sheds skin," "illegible by choice, uncontainable by design") without stress-driven compression or modulation. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Under peak focus (rebuilding the anthology), the prose maintains its lyric register without internal texture shift, which is coherent but does not demonstrate range. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The voice is distinct but does not degrade or vary under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high in the backstory passages, but the present-scene beats loop: "lifted another torn page," "pressed another page into her growing manuscript," "touched the coffee tin once more" recycle similar actions without propulsion. Sentence openings vary, and no major grammar or tense errors appear. Figurative language is controlled ("liquid silver," "luminous fractures") and apt for the tone, though density in some lines ("Each personality was perfectly crafted for its purpose, a tool in her larger work") trends explanatory. The paraphrase loop around the anthology-building (Neruda/Rumi/Dickinson fragments described similarly across paragraphs) and the restatement of October's method in the penultimate paragraph trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for scaffold and momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vagrant poet who changes names monthly and the anthology-from-fragments conceit are appealing, but the core frame—underground resistance through art, prison friendship, coded networks—follows a familiar template without a transformative twist. The ending affirms the premise established in paragraph one without surprise or reversal; the transformation test suggests plot and arc would function identically with different names. The specificity of the rusted library and Marcus's sorting-books backstory add texture, but the moral calculus (beauty vs. standardization) and the final affirmation remain comfortably within expected bounds. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece executes its premise competently but predictably.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>October is present throughout and her ongoing work (lifting, pressing pages) drives the continuous action. However, her choices do not create turns—she was already committed to the anthology at the start and remains so without a pivot. The character enables observation and backstory but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development gates are met (present early, involved in middle beats), but closure participation is weak (she smiles and touches the tin, no decisive choice). Swappability is moderate; another artist-vagrant could serve the same function with minor edits. Band: functional but replaceable, low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in three beats: first mention with the secret false bottom, mid-story catching moonlight with "luminous fractures," and final touch. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is present (the fracture image links to tone). The tin's false bottom matters conceptually (it conceals the resistance list) but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics—October never opens it or uses the names within the scene. The object is integral to the resistance backstory but not causally active in this night's work. Lyric reprise (first → last) with charged detail lifts it into mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure caps further climb.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "blooming resistance" is named and explained in the fourth paragraph, shaping the backstory and thematic frame. It defines the network (fifty-three names, coded letters, scattered seeds) and the broader stakes. However, within this single night's scene, the concept does not alter October's options or tactics—she rebuilds the anthology as planned without the resistance exerting pressure. Setup is late (~30% mark); development is summary-only (resistance explained, not dramatized); payoff is thematic echo in the final line ("resistance blooms best in broken places"). The concept frames meaning but does not drive beats. Band: one thematic turn, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>October's monthly name-molting is introduced in the opening line and revisited in paragraph five ("As September... As November... Each personality was perfectly crafted for its purpose"). The trait is asserted to enable different roles (street performer, cleaning woman), but no on-page cost or constraint emerges from it in this scene—she is October tonight, working alone without needing to shift. Setup gate met; middle development is explanatory summary; closure does not hinge on the trait. The attribute enriches backstory but remains label-only within the present action. Band: functional but ornamental in this scene, low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rebuilding the anthology is the dominant action across all beats: October lifts pages (Neruda, Rumi, Dickinson), presses them into the manuscript, and nears completion by the end. Setup is immediate (paragraph one: "rebuilding something precious"), middle beats show her adding fragments, and the ending declares "Tomorrow, the rebuilt anthology would be complete." The action drives every present-moment beat and culminates at closure. However, the rebuilding proceeds without friction or reversal—no choice between competing fragments, no failed assembly—so causal pressure is moderate. All three gates met, strong beat involvement, closure linkage solid. Band: essential across beats, high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The friendship with Marcus, sparked "sorting donated books together" at the prison library, is introduced in paragraph three and revisited in paragraph five (Marcus taping torn pages). It explains the origin of the resistance network and the method of rebuilding books from fragments, priming October's current work. Setup is mid-story (~25%); development is backstory summary; payoff is indirect (the technique October uses tonight traces to Marcus). The method shapes the anthology's hybrid form but does not appear as a live process or choice in the present scene. Band: functional backstory link, low-mid 3s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library—shipping container, copper roof cut away, open to stars—is established in paragraph one and anchors every beat. October crouches in the space, moonlight pours through the absent ceiling, the stars witness her work. The setting supplies the nocturnal privacy and poetic atmosphere essential to the tone and enables the moon-timing (timeframe). The final image ("under the stars in her rusted library") charges closure. Setup immediate, beats involve spatial detail (roof, stars, moonlight on pages), payoff integral. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice but it shapes mood and the final reconfiguration. Band: essential to tone and ending, mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the moon cleared the skyline" appears in paragraph two, and moonlight illuminates October's work throughout ("moon cleared the skyline," "moonlight," "by moonlight" in the close). The moon provides light for her nocturnal assembly and reinforces the luminous tone. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no deadline, no approaching dawn that forces completion. The clock is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Setup early, development is sensory continuity (moonlight on pages, coffee tin catching light), payoff is tonal (final line "by moonlight"). Band: shapes atmosphere and charges imagery, one thematic turn, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>October's desire "to forge beauty from anarchy" is articulated by Marcus in paragraph three and restated in the penultimate paragraph. The anthology's structure (fragments from destroyed books) embodies the motivation, and her nightly work dramatizes the forging process. However, the motivation is more told than friction-tested—no competing want (safety, rest, doubt) opposes it on the page. Setup is early (via Marcus); development is the ongoing assembly; payoff is thematic affirmation ("proof that beauty could be forged from anarchy"). The motivation drives the action but without internal conflict or visible cost. Band: one clear dramatized turn, low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone—"luminous fracture"—is embodied throughout: "moonlight poured through... like liquid silver," the coffee tin's "dented surface creating a pattern of luminous fractures," and the anthology itself as broken books rebuilt. The oxymoron (light within brokenness) coheres across the piece and modulates subtly from descriptive (paragraph two) to charged metaphor (tin detail, final image). The tone does not shift under pressure (no tonal contrast or breakdown), maintaining lyric elevation throughout. Setup immediate, development accumulates fracture/light images, payoff charges the ending ("luminous fractures," "broken places"). The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to closure. Band: essential and modulating, low-7s.</comment>
