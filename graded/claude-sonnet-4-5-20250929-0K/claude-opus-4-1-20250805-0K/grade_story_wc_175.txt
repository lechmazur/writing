<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor the cloud dwellers is clear and drives her action, but her internal life remains largely cerebral and observational. The piece offers embodied moments ("weathered fingers," "blushing stillness") yet the protagonist's choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted—she never hesitates or confronts a competing impulse. The final act of watching the butterfly depart carries cost (impermanence, solitude) but the cost is atmospheric rather than a dramatized forfeiture that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered history (cloud dwellers, luna moth, monarch migration) and the final image reweights the opening premise with visible cost (structures dissolving, Mira descending in darkness). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the monarch's departure crystallizes the story's stakes—preservation through impermanence—and the cost (everything dissolves, leaving only traces) is legible in the final paragraphs. One minor slip: the middle section's exposition about moth-wing encoding and cloud dweller civilization slows accumulation without adding a turn or deepening the present stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto is vivid and specific: mosses like curtains, ferns in weeping crevices, suspended bowl formed by collapse. The setting constrains choice (Mira climbed three days to reach it, moisture dissolves her structures within hours) and charges the final image (structures returning to the grotto that "sheltered so many forgotten stories"). Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's attentive, reverent perception. The moth wing as micro-setting object participates in the closure (placed at the spiral's center, read by the butterfly).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the cloud dwellers by encoding their history for the last monarch—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is textural rather than causal: Mira works methodically without opposition or internal doubt, and the arrival of the butterfly feels awaited rather than contested. The tightening occurs when the butterfly lands on the moth wing and "reads" it, then departs—a meaningful beat that forecloses continuation (the butterfly will die, structures dissolve) with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens this is sufficient, though the lack of a complicating reversal or moment of doubt keeps the score from the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: impermanence as honoring, the temporary as profound, overlooked histories encoded in natural media. The final image—bent stems, displaced stone, ghost of moth-wing dust—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to preserve the erased) without moralizing. One small slip: "Their entire civilization had been built on such gestures: profound, temporary, and visible only to those who knew how to look" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains character-filtered rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's attentive, reverential perception. Diction is elevated and controlled ("interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted") with a consistent lyric texture. No dialogue appears. A few moments drift toward over-wrought lyricism ("water droplets seemed to pause mid-fall, creating prisms that hung like unfinished sentences") that risks preciousness, and the phrase "esoteric realist" in the opening feels label-like rather than demonstrated. Overall, voice is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagistic with high information load per sentence; rhythm modulates between descriptive expansion and tighter action. Minor slips: "interrupted cadence" appears three times as a motif anchor but edges toward over-reliance; "the cloud dwellers would have approved" in the penultimate paragraph is a small tell where implication would be stronger. A few metaphors approach purple ("orange wings like torn sunset") without crossing into muddle. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, and the closing image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of last-monarch migration, extinct aerial civilization, and moth-wing encoding is specific and non-obvious. The commitment to impermanence as structure (temporary monuments, dissolved traces) transforms familiar elegy tropes through world logic and sensory detail. Mira's occupation as "esoteric realist" is gestured at but not fully demonstrated—her specific skill set (reading atmospheric currents, interpreting pollen records) could be sharpened. The piece takes a meaningful risk in foregrounding atmosphere over conflict, and the ending's renunciation of permanence feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira ("esoteric realist") is present throughout and her choices drive the narrative: climbing to the grotto, building the structures, placing the moth wing. However, her role is largely observational and methodical—she enacts a plan without meaningful friction or a pivot. The character shapes one key turn (placing the wing at the spiral's center, which the butterfly reads), but agency is more ritual than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in the opening (pressed between fingers), is described with its history (luna moth, seventy years ago, cloud dweller gathering), placed at the center of the final structure, and read by the monarch in the climax. It participates in three distinct beats and directly shapes the closure image. Strong causal role and irreplaceability; the wing bridges two extinct histories.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is signaled early in the grass-stem tower (tight knot, loose knot, absence pattern) and reprised in the final paragraph's rhythm description. It shapes the method (structures with gaps, musical phrase without resolution) and charges the ending's conceptual closure. The concept constrains Mira's building choices and reweights the theme. However, mid-scene involvement is more thematic echo than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" describes the cloud dwellers and informs the story's logic (seasonal migration, impermanent homes). The attribute appears in one expository beat and aligns with theme but does not constrain an on-page action or choice by Mira. It is functional background rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Knotting (grass stems, twisted vines) structures Mira's signal-building and encodes the cloud dweller history. The action appears in two beats: the tower and the spiral. It is specific and purposeful, tied to the method and the monarch's reading. The story would lose clarity without it, but the knots do not create a reversal or constrain Mira's choices under pressure—she executes a plan.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Building temporary structures as signals is signaled early, shapes Mira's methodology across multiple beats (tower, spiral), and directly enables the closure (the butterfly reads the moth wing placed in the structure). The method's impermanence (dissolution within hours) is a cost that charges the ending. The mechanics are clear and integral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto is established early (suspended garden, collapsed peak, moisture-catching bowl) and constrains Mira's work: three-day climb to reach it, moisture that dissolves structures, isolation. It charges the final image (structures returning to the grotto, Mira descending in darkness). The setting is specific, irreplaceable, and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"migration of the last monarch butterfly"—is signaled in the opening and frames the story's urgency and finality. The species dwindling to one individual raises stakes, and the butterfly's arrival and departure anchor the closure. However, the migration itself does not tighten Mira's tactics or create a live clock; she waits and the butterfly arrives on cue.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated early and sustained throughout. It drives her climb, her encoding work, and her choice to leave no permanent trace. The motivation is thematically consistent and shapes the ending's renunciation. However, it is largely told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost paid on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named once and realized through pacing (deliberate movements, paused droplets, the grotto holding its breath) and diction (soft, suspended, reverent). Tone modulates subtly under pressure (the butterfly's arrival shifts to gentle urgency, the descent to quiet finality) and charges the closing image. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the accumulative design.</comment>
