<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaspar's guilt over teaching the wrong defense is anchored concretely, and his forgiveness arc culminates in a visible choice (placing the copper piece, walking away). However, the central journey relies heavily on abstraction—"winnowing truth from possibility" and "fierce repose"—rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The student's face appearing in the platinum queen is asserted insight rather than earned through on-page friction, and the final renunciation ("carrying the guilt served neither his student nor his future pupils") edges toward therapeutic self-awareness that flattens the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kaspar forgives himself and walks away, foreclosing the path of self-condemnation with visible cost (the copper piece offering, the acceptance that he cannot unfreeze the village or undo the mistake). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered imagery (frozen village, platinum labyrinth, tapestry threads) and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear early (exiled tutor, time-frozen village, central square). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaspar decodes the tapestry and sees his own error mirrored, which deepens his self-understanding and enables the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The time-frozen village constrains Kaspar's journey—he cannot physically help the villagers or his student, only achieve internal resolution—and the platinum labyrinth charges the final image (the copper piece placed on its edge). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: raindrops like glass beads, lightning as permanent veins, the board's internal light. The "woven hush" and "fierce repose" atmospheric phrases recur with some thematic weight but occasionally drift toward ornamental lyricism. Spatial choreography is clean (archway → central square → board's edge → exit through raindrops).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness for a past teaching error—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kaspar realizes the frozen game mirrors his own mistake, which narrows his options to acceptance rather than external redemption. However, the pressure is largely internal and reflective; no live antagonist or external force tests his choice. The cost of walking away (leaving the village frozen, accepting his student's lost future as unchangeable) is legible but feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so the lack of causal reversal is not penalized, but the tightening remains modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the frozen game's mirrored error, the tapestry's frayed threads, the contrast between the monumental platinum set and Kaspar's humble copper piece. The final image (thunder remaining distant, understanding coming "in the spaces between one heartbeat and the next") offers a resonant answer to the question of self-forgiveness without stating a moral. The woven hush functions thematically to make silence tangible, though it occasionally tilts toward overt symbolism. The piece resists tidy resolution—Kaspar cannot undo his mistake or save the village—and the wisdom is earned through his specific engagement with the labyrinth rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering the frozen village through Kaspar's chess-tutor lens (recognizing the Sicilian Dragon error, seeing the queen as sacrificed to save a pawn). Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "fierce repose" and "winnowed truth from possibility" maintaining a lyric register. However, the voice occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism ("silence itself became tangible, creating spaces between frozen seconds") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears, appropriately. Perceptual signature is clear: Kaspar notices tactical errors, patterns, and the weight of choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and largely coherent (raindrops as glass beads, platinum pieces reflecting futures, tapestry revealing intentions), but some constructions feel overwrought: "fierce repose," "woven hush descended like fog made of whispers," "the breath between one moment and the next." Line-level clarity is generally strong, though a few phrases approach purple ("the lull of distant thunder that never arrived" recurs without adding pressure). Minor scaffold: "Three years had passed since the tournament" is efficient setup, but the subsequent backstory explanation could be more concise. No major loops or template cadence issues. Information density is good; most lines advance character or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—exiled chess tutor seeks redemption in a time-frozen village—synthesizes fantasy and character study in a purposeful way, and the platinum chess labyrinth is a strong central image. The tapestry-decoding method and "woven hush" concept feel fresh. However, the emotional arc (teacher forgives self for past mistake) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (acceptance rather than external change) is predictable once the village's permanence is established. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and follows through on the chess-mirror conceit, but the moral calculus (forgiveness as wisdom) is not deeply interrogated or complicated by counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaspar's choices drive the narrative: he approaches the labyrinth, decodes the tapestry threads, adjusts the pattern (causing the platinum pieces to shift), and places the copper piece before walking away. These decisions alter his stance from self-condemnation to acceptance and enable the closure. Early setup (exiled tutor at village edge), middle development (decoding and adjusting threads), and payoff (placing copper piece, walking away) all three gates met. Causal pressure: his work with the tapestry narrows his options to acceptance. Closure linkage: his final action (placing the piece) and departure crystallize the forgiveness. Swappability is low; remove the chess-tutor identity and the mirrored-error insight collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears at setup (village center), is engaged in the middle (Kaspar studies it, adjusts the tapestry, sees the pieces shift), and receives the copper offering at closure. The object's mirrored-error property drives Kaspar's realization and enables his self-forgiveness. However, much of its function is descriptive and symbolic rather than tactile; Kaspar interacts more with the tapestry than the pieces themselves. Cost connection is present (the pieces reflect what he cannot change). Specificity is high (platinum, monumental scale, internal light). Two gates met solidly; middle development is partial (he observes and understands rather than manipulates the pieces directly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "woven hush" is introduced at setup ("rumors of the woven hush"), reappears in the middle ("the woven hush descended like fog"), and is mentioned at closure ("the woven hush began to unravel"). However, its function remains abstract and thematic rather than tactical. It does not constrain choices or alter what Kaspar can do; instead, it provides atmospheric resonance for his internal shift. The concept is poetic but largely ornamental. Swappability is moderate; replace it with "profound silence" or "moment of clarity" and the plot remains intact. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaspar "fidgets productively with the copper pieces in his pocket" early and later "his fidgeting fingers worked faster" when adjusting the tapestry threads. The trait is embodied and recurs, signaling his habitual processing style. However, it does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost; it characterizes but does not pressure. The attribute could be removed without altering the plot. Setup and middle development met; closure linkage is absent (the fidgeting is not invoked during the final placement or departure). Causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Winnow truth from possibility" appears at midpoint when Kaspar decodes the tapestry threads and again near closure ("the wisdom winnowed from the labyrinth's silence"). The action enables his key realization (the frozen game mirrors his error) and directly supports the forgiveness resolution. However, the mechanics are abstract—what does it mean on the page to "winnow"? The verb is more metaphorical than concrete. Setup is late (~40% mark), middle development is strong (he works with the threads), payoff is clear (wisdom winnowed). Swappability is moderate; "discern" or "sift" could substitute with minor edits. Cost connection is present (understanding leads to acceptance with visible cost).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is seeded early ("he began to decode their meaning"), developed in the middle (each thread tells a story, he pulls specific threads to alter the tapestry's pattern), and shapes the closure (the adjustments cause the platinum pieces to shift, enabling his insight). The method is specific and irreplaceable; remove the tapestry-decoding and the mechanism for Kaspar's realization collapses. All three gates met. Causal pressure: the threads reveal the mirrored error and narrow his path to acceptance. Specificity is high (frayed border, particular threads). One friction: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (how does pulling a thread shift a physical chess piece?).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is introduced immediately (opening line), pressures all action (Kaspar cannot change the past or unfreeze the village, constraining him to internal resolution), and charges the final image (he walks back through suspended raindrops, thunder remains distant). The setting's permanence forces the Earned Stasis closure. All three gates met strongly. Causal pressure is high: the frozen state makes external redemption impossible and mandates acceptance. Closure linkage is direct: the village's unchanging nature is invoked in the final beats. Specificity is high (raindrops hung midair, lightning painted permanent veins, villagers frozen mid-step). Cost connection is clear (he must leave the village frozen).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder that never arrived" frames the opening and recurs at closure ("the thunder remained distant, patient, eternal"). The timeframe is more atmospheric than tactical; no live clock tightens decisions. The thunder's permanence reinforces the frozen-time conceit but does not alter Kaspar's choices or escalate pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is absent (the thunder is not invoked during the key decoding beats). Swappability is high; replace with "in the eternal stillness" and the plot holds. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to forgive himself for teaching the wrong defense is signaled in the second paragraph, drives every beat (approaching the labyrinth, decoding the tapestry, adjusting threads, realizing the mirrored error, placing the copper piece), and achieves closure in the final paragraph ("he finally forgave himself"). All three gates met strongly. The desire is dramatized through on-page choices and internal friction (he sees his student's lost future, wrestles with "the bitter edge of his self-condemnation," and arrives at acceptance with visible cost—he cannot undo the mistake). Specificity is high: the Sicilian Dragon error, the student's lost patronage. Cost is legible: he walks away carrying wisdom but not redemption.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is invoked once near the end ("standing amid the fierce repose of this temporal prison") and subtly reflected in the setting's paradox (frozen motion, permanent lightning). The tone balances stillness with intensity throughout: vivid sensory detail (glass beads, internal light) against a contemplative, slow-burn emotional arc. However, the phrase itself feels imposed rather than earned—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image directly. Setup is weak (the phrase appears late); middle development is indirect (the tone is present but not named); payoff is present. Swappability is moderate; the story's tone could be described other ways without structural loss. Coherence is strong; resonance is partial.</comment>
