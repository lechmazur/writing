<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her perceptual ability is embodied in concrete action (pressing palms, catching fragments). However, interiority leans toward explanation rather than contradiction under pressure—her reverence for walls and legacy remains stable without genuine internal conflict testing it. The final choice to add her own whisper feels inevitable rather than foreclosing a live path with visible cost. Minor issue: "Legacy's burden" reads as a diagnostic label rather than dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Mira, ivy-veiled passage, post-climate university). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered discoveries (film negative → Voss diary → hidden recordings) that deepen Mira's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she places her notebook beside Voss's, continuing the tradition with felt cost (solitude, burden accepted). The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical turn, but the final image reweights "legacy's burden" from inheritance to active preservation. One meaningful deepening present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivy, stone walls, and the fireplace mantle function as active setting elements that constrain Mira's movements and supply the hidden archive. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "cool stone wall," "curtains of leaves," "brown and brittle as autumn leaves." The micro-setting (fireplace and specific stones) charges the final image when Mira places her notebook on the mantle. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving and decoding acoustic memory—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes Voss had the same perception and left a map. The film negative strip discovery and diary annotations create one meaningful pressure point that narrows her options to extraction work. Agency is primarily attention and endurance; the ending crystallizes her stance (adding her whisper, ensuring future searchers) with conceptual cost (ongoing solitude, burden perpetuated). No antagonist or physical obstacles test her commitment, keeping escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as architectural inheritance, the duty to preserve stories—emerges organically from Voss's diary, the hidden recordings, and Mira's final act. "The walls dream of us because we taught them how to remember" functions as thematic echo but is earned by prior particulars (trapped conversations, limestone absorption). The notebook placement offers a resonant, non-literal answer to what preservation costs without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the half-burned diaries and Mira's solitary continuation of a dying art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Mira's perceptual signature (trained senses, wall vibrations). Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she closes her eyes to expand her senses. Diction stays within her lexicon, though "molecular structure" and "resonance detectors" risk minor register elevation. Voice is consistent but not sharply distinct—syntax and rhythm remain steady across emotional beats rather than degrading or compressing under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and purposeful with strong momentum through the archive discovery sequence. Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character perception, or thematic material. Minor issues: "Legacy's burden, her mother had called it" reads as scaffolding exposition; the phrase "sensitively perceptive hearing" in paragraph two is slightly redundant with surrounding description. Final line "before disappearing back into the green passages that had become the world's new architecture" carries thematic weight but borders on overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—sonic archaeology in a climate-changed world—offers a fresh angle on preservation narratives. The fusion of echo cartography with post-warming ivy conquest and Voss's hidden archive feels specific and integrated. However, the emotional arc (lone expert discovers predecessor's work and continues the mission) follows a recognizable template without transformation through moral calculus or lived friction. The film negative as treasure map and the fireplace archive are purposeful but not conceptually surprising. Solid synthesis elevated by sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as corridor echo cartographer drives all major beats: she navigates the passage, interprets wall vibrations, decodes the film negative, extracts recordings, and makes the final choice to place her notebook. Her profession enables every discovery and the ending crystallizes her acceptance of the role's solitary burden. Introduced in the opening and causally active through closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Film negative strip appears early (paragraph three) and serves as the map to Voss's hidden archive, shaping Mira's extraction work. It drives the middle discovery beat but does not return at closure with reweighted meaning—once decoded, it disappears from the text. Two-beat involvement (discovery, application) but no closure participation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named explicitly in paragraph two and shapes Mira's motivation (carrying forward her grandfather's and mother's work). It informs her final choice to continue the tradition, though the cost is conceptual rather than a visible tradeoff on the page. The concept frames stakes but does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure; it functions more as thematic backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive hearing" enables Mira to read wall vibrations and catch conversation fragments—her core capability throughout. It constrains her work (requires training, isolation as last practitioner) and enables the extraction. However, no visible tradeoff or cost tied specifically to the trait appears; it functions as pure advantage. Present in setup and development, shapes one key middle beat, minor closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears twice: Mira glimpses the fireplace through vegetation (paragraph five) and the final line imagines future searchers glimpsing her notebook. The fireplace glimpse triggers the archive discovery, a major turn. The closing reprise reweights the action from chance observation to intentional continuity. Two-beat structure with thematic charge, but the ending could function without the verb itself; the concept (seeing through obscurity) matters more than the exact word.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered in paragraph five and provide Voss's annotations that map the hidden recordings. The method (incomplete burning preserving crucial pages) is causally necessary: without the diary, Mira cannot decode the film negative or locate the recording devices. Shapes two beats (discovery, decoding) and the final notebook placement mirrors the fireplace setting. Does not constrain later tactics but enables the climactic extraction work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage frames the entire journey, forcing Mira to brush aside vegetation and navigate choked doorways. The passage narrows physically, creating spatial pressure and revealing the archive room. The ivy returns in the closing image ("green passages that had become the world's new architecture"), reweighting the setting as permanent transformation. Three beats with early setup and closure linkage; constrains movement but does not alter tactical choices at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the premise (abandoned university, ivy conquest, rising sea levels in trapped conversations) but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The phrasing is backstory context rather than an on-page clock. Mira's work unfolds over hours with no urgency; the temporal pressure is generational (last cartographer) rather than immediate. Present in setup, weak development, absent from closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is implicit in Mira's extraction work and explicitly articulated by Voss ("The walls remember everything... They dream of footsteps and laughter"). The desire drives Mira's entire arc and her final realization ("The walls dream of us because we taught them how to remember") answers the question thematically. However, the motivation is told and uncomplicated by friction—no competing want or fear tests her commitment. Present across all three gates with thematic payoff but minimal on-page conflict.</comment>
