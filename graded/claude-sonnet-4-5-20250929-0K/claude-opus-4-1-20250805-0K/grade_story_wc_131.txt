<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Edgar's interiority is specific and embodied—the copper pipe's coolness, the sense memories from tape fragments. His contradictory impulses (hiding versus yearning to connect) drive choices with visible cost: thirty-seven years of isolation versus the risk of leaving fragments for the archivist. The final choice to leave the rest tomorrow is earned by the revelation that she's been conducting the same rescue operation, though the ending hedges slightly with "perhaps" rather than full commitment. Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing of "becoming visible" as stated goal rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Edgar's realization that "becoming visible wasn't about emerging from the shadows" but about "trust—the careful exchange of gifts" reconfigures the thirty-seven-year isolation with visible cost (he will leave the fragments tomorrow). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the pattern of cache-giving deepens when we learn the archivist has been mirroring it, creating a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The orientation anchors (crawl space, library, dawn outage) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist reveals she knows he's there and has been leaving the tape player as invitation.</comment>

<comment>The crawl space between floors, the copper pipe, the ventilation grate, and the battery-powered reading light on twine all constrain Edgar's methods and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Edgar's long habitation: "old beams that had supported him for thirty-seven years," dust motes, the click of mechanical relays as sense memory. The library's physical architecture (pipe chases, floor gaps, stacks) enables his providential acts and shapes the archivist's search pattern. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—Edgar's need to preserve the building's autobiography while remaining hidden—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist's matching rescue operation is revealed. The power outage complicates (he must act more visibly by lowering the light), and her direct address "I know you're there" narrows his options with visible cost: he can no longer sustain the ghost illusion. Agency is clear: his decision to leave the fragments tomorrow forecloses the path of pure isolation. One strong reversal—learning she's been conducting the same operation—reweights his entire thirty-seven-year pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection through indirect care emerges from the cache pattern, the tape fragments as constellation of memory, and the final realization about trust. The "careful exchange of gifts between two people preserving what others had forgotten" answers the implicit question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the archivist's purposeful leaving of the tape player, her "I know you're there" that respects his boundaries. The tape fragments function thematically (memory, preservation) and causally (shared mission). Minor issue: "sapphire hush of dawn" in her dialogue reads slightly ornamental rather than organic to her voice, though the final image of remaining "her careful guardian" carries resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable in Edgar's limited third with consistent perceptual signature: he notices building systems (copper pipe temperature, beams, ventilation), sense memories tied to technology (oxide coating, vacuum tubes), and the archivist's movements through his hidden vantage. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during memory triggers, more observational during cache-giving. The archivist's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Minor deduction for "sapphire hush of dawn" in her speech, which tilts slightly purple for spoken words in this moment, though it serves the tonal requirement.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm variation and concrete imagery. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Opening and closing images (lights dying/steadying, dawn through windows) frame effectively. Minor issues: "kindly, methodical acts of providence" and "careful guardian, the keeper of sense memories" edge toward abstraction where concrete action would be sharper. The phrase "cascade of sense memory" is slightly generic. One near-loop: "carefully, methodically" in paragraph four echoes "mindful" and "carefully" from paragraph one without adding pressure. Still, no major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The crawl-space dweller premise is executed with specific, grounded detail—pipe chases, ventilation grates, donated objects as cache material. The recognition scene where both characters are revealed as parallel preservationists offers a fresh angle on isolation narratives. However, the core emotional arc (hidden helper learns to accept visibility through recognition) follows a recognizable template, and the thirty-seven-year timeline without significant prior incident or complication reads convenient. The ferromagnetic tape fragments and library-as-autobiography provide texture but don't fully transform the underlying framework.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Edgar's crawl-space dwelling is established in paragraph one, enables all middle cache-giving beats (battery light, prior gifts to janitor/guard/volunteer), and his decision to leave fragments tomorrow grows directly from the revelation. His specific methods (moving through pipe chases, lowering gifts on twine, caching in hidden spaces) are irreplaceable to the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the final choice is stated intention rather than completed action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The tape fragment appears in paragraph four with sense-memory trigger, is identified as "part of something larger" that Edgar has been caching throughout the building, and the archivist's matching tape player in paragraph ten reweights it as shared mission object. The fragment drives Edgar's preservation constellation and the thematic recursion of memory. Present across three distinct beats (discovery/memory, cache explanation, recognition of shared purpose) with clear causal and thematic work. Closure participates via the decision to leave "the rest of the tape fragments" tomorrow.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sense memory is dramatized in paragraph four: the tape fragment's oxide coating triggers "the smell of hot vacuum tubes, the click of mechanical relays, his mother's voice captured on magnetic tape before the accident." This memory directly connects to his thirty-seven-year retreat and his preservation mission. The concept shapes his motivation (preserving "recordings of patron requests, whispered confessions between the stacks") and is mirrored in the archivist's attempt to preserve old recordings. It alters tactics (caching fragments as memory constellation) and charges the thematic closure about trust and preservation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Kindly, methodical" is stated in paragraph six but shown through the cache pattern: exact change for parking, refilled thermos, materialized reference book. The trait enables his thirty-seven-year survival and shapes his gift-giving approach (lowering light on twine, systematic caching). However, the trait is introduced via summary label rather than early dramatization, and while "methodical" fits the cache constellation, "kindly" trends toward character summary rather than constraint with visible cost. Functional across beats but somewhat replaceable with "careful" or "patient."</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Caching is introduced in paragraph five ("Edgar had been caching pieces throughout the building's pipe chases"), demonstrated in paragraph six (battery light prepared weeks ago), exemplified through prior acts (janitor, guard, volunteer), and drives the ending turn when the archivist reveals she's been conducting the same rescue. The action is irreplaceable: remove caching and the recognition scene, shared mission, and Edgar's entire method collapse. Present across setup, development (lowering the light), and closure (decision to leave remaining fragments). Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Pipe chases are established in paragraph one ("crawl space between floors"), used as Edgar's navigation system in paragraph five ("pipe chases") and paragraph eight ("the pipe chase that ran directly above her position"), and enable his cache placement throughout. The method shapes his tactics (following pipes to position himself, using gaps where pipes penetrate floors) and is specific to the library's architecture. However, the mechanics are functional rather than transformative—the story could use ventilation ducts or service corridors with minor edits. Present in setup and development but not decisively charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The shadowed library at dawn is anchored in the opening line ("pale wash of dawn through the library's high windows") and maintained throughout—the archivist arrives "each morning before anyone else," the emergency lighting fails, fluorescents stutter back. The dawn lighting enables Edgar's observation through the grate, the outage forces the battery-light gift, and the final image returns to dawn's "rectangles of amber across the floor." The setting's verticality (crawl space above stacks) is essential to Edgar's hidden vantage and the gift-lowering. Time of day and lighting conditions constrain visibility and pressure the interaction. Irreplaceable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The outage is introduced in the opening line ("city's lights flickered and died") and drives the middle beat: backup systems fail, the archivist's flashlight dies, Edgar must provide the battery light. The timeframe creates urgency and opportunity. However, the outage resolves quickly ("power surged back suddenly") without sustained pressure on the closure beat, and the "while" framing suggests the outage brackets the story yet it's absent from the ending. Present in setup and development but does not decisively shape the final choice, which would occur with or without the outage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The desire to become visible is dramatized through Edgar's thirty-seven-year hiding conflicting with his gift-giving, his careful observation of the archivist, and the final recognition that "becoming visible wasn't about emerging from the shadows" but about trust. The motivation is tested when the archivist directly addresses him ("I know you're there") and he must choose whether to continue pure hiding or leave the fragments. The cost is visible: tomorrow he will risk exposure by leaving all remaining fragments. The phrase "to those who need you" is realized in the archivist's need for the recordings. Strong causal and closure work, though stated slightly abstractly in the ending paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Tone is established through "pale wash of dawn," "shadowed stacks," dust motes, the quiet of pre-opening hours, and maintained through soft gestures (lowering light on twine, whispered thanks, the archivist's quiet voice). The phrase "sapphire hush of dawn" appears in the archivist's dialogue, feeling slightly imposed but serving the tonal requirement. Tone modulates appropriately: contemplative during Edgar's memories, tense during the outage, tender at the recognition. The ending's "careful guardian" and "sense memories in the space between floors" sustains the hushed quality and charges the final image. Coherent through turns with purposeful modulation.</comment>
