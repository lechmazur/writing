<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaia's motivation is clear and her fireworks expertise grounds her choices, but her internal life remains surface-level—she filters the world through her chant without genuine contradiction or self-doubt. The elderly mosaic artist functions as convenient support rather than applying pressure. The children's "listless game" and "forced and brittle" laughter are told rather than shown through specific behavior. Kaia's transformation from solitary wanderer to community leader occurs too smoothly without visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Situational/Accumulative lens: despair presses down, Kaia gathers resources, the community fires rockets, hope blooms. Orientation is clear (fortress courtyard at dusk). However, closure lacks felt cost—the fireworks succeed immediately, the community responds on cue, and no path is foreclosed. The "REMEMBER WONDER" tiles promise a turn but simply confirm what Kaia already intended. No meaningful tightening occurs; the escalation is additive assembly rather than pressure-driven choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phosphorescent moss and ceramic mosaic are vivid and specific anchors. The courtyard's spatial layout remains clear through Kaia's walk. The setting provides literal materials (moss, tiles, metal shavings) that enable the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the "starless void" and "Dimming" remain abstract; we never see how darkness constrains movement or choice in a concrete beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through communal fireworks—is signaled early but never truly tested. No reversal occurs; Kaia proposes a solution, gathers materials, and succeeds without setback. The mosaic artist's prior weeks of work should create friction (why didn't it work before?) but instead validates Kaia's arrival. The rockets' sustained burn is a technical triumph, not a dramatic one—no live choice narrows options or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of defying despair through communal creation emerges from image and action. "We make our own constellations" risks stating the thesis but stays just within metaphor. The chant-as-filter and the kerosene knot's sustained burn are purposeful motifs. However, "serious playfulness" never complicates the work—there's no friction between levity and gravity, only earnest assembly. The final "Against the gravity of hopelessness, they had learned to fly" borders on moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kaia's perceptual signature—filtering chaos through designer's rhythm and chemical formulae—is consistent and voice-specific. The chant device is distinctive and modulates with purpose. Dialogue is minimal but natural; the mosaic artist's "Fireworks without stars?" carries subtext. The phrase "serious playfulness" appears only in narration, never embodied in Kaia's choices. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm in the chant sequences. "Sulfur and saltpeter, charcoal and stars" establishes pattern. However, several phrases loop: "filtering" appears three times in similar constructions, and "steady as" is repeated in the final paragraph. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions—"purpose," "filtering despair into determination," "serious playfulness," "gravity of hopelessness"—where concrete image would land harder. "Bloom" is used for both moss and the fortress's transformation, diluting the metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fireworks-designer-as-hope-bringer premise is familiar, but the kerosene knot (borrowed from fire spinning) and phosphorescent moss as chemical source add specific texture. The "note in mosaic" concept promises ingenuity but delivers only a sign someone else made. The Dimming phenomenon remains generic dark-times allegory. The story commits to its premise but follows a predictable arc: wanderer arrives, teaches craft, community united, hope restored.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaia is present throughout and her designer expertise drives the material gathering and rocket construction. She makes the choice to stay and teach rather than merely demonstrate. However, her wandering is backstory; on the page she arrives already committed to helping. Her decisions (kneel, follow the perimeter, teach, light the first device) are all aligned—no trade-off or conflicting want complicates her goal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is introduced early (first third), handled when Kaia pulls it from her satchel, and its slow-burn property enables the sustained fireworks at the end. It appears in three beats: the trade backstory, the material-gathering explanation, and the lighting ceremony. However, it could be replaced with any slow-burning fuel without structural change—"oil-soaked rope" or "beeswax wick" would function identically. No specific cost or constraint ties to this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"REMEMBER WONDER" is the literal note in mosaic and it stops Kaia mid-chant, but it confirms her existing intention rather than redefining her goal. The mosaic artist has been leaving messages for weeks with no effect until Kaia arrives. The concept reappears as theme ("look up in wonder") but does not constrain choice or enable a tactic unavailable without it. Present in two beats (discovery, thematic echo) but swappable with any sign of prior resistance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaia's chant appears in the opening, recurs during the perimeter walk with "new words," becomes a communal chorus, and continues in the final paragraph "steady as the kerosene's flame." The rhythm helps her "measure perfect timing" and later "transformed worry into purpose" for the group. It's character-specific, affects how she teaches, and charges the ending. The chant's particular content (chemical formulae) matters—generic humming would not carry the same specificity or teaching function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Filter" appears in Ambrose's framing: Kaia "filtered the world's chaos," the chant "filtering their fear through rhythm," and the final line "filtering despair into determination." It describes her method but does not constitute a discrete action beat. The actual filtering work—sorting which minerals to grind, how to pack powders—happens off-stage in summary ("she showed them how to pack"). The word recurs but the dramatized act does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" appears once: "Kaia could sense their despair through ambient awareness, the way a designer feels the crowd's anticipation." This describes perception, not a method that shapes subsequent action. She does not use this sensing to adjust her approach or discover hidden resistance. It's mentioned in the first third, but her tactical choices (teaching, gathering materials) proceed from visible cues (listless children, mosaic message) rather than from this ability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fortress courtyard is anchored early with moss, gate, mosaic, and blacksmith. The phosphorescent moss and ceramic tiles supply actual materials (green pigment, crushed colors) that enable the fireworks. The kitchen contributes flour. The courtyard as gathering space shapes the communal launch. However, "blooming" at dusk is metaphoric description; the moss's glow does not constrain movement or choice in a specific beat. Present in setup, middle resource-gathering, and ending launch—functional across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story moves from dusk (opening, moss blooms) through "evening's hush" (work montage) to "true darkness" (launch). "Starless nights" and "absolute black" create atmosphere and motivate the need for artificial light. However, no time pressure tightens decisions—Kaia and the group have as much time as they need to gather and build. The clock does not force a trade-off or narrow a window. Present across the arc but primarily atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Defying hopelessness is Kaia's explicit goal from the fire spinner's charge ("hope that burns longer") through her statement "We make our own constellations" to the final line. It drives her choice to stay and teach. However, the motivation is never conflicted—she has no competing want (to move on, to conserve her last design, to protect her solitude). No cost is paid; the community's immediate receptiveness removes friction. Desire is clear but uncomplicated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The tone blends earnest craft instruction (chemical formulae, packing techniques) with metaphoric language ("bloomed with phosphorescent moss," "learned to fly"). "Serious playfulness" is named in the final paragraph but not embodied—the work is depicted as solemn and purposeful without levity or irony. The children's brittle laughter hints at forced cheer but disappears when they "dance." Tone is coherent and supports the ending's hopefulness, but the playful half of the intended register never materializes on the page.</comment>
