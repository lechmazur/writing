<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—she's protecting bees to preserve hope—and the involuntary honesty trait creates consistent pressure. The grandmother's legacy provides backstory that anchors present choice. However, the climactic broadcast feels too easily executed without internal resistance or competing impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from terror to steady hands without embodied contradiction. The citizens' wonder-filled arrival lacks individual distinction or status friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tower shifts from lightning collector to hope beacon, and Mira's involuntary confession transforms her isolation into community witness. The cost is legible—three years of theft exposed, her solitude ended. Drive lens reads as Causal with light Situational coloring; the broadcast decision follows motivated escalation from the neural dampener failure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One tightening (broadcast decision) suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower's seven hundred steps, copper coils, and glass chamber ground the action with functional detail. The lacquer box and its bee imagery charge the final candlelight image effectively. Spatial choreography is clean through the climb and chamber scenes. However, the "nectar-sweet evening air" and "amber sky" trend decorative without filtering through Mira's toll-keeper priorities or constraining a choice. The vertical farms are mentioned but remain abstract stakes rather than sensory pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of natural pollination vs. Mira's secret—is signaled early and tightens when the involuntary honesty forces the broadcast choice. The decision narrows options (exposure vs. continued hiding) with visible cost: her job security and privacy foreclosed. The citizens' arrival provides consequence. Agency is clear in the broadcast act. The matchbox riddle feels ornamental to escalation; the honeycomb placement and confession drive the turn more directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth as both sting and healing emerges through concrete action—the neural dampener failure, the forced confession, the bees' indifferent work. The final image of painted bees seeming to move in candlelight reweights the lacquer box without stating a moral. "The most powerful things usually are" risks platitude but is grounded in the child's embodied wonder. Subtext operates in Mira's self-accusation ("thief and a liar") and the quiet procession's candles. The riddle answer feels slightly over-articulated but ties to grandmother's cryptic teaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV Third Limited remains stable with consistent distance. Mira's perceptual filter (toll keeper's professional lens, "words tasted wrong") is specific. The involuntary-honesty dialogue creates voice distinction in her asides. However, some diction drifts elevated: "drone-dulled eyes remembering what they'd lost" and "radiating hope" read more lyric than Mira's pragmatic register. The child's "They're so small" works naturally. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully during the broadcast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Information density is high—most lines advance situation or character. Minor template cadence in the citizens' arrival paragraph: "their faces soft... their drone-dulled eyes..." paired descriptors. "Nectar-sweet evening air" and "drops of liquid gold" trend decorative in high-pressure beats. The closing metaphor "truths were meant to sting before they could heal" is functional but borders stock. No paraphrase loops or major filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is consistent through the climb and broadcast.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The involuntary-honesty premise offers a fresh constraint on the eco-parable frame. The lacquer box misdirection (ashes vs. honeycomb) and glass chamber secret provide specific angles. However, the core arc—secret eco-hope revealed to save community—follows a familiar template without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational detail. The drone-bee failure as inciting incident is topical but not deeply inhabited; we don't see Mira's toll-keeping work pressure her choice. The matchbox riddle feels convenient rather than integral to her grandmother's teaching method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's toll-keeper role anchors her access to the tower and provides the badge detail in the opening. The "candid" aspect (involuntary honesty) drives the broadcast decision and shapes multiple dialogue beats. However, the toll-keeping duties themselves don't constrain her choice—she could have hidden bees in any secure location. The role is functional but partially swappable with "tower custodian" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in four beats: opening climb, honeycomb placement, closing image, and embedded backstory anchor. Its bee imagery charges the final candlelight moment when "painted bees seem to move." The misdirection (ashes vs. honeycomb) creates a purposeful reveal. It enables the honeycomb's protected transport and signals grandmother's legacy. Removing it would require restructuring the inheritance motif and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is the inciting incident that creates the famine threat and makes Mira's secret bees urgent. It shapes her broadcast decision directly—without the drones' corruption, her revelation would lack stakes. The vertical farms' impending collapse provides the ticking clock. The concept drives two major beats (opening context, broadcast justification) and anchors the thematic question of nature vs. artifice. Highly specific to this plot's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Involuntary honesty appears in the opening scene (driving away visitors), constrains Mira's dialogue throughout, and directly enables the broadcast confession. The trait creates visible cost: she can't sugarcoat her theft, forcing full exposure. It operates in at least three beats (visitor dismissal, self-accusation, broadcast) with distinct consequences. The neural dampener cause feels slightly convenient but the trait's pressure on choices is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The reveal (broadcast confession) is the story's decisive turn; it transforms Mira's isolation into community action and redefines the tower's purpose. Two beats depend on it: the broadcast itself and the citizens' candlelit arrival. The involuntary honesty makes this specific form of reveal necessary—another character might have chosen a different method. The action reweights the lacquer box, the bees, and Mira's three-year secret with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The matchbox riddle appears once (pulled from pocket) and provides thematic echo ("bees") but doesn't shape Mira's tactics or choice. She already knows the answer; the riddle doesn't constrain her broadcast decision or honeycomb placement. It feels like a motif planted for lyric symmetry rather than causal pressure. Swappable with any grandmother keepsake that symbolizes the lesson. Present in closure thought but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower provides secure height for the glass chamber, the siphoned power that kept bees alive, and the emergency broadcast system. Its copper coils and seven hundred steps ground the setting physically. The tower's shift from power collector to hope beacon charges the final image. Three functions—hiding place, power source, broadcast platform—are irreplaceable. Removing it breaks the plot's logic and the thematic transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three nights ago" blackout, "three years" of secret keeping) provides context and urgency. The blackout's destruction of neural dampeners is the inciting incident. However, the "weeks until vertical farms fail" deadline doesn't tighten Mira's decision on the page—she acts from involuntary honesty rather than racing a clock. Time anchors causality but doesn't actively pressure her tactics in the broadcast scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Preserving wonder is stated in Mira's reflection ("guard this impossible hope") and enacted through her three-year secret and the child's gasping response. The motivation shapes her broadcast choice—she wants citizens to see the bees, not just hear about them. However, the friction between wonder-preservation and her terror is resolved too smoothly; we don't see her weigh the cost of exposing wonder to potential rejection or exploitation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Nectar-dusk tone appears in the opening ("nectar-sweet evening air," "amber sky") and modulates into the candlelit final image. The sweet/amber palette supports the bee imagery and provides atmospheric coherence. However, "nectar-sweet" trends decorative in the high-pressure beats and isn't filtered through Mira's practical POV. The tone charges the closure image (bees in flickering shadows) but operates more as consistent mood than dynamic pressure that tightens with escalation.</comment>
