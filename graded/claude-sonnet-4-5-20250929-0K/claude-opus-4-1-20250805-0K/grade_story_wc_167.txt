<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in his glazier's craft—"reading between lines" manifests through stress fractures and interference patterns. His decision to document and teach before demolition shows agency with visible cost (professional identity ending). Internal contradiction is present: he's spent thirty years framing views without truly seeing through them, and this reckoning drives his final stance. Minor deduction for the epiphany feeling slightly over-articulated in places ("surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces of possibility"), but the embodied observations through glass, water, and light ground the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: Marcus observes ripple patterns, dawn light through prisms, building toward a conceptual repricing where he resolves to teach others before the bulldozers come. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the final image crystallizes his stance—"a clear view through"—with felt cost (atrium will fall, career ends, but lesson persists). One meaningful deepening occurs as dawn floods the atrium and he commits to documentation. Deduction: the development company letter functions as convenient external pressure rather than emerging organically from prior causality, and the cost could be more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism atrium and pool are richly detailed, functioning as micro-setting that constrains Marcus's communion ritual and charges the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through his glazier's expertise: condensation beads, interference nodes, spectra painting water. The stone-and-ripples method becomes a tactile, lived-in practice. The pre-dawn mist and timed sunrise create urgency and modulate atmosphere. Pearl Bay's waterfront anchors the piece spatially. Small deduction: while vivid, the atrium's geometry could be more legibly tracked across moves—some angles and reflections blur slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Marcus seeks to understand what his decades of glazier work have been revealing, then shifts to preserving that insight before demolition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the development letter enters, narrowing his timeline to "the last morning." The stone-throwing acts are Marcus's agency—observation, decision, documentation—and the final stance (teaching others) forecloses his old passive installation role with felt cost. Deduction: the escalation relies on external coincidence (demolition notice) rather than a turn driven by Marcus's prior choices, and the pressure remains contemplative rather than testing him with a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: surfaces as conversations, boundaries as meeting-places, simple acts revealing depth. The noctilucent clouds seed the metaphor early, the ripples develop it, and the final image ("surfaces weren't barriers but birthplaces of possibility") reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the atrium's design—Marcus built it unknowingly as his own teaching tool. Minor deduction: the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("a glazier's true work was helping people see through more than glass"), slightly over-articulating what the ripples and light already conveyed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Marcus's perceptual signature: he notices stress fractures, beading condensation, interference patterns. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a lyric cadence that matches his contemplative stance. Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the stone-throwing beats. Small deduction: some metaphorical constructions in the final third drift into elevated register ("noctilucent reckoning," "birthplaces of possibility") that feel slightly authorial rather than organically Marcus's lexicon under pressure, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative sentences interspersed with sharp physical beats (stone leaving hand). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Deductions: "This was how he communed now" and "Marcus understood this was the last morning" are scaffold phrases that externalize rather than embody. The phrase "illuminate value in the mundane" recurs as a thematic label without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening third ("he'd built," "he'd installed," "he pulled") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glazier-as-seer premise offers a fresh occupational lens, and the atrium-as-teaching-tool twist is non-obvious. The ripple-pattern communion is specific and visually memorable. Deduction: the development-company demolition notice is a familiar extinction-of-craft trope without transformation, and the emotional arc (passive craftsman awakens to deeper purpose before loss) follows a template structure. The noctilucent cloud metaphor is elegant but feels imported for resonance rather than arising inevitably from Marcus's world. Risk is present in the accumulative, image-driven structure, but the core trajectory is recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his observation-to-documentation decision creates the final turn. His glazier expertise shapes every beat. The reflective mode is sustained and his choice to teach forecloses his old passive role with cost. Deduction: much of the arc is observational; the key decision (document and teach) arrives late and is stated rather than dramatized through a specific on-page action that tests him.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in the opening, is entered and used for the stone ritual, awakens at dawn with spectral display, and charges the final image (it will fall, but the lesson persists). Its glass-and-angle geometry enables Marcus's communion and directly shapes his realization. Small deduction: the atrium's specific architecture (angles, pool edges) could constrain a tactical choice more concretely rather than serving primarily as atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is seeded early (ice crystals catching impossible light) and returned at the climax ("his noctilucent reckoning: that endings could illuminate beginnings"). The concept shapes Marcus's stake—understanding what illuminates the hidden—but remains more thematic echo than a rule that alters his tactics. It reweights the ending's meaning but does not create a visible on-page cost or constrain a mid-story choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" is established early (seeing stress fractures, understanding light bending through imperfections) and enables Marcus's breakthrough (noticing language in spider-web cracks). It is a trait with visible application. Deduction: it does not constrain a choice with cost; it functions as an enabling skill without trade-off, and the final teaching decision does not hinge on this specific attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Commune" is Marcus's core action: he throws stones, watches ripples, and processes their patterns as a spiritual/intellectual practice. This ritual structures the middle beats and leads to his resolution to document and teach. Deduction: the communing itself is passive observation; the decisive action (choosing to teach) is stated in summary rather than dramatized, and the method could be swapped for other contemplative acts without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ripple-pattern method is signaled early (stone from pocket), executed on-page twice with detail (concentric rings, interference nodes, moving prisms), and its mechanics matter—the complexity-from-simplicity lesson becomes the content Marcus will teach. The patterns shape his understanding in real time and charge the closure image. The method is irreplaceable and causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn anchors time and mood, supplies the mist that makes the prism atrium visible, and the cresting sun triggers the spectral display that finalizes Marcus's insight. The waterfront's impending modernization supplies the external deadline. Deduction: the bay itself is more atmospheric than a constraint that alters Marcus's tactics; the atrium does more causal work than the larger geography.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" is stated early and sustained (pre-dawn, dawn arrival, "last morning," bulldozers coming). The timeframe tightens Marcus's decision to one final session and creates urgency for documentation. Deduction: the clock is declared but not tracked beat-by-beat; the dawn transition is atmospheric rather than a hard deadline that forces a mid-story tactical shift or painful trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate value in the mundane" is dramatized through Marcus's history (thirty years of installing windows without truly seeing), tested in his stone ritual (ordinary stone, extraordinary display), and drives his final choice (teach others before the atrium falls). The desire creates friction with his old passive role and costs him his professional identity. Minor deduction: the motivation is slightly over-articulated in the final third rather than left implicit in the actions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative with lyric precision, modulating from pre-dawn stillness to the flooding light of resolution. Metaphorical language ("darkness clung like oil," "surfaces as conversations") is consistent and coherent. The tone charges the final image by sustaining controlled wonder without tipping into sentimentality. Complexity is present in the interplay of endings-as-beginnings and Marcus's bittersweet acceptance. A strong tonal through-line under pressure.</comment>
