<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is stated rather than tested. The "resiliently positive nature undimmed by the existential weight" is label-only assertion; no on-page choice shows him choosing optimism over despair under concrete pressure. His decision to initiate convergence appears unmotivated—three years of collecting fragments is told in summary without showing what micro-choices led him to act tonight. The woman passenger and parallel selves are gestural presences without relationship friction or status dynamics that would force Marcus's hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when adequately (Marcus, ferry, 11:47 sideways time). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus merges timelines and finds purpose in "eternal transience." However, the convergence protocol and hourglass mechanism arrive without prior causal groundwork—the hourglass "collects temporal fragments" in summary, never shown gathering them or making a trade-off to do so. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density and motif layering toward a final reweighting), but the final image asserts transformation rather than earning it through escalated pressure. Cost is conceptual but not legible on the page; we're told timelines merge, not shown what Marcus loses or what choice this forecloses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, starlight, and ferry deck provide vivid atmospheric anchors. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent: "limestone cliffs phased between solid and ethereal," "constellations that spelled different stories." The woman's "three reflections" in water is a strong micro-setting image. However, the environment remains decorative—spatial choices don't constrain Marcus's actions or alter his convergence plan. The compass in the final beat is a charged object, but it appears only after the hourglass shatters, so it doesn't guide prior tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is declared but never tested with a meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. Marcus initiates convergence without on-page obstacles, failures, or visible prices paid during the act itself. The woman passenger's "which timeline tonight?" exchange is a potential pressure point but dissolves into passive observation. No escalation or deepening occurs; the ferry "shudders," timelines "braid," and success is immediate. Under an Accumulative lens, we'd expect density to tighten choices or a pattern to break and force a stance; instead, the resolution is announced in summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of potential/transience versus permanence emerges clearly from the empty hourglass and vanishing ferry conceit. "Not sand, but moments themselves" is a purposeful image. The convergence ending attempts to answer the thematic question—can one live all possibilities simultaneously?—through the compass pointing to "every now." However, the resolution is stated rather than shown through Marcus's final choice or action that reweights prior material. The woman's merged reflections (mother-artist-scientist) is a strong thematic image but arrives without her having made a choice that earned the synthesis. No quiet counter-reading or ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; third-person limited anchored in Marcus. Perceptual signature is present: "he'd been gathering the tools to merge parallel timelines" reflects his optimistic framing. Diction maintains a speculative/lyric register: "probability," "cosmic weave," "pure possibility." The captain's absence and one-way radio communication is a coherent constraint. However, the woman passenger's dialogue ("The one where I said yes") and Marcus's response feel interchangeable—no distinct idiom. Internal voice in the convergence sequence shifts into elevated exposition ("all the versions of himself across infinite timelines") that explains rather than dramatizes his perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and creates atmosphere: "Each night, the *Meridian Passage* materialized at precisely 11:47, when clocks run sideways and time folds into itself." Figurative language is purposeful in early beats. However, the convergence sequence stacks abstractions without concrete action anchors: "experiencing every version of his story at once," "pure possibility into the night," "eternal *Meridian Passage*." Paraphrase loop in the final paragraph: "no longer ardent for escape" / "found his purpose in the perpetual journey" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the woman-passenger beat: "She clutched… her edges flickering… her reflection… showed three different faces" uses parallel construction without progression. Minor −0.6 for loops and abstraction density in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry + parallel timelines premise is a recognizable SFF template (liminal transit + multiverse convergence). The empty hourglass as potential rather than futility offers a fresh inflection. Marcus's role as deckhand-turned-unifier has specificity. However, the convergence climax relies on familiar beats: protagonist realizes they've been gathering power all along, initiates a merge-all protocol, and achieves cosmic synthesis without friction. The woman passenger and parallel selves feel like requisite set-dressing rather than individuated complications. Risk-taking is present in the lyric, accumulative structure, but the ending retreats into safe abstraction rather than a bold, particular image that transforms the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his deckhand role frames the setting. He makes one key decision—initiating convergence—but it's unmotivated by prior on-page pressure. His "ardent" quality is told ("resiliently positive") rather than tested through a choice where optimism costs him something or enables a risky tactic. Touches: opening, woman scene, convergence, ending. Functional but replaceable; the convergence could be triggered by the captain or an external event with minor edits. Early signal +0.3, multiple beats +0.9, but swappability −0.8 and late decision (past midpoint) without prior character-driven escalation −0.5. Caps at 4.6 for weak causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in paragraph 2, returns at the convergence ("raised the empty hourglass"), and shatters to release possibility. Its emptiness as "potential" rather than futility is a specific, thematic inversion. It enables the convergence by storing "temporal fragments," though this mechanism is told in summary. Touches: pocket hum (para 2), convergence trigger (climax), shattered release (resolution). Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, specificity +0.5 = strong support. However, the gathering of fragments is summary-only (−0.4) and the hourglass could be replaced with another container or talisman (−0.5). Rounds to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry is the story's anchor: it materializes at 11:47, exists "between parallel worlds," and becomes "eternal" through Marcus's convergence. It shapes stakes (passengers seeking alternate timelines) and the setting. The ferry's "coherence" loss and Marcus's deckhand duties create ongoing pressure. Touches: opening, grotto approach, woman boarding, convergence, eternal resolution. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (passengers' destinations depend on ferry's liminal state) +1.0, closure linkage (ferry becomes permanent bridge) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6 = strong integration. Summary in middle beats −0.3. Score 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is labeled in one sentence ("his resiliently positive nature undimmed") but never tested. No on-page moment shows Marcus choosing optimism when despair would be easier, nor does positivity constrain his tactics or cost him something. The trait is ornamental—remove it and the convergence sequence plays identically. Mentioned once (para 5), absent from climax. Late mention −0.2, label-only −0.6, no causal work −0.8. Caps at 3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Marcus radios the captain (static answer) early, then radios "all hands" across timelines to initiate convergence. The second radio call is the convergence trigger. However, the action is interchangeable with any communication method (shout, signal, mental link) and the radio's properties (frequencies, static, patterns) don't shape the attempt. Touches: early static call, convergence trigger. Two beats +0.9, convergence involvement +0.5, but swappability −0.8, late first plot-relevant use −0.3. Caps near 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" appears in the captain communication sentence ("messages threading through the cosmic weave") and is implied in the convergence ("timelines began to braid together"). The method is gestural—we see results (merging) but not how Marcus reads or manipulates patterns. The hourglass release and "all hands" call could work without the pattern mechanic. Mentioned early +0.3, two beats +0.9, but summary-only execution −0.8, swappability −0.7. Caps at 4.6 for missing concrete middle use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto appears when the ferry approaches, provides the boarding location for the woman, and "solidified" at convergence ("no longer caught between states"). Starlight intensifies to reveal parallel selves. The setting charges the convergence image and offers a concrete visual for timeline merging. Touches: approach, woman boarding, convergence climax. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (limestone phasing, starlight spelling stories) +0.6. However, the grotto doesn't constrain Marcus's tactics (−0.4) and could be replaced with another liminal locale (−0.5). Score 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways and time folds into itself" appears in the opening and frames the ferry's existence. Marcus notes "Time meant nothing when you worked a vanishing commuter ferry." The ending references "dawn approached sideways." However, the timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical—no on-page beat shows Marcus racing a clock or time pressure altering his convergence plan. Touches: opening frame, Marcus reflection (para 3), ending image. Three touches +1.4, early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.4, but no causal pressure (time doesn't narrow options) −1.0, decorative −0.5. Score 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's goal—to merge parallel timelines—is stated in paragraph 10 ("This was why he'd remained resiliently positive… gathering the tools to merge parallel timelines"). He acts on it by initiating convergence. However, the desire is declared in summary rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a moment where merging costs him an alternative. No friction between merger and, say, preserving his own singular timeline or escaping deckhand duty. Touches: declaration (para 10), convergence action (para 12–13). Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but told-only with no on-page friction −1.0, late first clear statement −0.4. Score 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is embodied in the ferry's nature (vanishing nightly yet recurring), Marcus's role ("three years—or was it thirty?"), and the ending ("permanent in its transience"). The tone is wistful and lyric, held across beats: "infinite moments suspended between never and always," "eternal… perpetual journey." At convergence, the tone shifts slightly to triumphant ("now-eternal *Meridian Passage*") but the paradox persists. The final compass image ("pointed to now—every now, always now, forever now") charges the tone with recursion. Touches: opening, Marcus reflection, convergence, ending. Four beats +1.4, early signal +0.8, closure charge +1.0, coherence +0.5, modulation under pressure +0.3. Minor static mood in middle −0.2. Score 6.2.</comment>
