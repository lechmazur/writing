<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to find her dog opens clearly but her interior journey from fear-of-letting-go to openness feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The metaphorical dog as "unleashed joy" arrives without prior dramatized contradiction between holding on and releasing. Embodied emotion is present ("calling his name until her voice went hoarse") but the final transformation lacks visible cost: she simply "knew how to open" without forfeiting a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the ridgeway setting and ferry premise are legible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: mist, limestone, water imagery recur and the ticket punch marks a symbolic passage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Marina steps onto shore "no longer needing any leash at all"—but the cost is metaphorical only. No on-page choice or forfeiture is dramatized; the reweighting happens by assertion in the final paragraphs rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, limestone spine, and twilight water are vivid and consistent; the brass ticket punch and the star-shaped holes provide concrete touchstones. Spatial choreography across the boat journey is clear. The setting charges the final image when Marina follows "star-shaped light leaking through her ticket," satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain or charge closure. Minor: the "shore that was somehow also the place where she'd started" briefly blurs spatial logic but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marina's need to let go of control—is signaled early and coheres through the journey. Pressure tightens in the confession beat ("I was never brave enough to let him run free") and the guide's response with the star punch. However, no on-page reversal or live choice narrows Marina's options: the ferry guides steer the journey, the ticket is punched without her decision, and she arrives at the far shore without agency. The resolution feels delivered rather than earned by protagonist action under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of release versus control emerges through particulars: the snapped leash, the blank ticket, the star-shaped puncture. The final image—"fingers that knew how to open, a heart punched through with star-shaped spaces"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The guides' chorus ("unused courage waits in the spaces we create when we stop gripping") borders on thematic echo but stays anchored to action. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, especially the blank ticket transforming into proof of passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "limestone spine where mist clung like unspoken prayers," "shoreline lullaby quality, soothing and eternal." Purposeful compression and patterned diction (the ferry guides' refrains) teach the reader the piece's textural method. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marina notices the leash, the treats, the brass punch. Minor: "gently persistent rhythm" and "shoreline lullaby quality" describe the guides' voices in near-identical register, flattening voice distinction slightly, but the effect remains coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense: "limestone teeth," "water whispered names," "courage sleeps in its unused corners." In the peak confession beat and closure, metaphor density approaches saturation without pattern-teaching payoff ("star-shaped spaces where light could finally enter" stacks with "leaking through her ticket" within two lines). High information density overall, but the closure image relies on repeated star/light/space imagery that blurs into symbolic convenience rather than sharpening causal pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ferry-as-threshold and the allegorical dog offer a recognizable template (Charon, liminal passage) given fresh texture through the veiled ridgeway, the star punch, and the blank ticket. The ending's synthesis—proof of passage as a punched-through heart—feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc (learning to let go) does not transform the familiar premise through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation is present but does not fully elevate the familiar structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ferry guides signal the journey's rules, present the ticket punch, and speak refrains that shape Marina's realization. They appear in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and speak in at least two distinct beats. However, they do not make a choice that alters Marina's tactics; they observe and facilitate. Their wisdom is told ("We've been expecting someone," "Your vigil begins now") rather than demonstrated through a decision with cost. Functional but replaceable with similar facilitator figures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears in setup (the guide holds it), mid-journey (the woman touches it to Marina's blank ticket, creating star-shaped light), and closure (Marina follows the star-shaped light home). It shapes two beats and charges the final image. The star-shaped puncture becomes proof of passage and opens her heart metaphorically. However, the punch's mechanics do not constrain Marina's choice—she does not wield it or forfeit anything to receive its mark. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vigil-in-twilight concept frames the entire journey: the guides wait at twilight, the boat moves only at twilight, the stars begin their vigil overhead, and Marina's own vigil culminates in passage. It shapes stakes (courage "sleeps in its unused corners, waiting to be found") and tactics (the crossing happens only at this threshold time). The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the closure when Marina's vigil finds its morning. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" describes the guides' voices and manner in two beats: the first guide's "gently persistent rhythm as waves against shingle" and the woman's "shoreline lullaby quality." It colors tone but does not constrain or enable an action with cost. The trait is label-only in the opening and reappears as thematic texture in the middle without altering Marina's options. Functional presence across beats but no on-page tradeoff tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears in the title beat ("We traverse these waters only at twilight"), governs the boat journey across the hidden lake, and recurs in the closure ("Marina followed... traversing the path back"). The action is the story's spine: Marina's literal crossing enables her metaphorical passage. Removing "traverse" and substituting "cross" or "travel" would weaken the specificity but not break the structure. However, the traverse shapes two major beats and the closure line, and its reweighted return charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Indirect routes" is signaled in setup ("following pawprints that led her through indirect routes she'd never noticed before") and returns in closure ("the dog... showing her the indirect routes home"). It does not shape a middle choice or constrain Marina's tactics during the crossing; the guides steer the boat. The method frames expectation and charges the final image through reprise, qualifying as lyric resonance. Two gates (setup, closure) with reweighted meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is named in the opening line, serves as the dock location, and reappears in closure as "every threshold she'd stood before, afraid to cross." The setting provides the hidden lake, the limestone teeth, and the stone arches that the boat must navigate. It pressures Marina's emotional state (mist clings like unspoken prayers) and charges the final image when the ridgeway reveals itself as metaphorical threshold. Strong specificity and closure linkage; the ridgeway is essential to the story's metaphysical logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the leash breaks" is established in the second paragraph and opens Marina's pursuit. Twilight governs the crossing ("We traverse these waters only at twilight"). However, the leash-break does not tighten decisions during the journey; Marina boards the boat without time pressure. The timeframe frames the inciting incident but does not create a live clock that alters tactics. Functional setup with thematic resonance but no middle or closure pressure tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is seeded when she confesses her fear ("I was never brave enough to let him run free") and resolved when she finds "courage she'd kept unused for far too long." The desire is dramatized in the confession beat with embodied regret. However, the friction between wanting courage and the cost of claiming it is told rather than enacted: Marina does not choose to let go on the page; the guides deliver the transformation. Two gates (middle, closure) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" tone is established through the first guide's "gently persistent rhythm as waves against shingle," maintained in the guides' working song ("their voices braiding together like mist and limestone"), and charges the final image as Marina follows "the indirect routes home" with newly opened fingers. Tone modulates under pressure during the confession beat, then resolves to calm at closure. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and inseparable from the story's textural method. Strong across all three gates.</comment>
