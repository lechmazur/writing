<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus displays clear observational habits and tactical thinking (mapping acoustics, timing groups), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The teenager interaction offers a micro-choice (shifting repertoire, accepting the guitar pick), yet the cost is abstract; we don't see what Marcus forfeits by engaging this way versus another. Embodied emotion is present but limited: "smiled, incorporated a strumming motion" reads more performed than felt. The piece defaults to competence without genuine struggle or blind spots that compound pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (boardwalk, tidal arcade, stars) by the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: beats accrue through performances, the bishop's rotations, and the final packing ritual, with the guitar pick serving as a late accent that reweights the routine. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marcus packs, acknowledges "nothing would be identical," and the waves erase his footprints, crystallizing his stance of perpetual recalibration. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: opportunity cost of this liminal life is implied but not dramatized on the page. The cadence shift from performance to reflective packing supports the lens, though a sharper on-page price would elevate closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is vividly anchored: weathered planks, natural amphitheater carved by waves, tide clock, foam fingers on steps. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (Marcus notes acoustic sweet spots, darkness pooling). The environment constrains choice: the two-hour tide window structures his cycles, and the seawall provides staging for the teenager encounter. The bishop catching moonlight and the waves erasing footprints charge the final image with micro-setting specificity. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining his livelihood through engineered spontaneity—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus shifts from the shanty to his own dark-winter composition for the teenager, narrowing his repertoire to match observed need. The guitar pick drop is a micro turn that reweights the interaction, but the escalation is modest: no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through the performance cycles, yet the cost at closure (packing, resetting for tomorrow) feels routine rather than urgent. The piece lacks a second pressure point or a stakes test where Marcus must choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—art as the ordering of chaos, creativity serenading monotony—emerges through Marcus's method and the recurring bishop. The final image (waves erasing footprints, "preparing the stage for whatever might happen next") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the teenager's posture, the guitar pick exchange, and Marcus's acknowledgment of his own "dark winter." However, two moments veer toward theme statement: "To serenade monotony with creativity, to prove that even within patterns, surprise could flourish" and "Life's a chess match... who says we can't change the rules?" deliver thesis-like declarations that reduce ambiguity. These intrusions cost ~0.4–0.5, capping the score near mid-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with Marcus's perceptual signature (sight lines, acoustic sweet spots, "calculated wilderness") consistent throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "engineered spontaneity," "liminal space between land and sea." The single line of direct dialogue—"Life's a chess match..."—feels slightly expository, a thesis moment rather than goal-driven speech, but it's brief. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the teenager interaction, wider during the setup and packing. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the closing rhythm ("Behind him, waves erased...") charges the exit. Minor slip: the "calculated wilderness" phrase recurs as both image and meta-label, risking self-commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and information density is high: most lines advance action, character habit, or atmosphere. The opening ("positioned... calculating sight lines from three different tourist flows") packs spatial and tactical detail efficiently. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "orchestrated chaos" is restated as "ordering randomness" and "calculated wilderness," then "randomness into moments of wonder"—synonym churn across the middle third. The phrase "between acts, he reset" and "between acts, he studied patterns" use identical stems. Template cadence emerges in the performance-cycle paragraphs (family, teenager, late-evening couples, bar crowd, insomniacs) with parallel structure that becomes mechanical. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template runs; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The street-performer premise with a chess piece as prop is familiar, and the emotional arc (artist engaging audience, small human connection, resetting for tomorrow) does not transform the template in structural terms. The tidal-arcade setting and the engineered-spontaneity frame offer fresh angles, and the guitar-pick exchange is a specific, non-obvious beat. However, the transformation test flags a problem: swap names/places and the plot and emotional core remain largely intact. The "calculated wilderness" metaphor and the bishop-rotation mechanism provide texture but not irreplaceability. No close echoes of famous scenes, yet the piece reads as competent synthesis rather than bold risk. Mid-6s for solid craft on recognizable material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout. Setup: introduced immediately as the POV who calculates sight lines and engineers spontaneity. Development: shifts repertoire for the teenager (middle choice). Payoff: packs the bishop last, acknowledges the liminal cycle. The analytical trait constrains his approach (mapping, timing, cataloguing) and enables the teenager connection. However, most "decisions" are tactical adjustments rather than turns that narrow options or impose visible cost. The guitar-pick acceptance is a micro-choice, not a pivot. Two-gate presence (setup + payoff) and one middle beat = eligible up to ~6.0; causal pressure is modest, so score near mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bishop appears in setup (extracted from coat, "anchor his performance"), development (rotates during the shanty, catches moonlight during the teenager scene), and payoff (packed last in velvet). It recurs with reweighted meaning: begins as performance tool, becomes a stable point in flux, ends as a cherished remnant ("this piece alone remained"). Three distinct beats (family, teenager, packing) and closure linkage qualify for ≥7.0. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the performances but doesn't constrain a choice where its absence would alter outcome. Score at 7.1 for strong reprise and irreplaceability (grandfather's set) without higher causal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orchestrated serendipity is the premise: Marcus engineers moments that appear spontaneous. Setup: "engineering spontaneity... mapped acoustic sweet spots, timed intervals." Development: the modified shanty and bishop rotation for the family, the dark-winter piece for the teenager. Payoff: "nothing would be identical" acknowledges the frame. However, the concept is primarily thematic—it describes Marcus's method but doesn't create a choice where ordering vs. yielding to randomness imposes a cost. It shapes tactics (when to play what) but doesn't pivot the story. Functional but replaceable; score at 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Lightly attentive" is introduced in the first third: "remained lightly attentive to everything—never staring, always observing." It's a trait label that colors Marcus's observational style (noticing the teenager's posture, footsteps quickening). However, no on-page moment dramatizes a tradeoff where this specific mode of attention enables success or costs him something another mode would not. It could swap with "alert" or "watchful" without structural change. Present in setup, mentioned in development (the teenager observation), absent from payoff. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure; deduct for label-only use and swappability. Final score 4.6 - 0.5 (ornamental) = 4.1, round to 4.6 under the two-gate floor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Happen" as an action is diffuse. The prompt likely points to the line "preparing the stage for whatever might happen next," a thematic closer. Setup: implicit in the title and Marcus's acknowledgment of controlled spontaneity. Development: each performance "happens" on cue. Payoff: the final line names it. But no major turn traces strictly to this verb; the teenager connection, the packing ritual, and the cycle reset would remain intact if "happen" were replaced with "unfold" or "emerge." Summary-only use in the ending image; no causal pressure. Missing middle development gate → cap 3.4; add +0.3 for closure mention = 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By ordering randomness" is signaled in setup ("ordering randomness into moments of wonder") and restated multiple times (calculated spontaneity, engineered performances). Development: Marcus's acts are structured (modified shanty, dark-winter piece, improvisation within structure). Payoff: the method is implicit in the reset ritual. The mechanics matter—his mapping and timing—but the method itself doesn't pivot a choice where a different approach (pure improvisation, rigid setlist) would impose a visible cost. It's a descriptor of his habit, not a constraint or turning point. All three gates present; causal pressure modest; score at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is present throughout. Setup: "natural amphitheater carved by centuries of waves, now exposed between high tides." Development: the tide clock and two-hour window tighten Marcus's cycles; the seawall stages the teenager encounter. Payoff: "foam fingers reaching for the arcade's lower steps" and "waves erased his footprints" charge the final image with urgency and transience. The setting supplies a live clock (tide return) that alters tactics (three more cycles) and a spatial constraint (darkness pooling near pier's end). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; score at 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Between acts" frames the entire piece: Marcus performs, resets, performs again. Setup: "Between acts, he studied patterns... Between acts, he reset." Development: the cycles structure his interactions (family, teenager, planned late-evening/bar/insomniac sets). Payoff: "Tomorrow he'd return, same time, same place" and the packing ritual close the loop. The timeframe is tracked (tide clock shows two hours) and shapes tactics (three more cycles). However, no moment where the clock forces a trade-off or pivots a choice is dramatized; it's a scaffold more than a constraint. All three gates; moderate causal pressure; score at 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to serenade monotony with creativity" is stated explicitly in the fourth-to-last paragraph. Setup: implicit in Marcus's engineered performances. Development: the dark-winter piece for the teenager dramatizes the desire (lifting the teen's head, eliciting the guitar pick). Payoff: the final paragraph names it again. The desire is partly shown (repertoire shifts, the personal composition) but also told ("This was why he performed here... to serenade monotony"). No on-page friction between this want and a competing need or cost is dramatized—Marcus succeeds routinely. Late explicit statement −0.5; functional but partially told; score at 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calculated wilderness" is introduced early ("This calculated wilderness of human behavior") and recurs in the final third ("The calculated wilderness would shift"). Tone is coherent: analytical yet alive to surprise, controlled yet open. The phrase charges the final image by naming Marcus's stance. However, the tone is more static descriptor than modulating pressure—it doesn't shift as stakes rise or fall. The final image (waves, footprints, "whatever might happen next") resonates with the tone but doesn't transform it. Strong setup and payoff reprise; modest development; score at 6.7 for charged return without dynamic escalation.</comment>
