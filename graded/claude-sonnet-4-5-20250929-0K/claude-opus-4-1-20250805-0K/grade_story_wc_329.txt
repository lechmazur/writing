<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority operates through embodied perception—the locust shell stirring "something in her chest," fingers "finding notes that shouldn't exist." Her motivation to reawaken beauty drives concrete choices: mapping buried rhythms for weeks, calibrating melody to ghost-rhythms. However, the final paragraph's "playing herself empty, becoming the shell another's freedom might require" edges toward abstract self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis. The statues' awakening is dramatized through physical breakdown (gears grinding, clockwork shattering), but their interior shifts remain largely asserted rather than shown through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: sky-bridge, violin, statues below, locust shell discovered three dawns ago. The causal chain is clear—Lira maps rhythms, plays them, statues respond, orchard awakens—with escalation from first falter to widespread transformation. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: "playing herself empty" as the orchard blooms and enforcement squadrons approach, a Charged Poise that crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first statue's heart shatters and others follow. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements (recurring locust-shell imagery charges the ending). Minor tension: the seed pressed into her hand feels like a symbolic convenience rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sky-bridge's "iron lattice work humming with industrial frequencies" and "rivets" ground the opening. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Lira's tactical choice (she studied it, holds it to light, weaves its memory into playing). Trees "welded into productive angles," "harvest-optimization devices," and "compacted growing grids" create a vivid mechanized orchard whose physical constraints the music then breaks. Spatial choreography is clean: statues patrol below, one approaches the bridge's base, the eldest climbs toward her. The bridge's metal bones resonate with her music, making setting an active participant in the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: initially selective (wind through metal), expanding as transformation spreads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical enforcement—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Lira's playing causes the first statue to falter, then others stop, then clockwork hearts shatter, culminating in the orchard's chaotic bloom. The cost is legible: enforcement squadrons approach, and Lira must "play herself empty," forecloses safety for transformation. One meaningful tightening when the first heart shatters raises immediate stakes. The seed and trees uprooting add tactical resources but don't resolve—the enforcement threat remains. Agency is clear throughout: Lira's weeks of preparation and active performance drive every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of metamorphosis and liberation emerges through concrete particulars: the locust shell as literal abandoned perfection, statues breaking free from clockwork, trees uprooting themselves. The recurring image of the shell shifts meaning from static object (first mention) to active metaphor at closure ("becoming the shell another's freedom might require"). No overt moralizing; the ending resists tidy resolution—enforcement approaches even as transformation succeeds. "Beauty that served no purpose except its own existence" and "efficiency became scripture" embed thematic weight in world-building rather than assertion. The final image offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: transformation requires self-emptying, a cost made concrete through Lira's continuous playing under threat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Lira; perceptual signature is consistent (musician's attention to rhythm, melody, resonance). Diction elevates purposefully: "metronomic time," "ghost-rhythms," "imperfection's grace" fit a musician-narrator. However, several phrases push into purple territory without sufficient voice anchoring: "tarnished wonder caught fire in her strings," "summers of metamorphosis" as direct interiority feels over-articulated. The final paragraph's meta-commentary—"Some transformations...could only happen when you played yourself empty"—reads as authorial intrusion rather than character thought mid-performance. Psychic distance widens at the end without clear motivation, breaking the tight focalization maintained earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well in action beats ("The first statue faltered. Its head tilted..."). Strong verbs anchor key moments: "shattered," "groaned," "writhed." However, paraphrase loops appear: "began to remember" / "beginning to sing again"; "clockwork hearts" repeated across adjacent paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence in the climax: "She played the shell's hollow architecture, its abandoned perfection, its proof..." stacks three parallel possessives without variation. Figurative density escalates in final paragraphs—"fire in her strings," "gap between knowing and understanding," "played herself empty"—blurring clarity at the closure beat. The metaphor "playing the gap" in the final line feels abstract rather than concrete. Minor filter-verb stack: "began to remember," "began to crack," "began to sing" within three paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—music breaking mechanical control by accessing buried organic hearts—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar rebellion/awakening tropes. The locust shell as both literal object and transformation metaphor feels specific and earned, not ornamental. However, the "beauty versus efficiency" framework and musician-as-liberator read as recognizable YA/allegory templates. Transformation through music targeting hidden "real hearts" beneath machinery is executed with care but doesn't fully escape its archetypal scaffolding. The orchard's agency (trees walking, singing) and the seed-gift add specificity. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric-leaning structure and the open ending with enforcement approaching elevate the piece above median execution. The final image's resonance justifies a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira appears immediately, frames the story, and drives all major turns: positioning herself, drawing the bow, weaving memory into playing, playing harder, closing her eyes as closure crystallizes. Her weeks of preparation (mapping rhythms) enable the climactic action. She receives the seed and holds it as transformation spreads. Three gates met: setup (paragraph 1), development (multiple beats where her playing alters statue behavior), payoff (final paragraph where she "played on" as transformation completes). Her active choices narrow options and raise cost throughout. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locust shell appears in paragraph 2 (discovered three dawns ago, held to light). It returns with reweighted meaning in paragraph 9 ("played the locust's escape from its shell, the moment of splitting") and implicitly in the final paragraph ("becoming the shell another's freedom might require"). Three touches across setup, middle transformation beat, and closure metaphor. The shell's specific property—proof that "leaving something behind could be liberation"—enables Lira's thematic choice. However, it is not physically handled after the opening; middle and final uses are metaphorical extensions. Setup and payoff gates clear; development gate is conceptual rather than tactile, limiting score. Still, the lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure with felt cost, reaching mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes stakes explicitly: statues breaking from clockwork, orchard breaking from grids, Lira playing transformation music. It drives tactics—her weeks mapping buried rhythms to enable breakage, her choice to play despite approaching enforcement. The concept appears in every escalation beat: "clockwork hearts stuttered," "hearts breaking like shells," "trees beginning to uproot themselves." Closure crystallizes around it: "all breaking free begins" in the gap Lira plays. The concept is not merely thematic; it alters on-page options (statues move fluidly, trees walk) and forecloses Lira's safety. Setup (paragraph 1 context), development (paragraphs 6–11 escalation), payoff (final line). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" appears once in paragraph 4: "The first note emerged resonantly soft, barely distinguishable from wind through metal." It enables the tactic of stealth—music that doesn't immediately alert enforcement—and carries thematic weight (softness with power). However, it does not recur or visibly constrain later choices; Lira "played harder" in paragraph 9 without cost tied to abandoning softness. Single beat involvement (the opening note's effect on the nearest statue). Setup gate met (paragraph 4), development arguable (if the soft start is necessary for statues to hear it as non-threat), payoff absent (not present in or shaping the ending). Swappable with "quiet" or "gentle" in most edits. Functional but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Uproot" drives the middle escalation and closure: trees "began to uproot themselves from their assigned positions" (paragraph 11), "trees walking on root-legs, seeking their own light" (paragraph 12), "orchard writhed into new configurations" (paragraph 11). The action redefines the orchard's agency and visibly alters the tactical situation (living statues gain allies, enforcement faces mobile terrain). It is causally triggered by Lira's music and charges the final image of blooming chaos. Setup implied (paragraph 2: trees in "productive angles"), development (paragraph 11 first uproot), payoff (paragraph 12 trees walking, final paragraph orchard bloom). Three beats, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage. Irreplaceable—"uproot" is both literal and thematically tied to breaking free from assigned roles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is signaled in paragraph 3: Lira "spent weeks mapping their buried rhythms, learning to translate heartbeats into melody." It shapes her preparation and enables the climactic tactic in paragraph 6: "each phrase calibrated to match the ghost-rhythms she'd memorized, signaling through heart rhythms that transcended mechanical language." The method matters: it explains why her music works when others' might not. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how rhythms are detected, translated, and signaled is told rather than shown. Two beats (preparation in paragraph 3, application in paragraph 6), but the method does not evolve or face a test that forces her to adapt it. Setup and development gates clear; payoff indirect (the method's success is assumed in the ending). Causal role present but execution is summary-heavy, limiting upper score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard policed by living statues is introduced immediately and pressures every choice. Statues patrol in "calculated patterns" (paragraph 3), forcing Lira to time her playing. The orchard's mechanization (welded branches, optimization devices, compacted grids) supplies the physical constraints Lira's music must overcome. The sky-bridge provides elevation and acoustic resonance (metal bones amplify her playing). As the orchard awakens, it becomes an active participant: trees shiver, groan, crack the ground, walk on root-legs. The setting evolves causally and charges the final image ("orchard bloomed in chaos"). Setup (paragraphs 1–2), development (paragraphs 7–8 trees respond, 10–11 uproot), payoff (paragraphs 12–14 orchard in motion). Three gates, strong causal pressure, irreplaceable—remove the statues or orchard and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "gap between knowing what she must do and understanding what it would cost" is named in paragraph 4 and reprised in the final line: "the gap between knowing and understanding, where all breaking free begins." This frames the story's dramatic question and charges the ending. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—Lira's action unfolds in continuous real-time once she begins playing, with no clock or countdown pressuring her mid-performance. The approaching enforcement squadrons (paragraph 12) introduce a future constraint but don't alter tactics within the scene. Setup (paragraph 4), payoff (final line); development gate weak (the gap is thematic rather than a live temporal pressure during escalation). Lyric reprise reweights the stake, but lacks mid-scene mechanical force. Score reflects strong bookend resonance with limited tactical involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is dramatized through her weeks of preparation (paragraph 3), her decision to play despite enforcement threat (paragraph 4), and her sustained performance as squadrons approach (paragraph 12). Internal friction appears when she recognizes "what it would cost" but plays anyway, forecloses safety for transformation. The motivation is tested: she must "play herself empty," a visible price. It shapes tactics (calibrating melody to ghost-rhythms, playing notes "that shouldn't exist") and drives the climax. Setup (paragraphs 2–3 context of lost beauty), development (paragraphs 4–9 playing despite risk), payoff (paragraphs 13–14 cost and transformation realized). Three gates, strong causal pressure, cost legible. Not merely told; Lira's choices embody the desire with on-page consequences.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" coheres across the story: the orchard once bore "fruit that sang" (paragraph 2), now retrofitted with optimization devices; guardian spirits became "enforcement automatons" (paragraph 1); beauty declared "inefficient" (paragraph 2). Tone modulates with pressure—initially restrained and observational, escalating to "world's tarnished wonder caught fire in her strings" (paragraph 13). The final image charges the tone: "orchard bloomed in chaos," "statues danced," Lira playing "the gap between knowing and understanding." However, "tarnished wonder" as a phrase never appears on the page; the tone is enacted through contrasts (iron lattice vs. locust shell translucence, clockwork vs. heartbeat) rather than labeled. Setup (paragraphs 1–2), development (paragraphs 6–11 tension between mechanical and organic), payoff (final paragraph synthesis). Coherent and purposeful, but the exact phrase's absence and some purple inflation in closure beats ("fire in her strings") limit top score.</comment>
