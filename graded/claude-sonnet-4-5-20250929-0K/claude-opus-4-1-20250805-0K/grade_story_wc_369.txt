<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus shows interiority through embodied sensory detail (tingling moonlight, weathered hands) and his thirty-year maintenance history provides grounded motivation. The arc from dutiful caretaker to intentional transformer emerges through concrete choices—disassembling, realigning, installing—but the final understanding ("maintenance means transformation") edges toward articulated epiphany rather than fully dramatized realization. Internal contradiction is present in his decades of routine versus sudden insight, though the moonlight healing trait remains more label than lived constraint that shapes on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Marcus, tower, storm-knocked power). The closure—Marcus installing the deconstructed sextant to create new moonlit passages—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation of the labyrinth's purpose) with conceptual cost visible in the shift from preservation to transformation. Causality holds through discovery→understanding→action, though the astronomer's encoded grief and Marcus's sudden comprehension of the labyrinth's true purpose arrive somewhat conveniently. One meaningful deepening occurs when scattered light reveals hidden pathways in calculations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm-lit tower with broken dome, moonlight streaming through, and the labyrinth's mathematical carvings create a vivid, specific environment. Micro-setting excels: the sextant's mirrors projecting fragments, the ivy growing through the dome, and spatial choreography (spiral stairs, central chamber, observation deck) remains clean. The broken instrument becomes a tool that constrains and enables Marcus's final choice—realigning it to catch maximum moonlight—charging the closure image with the interplay of reflected light and shadow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the labyrinth's true purpose, signaled early through Marcus's maintenance role and deepened when the broken sextant reveals hidden patterns. Pressure escalates through accumulation: discovery of encoded grief → translation of microscopic notations → the pin-drop silence moment → comprehension of the labyrinth as "machine for processing sorrow." Marcus's agency drives the resolution (deconstruction and realignment), with the cost being transformation of his role from preserver to innovator. The storm provides external pressure but remains somewhat decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as navigable mathematics, transformation versus preservation—emerges organically from the astronomer's encoded sorrow and Marcus's realization. The sextant's shift from measuring celestial angles to mapping "the space between loss and understanding" avoids didacticism. Subtext operates well in the trees-witnessing motif (photosynthesis as patient survival math) and the final image of broken instruments measuring "most precisely." Minor slip: "maintenance means more than preservation—it means transformation" states the theme too directly, though it's partially redeemed by the concrete preceding action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and Marcus's perceptual signature (maintenance worker noticing mechanisms, moonlight's effect on his body). Voice carries distinct texture through selective technical detail ("index mirror, horizon glass, graduated arc") and the measured, contemplative register fits the character. Some filter verbs ("felt the weight," "heard it then") dull immediacy in peak moments, and the elevated register in reflective passages ("aggregate map of human searching") occasionally drifts from a maintenance worker's likely lexicon, though it could read as earned wisdom from decades of observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows strong specificity ("index mirror, the horizon glass, the graduated arc") and purposeful rhythm in the deconstructing sequence. However, several passages loop conceptually: the labyrinth as sorrow-processor is restated in multiple registers ("machine for processing sorrow," "quantified sorrow," "solving for x where x equals the weight of absence"). Template openings appear in adjacent paragraphs ("Marcus…," "The sextant…," "He…") without pattern-taught purpose. Minor simultaneity error: "By dawn, Marcus had installed" compresses complex work into summary rather than showing key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical precision and grief measurement through a broken sextant offers a fresh angle, and the labyrinth as accumulative sorrow-map rather than solvable puzzle transforms familiar material. The trees-witnessing motif (seasons as heartbeats, growth rings as survived hardships) provides unexpected philosophical depth. Risk: the accumulative, lyric structure and moonlight-healing attribute could feel ornamental, but they're threaded through action. Slight derivative pressure from the "wise maintenance worker discovers hidden meaning" template, though the mathematical encoding of grief and the specific reconception of brokenness as precision elevate it beyond stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus's maintenance role frames the story and his choices drive key turns: picking up the sextant, deconstrustructing it, realigning the pieces, installing them throughout the labyrinth. Present early (opening line), develops through middle investigation, and shapes closure. The character's occupation directly enables the plot and his decades of experience make the transformation credible. Not fully indispensable—another observatory worker could perform similar actions—but the integration is strong across all three gates with causal pressure at multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken sextant appears in paragraph two, drives the discovery beat when its mirrors project fragments, is handled and deconstructed in detail (index mirror, horizon glass, graduated arc enumerated), and is physically reassembled and installed by closure. It enables the plot (reveals hidden carvings), constrains Marcus's approach (must work with broken pieces), and its transformation from measuring instrument to grief-mapper charges the final image. The object's specific properties (mirrors, graduated arc, microscopic notations) are irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow appears as the astronomer's encoded grief in angles and equations, the labyrinth as "machine for processing sorrow," and "solving for x where x equals the weight of absence." It shapes the thematic stakes and Marcus's understanding, but operates more as conceptual backdrop than tactical constraint—Marcus's choices aren't narrowed by the mathematics themselves. Present in setup (astronomer's loss encoded), developed in middle (diary entries in mathematical notation), and echoed at closure (new passages of light through quantified sorrow). Lyric reprise reweights the premise but doesn't force on-page trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is mentioned twice: "familiar tingling began—old cuts sealing, arthritis retreating" and the closing reflection "In moonlight, everything heals." It provides atmospheric texture and thematic resonance but doesn't constrain or enable a key choice—Marcus would perform the same actions regardless. The attribute doesn't create visible cost or force trade-offs. Present early and reprised at closure, but its function is ornamental rather than causal. Missing middle development where the healing trait would alter tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" appears explicitly when Marcus "began to deconstruct the sextant, laying each piece on the dusty floor" and again at closure: "deconstructed sextant throughout the labyrinth." This action is the story's fulcrum—it reveals the microscopic notations, enables the new understanding, and makes the transformation possible. Not easily swappable; merely examining or moving the sextant wouldn't unlock its secrets. The action reshapes the instrument's purpose from measurement to mapping grief. Strong causal pressure with closure participation, though it could be slightly more foregrounded in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" does not appear on the page. The story shows mapping of light fragments, calculations, and grief patterns, but not dreams. The sextant's mirrors map "fragments across the walls," "pathways," "shadows of leaves," creating "new passages of light," but the dream element is absent. If we interpret "dreams" metaphorically as aspirations or the astronomer's lost future, it remains implicit rather than dramatized. The method described is closer to "mapping scattered light" or "mapping encoded grief." Missing setup as specified; cannot score for an element not present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Storm and moonlight are present throughout: storm knocks out power (inciting incident), lightning flashes illuminate, moonlight enables the healing and reveals the sextant's notations, thunder marks the silence moment, and dawn concludes the action. The tower's broken dome channels moonlight purposefully. The setting provides the conditions for discovery (no electric light forces reliance on moon) and the moonlight specifically enables Marcus to read the microscopic etchings. Strong setup and development; the stormlit/moonlit contrast charges multiple beats and is present at closure when ivy grows through the broken dome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor" appears literally: "he heard it then—a pin dropping in the assistant astronomer's old quarters, the sound impossibly clear. Time seemed to pause, the storm holding its breath." However, this moment doesn't tighten decisions or create time pressure—it's a marker of realization rather than a deadline. The pin-drop creates atmosphere and signals Marcus's shift in understanding but doesn't constrain his choices or force urgency. Present in middle third as punctuation for comprehension but doesn't drive escalation. The overnight timeframe (storm to dawn) provides loose structure but no tactical clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" appears when Marcus translates an equation: "'She asked what trees see,' one equation translated. 'I couldn't answer.'" This becomes thematic material—trees witness "time differently," with "sorrow as growth rings"—and is reprised in the closing image of ivy and trees whispering "calculations older than numbers." However, it's the astronomer's daughter's question and the astronomer's failure, not Marcus's active motivation. Marcus's dramatized goal is to understand the labyrinth's purpose and repair/transform it. The tree-witnessing operates as discovered theme rather than driving want. Present but attributed to absent characters; not Marcus's on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mundane miracles—moonlight healing, broken instruments measuring precisely, maintenance as transformation, ordinary ivy carrying "slow pulse," equations whispering—pervades the piece. The tone balances technical detail (sextant parts, mathematical notation) with wonder (impossibly clear pin drop, light revealing hidden patterns) without tipping into fantasy. It modulates: workmanlike in the opening descent, contemplative during discovery, quietly transcendent at closure ("not back to what was, but forward to what might be"). The final image of patient, breathing trees grounds the miraculous in naturalistic observation. Coherent across beats and charges the ending effectively.</comment>
