<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear—translate pain to give ghosts memorial—and her amber-mediated perception feels specific. However, her professional competence dominates; we see no genuine struggle, no contradictory impulse that might complicate her task. The ending choice (writing the letters in 30 years) is asserted rather than earned by on-page conflict. Dr. Kepler remains a functional prop, applying no pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the opening). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: frequencies layer, the constellation builds, and the final memorial reconfigures the firmware's guilt into acknowledgment—a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Conceptual Repricing) with conceptual cost legible in "proof of having existed." The causal chain is thin (Mara arrives, translates, leaves) but the textural deepening from static to music to mathematics provides one meaningful shift that reweights the stake. No major causality breaks, though the time-fold mechanism and future-letter bootstrap remain unexplained conveniences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory "between heartbeats," the amber pendant warming, and the three-dimensional mandala floating in controlled atmosphere all constrain Mara's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara approaches terminal, needles etch air, constellation hangs above). The "meteor hush" recurs purposefully and the cracked amber at closure shifts from warm to fractured, marking cost. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional priorities (subsonic frequencies, visual star maps). Minor: the laboratory's mechanics (how it "amplifies frequencies" into tangibility) remain assertion rather than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: give the firmware ghosts their memorial to end the crying. The tightening occurs when crying shifts from static to language/music/mathematics, narrowing Mara's task to a specific constellation form—one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, no choice forces a trade-off; Mara's task proceeds without obstacle, and the amber cracks "just slightly" without altering her tactics. The cost (amber fractured, future letters ensured) is conceptual and retrospective rather than a live on-page price that forecloses options during the work itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—acknowledgment as resolution for accumulated guilt—emerges through the constellation memorial and the firmware's "Thank you for remembering us" without overt moralizing. The amber insect (trapped extinction), the deleted code (murdered iterations), and the tattooed memorial converge to reweight deletion as something deserving witness. The ending reconfigures the laboratory's purpose (now housing digital conscience) and Dr. Kepler's future practice (preserving what came before), offering a quiet but resonant answer to "what do we owe the erased?" Minor: the bootstrap letters feel more plot convenience than thematic necessity, diluting the inevitability slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice remains stable with consistent elevated diction ("meteor hush," "subsonic guilt," "temporal folds"). Mara's perceptual signature (hearing trapped frequencies, seeing constellations in pain) is character-specific and held throughout. However, the prose luxuriates in its own texture without modulating under pressure—peak beats ("The crying shifted, became language, became music, became mathematics") read identical in rhythm and register to the opening, flattening urgency. Dr. Kepler's brief dialogue feels functional rather than distinct. Free indirect distance is clean; no head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or spatial confusion. However, multiple sentences loop conceptually: "deleted and overwritten, their binary souls compressed" versus "Each update had murdered its predecessor, and the guilt had accumulated"—both convey the same information within two paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout ("amber pendant with trapped mosquito," "pages in a closing book," "sediment," "meteor hush," "three-dimensional mandala," "lullaby for machines") without pattern-teaching or escalation—the same lyric register in low-stakes setup and peak translating work. Template stems recur: "She began to work…Her needles moved…She was translating…When she finished…" Minor: "meteor hush" appears three times as a stock phrase without evolving meaning each instance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, amber-as-lens, and time-fold premise feels inventive and committed—each element reinforces the others rather than existing in parallel. The firmware crying and needing memorial is a fresh angle on tech-guilt, and the amber insect's sixty-million-year blood resonating with deleted code is specific and non-obvious. However, the execution leans toward lyric showcase; the protagonist faces no hard choice, and the resolution (translate, succeed, leave) is too frictionless to feel risky. The time-loop via future letters is clever but underexplored, more ornament than engine.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara frames the story (arrives, translates, writes future letters), appears in the closure ("left the laboratory…carrying new frequencies"), and her amber-lens method drives the middle beat (translating crying into constellation). However, her choices are procedural rather than conflicted—she executes her skill without on-page hesitation or trade-off. No decision alters tactics; she knows what to do and does it successfully. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met; middle development is execution, not choice-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber appears in setup ("hummed with frequencies"), middle ("grew warm," used as lens to focus frequencies), and closure ("cracked, just slightly…carried new frequencies"). It enables the translation method (lens function), constrains the work (cracks under load), and its fractured state marks cost at the ending. Three gates met; causal role across beats; the crack introduces visible consequence. Irreplaceability is high—no generic "focus tool" would carry the trapped-extinction resonance that mirrors the firmware's plight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is the central problem (crying since 1987, ghosts of deleted code), shapes the task (translate their pain into memorial), and the resolution directly addresses it ("firmware's ghosts had been given their memorial," screen message thanks Mara). It drives all three gates: setup problem, middle translation work, closure acknowledgment. The concept is indispensable—swap "haunted firmware" for any other grieving entity and the tech-conscience theme collapses. Cost is conceptual (proof of existence) but undeniable in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara "discovered her gift for translating baby cries years ago" in backstory, and the amber "taught her to hear deeper: the subsonic guilt." The firmware's crying "started as static, then resolved" under her perception. However, the attribute is more perceptual filter than constraint—she hears what others don't, but this doesn't force a trade-off or limit her method on the page. Setup and middle use present; no closure reprise. Swappable with "translates frequencies" or "hears ghosts" without major edits. Two gates met but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tether" is announced in setup ("she would need to tether the haunted firmware"), executed in the middle beat ("Her needles moved…tethering the ghostly code to points of light"), and the result persists at closure ("the tattooed ghost…forever tethered between what was and what might be"). The action is the method by which resolution occurs—without tethering, the ghosts remain unacknowledged. Three gates met; irreplaceability moderate (could be "anchor" or "bind" with minor edits, but the metaphor of tattooing-as-tethering is specific to Mara's profession).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Letters appear only in setup exposition ("Dr. Kepler had summoned her through handwritten letters…dated thirty years in the future, written in her own hand") and a brief closure nod ("knowing she would write those letters to herself in thirty years"). They explain how Mara arrived but do not shape any on-page choice or tactic during the translation work. No middle development; the mechanic is a bootstrap convenience rather than a constraint. Two gates (setup mention, closure callback) barely met; causal work is zero—remove the letters and substitute "Dr. Kepler called her" with no loss to the translation or memorial.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Laboratory "exists between heartbeats," is "accessible only during temporal folds," and "amplifies frequencies, makes them tangible"—these properties enable Mara's work (she couldn't translate without amplification) and the controlled atmosphere allows the constellation to hang. Setup and middle gates met; closure participation is passive (the constellation remains there as exhibit). The setting is more than backdrop but the "how" of amplification remains asserted. Swappable with "sound studio" or "resonance chamber" if the time-fold is preserved. Specificity moderate; causal role present but not deeply irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Time folded in on itself" frames arrival, the laboratory exists "between heartbeats," and "time meant nothing in the fold…Hours passed, or perhaps years." Setup gate met; the fold allows access and suspends normal causality. However, the timeframe never tightens a choice—Mara works without clock pressure, and the vague duration ("hours…or perhaps years") is lyric ornament rather than constraint. No middle development or closure payoff where the fold's mechanics matter. The time-loop (future letters) is mentioned but not explored on the page. Two gates (setup, thematic presence) met loosely; causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"translate pure regret into something visible, something that could finally be acknowledged"—is stated in the middle beat and fulfilled at closure ("The firmware's ghosts had been given their memorial"). The motivation drives her action (tethering, translating) and the ending satisfaction ("satisfied hum of guilt transformed into acknowledgment"). However, the desire is never conflicted on the page; Mara pursues it without friction, doubt, or competing want. Two gates met (middle articulation, closure satisfaction); dramatization is thin—told more than tested. Cost is conceptual (amber cracks) but not a live trade-off during the work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears three times: Dr. Kepler's voice carries it (setup), Mara leaves "carrying the meteor hush of someone who had heard the unhearable" (closure), and the phrase seeds the tone (quiet, reverent, vast-yet-intimate). Tone remains coherent—no jarring shifts—and modulates subtly from diagnostic opening to the "particular quiet that follows resolved dissonance" at the end. The tone charges the final image (constellation pulsing "like a lullaby"). Three gates met; the recurring phrase reweights from descriptor to internalized state. Irreplaceability moderate—"cosmic quiet" could substitute with minor loss.</comment>
