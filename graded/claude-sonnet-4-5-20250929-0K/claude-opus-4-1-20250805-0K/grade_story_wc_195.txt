<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aldric's interiority relies heavily on abstract, diagnostic language ("quantum simultaneously," "every potential sensation at once") that never lands in embodied contradiction. The transformation at closure is asserted through elevated metaphor rather than earned through prior choices that reveal competing impulses. No micro-choice under pressure demonstrates a hierarchy of values; the knight simply accepts the puppet's hand without visible cost or foreclosed path. The seven years of silence and the final surrender feel like set-pieces rather than decisions driven by contradictory wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but wavers—metaphoric density increases steadily, yet no decisive turn or deepening reweights the stake with legible cost. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into "guardian"), but the cost remains abstract: what did Aldric forfeit by taking the puppet's hand? The "unsnapping" action at the end echoes the Grand Alchemist's historic act, yet no prior causality compels this exact repetition, and the final image ("glow of unmanifest tomorrows") names theme rather than charging a concrete choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse's silver-barked trees, obsidian floor, and liquid starlight pools are vivid and purposeful, establishing a charged micro-setting. The marionette stage at the heart of the greenhouse constrains Aldric's ritual choice. However, the endless night and glass walls remain postcard elements that do not alter tactics or pressure; the phosphorescent glow is atmospheric but never limits movement or visibility in a way that matters. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Aldric recites the oath, the marionettes stir, and transformation proceeds without resistance or cost. The program's instructions are followed rather than interpreted under pressure. The final "surrender to infinite possibility" names the outcome but does not dramatize what Aldric gave up to achieve it, leaving escalation inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of inhabiting "the trembling moment before choice crystallized" emerges from the imagery of "living equations" and layered potential worlds, but the final paragraph states the theme directly ("the glow of unmanifest tomorrows, waiting to be born") rather than letting the image speak. The marionettes and trees recur, yet their transformation is described rather than re-priced by a final, earned contradiction. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or felt tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and poetic ("factually mystical," "bypassed the ear and etched itself directly onto consciousness") but consistent within the fantasy register. However, at peak pressure—the oath, the transformation—the prose leans into abstract metaphor ("molten possibility," "quantum simultaneously") that names states rather than grounding them in Aldric's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy when the stakes should tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the transformation beat without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without propulsion. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "Not sunlight—something better. The illumination of..." and "Not into wood...but into something between..." loops the negation-correction structure. Mixed metaphors: "dissolving" armor is "unsnapped from the necessity of its existence"—two incompatible mechanisms in one image. Paraphrase loop: "the trembling moment before choice crystallized" in paragraph ten is restated as "everywhere the greenhouse's influence touched" and "all worlds within himself" in the final paragraph without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist's greenhouse, reality-bending marionette ritual—synthesizes familiar fantasy tropes (The Night Circus, VanderMeer's botanical surrealism) without a fresh inflection. The "forgotten patterns of reality-weaving" and "oath in an alphabet that predated human speech" are stock wizard-initiation beats. The transformation into "guardian" of infinite possibility is declared rather than discovered through a non-obvious choice. No turn or intensification arises from Aldric's specific history (seven years of silence, knighthood) in a way that makes this greenhouse or this ritual irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aldric ("withdrawn knight") is present throughout and performs the key action (reciting the oath, taking the puppet's hand), but his withdrawal shapes no on-page choice or tactic. The seven years of silence are mentioned but never constrain his speech or decision-making. Setup present, closure participation nominal (he transforms), but no middle choice driven by his knight/withdrawn status. Swappable with "solitary scholar" or "exiled mage" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "abandoned marionette theater program" appears in the opening paragraph, is clutched throughout, and contains the oath recited at closure. However, it functions as a script Aldric follows rather than an object whose handling or evolving meaning shapes choice. No second beat reweights it; no cost tied to possessing or using it. Setup and closure participation present, but no middle development or causal pressure. Could be replaced with "ancient scroll" or "engraved tablet" without restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"A murmured allegiance" appears late (final third) when the lead marionette's extended hand is described as "the murmured allegiance made manifest." It is thematic echo only, not a tactic or stake that alters Aldric's options. No prior beat establishes allegiance as a contested choice. Ornamental mention; late arrival caps at 4.6, but lack of causal work drives score lower.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is applied to the trees' energy in paragraph three. The phrase is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates a trade-off between "factual" and "mystical" properties. The trees pulse and bear fruit, but their dual nature does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Present in setup and atmosphere, but no beat involvement or closure linkage. Swappable with "arcane" or "enchanted."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unsnap" is used twice: the Grand Alchemist "unsnapped the bonds between here and elsewhere" (paragraph one) and Aldric's armor is "unsnapped from the necessity of its existence" (final third). The second use drives the transformation beat and links to the historic action, creating a thematic echo. Setup signal, closure participation with some specificity, but no middle beat where Aldric must choose to unsnap something under pressure. One functional reprise lifts it into the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" appear in the program's description (paragraph two: "forgotten patterns of reality-weaving") and recur at closure ("This was the forgotten pattern"). Setup and closure participation present, but the mechanics are never dramatized—Aldric reads the oath, and the pattern activates without him navigating or choosing among alternatives. No middle beat where the method shapes his attempt or forces a trade-off. Functional but replaceable with "ancient ritual" or "lost ceremony."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" is established in paragraph one, detailed with silver-barked trees, liquid starlight pools, and obsidian floor, and supplies the marionette stage at its heart. The setting constrains the ritual to this location and provides the trees that "began to sing" during transformation. The endless night cracks with light at closure, marking the change. Setup, middle constraint (stage location), and closure participation all present. Two distinct beats plus closure linkage; essential but not fully irreplaceable—other mystical gardens could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" is invoked in the prompt timeframe but appears on the page only as a descriptor ("As reality began to shift, the greenhouse walls became permeable membranes"). No ticking clock or urgency; the transformation proceeds at narrative convenience without time pressure altering Aldric's tactics. Summary-only use in one beat, no setup or closure constraint. Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To capture the shape of possibility" is named in the final paragraph but never articulated as Aldric's goal in his interiority prior to that moment. The opening establishes his exile and the program's instructions; the middle shows him reading the trees and reciting the oath. No on-page beat where he voices or weighs this desire against a cost. Told-only at closure, no friction with competing wants. Late thematic claim without causal groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears once in the final third: "The shivering bliss of it overwhelmed him, every nerve ending experiencing every potential sensation at once." The tone is consistent—elevated, mystical, positive—but static; no modulation under pressure, no turn from dread to bliss or bliss to cost. The phrase charges one moment but does not shape the arc or final image. One functional beat, no setup or recurring tonal shift. Mid-band for atmospheric presence without tonal architecture.</comment>
