<comment>Yula's motivation (learning to navigate without moving) is coherent and embodied through her three-hundred-year stillness, with the arrowhead functioning as a focal object. Her final exchange with her younger voice shows a stance crystallization, though the cost remains abstract—three centuries have passed, but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and maintains a meditative register consistent with the premise. The protagonist's agency is renunciation/endurance, fitting Earned Stasis, but the emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, trending toward summary of her evolution rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who and where early ("harmonic stone skimmer," "bone towers," "canyon of endless echoes"), with when clarified by "three hundred years" in the opening line. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Yula's younger voice returns after circling the canyon's acoustic maze, and her whispered reply "I am still here" crystallizes her refusal of movement as mastery with felt conceptual cost—three centuries of dust and solitude. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered acoustic imagery, the vultures' pattern tightens, and the final exchange reweights the opening premise. One meaningful deepening is present when the wandering pulse is revealed as her own voice, narrowing the temporal loop and charging the final image with the cost of her unwavering stillness.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, and arrowhead constrain Yula's method: she reads vulture formations like sheet music, accesses temporal currents through acoustic resonance, and uses the arrowhead as a compass aligned with her heartbeat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—dust as temporal marker, vulture shadows crossing her face in rhythm with the arrowhead's carvings, the pulse "ricocheting between the bone spires." The micro-setting (arrowhead, body stillness, acoustic environment) charges the final image when the wandering pulse returns as her own voice. Spatial choreography is clean; the towers, canyon, and Yula's fixed perch remain coherent across the piece.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the vultures' spiral tightens, the wandering pulse shifts in response to Yula's synchronization, and the swallows encode the awaited message, culminating in the pulse's return as her own younger voice. Agency is endurance/attention that forecloses movement with on-page cost: three centuries of stillness, dust accumulation, and the final recognition that "the greatest journey was the one that required no steps at all." The cost is conceptual and temporal but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening is present; no reversals are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—stillness as mastery, time as navigation medium—emerges organically from the bone towers as acoustic libraries, the arrowhead's encoded migrations, and Yula's transformation from believing "movement was mastery" to understanding navigation through fixed presence. The wandering pulse returning as her own voice offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the journey circles back to its origin without steps. Subtext operates in the vultures' tightening spiral, the dust as years, and the arrowhead pulsing with "deep time." The ending avoids moralizing and reweights the opening premise through image and echo. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature filtered through Yula's centuries of stillness: "not sound exactly, but the ghost of one," "reading their formations like sheet music." Diction remains consistent—meditative, precise, with elevated register appropriate to the timescale and premise. Purposeful compression ("Each echo here contained a moment") and lyric patterning are taught early and serve closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The arrowhead's warmth, the pulse's shift, and the final whispered exchange maintain embodied immediacy without slipping into abstraction. Psychic distance holds steady; no voice convergence or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ; paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or temporal logic. Minor scaffold present: "She had come here as a young woman" and "She had learned to appraise" are slight exposition anchors that could be tighter, and "The skill had taken lifetimes to develop" summarizes rather than dramatizes progression, costing momentum. One paraphrase loop: "The old texts spoke of stone skimmers who could slide across water" and "But none had written of navigating through time" restate her pioneering nature across adjacent beats. No metaphor muddle, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, no template cadence runs. Clarity remains high; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—navigating time through acoustic stillness atop bone towers—synthesizes fresh elements: stone skimmer mythology, temporal echo libraries, and bird-pattern divination. The choice to remain motionless for three centuries while "navigating the universe from her single, perfect point" inverts expectation and reads inevitable in hindsight. The arrowhead as compass for migrations-turned-temporal-anchor and the wandering pulse as Yula's own returning voice avoid stock resolutions. Risk-taking in the centuries-long timescale and the refusal of movement as climax heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Some formulaic phrasing ("weathered resolve unbroken," "the greatest journey") nudges toward abstraction but does not flatten the core invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Yula's choices—pressing the arrowhead to her sternum to synchronize with the pulse, closing her eyes to navigate backward through dust-years, whispering back to her younger voice—create the final turn. Setup in opening paragraph; development when she synchronizes heartbeat and pulse; payoff when she speaks the closure line. Two beats (synchronization, final whisper) are causally driven by her agency. Her stillness as refusal forecloses movement with conceptual cost. Swappable with another meditator archetype only with moderate edits; her specific skill (acoustic temporal navigation) ties her to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The arrowhead appears in opening paragraph as compass, returns when Yula presses it to her sternum to align heartbeat and pulse (middle beat), and pulses "with the heartbeat of deep time" in the final line. Three touches across beats; used actively to synchronize and access grandmother's memories; charges the closure image. Specific properties (flint etched with migration patterns, warmth, point alignment) matter. Could be replaced by another heirloom object with minor edits, capping at mid-7s; specificity (arrowhead = compass/weapon inversion) lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The wandering pulse is introduced early ("caught her attention"), drives the middle synchronization beat (Yula aligns her heartbeat to draw it), and supplies the closure revelation (her own younger voice returning after three centuries). Three beats; causal: her stillness as fixed point allows the pulse to eddy and return. Shapes tactics: she uses breathing and heartbeat to summon specific moments. Closure linkage strong: the pulse's return as her own voice reweights the opening premise. Specificity: the pulse as acoustic ghost with memory is tied to the canyon's logic. Irreplaceable within this acoustic-time framework.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Historically reverent nature" is mentioned once in paragraph four as a character label but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. No dramatized trade-off where reverence prevents or compels a choice. Present in setup but absent from development and payoff beats. Ornamental: easily cut without altering escalation or closure. Static description without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Appraise" appears once: "She had learned to appraise such phenomena through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight." Sets up the method but is not repeated as an active verb in subsequent beats. The vultures' pattern and swallows' message are read/interpreted, but the text does not return to "appraise" as the specific action. Two-gate presence (setup via telling, implicit in middle and closure bird-reading); causal role in one major beat (vulture spiral tightening). Swappable with "read," "interpret," or "assess" with minor edits. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Bird patterns as method are signaled early ("appraise such phenomena through the patterns in a flock of birds"), developed when vultures circle in diminishing spiral matching the pulse's rhythm, and return when swallows weave between towers encoding the awaited message. Three beats; mechanics matter: formations read "like sheet music," shadows cross her face in rhythm with arrowhead carvings, pattern matches arrowhead's deepest engraving. Shapes attempts: Yula's navigation depends on reading avian formations. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; specificity ties to acoustic-time logic. Could be replaced by another divination method (wind, water patterns) with moderate edits, capping below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and canyon are anchored in opening paragraph, constrain Yula's stillness (she sits atop the tallest tower for three centuries), and supply resources: the towers are "libraries of sound" whose hollow cores preserve temporal echoes, enabling her acoustic navigation. The canyon's infinite acoustic maze is the medium through which the wandering pulse circles and returns. Three beats: setup, middle (towers as libraries), payoff (pulse returns through canyon acoustics). Causal: the setting's acoustic properties are indispensable to the closure effect. Irreplaceable: no other environment could substitute without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Three hundred years of stillness frames the piece (opening line), and "centuries of layered dust" appears in paragraph two; the timeframe is referenced when Yula "navigate[s] backward through the accumulated dust of centuries, each grain a year." The pulse returns "three hundred years ago when she first arrived, finally returning after circling." Three touches; time supplies conceptual cost (three centuries of solitude) but does not tighten decisions or create live tactical pressure within the dramatized window. The piece is essentially a single moment reflecting on elapsed time rather than time narrowing options on the page. Setup, thematic development, closure participation all present; cost is felt but time does not function as escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Yula's desire to learn navigation without movement is introduced in opening paragraphs ("believing movement was mastery... true navigation happened in stillness"), dramatized through her three-hundred-year stillness and acoustic synchronization (middle beats), and affirmed in the closure whisper: "the greatest journey was the one that required no steps at all." Three beats; friction between want (mastery) and cost (centuries of dust, solitude) is legible. Agency is endurance; the motivation shapes tactics (stillness, heartbeat alignment) and charges the final image. Conceptual cost on the page: three centuries forfeited, youth spent motionless. Irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Weathered resolve is coherent throughout: meditative register, patient observation, refusal of movement despite centuries passing, and the final whisper "her weathered resolve unbroken" in the penultimate paragraph. Tone modulates subtly with pressure: the vultures' tightening spiral and swallows' arrival raise intensity without breaking the meditative frame. The final exchange (younger voice / older reply) charges the ending image with the cost of endurance. Consistent across beats; charges closure. Minor deduction: "weathered resolve unbroken" is stated rather than fully embodied in the final gesture, nudging toward label-speak, but the overall tonal control remains strong.</comment>
