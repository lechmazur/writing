<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The guardian's interior is vivid and embodied throughout—"ice crystals formed in her thoughts," bare feet that "left no prints"—and the final choice to step through with the scholar is earned by the sustained homesickness and the pendant's function. The scholar's motives are clean and goal-driven. Minor weakness: the guardian's loss of speech feels asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices; we see the clicking growls but not the moment-by-moment struggle to form words until the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative textures (homesickness accumulates; scholar's arrival triggers causal turn). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change (guardian leaves with the scholar via the Codex) with visible cost (removes pendant, thaws garden, softens feral nature). One meaningful tightening when the scholar offers retrieval. Cost is legible: she surrenders the pendant and her role. No causality breaks; the scholar's arrival and the Codex mechanism are motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden is vivid and consistent: "dead grass that crunched like broken glass," "ice-glazed topiaries," "cherub's face cracked down the middle." The setting pressures the guardian's isolation and charges the thaw at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (fountain, hedges, library entrance). The pendant functions as micro-setting, constraining her perception of dimensional boundaries. Minor slip: the library's "walls that curved impossibly" is asserted late without prior setup of impossible geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape/rescue from the sealed garden. One clear tightening when the scholar offers dual retrieval, forcing trust in "uncertainty." The guardian's agency is renunciation (removes pendant) and acceptance (steps into the Codex light). Cost is visible: she gives up her only anchor and her guardian role. The scholar's need (sister retrieval) converges with the guardian's need (escape) at closure, creating a credible trade-off. Pressure coheres under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of befriending uncertainty emerges through specific images: the pendant showing "boundaries of light like prison bars," the guardian's learned patience in "endless frozen nights," and the final step into "luminous uncertainty." The closing image—light dissolving boundaries rather than ending at them—reweights the premise without moralizing. The scholar's line "make friends with not knowing if you'll arrive whole" ties motif to action. Subtext operates in the guardian's tears and the pendant transfer. No thematic echo or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the guardian throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: "Words had become foreign architecture in her mouth," "homesickness carved hollow spaces in her ribs." Dialogue (scholar's lines) is goal-driven and advances plot without exposition dump. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (removal of pendant, step into light). Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor slip: the scholar's phrasing "my sister—she's stuck between dimensions" reads slightly over-articulate for breathless urgency, but does not break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high: "She crouched now among the ice-glazed topiaries, watching mist roll across dead grass that crunched like broken glass beneath her bare feet" does scenic, sensory, and character work simultaneously. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "The pendant showed her these edges, taught her to wait in the spaces between" edges toward abstraction without concrete image. One unnecessary scaffold: "Not a question" after dialogue already conveys certainty. Overall propulsion is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of feral guardian + dimensional homesickness + cultist's pendant is specific and non-generic; the frozen garden and "boundaries of light" motif charge the premise. The scholar's dual-retrieval offer transforms a stock rescue into a credible trade. Risk: the piece leans into extended metaphor ("interiorizing exteriors," light boundaries) without always grounding it in tactile action. The ending avoids safety middle and commits to transformation. Not derivative of a single famous work, but the "trapped librarian" and "pendant as key" feel familiar without full reinvention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Feral library guardian: setup (first line "had not always been feral"), development (crouches watching, recognizes scholar via pendant, leads through maze), closure (removes pendant, steps into Codex light). Her choices create the key turn (accepting scholar's offer) and the closure action. Causal pressure: her internalized winter and homesickness drive the decision. Cost: surrenders guardian role and pendant. Irreplaceable: the feral trait and its reversal ("feral nature softening") are central to arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cultist's pendant: setup (paragraph 2, "hung cold against her chest"), development (grows warm recognizing scholar, shows boundaries of light, sparks to reveal vision), closure (she removes it, places it around scholar's neck as anchor). Used in at least three distinct beats with evolving function. Causal: enables her perception and the final passage. Cost tied to it: giving it up is the price of escape. Specific irreplaceability: obsidian surface, dimensional recognition, anchor function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Boundaries of light: setup (paragraph 4, "the membrane where illumination ended"), development (pendant "showed her these edges," scholar sees "boundaries of light like prison bars"), closure (light "poured out—not ending at boundaries but dissolving them entirely"). Shapes the conceptual stake (trapped by dimensional boundaries) and the resolution mechanism (dissolving them). Causal role in closure. Moderate irreplaceability; "dimensional barrier" could substitute with edits, but the light/boundary image charges the final beat and ties to title motif.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dimensionally homesick: setup (paragraph 2, "feel her original world," "homesickness carved hollow spaces"), development (drives her patience and waiting), closure (finally going home). Constrains choice: the ache motivates her acceptance of the scholar's offer. Cost: she has endured three years of isolation because of it. Swappability: "trapped" or "exiled" could replace with minor edits; "homesick" is more specific but not fully irreplaceable. Present across arc with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wait: setup (paragraph 4, "taught her to wait in the spaces between"), development (monks sealed the space, she waits among topiaries, "always waiting for the next threat"), closure ("She waited one last heartbeat in the fog-shrouded garden, then stepped forward"). The action defines her method and the final beat's charge. Causal: waiting has internalized the winter; the final wait-then-act is the pivot. Cost: waiting has changed her. Moderate irreplaceability; "endure" could substitute, but "wait" ties to uncertainty theme and the cultist's teaching.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiorizing exteriors: setup (implied in paragraph 3, "she internalized more of this frozen exterior world, bringing the garden's endless winter inside herself until ice crystals formed in her thoughts"), development (monastery walls "had become her skeleton"), closure (thaw begins as she leaves). Shapes the cost of her imprisonment and the stakes of departure. Present in two beats with causal role. Swappability: "absorbing the environment" could replace; the specific phrasing "interiorizing exteriors" is more conceptual than tactile. Closure linkage via thaw is present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden in mist: setup (paragraph 3, "existed in perpetual winter," "mist roll across dead grass"), development (topiaries, fountain, maze-like hedges guide movement; mist conceals then reveals scholar), closure ("fog-shrouded garden began to thaw" as she steps away). Pressures isolation and supplies tactical cover. Causal: the seal traps her; the thaw marks release. Irreplaceable: the frozen state and its reversal are load-bearing for the arc. Used across at least three beats with closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Through the veil of sleep: setup (paragraph 4, "that strange half-state she entered when exhaustion finally claimed her"), linked to reaching "boundaries of light." Development: unclear if the present action occurs in that state or waking. Closure: not revisited; the Codex passage does not explicitly invoke sleep-veil. Ornamental mention without mechanical constraint. Swappable with "trance" or "meditation." No visible cost or tactic shaped by it. Present in one beat only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Make friends with uncertainty: setup (paragraph 4, "uncertainty that had become her only friend"), development (scholar: "you'll have to trust the uncertainty of it. Make friends with not knowing if you'll arrive whole"; guardian "had already befriended uncertainty"), closure (steps into "luminous uncertainty"). Shapes the final choice and its acceptance. Causal: her prior endurance enables the leap. Cost: she must accept not knowing outcome. Moderate irreplaceability; "embrace risk" could substitute, but "befriend uncertainty" is more specific and ties to the waiting theme. Present across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity: The tone blends dreamlike imagery ("mist," "fog-shrouded," "strange half-state," "veil") with sharp tactical clarity (crouches, watches, leads, removes pendant). Modulates under pressure: surreal descriptions in setup, concrete action in middle, luminous dissolution at closure. Coherent through turns. The fog motif charges the final image ("fog-shrouded garden"). Slightly swappable with "liminal clarity" but the fog anchor is consistent and purposeful. Present across arc with closure participation.</comment>
