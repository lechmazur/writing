<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("moral edges," "poet's hunger") rather than embodied contradiction. His decision to replace the rope feels unmotivated—no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the choice. The energy beings remain unexplained conveniences that grant revelation without resistance. Internal conflict is asserted ("impossible choices") but never dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story presents a series of revelations (Samuel, Thomas, the daughter) but no causal chain—each layer is passively received rather than earned through Marcus's agency. Closure reads as a thematic statement ("texture of time") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses options with visible cost. The orientation test is passed (who/where/when anchored early), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization coheres at the ending. The rope replacement gesture carries no legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly anchored (amber glow, clay texture, vibrations) and recurs through the piece. However, it functions primarily as a backdrop for passive revelation rather than constraining Marcus's choices or altering tactics. The rope's texture is noted but does not shape action. Micro-setting qualifies (the rope, the wall) but lacks constraint or closure charge, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or escalating cost. Marcus encounters no resistance; the energy beings simply comply with his commands. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; he walks away having learned everything he sought with no visible sacrifice. The revelations about the Reeves family are ornamental, not integrated into Marcus's own pressure or agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("impossible choices," "texture of time") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph delivers explicit moralizing: "the texture of time was nothing more...than the accumulated weight of every heart that had ever broken itself trying to choose correctly." Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6). The Reeves family's layered guilt could provide complexity, but Marcus simply observes without moral friction of his own.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Voice carries elevated, poetic diction ("terra-cotta," "ethically complex game," "terrible beautiful complexity") that remains uniform across emotional beats—no modulation under pressure. Marcus's perceptual signature is generic poet-speak rather than character-specific. No dialogue present. POV remains stable, but the prose reads as committee voice rather than singular perspective, and the lexicon ("savoring impossible choices like wine") feels more authorial than grounded in Marcus's roadside drifter experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Show me another layer" / "Pattern it forward" / "The final layer revealed itself" follow identical stems. Abstract phrasing ("moral complexity," "cosmic scales," "dimensions that yesterday he couldn't have imagined") replaces concrete action. Stock metaphor string: "Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave, smooth like worn clay, sharp like the moral edges." Figurative density in high-pressure beats (−0.5), template cadence runs (−0.5), and abstraction in the closure paragraph (−0.4) accumulate to −1.4 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The core premise—energy beings revealing layered history—echoes familiar "mystic guide shows protagonist truth" templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Marcus's poet role and the terra-cotta grotto provide some texture, but the emotional arc (seeking understanding, receiving it costlessly, walking away satisfied) follows a median path. Derivative Premise adjustment (−0.7) applies; the piece does not take bold risks or offer a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout but makes no key turn—he requests revelations and receives them without resistance. His decision to replace the rope does not alter tactics or stakes. Observation dominates; he is a passive recipient rather than an agent whose choices create pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rope appears in multiple beats (found, examined, textured, replaced) and is present in the closure image. However, its use is static description—Marcus holds it, feels its texture, and sets it down without the object constraining a choice or reweighting meaning through evolving function. Setup and payoff gates met; development (middle choice constrained by the rope) is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is declared in exposition and thematic summary but never dramatized on the page. The Reeves family faced choices; Marcus does not. The concept is ornamental label rather than shaping stakes or tactics in Marcus's present action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" is mentioned once as a descriptor of the energy beings' game but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. Label-only; no visible tradeoff tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pattern" appears as both verb (Marcus "patterns out the truth") and method, seeded early and recurring. However, it describes passive reception of information rather than driving a turn. The act of patterning does not redefine options or create escalation; it is easily swappable with "perceive" or "understand."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled early and structures the middle (three historical layers revealed in sequence). The mechanics matter in that each layer is distinct, but the method is passive observation—Marcus requests, the beings comply. No cost or friction shapes the attempts. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly described, anchors the scene, and appears in the final image ("the grotto's terra-cotta walls began to sing"). It provides atmosphere and a charged recurring detail. However, it does not constrain Marcus's choices or alter tactics—he could receive the same revelations anywhere. Lyric reprise reweights slightly but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three nights ago" the beings arrived) is mentioned once at the opening and provides setup context. It does not tighten decisions or shape tactics in Marcus's present action. Vague; no live clock or urgency tied to the arrival window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Marcus's desire "to discover the texture of time" is stated and motivates his request for revelations. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between cost and want—he achieves his goal without sacrifice. Functional but swappable with generic curiosity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is attempted through elevated diction and restrained physical action. The tone remains static—no modulation with pressure since Marcus faces no escalating stakes. The final image ("Marcus smiled, knowing he'd discovered exactly what he'd been seeking") offers satisfaction without tension, and the closing sentences deliver overt thematic summary rather than charged implication. Coherent but does not intensify or charge the closure.</comment>
