<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("felt it in her bones," physical grip on the rope), and her choice to ring the bell shows contradictory impulses—trusting old wisdom over modern certainty under pressure. However, her competence is too smooth; the "credibly curious" trait appears only as a label ("credibly curious about the pressure readings") without constraining a choice or revealing a blind spot that complicates her path. The grandmother backstory anchors her listening preference but remains inert; it doesn't tilt a present micro-choice until the bell-ringing decision, which feels more like validation than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal: barometric anomaly → stone vibration → animals flee → bell ring → avalanche. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Mara shifts from observer to guardian, and the villages evacuate. The cost is legible—she remains at her post, isolated, having staked her credibility on primal warning methods. One meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses the bell over the electronic switch. Minor slip: the avalanche "triggered by deep tectonic shifts her instruments had detected as pressure changes" arrives as retrospective explanation rather than dramatized discovery, softening the causal spine at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, cloud layer, and stone floor are vivid and pressure Mara's choice: the bell rope is tactile ("hemp fibers rough beneath her fingers"), the stone hum is felt, and the spatial setup (five thousand feet above the clouds, open arches) frames her isolation and the warning's reach. The glue drying on the siren's weatherproofing functions as a micro-setting constraint tied to the timeframe. Slight drift: "acrylic seal gleaming in the morning light" and "ice crystals that chimed like a thousand tiny bells" are decorative touches that don't alter tactics or charge the closure image, lowering integration density.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—warn the valleys in time—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara chooses the bell over the electronic system, a reversal that narrows options and raises credibility cost ("would anyone… believe a warning issued in such perfect weather?"). The cost is visible: villages evacuate, Mara remains exposed in the sanctuary as the avalanche reshapes the landscape. The tightening is meaningful and forecloses a path (passive monitoring). Minor issue: the avalanche's appearance feels coincidental in timing rather than dramatized as a consequence of her choice, slightly softening agency at the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—old wisdom versus modern certainty, listening versus noise—emerges from Mara's tactile choice to ring the bell and layer both systems. The final image ("bell rope… still warm from her grip, as snow began to fall") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the ending paragraph over-articulates: "In the balance between old and new, between silence and warning, she had found the perfect moment to switch from observer to guardian" is a thematic echo that states rather than trusts the enacted resonance. The word "switch" (prompt term) and the tidy framing reduce ambiguity and felt complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's sensory priority (listening, humidity, pressure) filters description consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("She closed her eyes and listened with her whole body") to wider observation of the valleys. Minor slips: "credibly curious" is an external judgment rather than interior texture, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("primal authority," "walls of snow reshape the landscape") drifts slightly from Mara's established idiom under stress, though it remains legible and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Syntax varies and information density is generally high, but several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "windblown sanctuary" recurs four times without functional shift; "She preferred listening over noise" is told and then paraphrased in "tracking storms the old way"; "zero hour had arrived" is announced rather than shown through accumulating pressure. The phrase "acrylic seal gleaming" and "ice crystals that chimed like a thousand tiny bells" are decorative metaphors that slow momentum at the denouement. Template cadence in the middle section: "The usual winds… had stilled," "The barometric data suggested," "The cathedral bell rope caught…" use parallel passive/past-perfect stems across adjacent lines. Apply −0.8 for distributed loops and scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of meteorology, monastery setting, and the bell-versus-siren choice is specific and non-obvious. The "solstice hush" atmospheric pause and the avalanche from within the mountain (tectonic rather than weather-driven) add fresh angles. However, the core arc—rural expert trusts intuition over technology and saves lives—is a familiar template ("The Engineer Who Knew Better"), and the transformation is modest: the grandmother's teaching and the stone's hum provide texture but don't complicate Mara's moral calculus or force a surprising trade-off. The ending satisfies without risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara the storm siren tester is present from the opening and her humility is signaled ("humble storm siren tester"). Her choice to ring the bell (final third) creates the key turn from observer to guardian. The role constrains her options (she must choose between electronic and manual warning) and her expertise (tracking microclimates, reading silence) enables the avalanche detection. However, "humble" functions more as a label than a trait that complicates her path; she never second-guesses her authority or struggles with self-doubt in the decision beat, so the attribute doesn't impose visible cost. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓; causal pressure moderate; cost tied to role rather than humility specifically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bell rope appears in the opening ("hung motionless"), is handled mid-story ("rough beneath her fingers"), and becomes the instrument of the climactic choice ("pulled with her entire weight"). It recurs with reweighted meaning in the final image ("still warm from her grip"). Its use is irreplaceable—the physical act sends "a different message—older, more urgent" than the electronic system. The rope's tactile presence and the bell's "primal authority" charge the closure. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓; two beats (consideration, action); closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high. Slight friction: the rope's second mention ("caught her attention again") is static observation rather than a choice point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is defined early ("that moment when a catastrophic storm would give no other warning") and shapes Mara's stake: she must recognize the unprecedented conditions and act. The concept reappears at the decision beat ("Zero hour had arrived") and drives her choice to ring the bell. It alters tactics by framing the bell rope as the only credible warning at this threshold. Setup ✓, Development (frames recognition) ✓, Payoff (triggers action) ✓. Minor friction: the phrase "zero hour had arrived" is announced rather than discovered through incremental tightening, reducing felt pressure. The concept is integral but slightly under-dramatized at the turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" appears once as a descriptor ("credibly curious about the pressure readings that made no sense") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The trait is label-only; Mara's investigation of the barometric anomaly would proceed identically if this phrase were removed. The curiosity is consistent with her role but adds no visible tradeoff or friction—she doesn't pursue a risky measurement, delay a warning, or ignore protocol out of investigative zeal. Setup (mentioned) ✓, Development ✗ (no choice tied to this trait), Payoff ✗. Swappable with "attentive" or "methodical." Cap 4.6 for missing middle and closure; ornamental use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Switch" anchors the climactic choice: Mara switches from electronic system to bell rope, then activates both ("activated the modern sirens too"). The action redefines options—layering old and new warnings—and the final paragraph explicitly ties it to theme ("the perfect moment to switch from observer to guardian"). The verb is irreplaceable in the closure logic. Setup (control panel introduced) ✓, Development (choice framed) ✓, Payoff (enacted and thematized) ✓. Two beats (decision, reflection); causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. Friction: "switch" in the final paragraph reads as a thematic claim rather than strictly the physical act, slightly diluting specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is signaled in the opening ("tracking microclimate variations through her portable weather station") and the method enables Mara's expertise throughout: she reads "subtle shifts in humidity, temperature gradients," detects the stone vibration her instruments can't measure, and recognizes the "deep silence." The method is present in two beats (opening setup, mid-story detection) and underwrites her credibility at closure. Setup ✓, Development (shapes detection) ✓, Payoff (her expertise validates the warning) ✓. Friction: the method is described but its mechanics are summary rather than shown in action (we don't see her adjust instruments or cross-check readings), and "portable weather station" becomes inert after the opening. Causal role moderate; swappable with "studied weather patterns."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary supplies the bell rope (resource), the stone floor transmits the mountain's vibration (signal), the open arches frame the cloud-top view and evacuation lights, and the five-thousand-foot elevation isolates Mara at closure. The setting constrains her choice: she must decide whether a warning from this remote post will be believed. Setup ✓, Development (stone hum, spatial isolation) ✓, Payoff ("remained at her post in the sanctuary") ✓. Three beats; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong (she stays as the avalanche passes). Minor friction: "windblown" recurs decoratively without tactical shift, and the ice crystals at the end are postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the glue dries" anchors Mara's waiting in the opening ("waiting for the glue to dry on the newly repaired warning system") and releases her to act mid-story ("The glue on the siren's weatherproofing had dried an hour ago"). It tightens the decision window: she can now activate the system, and the solstice timing adds atmospheric pressure. Setup ✓, Development (releases action) ✓, Payoff (implicit—she acts post-drying) ✓. Two beats; moderate causal pressure. Friction: the glue-drying is a soft constraint—it doesn't create urgency or race against the avalanche's arrival; Mara could have used the bell regardless. The "hour ago" note deflates rather than tightens the clock. Swappable with "after equipment check."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to favor listening over noise is seeded early ("She preferred listening over noise, always had") and dramatized through Mara's choice to rely on sensory cues (stone vibration, animal behavior, silence) over automated systems. It drives the climactic decision: she chooses the bell's "primal authority" because electronic warnings might be "dismissed as malfunction." The friction between old wisdom and modern certainty shapes her action. Setup ✓, Development (sensory detection) ✓, Payoff (bell choice) ✓. Three beats; causal pressure high; cost visible (credibility risk). Minor slip: "She preferred listening over noise" is told summary rather than discovered through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy under stress, and the grandmother backstory supports but doesn't complicate the preference.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" is named early ("that rare atmospheric pause when sound traveled perfectly") and sustained through the piece: "unnatural calm," "crystalline and still," "the deep silence," "peculiar quiet." The tone modulates at the bell-ringing ("the bronze bell spoke its ancient warning") and shifts to kinetic urgency ("walls of snow reshape the landscape") before returning to quiet in the final image ("snow began to fall in the solstice hush"). The tone charges the closure by framing the warning's breach of silence and its return. Setup ✓, Development (coherent hush) ✓, Payoff (framed return) ✓. Three beats; tone shift purposeful; closure linkage strong. The phrase "solstice hush" recurs in the final line, creating lyric resonance.</comment>
