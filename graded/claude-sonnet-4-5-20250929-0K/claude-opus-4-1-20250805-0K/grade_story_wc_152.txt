<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's disguised competence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—genuine hums alongside encoded intelligence work—with clear interiority ("smiled, genuinely this time"). Her internal texture remains specific through embodied choices: deliberate blood-smear encoding, needle-threading of flame. The final choice feels earned by months of listening and stitching, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Minor slip: Hecht and other officers read slightly stock in their dismissiveness, functional but not deeply individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—Vera completes the final chart knowing the coup will begin tomorrow, her intelligence network activated with undeniable consequences ahead. The causal lens holds: each scene flows because/therefore from her embedded position to encoded intelligence to final transmission. Orientation anchors early (cobalt dome, Vera at work, officers visiting). One meaningful tightening occurs when Crane confirms "tomorrow night," crystallizing the timeline and raising immediacy. Cost is legible in the conceptual price: her disguise forecloses normal relationships, and the resistance will now act on her intelligence with lives at stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dome and eternal flame function as more than backdrop—the flame's "adjacent possibilities" mechanics enable her encoding method, and the observatory's status as trusted navigation hub makes her position plausible. Spatial choreography stays clear (work table, corridor, dome). Autumn light and rattling wind recur purposefully. Micro-setting strength: the needle, velvet, and flame serve as constraint-tools that shape her intelligence method. The eternal candle's properties (three-century burn, shadow-casting) constrain tactics and charge the final image of "threading one last secret."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prevent the coup by transmitting intelligence without detection. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Crane announces the observatory closure, confirming tomorrow's timeline and eliminating future opportunities. Vera's agency drives escalation—each encoded chart, each feigned foolishness is a tactical choice with detection risk. The "twin moons synchronize" detail demonstrates she's tracking multiple constraints. Cost is visible in her sustained performance ("letting drool collect") and the conceptual price of years spent isolated in disguise. One solid reversal when the timeframe compresses from abstract future to "tomorrow night."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden intelligence networks and unheard voices emerges through concrete particulars: the embroidered routes, the "echoed silence between words," the resistance navigators trained to read true work. The eternal flame's revealing-through-angle mechanic offers a non-literal answer to how truth hides in plain sight. Subtext operates in her performance versus reality gap. Minor weakness: "unheard stories" occasionally tips toward thematic echo ("threading one last secret into the vast, silent map of revolution" states more than it dramatizes). The final image reweights prior stitching as revolution rather than decoration, though the resonance is solid rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Vera's perceptual signature: she notices officers' "echoed silence," tracks guard rotations, sees flame-cast shadows revealing "adjacent possibilities." Her professional lens (mathematical precision, memory techniques encoded as melody) filters all observation. Dialogue carries subtext effectively—"The stars whisper such lovely secrets" masks tactical intelligence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening to close observation during Crane's inspection, pulling back for summary of months' work. Clean focalization with no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent—elevated but grounded in her scholarly-artisan register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance plot, character texture, or intelligence mechanics. Rhythm varies effectively between longer atmospheric sentences and short tactical beats. Minor scaffolding appears: "Each flicker cast shadows that revealed adjacent possibilities" tells mechanism rather than showing it in use; "paths that existed alongside the obvious ones" paraphrases the same idea. Template stems recur lightly ("she'd just marked," "she'd spent years"). The blood-smear encoding and flame-threading show strong concreteness. Opening line ("bruise against the sky") and closing wind-whisper create effective frame. No loops obscure causality, but synonym variation for "stitching/embroidering/threading" edges toward decorative in mid-section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "adjacent possibilities revealed by eternal flame" premise offers a fresh supernatural-meets-tradecraft synthesis. The embroidered star-chart intelligence network transforms the "wise fool" trope through specific mechanics: hemoglobin code, synchronized overlays, angle-dependent visibility. Vera's sensory-memory encoding (melody-as-mnemonic) and the flame-threading technique feel particular to this story. Moderate risk: the metaphysical flame properties could read convenient, but they're established early and constrain her method. The emotional core—years of isolation in performance—grounds the fantastical elements. Proximity check: the fool-who-knows trope is familiar, but the embroidery-as-spycraft execution adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera drives every key choice: extracting flame-thread, encoding blood-markers, sustaining disguise under Crane's scrutiny, completing the final chart. Her decisions create all turns. Present from opening, shapes middle choices (drool performance, blood encoding), and culminates in the final threading action that enables resistance coordination.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eternal flame appears in three distinct functional beats: first as worldbuilding anchor ("three centuries, never diminishing"), then as tool when Vera extracts flame-thread for encoding, finally as verification mechanism (resistance navigators will use its light to reveal hidden patterns). Its unique properties (shadow-casting "adjacent possibilities," persistent burn, angle-dependent revelation) are irreplaceable—no ordinary candle would enable her method. Shapes the closure image indirectly (her work depends on the flame's mechanics being understood by resistance readers).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Conspiracy-unraveling defines the story's central action: Vera listens to coup plotters, encodes their plans (dates, routes, targets, rotations), and transmits intelligence. The concept shapes every beat—her foolish-disguise tactic exists to enable conspiracy access, and the stakes turn on whether her unraveling succeeds before the coup launches. The final chart represents months of accumulated conspiracy details. Cost is dramatized in her years-long isolation and tomorrow's detection risk.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "disguises wisdom as foolishness" attribute constrains multiple on-page actions with visible costs: she must drool and cackle (embodied cost), sing nonsense to encode intelligence (method constraint), and pretend confusion under Crane's inspection (detection risk). The disguise enables her access but forecloses normal relationships. Present from the opening interaction with Hecht, tested under pressure with Crane, and referenced in the final "old fool stitching wisdom" line that reweights the trait as revolution-enabling. The years-long maintenance implies sustained personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears as the coup trigger (twin moons) that Vera encodes and the resistance must coordinate around. The synchronization concept drives the timeline pressure and shapes her overlay-chart method (navigators must synchronize charts with flame-light). Functional in two beats: encoding Marsh's "when the twin moons synchronize" and designing the master-pattern system. Could be replaced with simpler "timing coordination" with moderate edits, keeping it mid-range. Participates in closure through the completed synchronization-enabling chart.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "adjacent possibilities" method is explained as how the eternal flame reveals hidden patterns and how her overlay charts create a master intelligence network. Signaled in the first third ("shadows that revealed adjacent possibilities"). Shapes her encoding approach—she's exploiting what exists "alongside the obvious." The mechanic matters for the resistance payoff. Weakness: the mechanism is told more than shown in action; we don't see a specific moment where adjacent-possibility perception changes her tactical choice on the page. Lyric presence across the arc but limited dramatized use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory provides narrative necessity: her position as chart-decorator explains officer access, the navigation-room distribution network enables intelligence dissemination, and the closure announcement pressures the timeline. Autumn's dying light frames opening and closing. The dome setting recurs in three beats (opening, Crane visit, final wind rattle) with evolving pressure. Micro-setting (work table, eternal flame, embroidery tools) enables her methods. Not deeply irreplaceable (a similar trusted-access position could substitute) but well-integrated with visible consequences when Crane announces closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "before the coup" timeframe creates all urgency. Signaled early through officer discussions, tightened when Marsh specifies "the twentieth...twin moons," and compressed decisively when Crane announces "tomorrow night" closure. The deadline forecloses future chart opportunities and forces Vera to complete her work tonight. Time pressure shapes her final-threading choices and charges the ending: this is her last chance. The months-of-preparation backstory establishes cumulative effort now at risk. Live clock that alters final moves and makes cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated explicitly ("every unheard story she'd gathered") and shown through her months of listening to plotters. The motivation drives her intelligence work and years-long disguise. Appears in opening beats (listening to "echoed silence between words") and closure ("threading one last secret"). Weakness: friction between the desire and its costs is asserted ("years weaving," isolation implied) rather than dramatized in a specific moment where she weighs abandoning the mission. Functional motivation with thematic weight but limited on-page conflict-testing of the drive itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone of "echoed silence" operates through the pauses and implications Vera reads, the quiet intensity of secret encoding, and the officers' failure to hear what she's doing. Coherent across beats: atmospheric opening, tense but quiet interactions, whispered final image. Modulates appropriately—tightens during Crane inspection, opens for summary passages. The wind "whispers" and eternal flame's "patient burning" reinforce the tone. Charges the final image where she "listened to its whispers, threading one last secret" into silence. Strong tonal consistency that supports rather than dominates the pressure system.</comment>
