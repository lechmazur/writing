<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is vivid and particular ("light through a prism," "electricity through water"), but his transformation from adjuster to singer feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The shift happens through mystical transmission ("felt the weight of her story flooding through") rather than a dramatized internal conflict that forecloses options. Eliza's backstory provides mythic weight but Marcus's agency in the present remains passive—he receives, understands, and obeys rather than wrestles with contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is late (who/where/when coalesce only after the puppet discovery) but the piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early. The closure reconfigures Marcus's role through song and the puppet's light refraction, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization). However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("time itself learned to hold humanity") rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off that Marcus experiences on the page. The lens is Accumulative/Textural but the final cadence shift, while beautiful, doesn't demonstrably narrow Marcus's options or exact a visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is rendered with strong sensory detail ("bruised plum and copper," "pane of hush") and the lens apparatus becomes the instrument of closure, constraining Marcus's final action. Spatial choreography is clean (keeper's quarters → spiral stairs → lamp room ascent). The "pane of hush" recurs purposefully, and the lens refraction directly charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—adjusting humanity's countdown—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a tightening choice that narrows options. Marcus discovers, understands, and acts without internal conflict or external resistance. The transformation from mathematics to melody is a deepening of method, but it arrives through mystical revelation rather than a pressure-driven pivot with visible cost. No meaningful reversal or escalating complication forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of inherited burden and transformation through flawed beauty emerges organically from the puppet's cracks-as-map and the lullaby's transmission across lifetimes. The final image ("beautiful in its flaws, perfect in its breaking") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The nested-patterns motif accumulates meaning and charges the closure without becoming a stated thesis. "You are not alone" risks sentimentality but remains tied to the lullaby's concrete function.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature ("spider-webbed with cracks that formed a map of suffering he recognized"). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, fitting the mythic-lyric mode. However, the voice remains uniform across emotional intensities—descriptive and meditative even in the climactic singing scene—missing the rhythmic modulation under peak pressure that would reach high-band. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("Atlantic dissolved into something older than oceans") but approaches saturation in high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching. Stock constructions appear: "weight of her story," "terrible love and impossible hope," "something larger than fear." Paraphrase loops: "nested pattern within a pattern—a life within a death within a promise" restates the concept without advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks modifiers and abstractions where concrete image would sharpen closure. Template cadence in the singing sequence: "he sang to every...," "the puppet's eyes...," "the lighthouse beam..." Information density is moderate; many lines do one job when two would tighten momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The doomsday-clock-adjuster premise is fresh, and linking it to a lighthouse keeper's daughter who "wound time itself" offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc (discover → understand → accept burden → sing) follows a received chosen-one structure. The puppet as talisman, the lullaby as transformative magic, and the backward-moving clock are executed competently but don't offer a perspective that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (porcelain cracks, lens apparatus, quantum threads) are present but the core turn—mystical inheritance through touch—is familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Marcus appears early and his role as adjuster frames the premise, but his key choices are passive: he follows threads, touches the puppet, receives Eliza's transmission, and obeys the implied directive to sing. He does not weigh options, resist the burden, or forfeit a visible alternative. His decision to climb and sing is not shown as a choice under pressure but as an inevitability. Two beats (discovery, singing) but no causal agency that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The puppet head is present in three beats (discovery, transmission, placement in lens) and charges the closure by refracting light into nested patterns. Its cracks function causally (contain memories, conduct light) and its warmth signals transformation. However, it remains more conduit than constraint—Marcus never wrestles with whether to use it or faces a cost tied specifically to its brokenness. Strong closure linkage and specificity lift it into the 7–8 band, but irreplaceability is incomplete: another talisman could serve similar narrative function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Pane of hush" appears multiple times as atmospheric descriptor and metaphor for the temporal threshold, but does not shape tactics or constrain Marcus's choices. It functions as poetic texture rather than a stake-altering concept. Present in setup and closure but ornamental—removal would not break story logic, only reduce lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is named explicitly in the puppet's description and echoed in the final image ("beautiful in its flaws, perfect in its breaking"). It motivates Marcus's recognition and underpins the theme of cracks-as-wisdom. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—Marcus does not choose flawed singing over perfect silence, for example, or pay a price for imperfection. Present across beats and thematically central, but lacks the visible tradeoff needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe this burden to you" is the pivot line where Eliza's voice transmits the role to Marcus, redefining his purpose from quantitative adjustment to song. It drives the turn from discovery to action. However, the transmission is mystical rather than chosen—Marcus does not accept or refuse, and the mechanics are not contested. Present at the structural hinge and essential to the arc, but the ease of transfer reduces causal pressure. Two gates (middle, closure setup) met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" recurs throughout (cracks, lifetimes, light refraction, lullaby structure) and is signaled early as Marcus's professional lens. The lens apparatus refracts light "creating nested patterns of illumination" that directly enable the closure. The method is visible in at least two beats (puppet examination, lens activation) and shapes the final image. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how nesting achieves the time-reversal is asserted, not demonstrated through constrained choices. Early signal, closure linkage, but mid-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse is present in setup and serves as the sole location, providing the lens apparatus that becomes essential to closure. The spiral stairs structure Marcus's climb-as-transformation, and the lamp room's openness to sky enables the outward/inward light refraction. The setting supplies a concrete resource (lens) and spatial progression (ascent) that alter the final action's scope. Three gates met; strong closure linkage and purposeful constraint lift it above ornamental postcard use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" appears in setup and closure as poetic framing for the temporal stakes, but the timeframe does not tighten Marcus's decisions or create urgency. No live clock counts down; the "final ripple" is atmospheric rather than tactical. The thousand lifetimes are referenced but not tracked. Present and thematically coherent, but does not function as a pressure mechanism that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The desire to sing the lullaby across lifetimes is Eliza's transmitted motivation and becomes Marcus's enacted goal in the climax. It drives the final beat (climbing, singing) and is dramatized on the page rather than summarized. However, friction between this want and competing costs is absent—Marcus does not weigh personal forfeit, doubt his voice, or resist the burden. The lullaby itself is described as "cracking on the high notes" but this flaw is celebrated rather than costly. Two beats, closure-active, but lacks visible conflict between desire and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" is named once explicitly and sustained through diction choices ("bruised plum," "wound," "terrible love," "impossible hope") that blend damage and wonder. The tone modulates subtly from discovery's hush to the climax's tender urgency, and the final image's "beautiful in its breaking" integrates the bruised-awe register. Coherent through turns and present in the closure's charge, meeting the high-band test for tone that shapes the final image.</comment>
