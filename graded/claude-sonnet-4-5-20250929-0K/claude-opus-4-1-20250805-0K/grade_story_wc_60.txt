<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interior is labeled rather than embodied—"luminous skepticism transformed" is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The woman is spatially present but her relationship to Marcus never tests values or forces a hierarchy of commitments; they cooperate without friction. The final stance shift lacks visible cost: Marcus simply "understood" and "learned," which reads as convenient epiphany rather than earned renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is vague past 120 words: who the woman is, why she sits at this fountain, and what Marcus's arrival changes remain unclear until late exposition. The closure unit—fountains flowing again—occurs on the page, but causal linkage is weak: the feather "touches" time and memories "unstick" without dramatized resistance or cost. The geese resuming flight is coincidental to Marcus's ritual, not a consequence of his choice. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the final image delivers satisfaction without felt trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The city's dry fountains and crystallized time are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the central image. The stained glass box constrains Marcus's ritual at each basin, meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is selective and supports tone. However, spatial choreography is thin—Marcus and the woman walk "to each fountain" without distinct geography or physical obstacles, and the geese above never complicate movement or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Marcus and the woman cooperate without friction; no reversal narrows options or raises price. The ritual at each fountain reads as serial repetition rather than escalation. Agency is passive: the feather does the work, and the geese resume flight without Marcus making a renunciatory or high-stakes choice. No visible cost forecloses a path or alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fountain imagery and the concept of memories composting rather than trapped, which reweights the premise without overt moralizing. The final image—"defiant hush, no longer forgotten"—offers resonance. However, "skepticism and wonder were not opposites but dance partners" is a stated thesis rather than an earned insight from specific struggle. The ten-thousand-year ritual and cosmic patience remain abstract rather than dramatized through Marcus's choices or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Marcus, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts into lyric essay ("sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic") without grounding in Marcus's voice under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's telepathic "though her lips didn't move" is a curiosity that the text does not exploit for subtext or pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Marcus notices cosmic metaphors rather than character-specific biases.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is legible but carries repeated metaphor stacking ("thick and viscous as amber," "patient fury of geological ages," "temporal residue") that slows momentum without clarifying stakes. Paraphrase loops appear: "memories were never truly trapped" / "they were composting" restates the same idea. Template cadence recurs in "Marcus approached... Marcus felt... Marcus held..." Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") cluster in peak beats. Information density is uneven; the seventeen-year backstory and Prague/Kyoto anomalies are scaffolding that does not alter present choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—frozen geese as temporal markers, fountains holding crystallized time—offers surface novelty but follows a familiar template: traveler arrives at magical city, completes ritual with guide, restores balance. Marcus's seventeen-year quest and the ten-thousand-year alignment are told rather than shown; no specific lived detail or moral calculus transforms the archetypal frame. The stained glass box and feather function as keys without irreplaceable properties that arise from prior character choice or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his tracking of anomalies sets up the journey, but his skepticism is labeled rather than tested by a choice that carries cost. He cooperates with the woman without friction or renunciation. His "luminous skepticism transformed" is asserted at the end, not earned through a turn that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early, is carried to each fountain, and projects ghost-constellations that frame the ritual. It functions in multiple beats and the woman's fingers pass through it as liquid, demonstrating specificity. However, it serves as a key without unique properties that constrain Marcus's choices or create visible cost; a different container could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is used as a label three times but does not shape on-page tactics or alter options. The ten-thousand-year alignment is exposition; Marcus does not practice or enact patience under pressure. The concept is thematic decoration rather than a constraint that forces a trade-off or enables a specific action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" appears once in the final third as a descriptor of Marcus's transformed state. It does not constrain or enable an earlier action, nor does it create a visible trade-off. The trait is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a choice where imagination conflicts with skepticism and forces a cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unstick" is the central action: the feather touches crystallized time at each fountain, and memories unstick like photographs. It drives the ritual and reappears across beats, shaping the ending. However, the mechanics are ornamental—no resistance or cost attends the unsticking—and a near-synonym ("release," "free") could replace it without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Following breadcrumbs" is mentioned in the opening paragraph as Marcus's seventeen-year method, but the mechanics are summarized (Prague clocks, Kyoto shadows) rather than shown constraining a present choice. The method does not shape Marcus's approach to the ritual or alter tactics under pressure; it is backstory scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is established early, supplies the dry basins as the stage for the ritual, and each fountain is revisited in the resolution. The setting's crystallized time and stone dolphins create specificity. The fountains' shift from dry to flowing charges the final image and makes the closure legible, meeting closure participation and causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The geese's pause opens the story and their resumption marks the ritual's completion, framing the timeframe. The woman notes Marcus is "early" and the pause "usually" lasts three more hours, signaling time. However, the clock does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Marcus proceeds without urgency or time pressure, and the geese's flight resumes coincidentally rather than as a consequence of a timed choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Liberating trapped memories is Marcus's stated goal and drives his journey and the ritual. The woman's explanation—"memories were never truly trapped"—reweights the motive at the end. However, the desire is told rather than tested by friction: no competing want or cost forces Marcus to choose between liberation and another value, and the ritual succeeds without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" appears in the opening, mid-story, and final line, creating a tonal throughline. The phrase charges the city's silence with resistance and recurs at closure to reweight the fountains' song. Tone modulates slightly—from geese frozen to fountains singing—but remains consistent. The phrase is specific and purposeful, though it does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure.</comment>
