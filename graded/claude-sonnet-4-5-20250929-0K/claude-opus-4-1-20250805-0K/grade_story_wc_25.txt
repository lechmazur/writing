<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's maintenance expertise and gait-recognition ability motivate his navigation choices, and the board's forced listening embodies an earned shift. However, the coin-as-grandfather's-artifact and his twelve-year accumulation of knowledge read as backstory exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending choice—gifting the coin—feels more symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a lived path with visible cost; Chen's acceptance is told ("finally understanding") rather than shown through embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (Marcus in container port during storm) and the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: whispered warnings accrete into validated marks, then crystallize at closure when Chen acknowledges them. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: authority forced to recognize the whisper-system), but the cost remains conceptual and off-page—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing lands in the final image. The challenge set-up ("prove whispers travel farther") is declared early, yet the storm conveniently delivers the test rather than Marcus engineering it, and the coin's "warm" moments read as convenient atmospheric cues rather than causally earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth during geomagnetic storm provides concrete spatial constraints (GPS dead, compasses wild) that force Marcus's map-and-gait method. Aurora light, metallic groaning, and acoustic amphitheater effects are vivid and purposeful. The graffitied validation marks on XB-471 charge the closure image by making the whisper-system visible. Micro-setting (the coin's warmth, brass key tapping) functions as tactile anchor, though the zodiac coin's constellations "revealing hidden paths" reads more mystical than material constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove whispers outpace shouts) is signaled in paragraph two and tested when the storm kills electronics. One meaningful tightening occurs: Chen's panic forces her to follow Marcus's method. However, the escalation is situational coincidence (storm arrives) rather than protagonist-driven pressure; Marcus does not choose the challenge's timing or create the conditions that validate him. The procession of workers and Chen's capitulation feel summarized rather than dramatized with a visible trade-off or cost that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—soft-spoken wisdom versus loud authority—emerges through the whisper-validation marks and acoustic design rather than stated moral. The final image (coin pressed into Chen's palm, workers learning Marcus's gait) offers a resonant answer without overt thesis. However, the closing line's meta-commentary ("wisdom traveled best in whispers, spreading… like aurora light between metal walls") abstracts the theme into a tidy summary rather than trusting the dramatized particulars to carry it forward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Marcus's perceptual signature (reading gaits, layering maps, recognizing boot-falls) is distinct and consistent. Diction stays grounded in maintenance-worker idiom. Chen's single line of dialogue ("How did you—") and Marcus's interruption carry subtext (authority yielding to expertise). The phrase "calculated spontaneity" in the final line feels like external narrator editorializing rather than Marcus's internal lexicon, and "a whispered prayer through the metal canyon" shifts into elevated metaphor during a practical navigation beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries noticeable template cadence: repeated "he'd [past perfect]" scaffolding in paragraphs 3–4, and several lines paraphrase prior content (e.g., "The zodiac coin grew warm" echoes the earlier warmth claim without new pressure). The closing paragraph stacks three metaphors (whispered prayer, aurora light, wisdom traveling) that blur rather than sharpen the final image. Paragraph-cut test: the grandfather-coin backstory in paragraph two does not alter present stakes and could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination—gait-recognition, folded-map layering, whisper-validation graffiti—offers a specific synthesis. However, the core premise (undervalued expert proves worth during crisis when systems fail) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived moral calculus or non-obvious cost. The zodiac coin's mystical constellations and the storm's convenient timing read as ornamental genre moves rather than a fresh angle on authority-versus-expertise stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's map-layering and navigation choices drive two beats (leading the procession, reaching XB-471) and the closure hinges on his whisper-system being validated. His agency is central.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three moments (carried in pocket, grows warm during walk, pressed into Chen's palm at end) but its constellations "revealing hidden paths" are mentioned without on-page use; the warmth cue is atmospheric rather than causal. The final transfer reweights it as teaching-tool symbol, lifting it above ornamental, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Folded maps are handled twice (paragraph 3 layering discovery, paragraph 5 route-finding during storm) and enable Marcus's navigation tactic. The translucent-overlay method shapes his ability to find the emergency corridor. The concept is seeded early and pays off at closure when the route proves fastest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Gait-recognition is seeded in the opening line, enables Marcus to identify Chen's panic-stride and predict her route, and returns when other workers recognize his "distinctive rolling gait" and follow. The trait constrains his method (he navigates by sound when sight fails) and charges the final image as workers learn his rhythm.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The challenge is declared in paragraph two and frames the storm-test, but the validation arrives via Chen's convenient need rather than Marcus engineering the proof. The challenge sets expectation but does not drive a middle turn; it is more frame than action-beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The brass key appears in paragraph six, used to tap rhythm patterns that reveal hollow versus loaded containers. It enables safe-passage detection during the walk. The "key with no lock" conceit is honored (it opens nothing, only resonates) and the specificity—grandfather's collection, tapping method—makes it functional rather than generic tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth provides spatial constraint (ever-shifting layout), acoustic channels, and graffiti-validation surface. The storm forces reliance on Marcus's map-memory rather than GPS, and the labyrinth's daily reconfiguration justifies his archive. Setting drives tactics and supplies the closure's physical anchor (XB-471's marked wall).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present throughout (aurora painting walls, compasses spinning, GPS dead), creates the crisis (medical supplies needed "within the hour"), and forces the navigation method. The one-hour deadline tightens the walk but is not tracked beat-by-beat; urgency is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation (prove whispers travel farther than shouts) is declared in paragraph two and tested when Chen must follow Marcus's quiet method. However, the desire is more thematic frame than on-page friction; Marcus does not struggle with doubt or cost during the walk—he executes confidently. The win is delivered to him by storm-coincidence rather than a choice that forces want-versus-fear trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" appears in the final line as authorial summary rather than modulating through the narrative. The tone throughout reads methodical-expert rather than spontaneous; Marcus's careful map-work and patient observation dominate. The phrase names a quality not consistently embodied on the page.</comment>
