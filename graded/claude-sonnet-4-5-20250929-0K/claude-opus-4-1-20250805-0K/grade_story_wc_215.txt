<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization shows purposeful restraint—her seventeen years of solitary survival and her careful observation align with her final choice to remain as keeper. However, her motivation shifts from survival to preservation feel more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grandfather's "tranquil perception" and "mute eloquence" are told attributes rather than dramatized through competing desires. The final stance of tending silence reads as thematic position rather than a choice with visible internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery of the box → ghost gestures → understanding the covenant's failure → decision to preserve. Orientation anchors (Mara, oasis, post-apocalyptic timeline) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara's decision to remain and preserve the silence forecloses the path of leaving or speaking, with the conceptual cost visible in her commitment to solitude. One minor lens wobble: the ghost subplot introduces light Situational pressure (their gestures force interpretation) but resolves back to Accumulative mode at closure, maintaining coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned apiaries and stained glass box provide strong sensory anchors—"white boxes bleached by decades of desert sun," "amber and crimson panels catching dawn light." The oasis setting constrains Mara's existence and the box's placement among rotting hives charges the discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (shelter, hives, box location). The desert's "slow consumption" returns at closure to pressure the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the collective dissolved—is signaled early and tightens through discovery (box → photographs → letters). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the covenant hadn't failed because of what was said, but because of what wasn't," which reweights her grandfather's silence. The ghosts' gestures provide external pressure that forces interpretation. However, escalation is primarily cognitive (realization) rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost; the decision to stay feels like acceptance rather than a trade-off that narrows live alternatives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tangled covenant, preserved letters, phantom bees, and the grandfather's wordless devotion all accumulate toward the weight of silence and failed communication. The final image—"luminous weight of their collective failure and love"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The stained glass box as vessel for unspoken words avoids symbolic convenience by being introduced early and working throughout. Minor slip: "mute eloquence" is slightly too on-the-nose as a phrase, though the concept itself is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited through Mara's lens. Perceptual signature is consistent—"careful steps of someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing." The prose carries a distinct lyric register appropriate to post-apocalyptic solitude. However, several phrases drift toward elevated diction that strains the voice: "tranquil perception," "mute eloquence," "museum of unfinished conversations." These feel more authorial than character-filtered, creating minor distance wobbles in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and clear propulsion. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "Their movements traced patterns she recognized—the old inspection routes, the careful choreography of tending living hives" paraphrases the same idea across the dash. The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" and "mute eloquence" lean purple in context. Some metaphoric density in the final third ("buzzed like phantom bees in colored light," "luminous weight...heavy and luminous as honey") stacks figurative language without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in "To protect the bees. To sustain the community. To preserve the oasis."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic beekeeper premise risks familiarity, but the stained glass box containing preserved letters and the ghosts as silent communicators offer fresh angles. The tangled covenant as both legal document and living thing that fails through silence rather than conflict provides a non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and the metaphor of silence-as-inheritance. However, the "last keeper of a dying world" frame and the ghosts-returning-to-finish-business trope remain recognizable genre furniture, only partially transformed through the specific beekeeping/communication angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara appears early (first sentence) and her reclusive astonishment drives the discovery sequence. She makes one key choice at closure—to remain and preserve—but the astonishment element is more told ("never seen") than dramatized through visceral reaction. Two beats: discovery, final decision. Setup and payoff present; middle development is observational rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box is introduced in paragraph two, handled physically ("lifted the box carefully"), and returns in the final paragraph to charge the closing image. Three distinct beats: discovery, opening/reading contents, carrying to shelter. Its specific properties (colored glass, warmth, containment of documents) enable Mara's understanding and shape the closure metaphor. Causal pressure and closure linkage both present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tangled covenant appears early (paragraph three), shapes Mara's understanding of the collective's failure, and the realization that promises became "incompatible knots" drives her interpretive arc. It constrains her understanding of her grandfather's silence and enables the thematic payoff. Present in setup, middle realization, and implied in closure. However, it functions more as backstory explanation than a force that alters present tactics or forecloses options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is attributed to the grandfather ("his eyes...held the same tranquil perception") but functions as label rather than constraint. The attribute is told in a single beat and does not enable or foreclose any on-page action. No visible cost tied to this specific trait; it could be replaced with "patient" or "observant" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Gazing appears in multiple beats: Mara gazes through the glass at the covenant (paragraph three), reads the ghosts' gestures, examines photos and letters, and "gazed through the amber panel...one last time" at closure. The action enables understanding and frames the final turn. However, it's largely receptive; replacing "gaze" with "examine" or "study" would not break story logic. Closure participation present but specificity/irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled in paragraph five ("Through contextual clues in their movements, she read their need") and demonstrated as Mara interprets the ghosts' gestures. The method shapes her understanding (middle beat) and enables the realization that drives closure. However, the phrase itself reads slightly mechanical—a visible seam where the method was inserted—and the mechanics could be condensed to "she read their gestures" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is established in the opening line and shapes every beat: the rotting hive frames provide the discovery site, the empty hives frame the ghosts' movements, the scorched desert pressures Mara's isolation, and "the desert would continue its slow consumption" charges the final image. The setting provides both spatial constraint (shelter, hives, oasis boundaries) and thematic resonance (extinction, preservation). Essential across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts become visible" is marked ("the morning the ghosts appeared," "ghosts had started appearing at midnight") and the dawn/sunrise boundary creates urgency as "ghosts began to fade with the rising sun." Two beats constrained by this window. However, the time pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical—Mara doesn't race against the dawn to accomplish something specific. Setup and middle present; closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" crystallizes explicitly in paragraph nine ("understanding her purpose now") and drives the final choice to remain. It's dramatized through Mara lifting the box, reading the letters, and choosing to stay as keeper. However, the motivation is more realized than conflicted—no on-page tension between preservation and an alternative desire (escape, speech, destruction). Setup late (~60%), development and closure strong, but lacks friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" operates throughout: Mara's wordless observation, the grandfather's teaching "through example rather than explanation," the ghosts' gesture-based communication, and the final commitment to "letting the preserved silence speak its own truth." The tone modulates from discovery (observational) to realization (interpretive) to acceptance (elegiac) while maintaining coherence. The phrase "mute eloquence" appears explicitly in the final third, which feels slightly on-the-nose, but the tonal execution across beats is consistent and charges the ending image.</comment>
