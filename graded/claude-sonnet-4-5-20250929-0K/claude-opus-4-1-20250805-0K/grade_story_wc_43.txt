<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior state is articulated ("I have a different kind of timeline now") but her dying process remains abstract—we get serene professionalism without embodied fear or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "decisively kind hands that never trembled, even now" tells rather than shows internal conflict. Secondary characters (Dr. Williams, patients) exist primarily to receive Maya's project rather than apply immediate pressure that forces her to alter tactics. The final choice to mount the vinyl and play the recording feels inevitable given her role, but the cost of leaving (physical decline, unfinished relationships) is implied rather than foregrounded in micro-choices that alter her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the rooftop recordings layer over weeks, culminating in the framed vinyl circle that reunifies old and new. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final gathered moment and the mounted vinyl promise continuation with the conceptual cost of Maya's departure legible. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya decides to "execute a flawless goodbye" and begins the recording project, narrowing her final weeks to a singular artistic-pedagogical act. The causality holds under the accumulative lens, though the weeks of work are compressed into summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden—Radiant Haven, tenth floor, bamboo, fountain, clouds at eye level—is vividly rendered and recurs across the arc. The vinyl fragment and harp case anchor micro-setting. The rooftop's elevation and light charge the final gathering, and the glass walls create a spatial boundary between Maya and the morning shift. The framed vinyl mounted on the garden wall provides a concrete object that constrains the ending tableau. Sensory detail is selective (chamomile/honey scent, elevator ding, cart squeak) and filtered through Maya's professional ear for sound-as-music, though the hospice interior below remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya must model "how to find [music] in living with knowledge of the end" for her patients after receiving terminal results. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to record the hospice sounds and reunify them with the broken Beethoven fragment, a choice that forecloses private grieving in favor of public pedagogy. The final gathering enacts that choice with the conceptual cost of using her remaining weeks for others rather than herself. No on-page reversals or obstacles test her commitment; the project proceeds smoothly from decision to execution. Coincidence does not resolve, but the lack of friction (no equipment failure, no patient resistance, no physical collapse) keeps pressure atmospheric rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vinyl-as-continuity image: the cracked Beethoven fragment paired with the new recording forms "a complete circle, cracked but whole." The recurring "hymning the mundane" and "scent of hope" motifs accumulate meaning without stating a thesis. The final mounted vinyl and Maya's parting line ("proof that every goodbye could be a beginning") offer a resonant answer to the central question—how to model living with the knowledge of death—without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries (sick/well, dying/living) by reunifying them as "instruments in the same sprawling symphony," though the resolution leans toward consolation without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she hears the world musically ("elevator's ding into melody," "ventilator becoming a rhythm section"). Diction remains clean and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Dr. Williams' "The results?" and Maya's reply advance knowledge economically. Brief convergence at the ending ("The music hung in the morning air like a promise") reads intentional, elevating the final image. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Under peak stress (receiving terminal results), the narrator's texture compresses appropriately ("four weeks, maybe six") without losing character specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong. Minor overwriting in the opening: "suspended between earth and sky on the hospital's tenth floor" states what the prior image already showed. "Decisively kind hands that never trembled" is assertive labeling rather than embodied gesture. The phrase "pulsing stillness" recurs twice, and "the scent of hope—that's what Maya called the particular blend" interrupts momentum with exposition. "Hymning the mundane" and related passages ("making sacred the ordinary sounds") lean toward stock lyricism. No paraphrase loops or syntactic uniformity. Sentence openings vary. Information density is high in the recording-project paragraph. The final paragraph's triple parallel ("their breathing, their presence, their willingness") is purposeful but borders on rhythmic sameness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hospice music therapist facing terminal illness is a familiar premise; transformation depends on specificity. The vinyl-fragment-as-continuity image and the practice of recording hospice sounds offer fresh particulars. "Hymning the mundane" as a signature method adds texture, though the phrase itself feels borrowed from spiritual-practice idiom. The rooftop garden and the craftsman mounting the frame provide grounded detail. The final vinyl circle is a purposeful synthesis that grows from prior material. Risk-taking is modest: the project proceeds without setbacks, and the ending's promise of beauty-in-leaving is earnest rather than ambiguous. The piece commits fully to its consolatory premise without retreat, but the smooth arc and tidy reunification resist darker counter-readings.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya decides to create the recording project (middle beat) and stages the final gathering (closure beat). Her serene professionalism shapes the opening tone and her musical lens filters sensory detail throughout. Her choice to "execute a flawless goodbye" initiates the project and her final bow closes the arc. Present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) with two distinct beats and closure linkage. Causal pressure is moderate: the project is her response to the terminal diagnosis, but no on-page obstacles force tactical shifts. The cost is implicit—using her final weeks for others—but not dramatized in micro-choices that alter her stance under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vinyl fragment appears in the opening (setup), is mounted mid-story (development), and paired with the new recording at closure (payoff). Handled in three distinct beats: found in Room 403, commissioned into a frame with space beside it, fitted with the new vinyl at the final gathering. The matching of old and new "forming a complete circle, cracked but whole" charges the ending image and reweights the continuity theme. Specificity: "Half of Beethoven's Ninth, cracked clean through the 'Ode to Joy'" makes the object irreplaceable. The element shapes the project's symbolic core and the closure tableau, though its mechanics (why these two pieces match physically) remain convenient.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"The scent of hope" is named twice: the chamomile-honey tea in the opening conversation and "drifting through the space" at the final gathering. Setup and payoff present, but no middle development. The scent does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as thematic atmosphere. The second mention expands from literal tea to "something ineffable rising from the gathering itself," reweighting the phrase with modest resonance. Swappable: another sensory anchor could serve the same function. Lyric reprise with light thematic charge, but no causal pressure or felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Decisively kind hands that never trembled, even now" is the sole on-page mention. Setup is present (first third), but the trait does not constrain or enable a later action with visible cost. The hands are told-only; we never see Maya make a kind choice that forecloses a self-protective option. No development or payoff beats. The label asserts her character without dramatizing a tradeoff between kindness and self-preservation. Ornamental: removing the phrase would not alter the arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reunification drives the core project: Maya records disparate hospice sounds and layers them ("reunified—not as sick and well, dying and living, but as instruments in the same sprawling symphony"), then physically reunifies the broken Beethoven vinyl with the new recording. Setup in the opening reflection on the cracked record showing "serene on one side, fractured on the other." Development through the weeks of recording. Payoff when she fits the two vinyl pieces together and mounts them. The action shapes the closure image and embodies the continuity theme. Swappability is low—reunification is the story's conceptual spine. Cost is implicit (her final weeks spent on this labor) rather than foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is named and demonstrated in the opening (elevator ding, breakfast cart squeak) and enacted in the final scene (breathing, presence). Setup and payoff present. Development: the recording project applies the method across weeks, transforming ventilator, chemotherapy drip, and footsteps into music. The method defines Maya's professional signature and generates the album that closes the arc. Mechanics matter: sound-layering with harp and voice creates the reunified symphony. Causal linkage: the method enables the project, though its execution is summarized rather than dramatized in discrete beats. Specificity is moderate—"hymning" could be replaced by "transforming" or "celebrating" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Radiant Haven rooftop garden appears in all three gates: opening setting, site of the conversation and the mounted vinyl frame, and location of the final gathering. The tenth-floor elevation and clouds-at-eye-level detail charge the "suspended between earth and sky" symbolism. The glass walls and spatial anchors (bamboo, fountain) ground the scenes. The rooftop's nickname and light quality shape the patients' experience. The setting enables the closure tableau and supplies the wall where the vinyl is mounted. Constraint is light: the rooftop does not narrow Maya's tactical options, but it charges the final image with its liminality. Integration is solid but not indispensable—the project could occur elsewhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" anchors the opening; "four weeks, maybe six" specifies the remaining time. "Over the following weeks" compresses the project phase. "On her last morning of work" marks closure. Setup and payoff present; development is implied in the summary transition. The timeline tightens Maya's decision to "execute a flawless goodbye" but does not visibly alter her tactics beat-to-beat—no missed deadlines, no physical decline that forces shortcuts. The clock is tracked loosely rather than live. Cost is conceptual (choosing to spend final weeks on the project) but not dramatized through time-pressure choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"I want to execute a flawless goodbye" is stated in the opening conversation and drives the recording project across the arc. Setup and development present; payoff when she mounts the vinyl and plays the recording at the final gathering. The motivation is articulated and pursued, shaping her choices to record, commission the frame, and stage the event. Friction is minimal: no on-page conflict between wanting a flawless execution and the messy reality of dying, no moment where perfection must be sacrificed. The desire is told and enacted, but contradictory impulses (fear, regret, desire to flee) do not act simultaneously in scene. Causal linkage is clear; cost is implied rather than foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named twice: after Dr. Williams' question and at the ending. The opening rooftop scene balances quiet (sitting, tea, bamboo rustle) with the city waking below. The final gathering holds still (wheelchair patients, gathered staff) while the recording plays, then releases into Maya's harp performance. Tone modulates from morning contemplation to collective ritual without dissonance. The phrase charges both moments with a held-breath quality. Coherence is strong, and the tone supports the theme of finding music in dying. Swappability is moderate—another paradoxical phrase could serve. The tone does not shift under peak pressure (no urgency or breakdown), which fits the Accumulative lens but limits dynamic range.</comment>
