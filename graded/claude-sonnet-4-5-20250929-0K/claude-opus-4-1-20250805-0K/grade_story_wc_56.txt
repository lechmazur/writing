<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is present and her journey has conceptual clarity, but the realization arrives through extended reflection rather than contradictory impulses forcing choice under pressure. The parallel between van der Meer's confession and her father's deception is told more than dramatized—we never see her wrestle with staying versus returning in a beat where both wants act simultaneously. Embodiment is thin; "serene upheaval complete itself within her chest" labels the state rather than showing contradictory physical responses. The final decision to "sit with her father" feels declared rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the sundial discovery, van der Meer's confession, and Mara's mirrored realization accumulate toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation is clear early (barge, twilight, Amsterdam). However, the closure unit—Mara recognizing her own evasion—arrives primarily through summary reflection ("She'd run from that knowledge") rather than a concrete image or action that reweights prior material with visible cost. The decision to return home is stated as future intent, not enacted on the page, so the cost remains conceptual and displaced. The lens holds, but the ending lacks a charged final image that makes the repricing undeniable in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The barge, canal, twilight, and Magere Brug are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's archaeological attention ("trained instincts," "fingers to read surfaces like braille"). The sundial as micro-setting object constrains her discovery and charges the final moments when she pockets it. Sensory selection is strong: "mirror-black water," "bridge's reflection, creating an impossible shadow." The canal's "held breath" directly supports the serene upheaval tone. The setting does guide the contemplative frame, though it does not force a tactical choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what she's been seeking—is signaled early and sustained. The sundial's hidden compartment provides one meaningful tightening that deepens knowledge and shifts Mara's understanding from external mysteries to internal evasion. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than enacted: no live option is foreclosed by a choice she makes on the page. The decision to confront her father is declared as future action, so the cost remains prospective rather than paid in the present scene. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening beat is sufficient, but the lack of on-page agency at closure limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth salvaged from the architecture of lies—emerges organically from van der Meer's confession and Mara's parallel evasion. The sundial's inscription and "impossible shadow" image carry conceptual weight without becoming allegorical. The final recognition that "every legend she'd sought had been a mirror" offers a resonant answer to the central question, though it edges toward explicating the theme rather than embodying it fully in image. The piece resists tidy morals and allows ambiguity (we don't see the father confrontation), but the closing paragraph's direct articulation ("she'd finally found what she'd been seeking all along") flirts with thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Mara's perceptual signature (archaeological attention, "trained instincts," reading surfaces) is consistent and voice-appropriate. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "serene upheaval" and "architecture of lies" recur enough to feel slightly templated. Psychic distance is consistent, with purposeful compression in the reflective passages. The narrative stance modulates appropriately between present action and memory, though the heavy reliance on past-tense summary in the middle third ("She'd found," "She thought of," "She'd run") creates a slight distance from immediacy. No dialogue to assess, which is acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and largely free of artifacts. Information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, the middle section relies on summary scaffolding ("She thought of," "She'd spent," "She understood now") that recounts rather than dramatizes key realizations. The phrase "serene upheaval" appears twice, and "architecture of lies" three times; while thematically intentional, the recurrence without fresh context borders on template cadence. Sentence variety is present, but runs of "She'd [verb]" in the backstory section flatten momentum. The closing image—pocketing the sundial, touching the canal wall—provides concrete action, but the final paragraph's explicative summary ("she understood that every legend") tells what has already been shown. Minor loop: "salvaging truth" recurs in nearly identical form.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The parallel between a historical merchant's confession and a modern archaeologist's evasion is a solid premise, not wholly original but executed with care. The sundial with hidden compartment and the twilight canal setting provide specific anchors. However, the "chasing mysteries to avoid personal truth" arc is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through an unexpected turn or lived detail that makes it feel inevitable in hindsight. The ending opts for thematic articulation over a fresh final image, which lowers originality. Emotional specificity (father's sweatshop deception) adds some freshness, but the resolution remains in the comfort zone of self-realization without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (errant legend seeker) is present throughout and her identity shapes the frame. She makes one key choice—to return home and confront her father—but it occurs as declared future intent rather than enacted decision with immediate cost. The character drives the accumulative structure and is essential to closure participation, but her agency is more cognitive than dramatic. Early signal, two-beat involvement (finding sundial, reading confession), closure linkage as intention. Swappability is low. Deductions for future-tense resolution and lack of on-page cost tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears early (opening paragraph), is handled physically (turned in hands, clicked open), and returns at closure (pocketed). Its inscription shapes Mara's reflection, and its hidden compartment provides the key tightening beat (van der Meer's confession). The "impossible shadow" image charges the final third. Three-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity. Does not resolve a problem it did not create. Strong integration, though the sundial's symbolic work (hindsight, truth) is stated more than it emerges from unique object properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is signaled early ("only now… did she understand") and threads through the story's logic: the sundial measures time backward, van der Meer's final entry offers retrospective truth, Mara's realization depends on looking back. The concept shapes the dominant stake and is integrated into the inscription ("Only when the sun sets on certainty does wisdom rise") and the "impossible shadow" moment. However, it functions more as theme than as a constraint that alters tactics or options on the page. Closure linkage is strong but largely conceptual. Early signal, closure participation, moderate causal pressure. Deductions for thematic echo rather than enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once in the opening line ("thoughtfully clear moment between day and night") and does not recur or constrain action. It describes the narrative tone but does not function as a character trait that enables or limits a choice with visible cost. The moment of clarity Mara experiences is more a product of accumulated reflection than a trait she employs. Ornamental use, no middle development, no closure-beat participation beyond ambient tone. Late implicit echo in "finally able to see," but the attribute itself is absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup as character trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Salvage" appears in van der Meer's phrase ("salvaging truth from the architecture of lies") and Mara's resolution ("salvage truth from her own past"). The action is thematic rather than physical—no on-page scene where Mara literally salvages an object or document under pressure. The word frames her intention and the story's concept, but the major turn (opening the sundial, deciding to return home) could function without this exact verb. Early signal via van der Meer's journal, closure echo, but swappable with "uncover" or "reclaim" without structural loss. Moderate thematic integration, low causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Training instincts" is signaled early ("her trained instincts drawing her to a false wall") and enables the key discovery beat (finding the sundial). The method recurs: "fingers to read surfaces like braille," "practiced touch" opening the compartment. Two distinct beats where the means matters and alters what Mara can access. However, the method does not constrain a choice or shape the closure image; once the sundial is found, instinct plays no further role. Early signal, middle involvement, no closure-beat use. Causal pressure in setup, specificity present. Deductions for absence in final third and lack of cost tied to this skill.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is present throughout, anchors every beat, and directly supports tone and stakes. The canal's "held breath," the Magere Brug lights, and the "mirror-black water" all charge the reflective atmosphere. The barge drifting (engine cut) creates the spatial stillness that allows Mara's contemplation. The setting does not force a tactical choice, but it supplies the metaphorical and literal frame ("docking" coincides with resolution). Early signal, continuous presence, closure participation (barge touches canal wall as she decides). High specificity and irreplaceability. Strong integration under Accumulative lens; setting as charged space rather than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Morning radio" appears once in a negation ("no morning radio would break tomorrow's dawn") with no setup or payoff. The phrase gestures toward a timeframe (night into morning) but does not track time, tighten decisions, or create urgency. The story's temporal frame is twilight-to-dusk, not shaped by radio silence. The element is ornamental, introduced late (second half), and easily removable. No setup, no middle development, no closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction; further deduction for zero causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to understand the architecture of lies—is signaled early via van der Meer's phrase and sustained as her reflective goal. The desire is dramatized through her thirty-year quest and the moment she recognizes her own evasion. Internal friction is present: she chased external mysteries to avoid confronting her father's deception. However, the motivation is more cognitive than conflicted in action; we do not see her wrestle between staying on the barge versus docking, or between keeping the sundial versus releasing it. Early signal, two-beat involvement (van der Meer's entry, her realization), closure linkage as intention. Cost is conceptual rather than enacted. Deductions for told-friction and future-resolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named twice and embodied throughout: the canal's stillness paired with Mara's internal reckoning, the "impossible shadow," the twilight as threshold. Tone modulates subtly (calm observation → memory → recognition → resolve) without breaking coherence. The oxymoron charges the final image ("serene upheaval complete itself within her chest") and supports the Accumulative lens. Early signal, continuous presence, closure participation. However, the phrase is stated rather than fully enacted in contradictory physical responses, and its recurrence without variation borders on template. Strong integration with minor execution slip.</comment>
