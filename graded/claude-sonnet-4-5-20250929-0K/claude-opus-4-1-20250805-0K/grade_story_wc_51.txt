<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to weave and collect weights is established early, and her internal state is embodied through the fractal work and relationship to objects. However, the piece leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "weights of burdens") that replaces concrete micro-choices under pressure. The father memory provides emotional texture but the present-tense stakes remain largely conceptual; we don't see her wrestle with a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending gesture—holding "the weight of weightlessness itself"—reads as philosophical summary rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara weaves progressively larger fractals, layering meanings until the whalebone structure completes. However, no on-page reversal or tightening changes her options or knowledge in a way that creates before/after legibility. The closure image—fractal completing, father's loop visible, burner cooling—offers atmospheric resonance but lacks felt cost; nothing is foreclosed, no path chosen over another. The ending reads as a meditative return to the same state rather than a reconfiguration with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight, lamp burner, and whale-rib fractal are vivid and purposefully filtered through Mara's craft-focused perception. The burner's weight (seventeen grams) recurs and the grotto's acoustics shape her weaving technique, constraining her to remain within its walls. Sensory hierarchy is strong: metallic chill, oxidation patterns, shingled hush, and the tactile warmth of the burner all ground the scene. The micro-setting (body, tool, grotto) does constrain her choice to stay, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's compulsion to weave and collect weights—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the whalebone fractal's complexity and the moment when "objects remembered their purposes," but no on-page choice narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece describes escalating pattern-work without a reversal or visible cost; she begins and ends in the same position, boundary-lessly trapped by choice. The lack of a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path keeps this below the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: self-imposed prisons, the paradox of freedom within constraint, weights made visible. The lamp burner and whalebone structure recur with shifting meaning, and the father's ritual cleaning becomes a meditation on incomplete understanding. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some prisons we weave ourselves") rather than letting the image carry the weight unaided. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the ending's modest explicatory tilt prevents full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptual signature: fractal-weaver diction, craft-specific noticing, and metaphors rooted in geometry and weight. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during weaving, wider for backstory). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped"—that remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping, and the register matches Mara's contemplative, artisan stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several passages loop conceptually: the "boundary-lessly trapped" idea is restated three times without added pressure, and "seventeen grams" recurs as incantation rather than tactical detail. Mixed metaphor in "whale-rib" fractals that "breathe with prehistoric patience" and "calcify" blurs the physical logic. Elevated diction ("oxidized brass," "vertices," "sediment") is consistent but occasionally drifts toward ornamental density in high-pressure beats, slowing momentum. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("weightlessness," "paradox," "prayer to patterns") where a sharper image would land harder.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—fractal weaver trapped by her own art, measuring emotional burdens in geometric patterns—offers a specific synthesis of craft, metaphysics, and constraint. The grotto's bronze acoustics and the lamp burner as grief-anchor are memorable particulars. However, the piece edges toward familiar territory: the artist imprisoned by their gift, lighthouse keeper's daughter seeking light/truth. The emotional truth is handled with specificity (father's ritual, grandmother's death in brass weight), but the ending's philosophical pivot ("some prisons we weave ourselves") feels anticipated rather than freshly earned. The whalebone reverie and shingled hush push the texture into distinctive territory, preventing full derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is on the page throughout and her weaving drives each beat, but her actions are iterative rather than decisional. She traces patterns, adds weights, completes the fractal—observation and craft-work without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "smile, her first in months" and decision to "begin again" tomorrow are told rather than dramatized with stakes. Present in setup, middle work, and ending, but the closure does not hinge on a choice she makes; it describes a cycle she will continue. Functional across beats but does not create a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lamp burner appears in setup ("long ago exhausted its fuel"), anchors a memory of grandmother's death ("seventeen grams"), is touched mid-scene ("she reached for the lamp burner"), and returns at closure ("cooled in her palm. Seventeen grams"). It carries emotional weight and recurs with reweighted meaning (from anchor to remembered purpose to final tally). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter her tactics; it remains a symbolic touchstone rather than a tool that changes options. Strong lyric reprise and emotional charge, but lacks causal pressure on her decision-making.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears as atmospheric description ("whispered with the shingled hush," "The shingled hush grew deeper," "the shingled hush of dimensions settling"). It evokes the grotto's acoustic quality and layers of silence, but never constrains a choice or changes Mara's options. Present in setup and ending as mood rather than mechanism. Ornamental and swappable with any phrase for "layered quiet."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is stated explicitly in the second paragraph ("She was boundary-lessly trapped here, free to leave yet unable to cross the threshold where her weavings would unravel") and echoed at closure ("boundary-lessly trapped and absolutely free"). It labels her paradoxical constraint but does not drive an on-page action with visible cost. We are told she cannot leave, but no scene tests this limit or shows her choosing to stay over a concrete alternative. Present as thematic claim without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Calcify" recurs: "Each one calcified in the air," "Her fractal began to calcify faster now," "in its crystallized perfection." The term describes the fractals hardening from ephemeral geometry into near-solid form, marking progression in her work. It signals the whalebone structure's completion, which anchors the ending. However, this transformation could be replaced with "solidify," "crystallize," or "set" without altering the story's logic. Present in middle beats and at closure, shaping the arc of her work, but not uniquely irreplaceable. One major beat (the whalebone reverie completing) traces to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled early ("she could weave patterns that captured weights beyond human experience") and detailed mid-scene ("tilting her head until the constellations aligned with the grotto's natural vertices," "aligning her body with the grotto's bronze acoustics"). The method enables her to weave the whalebone fractal and hear "the weights singing." Present in setup and development, it shapes her technique and the middle beat's success. However, it does not constrain a choice at closure or create visible cost; it is a craft skill she has already mastered. Two-gate presence (setup, middle) without closure participation caps at ~6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto anchors every beat: its walls contain her fractals, its acoustics shape her weaving, its vertices align with starlight to enable her method, and its accumulated weight becomes part of her final pattern. "The bronze walls held their stories in oxidation patterns" charges the closure image. The setting constrains her physically (she cannot leave without unraveling her work) and enables her craft (reflection, acoustics, containment). Present in setup, pressures middle choices, and participates in the ending's conceptual weight. Essential to story logic and the whalebone reverie's success.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" appears in the fourth paragraph as backstory anchor ("After the first snowmelt, when the world above turned soft and yielding, she had discovered this truth") and in the penultimate paragraph ("Tomorrow, after sunrise painted the grotto gold"). It marks seasonal context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock or deadline alters her tactics. Present but ornamental, easily removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "collect the weights of different burdens" is stated in paragraph two and demonstrated through her weaving: grandmother's death, mountains dreaming, oceans remembering, the grotto's accumulated stories. The whalebone structure adds "weights beyond human experience." Her work is driven by this motivation across multiple beats. However, no friction tests this desire; she encounters no cost or conflict in pursuing it. The ending affirms rather than complicates her collection. Functional across beats and tied to closure, but lacks dramatized conflict between want and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is named explicitly ("This was her whalebone reverie, the meditation that came when starlight filtered through bronze") and establishes the tone: contemplative, meditative, vast, prehistoric. The tone remains coherent through the piece—lyric, patient, accretive—and modulates subtly when the burner warms ("objects remembered their purposes") and when she smiles. The final image carries the same elegiac patience. Tone is stable and purposeful, charging the ending without dramatic shift. Strong coherence and closure participation, but a single static register prevents the highest band.</comment>
