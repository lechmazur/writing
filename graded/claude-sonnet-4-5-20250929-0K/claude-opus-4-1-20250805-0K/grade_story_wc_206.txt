<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias exhibits clear motivation and makes the pivotal choice to tether the chip to all boxes rather than just one, showing agency under pressure. His interior experience—"understanding flooding through him"—feels functional but edges toward convenient epiphany without sufficient prior contradiction or struggle. The wilting sensation provides embodied stakes, and Vex's decay offers external consequence, though Elias's competence never truly wavers or costs him a visible mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The causal chain holds: Elias's decision to tether all boxes → combined resonance → light breaks curse, with Vex's intrusion providing a micro-turn that escalates stakes. Closure is a Decisive Change (dawn restored) with felt cost to Vex and conceptual cost to the Covenant, though Elias himself pays no visible price—the triumph arrives without personal forfeiture, which slightly dulls the edge of the ending's weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly realized—copper walls, thousand mended boxes, acoustic design that reveals Vex's whisper—and directly enables Elias's tactic (the mirrors and combined song). Sensory detail (wilting sensation, brown spots on tools, chip's warm light) tracks pressure and filters through Elias's POV. The chamber constrains and resources the final move, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting integration at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore dawn/break the Covenant) is signaled early and tightens when Vex bursts in, forcing Elias to complete the work under immediate threat. However, the tightening arrives via external coincidence (Vex's arrival) rather than Elias's prior choice creating the complication, and the resolution costs Vex but leaves Elias unscathed—no visible trade-off or stamina/resource depletion that alters his tactics. One meaningful pressure point is present, but the lack of personal cost at closure keeps this from the 8.0+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (trust/honesty vs. power/betrayal) emerges organically from the Covenant's origin and Elias's method—mending through truth rather than force. The final image (dawn breaking, "seed of honesty that bloomed into day") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The closing paragraph's "understanding why they came apart" edges toward thematic summary but stays rooted in Elias's craft, and the particulars (mirrors, patient labor, music boxes as testimony) ground the abstraction sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent and the perceptual filter (repairman's eye for mechanisms, resonance) feels character-specific. Vex's dialogue ("The Council demands your progress") and Elias's careful reply carry subtext and goal-pursuit. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("sympathetic vibrations," "tether... threads of pure silver... sung into existence") in ways that feel more authorial than a tinkerer's internal voice under pressure, and the narrative certainty about the Covenant's history ("when the first midnight council stole...") exceeds what Elias would plausibly narrate mid-repair without filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive with strong imagery (rust spreading, chip pulsing, boxes opening "like a flower"). Minor template cadence in the exposition paragraph ("Since that cursed hour... iron rusted...") and slight paraphrase loop between "stuck inside" and "refused to play" in paragraph three. The phrase "tinker's wonder made manifest" in the penultimate paragraph lands as thematic label rather than image, and "wings of a simple repairman's song" in the final line tilts slightly purple. Density is high, but figurative language clusters without always earning its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair + philosopher's stone + rust-as-lie-detector offers a non-obvious angle, and the mirror mechanic (patient installation over decades) provides earned setup. The tinkersong frame feels fresh. However, the core emotional arc—solitary craftsman defeats corrupt council via patient craft—echoes familiar underdog-artist templates, and the Covenant's dissolution arrives without complication once the boxes sing; no counter-move or cost to Elias's triumph. The world rules (lies → rust, light trapped in stone) are vivid but not transformed beyond their initial premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's choice to tether the chip to all boxes (not just one) is the pivotal causal decision that drives closure. He appears in every beat, makes the key tactical call under pressure, and his patient prior labor (mirror installation) pays off. The role is essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The philosopher's stone chip is introduced paragraph one, handled throughout (placed in music box, tethered with silver, pulses with light, glows brighter as boxes resonate), and becomes the agent of closure (releases sunlight, breaks Covenant). Its unique property—trapped light—shapes the entire tactic and final image. Removing it would collapse story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Covenant of Rust is established early (paragraph two: "Since that cursed hour... iron rusted at the mere whisper of a lie"), pressures Elias on the page (wilting sensation, tools spotting with rust as Vex lies), and its dissolution is the story's climax. It constrains tactics (must weave truth into repair) and supplies the antagonistic force. Integration is strong across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "wilts near dishonesty" trait (wilting sensation, brown spots on tools) appears mid-story and signals Vex's lies, creating on-page pressure and informing Elias's understanding. It drives one key moment (realization of Vex's betrayal) and accelerates Vex's decay at closure. However, it does not constrain Elias's own choices with visible cost—he never must choose between honesty and expedience. Present in two beats with causal work, but the cost is externalized to Vex.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Tether" is the central action: Elias tethers the chip to the mainspring with silver threads (paragraph four), then extends the tethering to every box in the chamber (paragraph eight), which creates the combined resonance that breaks the curse. The tethering mechanic is unique, prepared by prior setup (resonance chamber design), and drives both the middle escalation and the closure turn. Swapping it for "connect" or "bind" would lose the specific constraint of sung-silver threads and acoustic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is introduced paragraph three ("not broken... yet it refused to play") and explicitly returned in the final paragraph ("some things are fixed not by forcing them back together, but by understanding why they came apart"). The method shapes Elias's approach (weaving truth into repair rather than mechanical force) and thematically charges the closure. It appears in setup, informs the tactic, and resonates at the end, though the mechanics could be more visibly tested mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced paragraph two, supplies resources (copper walls amplify song, mirrors reflect light, acoustic design reveals whispered lies), constrains the tactic (Elias must work within its harmonics), and enables the climax (combined song of all boxes). Removing it would break the story's spatial and causal logic. The setting is indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears in Elias's reply to Vex and frames urgency, but the story does not track a ticking clock or deadline that alters tactics. Vex's intrusion provides tempo, yet the work's duration and remaining time are vague. The phrase recurs thematically (balance between betrayal and trust) but does not tighten decisions through measurable time pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reclaiming stolen light is the dominant stake, signaled paragraph two ("the one stolen when midnight itself grew teeth") and dramatized throughout: Elias places the chip, works under rust-pressure, and the climax is the first ray of sunlight piercing the dome. The motivation drives every choice and the entire causal chain. However, Elias's internal conflict over the cost of success is minimal—he never doubts or sacrifices a competing want. Strong setup and closure linkage; modest friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" coheres across the piece—music boxes, sympathetic vibrations, patient craft, the resonance chamber as sanctuary—and modulates appropriately (focused calm → tension under Vex's arrival → triumphant crescendo). The final image ("tinker's wonder made manifest," "simple repairman's song") explicitly charges the tone at closure. Minor slip: "tongue dripped honey while his heart pumped tar" (paragraph five) tilts slightly gothic-grotesque, briefly tensioning the tinkersong register, though it recovers quickly.</comment>
