<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to understand emotion as mathematics—is concrete and drives her choices throughout. The borrowed personalities create internal contradiction ("felt all her borrowed selves simultaneously"), though the mechanism feels more conceptual than embodied in peak beats. The final realization ("emotion wasn't mathematics at all") arrives as assertion rather than earned discovery through on-page cost. The seventeen-mouth smile ends with a gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through borrowed personalities and vanishing stars, building to a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph: emotion reframed as typography, "the art of arranging empty space around meaning." Cost is conceptual—Mira can no longer distinguish her original self—and legible in "couldn't remember which personality was originally hers." One tightening occurs when the halo fragment's donor presence intensifies mid-piece, deepening the transposition stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under vanishing stars is vivid and constrains Mira's work: "crystalline walls caught and refracted the diminishing starlight into prismatic patterns across her printing plates." The constellation Empatheia's erasure functions as both setting pressure and timeframe, narrowing from seven to four stars. The letterpress and halo fragment are handled concretely across beats. The final star "held on, defiant" charges the closure image with environmental resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving personalities/stars through transposed empathy, signaled early ("each borrowed personality left traces"). Pressure accumulates as stars vanish and borrowed selves argue, creating internal turbulence. The halo fragment intensifies the transposition mid-piece, forcing Mira deeper into another's grief. The ending tightens understanding but does not foreclose a tactical path with visible cost—she continues her work, now enlightened. One meaningful deepening present; escalation reads more as revelation than choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mechanics: emotion as typography, preservation through empathy, the dissolution of self into collective experience. The final insight—"everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The mathematics-vs-typography pivot is purposeful, though it leans toward conceptual assertion rather than arising solely from dramatized particulars. Recurring images (stars, printing, empty space) support rather than state the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV with consistent third-person limited distance. Perceptual signature is distinctive: "lucid turbulence—perfectly clear chaos, like reading seventeen different texts printed on transparent sheets stacked atop each other." Diction stays elevated but voice-consistent ("tasted like metal and ozone," "texture of falling"). No head-hopping. Under peak stress (multiple personalities arguing), the prose maintains coherent focalization through Mira's lens without breaking into therapy-speak or losing narrative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled with high information load per sentence. Figurative language is heavy throughout—"constellation of meaning," "mathematics of ink and pressure"—but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "The sensation was," "The letters she chose," "The halo fragment grew." No paraphrase loops. Opening and closing images anchor well. The metaphor density occasionally slows momentum in non-closure beats but never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Core premise—cryptic letterpress operator who borrows personalities to create ambiguous broadsheets under vanishing stars—synthesizes familiar elements (empathy transference, dying cosmos, artisan craft) into a cohesive, non-obvious frame. The mathematics-to-typography pivot offers a fresh inflection. The "seventeen different mouths" closure image commits fully to the premise's implications. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and dense metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: plot and arc would not transfer cleanly to a generic setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's choices structure the piece: she presses the halo fragment to her temple (inciting the borrowed personality), sets type deliberately, prints a hundred copies, and arrives at the typography insight. Present in setup, middle development, and closure. Her decisions drive beats and the final realization, though the ending insight feels more received than actively chosen under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (setup), is pressed to Mira's temple to activate transposition (middle beat), grows warm as the donor's presence intensifies (second middle beat), and is touched "one last time" at closure to align all borrowed selves. Handled concretely across at least three beats. Its "residual divinity" property matters to the sorrow-taste and the final alignment, though removing it would not break the story's core logic—another empathy token could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is the engine: Mira borrows personalities wholesale to understand clients, experiences "complete transposition of self," and the accumulating traces create the central conflict ("all her borrowed selves arguing"). It shapes her tactics (choosing letters, printing ambiguous messages) and the closure realization that "everyone was already everyone else." The concept is irreplaceable; no near-synonym would preserve the story's stakes or final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Habitually borrowing personalities is the mechanism of every beat: Mira has "developed an unsettling gift," uses it with the halo fragment, and the accumulated cost—"couldn't remember which personality was originally hers"—is the closure's felt price. The trait enables the transposition action and constrains her self-knowledge. Without this habit, the story's conflict and ending dissolve. Visible tradeoff present on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Disorient" is explicitly the method: Mira's broadsheets are "precisely calibrated to disorient through deliberate ambiguity, to make readers question which thoughts were originally theirs." It frames her artistic purpose and the thematic work. However, the disorienting effect is told rather than dramatized in a reader's reaction on the page. The action shapes her goal but does not create a major turn or alter her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is Mira's stated method ("precisely calibrated to disorient through deliberate ambiguity"), signaled early and enacted in the cryptic broadsheet text: "THE HORIZON DRINKS LIGHT / YOUR SHADOW PRECEDES YOU / BY THREE DAYS." The method connects to the theme (questioning original thoughts) and the closure insight about typography as "arranging empty space around meaning." Its mechanics matter to her artistic process, though it does not constrain a choice under pressure or alter the ending's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is present in setup, middle, and closure. Its "open roof" and "crystalline walls" provide the starlight necessary for Mira's work and refract it into "prismatic patterns across her printing plates." The workshop fills with drying sheets that create "a constellation of meaning to replace the failing stars above," charging the final image. The setting's transparency and light-catching properties are irreplaceable to the story's visual logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-stars timeframe structures the entire piece: three of seven stars gone by opening, "another star vanished" midway, only four remain by the resolution, and "the last star of Empatheia held on, defiant" at closure. Each disappearance marks a beat and tightens the urgency of preservation. The timeframe is a live clock that alters Mira's understanding and charges the ending image with cosmic stakes. Removing this element would erase the story's temporal pressure and thematic scaffold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to understand emotion as mathematics is stated early ("the mathematics of emotion had always fascinated her"), drives her borrowed-personality practice ("emotional derivatives, sentimental integrals"), and is renounced at closure ("emotion wasn't mathematics at all"). The motivation is present across beats but mostly told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The shift from math to typography feels more like conceptual pivot than friction between wants and costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is named explicitly and embodied throughout: "perfectly clear chaos, like reading seventeen different texts printed on transparent sheets." The tone holds coherent through the accumulation of borrowed selves arguing, the "calculus of human connection," and the final alignment into "a single, impossible truth." Elevated diction and dense metaphor maintain the charged ambiguity. The tone modulates with pressure—calm in setup, layered during transposition, crystallized at closure—and charges the final "seventeen different mouths" image.</comment>
