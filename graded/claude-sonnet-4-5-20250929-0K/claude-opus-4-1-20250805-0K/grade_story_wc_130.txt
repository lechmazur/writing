<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Morrow's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete (phosphorescent pigments, months of mapping), but her emotional progression remains abstract—"buried optimism...bloom into understanding" is summary rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor Elias is told rather than shown; his vanishing and transformation into "emotional mathematics" sidesteps the earned grief or anger that would render Morrow's search visceral. The final acceptance ("absence...was just another form of presence") reads as epiphany declared rather than a choice with visible cost, leaving her agency untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by the carved steps). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Morrow leaves the eyes on the mosaic and commits to return, crystallizing her stance toward loss. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no tactic is foreclosed, no relationship altered. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of glass eyes, mosaic chips, fungal rings building to a reweighted understanding), but the final image restates theme ("mathematics of emotion...always balanced") rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (placing the eyes reveals Elias), yet the turn feels convenient: the eyes unlock exactly what she sought without friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vivid and purposeful: dripping stalactites nourish apple trees, bioluminescent fungi spread as calculations, mineral deposits form the chipped mosaic pattern central to the puzzle. Sensory detail is selective and integrated (limestone-filtered water, eternal twilight, frequencies below hearing). The mosaic stepping stone constrains Morrow's choice—she must place the eyes "precisely where two specific chips intersected"—and charges the final image when she leaves them there. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding Elias's disappearance via the mosaic and glass eyes) is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the eyes are placed and the fungi reveal Elias as an equation. Yet escalation is minimal: Morrow encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and faces no competing pressure. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned by a difficult choice. Coincidence provides the solution (the eyes fit the chips exactly) without Morrow's agency narrowing options or paying a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Ambiguous loss" and "mathematics of emotion" are named repeatedly rather than discovered through scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "absence, properly calculated, was just another form of presence...The mathematics of emotion, she now knew, always balanced." This states the thesis instead of letting the mosaic, eyes, and fungal patterns embody it. The conceptual frame (love transcends form, conjurers persist as influence) is interesting but told rather than enacted, and the ending offers a tidy resolution ("theme always balanced") rather than a resonant question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Morrow; no head-hopping. The prose carries a measured, slightly elevated register consistent with a "secretive conjurer" and her methodical nature. Diction choices like "dovetailed," "phosphorescent pigments," and "geometric language of glowing fungal threads" maintain voice. However, peak-beat interiority drifts into abstraction: "emotion operated on different mathematics" and "perpetually solving for connection" feel more like essay than embodied perception. Dialogue from Elias ("The formula that lets love persist despite physical absence") is articulate but lacks subtext or goal-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "presence and absence," "here or gone, alive or dead," "disappeared and death" are restated across adjacent lines. The metaphor stack in the final third ("loss...incomplete proofs in emotion's infinite equation") layers abstraction without grounding in concrete image. Template stems recur: "She'd spent months mapping," "She'd puzzled over this phrase endlessly," "She left the glass eyes...knowing she'd return." Figurative language in the closure beat ("buried optimism...bloom into understanding," "ancient arithmetic") elevates diction without clarity gain, triggering a −0.5 deduction for density and coherence drift in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—conjurers who vanish into mathematical forms of emotion, sustained in a cavern orchard—is imaginative and specific. The mosaic-as-equation and glass eyes as interface offer fresh angles. Yet the core turn (mentor transforms into pure presence via emotional mathematics) echoes familiar "love transcends death" templates without complicating the calculus. The resolution is convenient: Morrow finds exactly what she seeks with no ambiguity, no price, no rival claim. The final image restates the premise rather than transforming it, and the orchard's centuries of conjurers feels like worldbuilding ornament rather than a stake that pressures Morrow's choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Morrow is present throughout and her choices frame the action (descending, positioning the eyes, deciding to return). However, her decisions do not create key turns; the turn is provided by the eyes revealing Elias. She observes and accepts rather than choosing between competing paths. Her choice to leave the eyes and return tomorrow is a micro-commitment without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Early signal and closure presence are met, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass eyes appear early (in the satchel, wrapped in velvet), are used in a central beat (placed on the mosaic to activate the fungi and reveal Elias), and are left on the stone at closure, reweighting Morrow's relationship to absence. They enable the story's sole meaningful turn and participate directly in the final image. Their unique property (seeing "more than flesh ever could") matters. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ambiguous loss" is thematized throughout: Elias "existed in the ambiguous space where loss refuses clear definition, neither fully gone nor entirely present." The concept shapes Morrow's question ("Can you return?") and Elias's answer ("Return suggests I've left"). Yet it functions more as a thematic overlay than a stake that alters tactics on the page. Morrow never faces a choice structured by ambiguity—she simply learns that loss is ambiguous. Early signal, thematic presence, but low causal pressure and no cost tied to the ambiguity itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is mentioned once: Morrow was "gently inventive in her approach, using phosphorescent pigments to trace the invisible connections." The trait is told rather than demonstrated through on-page action with cost. The phosphorescent tracing is summary of prior work, not a live choice. The phrase recurs as "the gentle inventiveness of love finding new expressions" in the resolution, but this is thematic echo rather than a constraint or tradeoff. Present but ornamental; swappable with "methodical" or "patient" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears once: "Morrow's careful nature had always dovetailed perfectly with Elias's wild theories." This is past-tense characterization, not an on-page action. The story's present action is placement of the eyes and acceptance of Elias's transformation; no moment of dovetailing (fitting two efforts together precisely) drives a turn. The term could be replaced with "complemented" or "balanced" without altering structure. Functional background but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone is introduced early ("at the orchard's heart"), its chipped patterns are mapped by Morrow across months, and the eyes must be placed "precisely where two specific chips intersected" to activate the revelation. The mechanics matter: the chips form a sequence (joy, sorrow, longing, release) and Morrow has spent time decoding them. The mosaic is present in the final image when she leaves the eyes on it. Strong setup, clear mechanism, closure participation, and causal pressure (the placement is the key act). Specificity and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. It supplies resources (mineral water, bioluminescent fungi, dripping stalactites) that enable the revelation and shapes the choice to work "undisturbed" after the orchard grows silent. The setting's unique properties—limestone-filtered water "rich with memories of ancient seas," eternal twilight, fungal rings as calculations—are integral to the story's logic. Morrow's decision to return and continue learning "this ancient arithmetic" ties closure to place. Strong setup, beat involvement, closure linkage, and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon—when the surface world sleeps and mineral water ceases its rhythmic dropping" is mentioned in the opening and sets nocturnal atmosphere. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No clock pressures Morrow, no duration is tracked, and the choice to return "tomorrow night" is stated without urgency. Present as setting detail but not as a stake or constraint. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To understand the mathematics of emotion" is Elias's goal (cryptic notes) and becomes Morrow's when she decodes the mosaic. The motivation is signaled early, sustained, and resolved when she comprehends that "emotion operated on different mathematics." Yet the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. Morrow's months of mapping are summarized; no on-page friction between this want and another need or fear appears. The final understanding is delivered rather than earned through a choice that forecloses an alternative. Early signal, thematic presence, but low dramatization and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Buried optimism" is named once in the resolution: "the buried optimism that had sustained her search finally bloom into understanding." The tone is coherent—Morrow's patient search, the orchard's nurturing imagery, and the acceptance of presence-in-absence all support a hopeful stance. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure (no despair or doubt appears on the page), and the single explicit mention in the final third feels inserted rather than embodied throughout. The ending image (leaving the eyes, returning tomorrow) carries quiet hope, but the phrase "buried optimism" itself is ornamental rather than charged. Thematic presence without strong causal or rhythmic integration.</comment>
