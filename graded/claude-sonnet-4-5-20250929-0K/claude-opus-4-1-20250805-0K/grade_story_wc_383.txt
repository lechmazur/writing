<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior life is heavily filtered through abstract, poetic language ("tragically radiant," "skeptical of her own emptiness") that distances the reader from embodied emotion. The core motivation—recovering archived memories—is credible, but key moments lean on lyrical assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final integration choice feels thematically inevitable but arrives without visible struggle or on-page cost that forecloses a live path. Minor issue: "charmed by the peace but haunted by its price" reads as therapy-speak summary rather than a dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the seashell's whispers deepen across the night, density increases through layered memory fragments, and the final reunion of shell halves reweights the quarantine premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina digs and discovers the second half, crystallizing her choice to reintegrate. However, the closure—"memories came not as trauma but as teaching"—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; the final image of rainbow patterns feels decorative rather than charged with a choice that forecloses a path. Felt cost is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vividly established with selective, mood-driven detail: purple blooms that "absorb the dying light," petals brushing ankles, dirt under fingernails. The garden constrains Marina's search spatially and supplies the buried shell half, directly enabling the climactic discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency as the night progresses. The seashell itself functions as micro-setting, its "resonance structures" and "calcium carbonate lattices" grounding the memory mechanism in tactile, specific detail that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering quarantined memories—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina digs and finds the second shell half, narrowing her choice to integration or continued emptiness. However, the resolution lacks on-page resistance or visible trade-off; Marina simply "chose how to remember" without dramatized cost or a path visibly foreclosed. The whispers guide her without complication, and the final flood of memories arrives as gift rather than earned through struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—integration versus separation, memory as architecture—emerges organically from the seashell's fragmented structure and the Cognitive Quarantine premise. The final image of memories "learning to dance" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, lines like "memories weren't diseases. They were architecture" and "not as trauma but as teaching" veer into direct thematic statement rather than letting the shell's reunion dramatize the insight. The velvet garden and shell recur purposefully, but the closing wisdom feels slightly platitudinous ("carrying both her grief and her grace") rather than particular to Marina's lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "inverse stars," "archaeology in reverse," "tragically radiant." Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with emotional immediacy—"ghostly resolve," "incandescent with grief," "resonance structures"—reading as writerly rather than character-particular under peak pressure. The final paragraph's poeticism ("memories learning to dance") feels authored rather than focalized through Marina's exhausted, dirt-streaked present. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong images: "purple blooms so dark they seemed to absorb the dying light," "dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars." Information density is high. However, several beats loop conceptually: "skeptical of her own emptiness, charmed by the peace but haunted by its price" restates without advancing; "not as trauma but as teaching, not as weight but as wings" is a paraphrase-loop within one sentence. Template cadence appears in the closure paragraph: "no longer… but simply," "not by forgetting but by choosing," "not as… but as…" Figurative language is dense throughout without clear pattern-teaching, bordering on overwriting in high-pressure beats. Minor −0.6 for loops and template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The Cognitive Quarantine concept offers a fresh speculative frame, and the seashell-as-archive device is specific. However, the core emotional arc—recovering lost memories to reclaim wholeness—follows a familiar therapeutic journey without sharp inflection. The resolution's imagery ("memories learning to dance," "tragically radiant") leans on stock poetic phrasing. The velvet garden and shell are evocative but not irreplaceable; a different object-and-setting pair could carry the same arc with minor edits. Derivative Premise penalty −0.5: the premise closely matches recovery-through-integration templates, and transformation is partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina is the sole on-page character and labeled "charmed skeptic" in the prompt. Her skepticism is mentioned early ("skeptical of her own emptiness") but does not constrain a key choice; she follows the whispers without hesitation. The "charmed" aspect appears as lyrical acceptance rather than a trait that enables or blocks action. Present and consistent with tone, but replaceable with "determined seeker" or similar without structural loss. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seashell appears in the opening line, drives the search across multiple beats (listening, following whispers, digging, reuniting halves), and anchors the closure image. Its "resonance structures" and "calcium carbonate lattices" are specific and irreplaceable. Removing it would break the story's logic and metaphor. However, its mechanics—how it stores memories—are asserted rather than tested under pressure; Marina never doubts or misinterprets its guidance, slightly reducing causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quarantined memory shapes the premise, motivates Marina's three-year absence, and defines the stakes (reintegration versus continued emptiness). The Institute's procedure and its consequences are signaled early and govern Marina's goal. The closure directly addresses the concept when memories flood back "differently now." However, the mechanics of the quarantine—how it worked, why it failed, what the Institute might do—remain abstract; Marina faces no on-page complication from the quarantine itself, only from locating the shell. Present across beats and tied to closure, but the concept's pressure is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears twice as a descriptor of Marina's past grief state but does not constrain or enable a present choice. It functions as backstory color and thematic label rather than a trait with visible cost. The final paragraph inverts it ("no longer tragically radiant but simply, fully, herself"), but this is asserted resolution rather than demonstrated trade-off. Label-only use; swappable with "overwhelmed by sorrow" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Archive" appears in two forms: the Institute archived her trauma, and her younger self "found a way to archive what they were archiving." This double archiving is clever and drives the premise. However, the action itself—how young Marina encoded memories into the shell—is recounted in summary rather than shown influencing a present beat. The term recurs and underpins the logic, but the mechanics are told, not tested. Lyric reprise (early mention, closure payoff) elevates it to mid-6s despite lack of middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Resonance structures" are introduced early as the shell's mechanism: "overlapping waves of sound and memory that made the air itself shiver." The term recurs and is specific to the seashell's function. However, Marina never manipulates or tests these structures; they simply work when she listens and reunite when she presses the halves together. The method is present and consistent but does not shape tactics or force a choice. Functional but replaceable with "psychic imprint" or similar with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden at twilight is established in the opening paragraph and remains the sole setting throughout. Its "midnight flowers," darkness deepening across the night, and earth that hides the second shell half all constrain Marina's search and supply the resources (the buried shell) necessary for closure. The garden's sensory details—perfume, brushing petals, dirt—are woven into action and reflect Marina's emotional state. Time progression (twilight to dawn) tightens the search. Removing this exact setting would require restructuring the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—twilight to "when the last star fades into morning light"—is signaled early and tracked across the night: "as the hours passed," "as darkness deepened," "just as the last star faded." The passage of time creates urgency and marks Marina's commitment (she digs all night). The dawn arrival charges the closure image with renewal symbolism. However, the clock does not impose a hard deadline or force Marina to choose between competing goals; it functions more as atmospheric scaffold than tactical constraint. Strong scaffold, moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated explicitly in the resolution: "She'd translated her isolation into independence not by forgetting but by choosing how to remember." This is the story's thematic spine and matches Marina's arc from Institute release to self-directed recovery. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; Marina never wavers between continued isolation and the risk of reintegration. The motivation is coherent and present but lacks on-page friction or visible cost. Thematic claim more than enacted struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" appears twice: in the middle ("Marina understood, with the ghostly resolve of someone accepting their own haunting") and at closure ("ghostly resolve solidified into living determination"). The tone is consistent throughout—liminal, elegiac, suffused with memory and twilight—and modulates subtly as Marina moves from passive listening to active digging to final integration. The phrase charges the ending by marking the transformation from spectral to embodied. However, the tone remains uniformly poetic without pressure-driven variance; intensity does not spike or compress under urgency. Coherent and purposeful but static in emotional register.</comment>
