<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edmund's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices (sealing the bottle, writing specific details) that reveal hierarchy of values. The stoic-sensitive trait is embodied through restraint ("something loosened in his chest") rather than labeled. Internal contradiction operates in the tension between official duty and emotional archiving, though the choice to preserve remains predictable rather than forced by competing goods. The grandmother backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts his stance, but the emotional arc remains steady rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (shore surveyor, pavilion island, post-drawbridge). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered description and ritual acts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Edmund completes his archival gesture and departs, forecloses rescue-fantasy, accepts the pavilion's fate with visible cost (leaving only ripples, carrying "weight of witnessed absence"). The closure lands on the page with felt cost and coherent lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when he moves from documentation to personal ritual (grandmother's story), reweighting the stakes from professional to elegiac.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective: barnacles, seaweed as "funeral bunting," chandelier "just inches above the waterline." The submerged pavilion constrains Edmund's movement (wading, tide turning) and charges the final image (ripples, hidden archive). Micro-setting elements (cornerstone gap, orchestra pit) enable the bottle-sealing choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The physical environment drives both the conflict (rising water, structural decay) and the closure action (sealing the note before demolition).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the pavilion's story before demolition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tide turns, forcing departure and narrowing Edmund's window. Agency is present in the decision to seal the grandmother's story in the cornerstone, a renunciation of official-only documentation with visible cost (whispered words "never appear in his official report"). The escalation reads as accumulative density and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, consistent with the inferred lens. The cost is legible on the page but remains emotional/elegiac rather than high-stakes trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "interlaced absence—how what was missing defined what remained" is enacted through empty seats, silent music, submerged spaces. The bottle-sealing ritual offers a non-literal answer to preservation-versus-loss without moralizing. The final image (ripples, "weight of witnessed absence") reweights prior material and resists tidy resolution. One friction: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is close to thematic echo, though it's embedded in Edmund's self-concept rather than a final-paragraph moral. Subtext operates in gesture (sealing with fresh cement, whispered words) and purposeful ambiguity (will the archive be found?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: Edmund notices structural details (subsidence angle, mortar gaps) and emotional resonances (ghost of music, warped floorboards). Diction remains within a surveyor-historian's lexicon with controlled elevation ("patient violence of water and time," "encrypted in glass and stone"). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: longer, textured sentences during immersion, shorter at the tide-turn urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor filter-verb presence ("felt it shift") serves voice rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The drawbridge groaned upward behind Edmund Harrow, sealing him on the island" anchors action, stakes, and isolation). Two minor frictions: "hushed blaze of late afternoon light" mixes fire and quiet in a strained vehicle, and "patient violence of water and time" approaches stock phrasing. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "interlaced absence" concept is stated then immediately explained with near-duplicate language. Figurative density is high in the middle third but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The surveyor-as-archivist premise transforms a familiar elegy-for-lost-places trope through specific ritual: notes sealed in demolition sites, grandmother's Chopin transcribed from memory, cornerstone archive. Emotional specificity (warped floorboards holding "ghost of music") avoids generic loss. The final image (returning at low tide to check the archive) is particular to Edmund's methodical character. One derivative element: climate-change-drowned-landmark has become a writing-exercise staple, though the story personalizes it through family history and occupational detail. Risk-taking in sustained elegiac tone without dramatic reversal heightens coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edmund's surveyor role is present in the opening, drives documentation beats mid-story (opening inkwell, recording subsidence), and shapes the closure choice (sealing the bottle in the cornerstone using "fresh cement from his kit"). His professional access and method enable the preservation ritual. Causal pressure: his occupation provides both the assignment and the tools. The decision to hide the grandmother's story is professional skill repurposed for personal mission, visible in the final act. Present across setup, development, and payoff with strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inkwell is introduced early (paragraph 2: "most precious tool," described with verdigris and crystal reservoir), used in paragraph 4 ("opened his inkwell with practiced care, dipped his pen"), and closed in paragraph 9 ("Edmund closed his inkwell, its click echoing"). Three beats, but the inkwell's function remains static: it holds ink for writing. The closure click provides atmospheric echo but doesn't reweight meaning or constrain the final choice. The bottle (not the inkwell) drives the climactic sealing. Present across setup and development, cameo at ending, but not causally active in the peak choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named in paragraph 4 ("how what was missing defined what remained") and demonstrated through concrete images: absent crowds make empty seats prominent, silence makes imagined music louder. The concept shapes Edmund's documentation approach (recording "ghost of music") and his preservation motive (saving stories that high tides threaten). It does not directly constrain a tactical choice but reweights his stake from structural assessment to elegiac witness. Present in setup and thematically active in development; the final image (ripples, archived dreams) enacts it without naming it. Lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake with cost in the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is labeled in paragraph 5 ("feeling everything while showing nothing") and enacted when "something loosened in his chest" at the memory of his grandmother—restraint cracking briefly. The trait constrains his behavior: he whispers words "that would never appear in his official report," a visible cost (professional vs. personal expression). The attribute enables the preservation ritual (sensitivity) while maintaining surveyor composure (stoic). Present in setup (implicit in careful documentation), labeled and tested in development, and implicit in the closure (departure "leaving only ripples" is stoic; the archive is sensitive). One clear on-page action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in paragraph 7: "he would need to wrest himself away from this cataloging of shadows." The word describes Edmund's anticipated departure but does not create a turn; the departure is already planned (tide turning, drawbridge at sunset). The action is not dramatized as a struggle—he completes his ritual and leaves cleanly in paragraph 9. Swappable with "tear" or "pull" without structural change. Functional mention that fits voice but does not drive a beat or constrain the ending. Present in middle third, ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced in paragraph 5 ("whenever he inspected foundation repairs in buildings scheduled for demolition, he would carefully place rolled notes inside the walls"), signaling his recurring practice. It shapes the climax: Edmund seals the grandmother's story "in a small glass bottle" inside the pavilion's cornerstone gap (paragraph 8), using "fresh cement from his kit." The mechanics matter (storm damage created the gap; cement seals it). The method defines his preservation approach and drives the final act. Present in setup as established practice, enacted in the closure with specific causal detail. The return promise in paragraph 9 extends its consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion pressures every choice: Edmund wades through knee-deep water (paragraph 2), the building shifts under his boots (paragraph 6), the tide turning forces departure (paragraph 7), and storm damage creates the cornerstone gap enabling the bottle-sealing (paragraph 8). The setting supplies the dominant stake (preservation before demolition) and the constraint (rising water tightens the clock). Micro-setting elements (orchestra pit, ladies' parlor, chandelier above waterline, cornerstone) structure Edmund's movement and choices. The environment is indispensable to tactics, escalation, and closure. Present in setup, pressures development, and enables the final act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drawbridge closure is anchored in the opening line ("groaned upward behind Edmund Harrow, sealing him") and the exit deadline is stated in paragraph 9 ("drawbridge would lower at sunset"). The turning tide in paragraph 7 creates urgency ("Soon, he would need to wrest himself away"). The timeframe shapes two decisions: moving deeper into the pavilion (paragraph 6) and completing the ritual before departure (paragraph 8). The clock tightens tactics and charges the final image (leaving before demolition tomorrow). Present in setup and development; pressures the ending without being tracked beat-by-beat. One clear causal tightening mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 3 ("He'd become something more than a surveyor—an archeologist of abandoned dreams, collecting the stories that high tides threatened to wash away") and dramatized through his actions: documenting overlooked details (paragraph 4), placing notes in walls (paragraph 5), sealing the grandmother's story (paragraph 8). Friction is visible between official duty (assess structural damage) and personal mission (preserve dreams), creating the whispered-words cost. The desire drives every beat and the closure. Present in setup, conflicted in development (duty vs. devotion), and fulfilled in the ending with visible cost (weight of witnessed absence). The label "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is close to theme-speak but tied to specific actions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is enacted rather than named until paragraph 9 ("hushed blaze of late afternoon light"). The tone is coherent throughout: quiet reverence (whispered words, careful rituals) layered with elegiac intensity (funeral bunting, dying building, patient violence). Diction choices maintain the tone: "ghost of music," "drowned world," "weight of witnessed absence." The tone modulates with pressure: textured immersion in middle beats, compressed urgency at tide-turn, resonant quiet at departure. The final image (ripples, archived dreams) is charged by the tonal accumulation. The mixed metaphor ("hushed blaze") is the one friction, but the tonal effect holds across turns and charges the ending.</comment>
