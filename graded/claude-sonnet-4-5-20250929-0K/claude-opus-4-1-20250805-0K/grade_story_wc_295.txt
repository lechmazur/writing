<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is declared but thin; her "unique gift" to heal with words never constrains a choice or creates internal conflict. The discovery arc (telegram → understanding) follows a clean line, but the protagonist remains observational rather than struggling with contradictory impulses. The collective burden is asserted thematically but does not dramatize Mira wrestling with a personal cost that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discoveries (telegram, dreams, star patterns) toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The ending reweights the premise (stars as generational relay) with felt isolation turned to shared purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly (observatory, Mira, three months in). However, the closure cost is conceptual and relational rather than a visible forfeiture; the final act is documentation, not a choice that narrows options, which keeps this in mid-band under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The observatory supplies concrete anchors (telescope, dome, brass housing, speakers) and the daylily telegram constrains the inciting question. Sensory detail is selective (starlight whisper, whale-song audio, pearl-and-gold dawn). The micro-setting (pressed flower, viewfinder, laptop) charges the closure act of documenting and passing forward. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the setting evolution (silent vigil → collective arrival) reflects the thematic shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the temple-star link and understand the generational relay. One meaningful deepening occurs when Hayashi realizes the inscriptions are predictions, narrowing the question from archaeological to astronomical. The final act is documentation rather than a choice that forecloses a live option; cost is conceptual (accepting the witness role) rather than a visible trade-off. Escalation is smooth but lacks a moment where agency visibly alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: generational witness, shared burden, daylily as brief comprehension. The final image (memory card inscribed, placed in atlas) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the healing-words gift is declared but never integrated into the thematic question, and the "midnight solace" phrase in the penultimate paragraph edges toward articulating the thesis. Subtext operates in the daylily's one-day bloom and the recurring marginalia, reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Mira. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature (starlight as whisper, equations in dreams) is character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("The stars don't wait," subtext in shared exhaustion). Free indirect style is clean. Minor register slip: "midnight solace of revelation" and "mournful and profound" edge toward elevated diction that does not fully match the established voice under pressure, but the effect is localized and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high in the discovery beats (telegram, star pulse, temple prediction). However, "understanding dawned slowly, like sunrise on an airless moon" is a stock metaphor, and "burden" recurs five times without reweighting. "Midnight solace" appears twice in the final third, the second instance ("midnight solace of revelation") reading like thematic echo. Minor paraphrase loop: "shared burden" and "burden was heavy, but shared" restate without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The generational-relay premise (each chronicler decodes, leaves clues) offers a fresh angle on cosmic-message tropes. The daylily-as-ephemeral-truth and variable-stars-as-clocks are specific. However, the healing-with-words attribute is ornamental, and the temple-inscriptions-as-warnings arc follows a familiar pattern (ancient knowledge rediscovered). The final act (documenting for the next seeker) feels inevitable in hindsight but does not transform the premise through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira appears in all beats but her role is observational and curatorial. She decodes, witnesses, and documents; the peak choice is to chronicle and pass forward, which aligns with her role but does not impose a visible cost or alter tactics. The lucid-dream-chronicler attribute frames the setup and closure but does not constrain a middle choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The telegram appears in three beats: discovery (inciting), study with Hayashi (middle), and placement back in atlas with her own addition (closure). It reweights from historical artifact to relay instruction. However, the daylily itself is primarily symbolic (ephemeral bloom = brief understanding) rather than causally active; removing the flower would not break the relay logic, only reduce resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shared burdens is articulated in dialogue ("burden of understanding," "carry this together") and enacted in the collective arrival of astronomers and the relay structure. It shapes the ending stance (witness, not prophet; document, preserve, pass forward). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or impose a visible trade-off; it functions as theme rather than a stake that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Heals-with-words is mentioned twice: her "unique gift" and "healing words softening the edge of cosmic loneliness." Both are label-only; she never uses the ability to mend a fractured mind on the page, and it does not enable or constrain any action. The attribute is ornamental and could be removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Witness is the dominant action: Mira and Hayashi observe the star pulse, decode the pattern, and accept their role as relay participants. The final act (chronicling) is an instance of witnessing. However, the action is continuous rather than turning; it does not create a before/after in tactics. The closure reweights the meaning of witnessing (from isolation to shared purpose) but the action itself is steady observation rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Variable stars appear in setup (V442 pulsed rhythm), middle (pulse sequence matches dream symbols; audio conversion sounds like whale song), and closure (the inscriptions predict via stellar variations). The method is signaled early and its mechanics (brightness fluctuations as morse code) matter to the discovery. However, the stars do not constrain a choice; they supply information rather than imposing a cost or altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory anchors all beats (silent dome, telescope, viewfinder, atlas, speakers). It supplies the telegram, the star data, and the space for collective arrival. The setting enables the discovery and houses the relay artifacts (atlas, memory card). However, it does not pressure a choice; it is a stable resource rather than a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled (three months stationed, dawn approaching, forty-three years since the telegram) but does not tighten decisions. Understanding dawns over the course of one night, but there is no live clock or deadline that forces a trade-off. The timeframe is tracked but does not impose urgency or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Decode-temple-inscriptions is the inciting question (telegram: "match the variable star patterns") and drives the middle discovery (inscriptions are predictions). However, it is a puzzle rather than a conflicted desire; Mira does not struggle between competing wants or costs. The motivation is clean but not dramatized as a choice under friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Midnight solace is coherent across beats (silent dome, whisper of starlight, mournful whale song, pearl-and-gold dawn) and charges the closure (solace of infinite space, purpose found in shared vigil). The tone modulates from isolation (burden drove prior chronicler to madness) to collective purpose. However, "midnight solace" is stated twice in the final third, the second instance reading as explicit thematic articulation rather than tonal embodiment.</comment>
