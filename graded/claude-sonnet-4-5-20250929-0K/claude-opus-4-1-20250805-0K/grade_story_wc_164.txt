<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The recollectionist's emotional texture is consistent—"cheerfully gloomy"—and embodied through concrete actions (humming, kneeling, singing). However, her interior remains observational rather than pressured by contradictory impulses; she narrates discoveries without facing a credible dilemma that forces a costly choice. The final reflection on paths changing form reads as insight without visible on-page renunciation or alteration of her collecting practice. Motivation is present but not tested under sufficient friction to earn a higher band.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph (orientation clean). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the recollectionist gathers fragments, reflects on their meaning, and the sprouts in the final third offer a Conceptual Repricing—paths don't disappear, they transform. However, the repricing arrives late without strong causal pressure building toward it; the sprouts feel seeded for thematic closure rather than earned through prior escalation. Cost is conceptual (the mystery deepens, work never finishes) but remains abstract rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or reweighted choice on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The iridescent cave is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (smooth crystal floor, rainbow cascades, breathing walls, luminescence) and establishes a liminal, purposeful atmosphere. The cave's dimming as day wanes and the discovery of sprouts in crystal cracks both ground the final turn in the physical setting. The geode functions as micro-setting that enables the protagonist's work and charges the closure image with the sprouts, clearing the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options under pressure; the recollectionist moves from discovery to reflection to departure without facing a complication that forces a costly trade-off. The sprouts at the end offer a conceptual reframe but do not emerge from protagonist agency or a prior pressure point. The cost (work never finishes, mystery deepens) is thematic rather than legible in a specific on-page forfeiture or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring images of scattered seeds, crater glass, and transliterated emotions, culminating in the sprouts that reweight the central question without stating a moral. The final image—paths transforming from roads to seeds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "why some paths disappear." However, the thematic payoff arrives without being fully earned by prior causal pressure or a protagonist choice that dramatizes the insight. The "cheerfully gloomy" tone and the archaeology-of-abandoned-futures conceit cohere well, and the piece resists simplistic answers.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful: the sea-foam recollectionist's perceptual signature (emotions that taste, hum, smell) and the "cheerfully gloomy" diction establish a consistent narrative stance. Psychic distance is stable; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (holding the glass, kneeling by sprouts). However, some phrasing leans toward abstract philosophizing ("archaeology of abandoned futures," "genetic material of a path") that drifts into elevated register without full grounding in the character's immediate sensory experience. The final singing line and "bright melancholy" nicely reinforce voice under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "joy through frosted glass," "dandelion wishes on an uncaring wind," "bells wrapped in velvet," "trying to understand the ocean by collecting foam." While vivid, the metaphors cluster heavily in reflective beats without always advancing causal pressure, and some vehicles contradict physical logic (foam slipping through fingers, yet she's made of sea-foam). Template cadence appears in adjacent paragraphs: "Perhaps paths grew tired… Perhaps they simply forgot… Or perhaps…" Baseline −0.6 for density and scaffold loops; no closure-beat opacity, so no escalation beyond that range. Information density is strong in the opening and closing, but middle paragraphs loop thematically without tight propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist and the synesthetic transliteration of emotions (purple joy, middle-C sorrow) offer fresh, specific inflections on memory-work and ephemeral experience. The iridescent geode and crater glass are non-obvious choices that cohere with the premise. However, the emotional arc—solitary figure reflects on mystery, accepts incompleteness—follows a familiar contemplative template without a bold structural or perspectival risk. The sprouts provide a conceptual twist, but the piece does not fully transform the archetype of the melancholic archivist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist is present throughout and her actions (picking through the cave, holding glass, placing it in the pouch, kneeling by sprouts, singing as she leaves) structure the narrative. However, these are observational and curatorial gestures rather than decisions that create key turns or alter tactics under pressure. She notices, reflects, and departs; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reweights options. Present by setup, involved in beats, but her agency does not drive a meaningful reversal—mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Crater glass appears early (second paragraph), is handled and examined (held up to luminescence, grows warm, emotions leak through), placed in the collection pouch where it hums in agreement near the end. It is signaled, used across at least two beats, and participates in the closure moment by "humming" when the protagonist interprets the sprouts. However, its role remains primarily symbolic—a vessel for thematic content—rather than causally constraining a choice or enabling a tactic. Irreplaceability is moderate; another fragment could serve similarly. Scores in the 6.0–6.5 neighborhood for setup + beat involvement + closure presence, without strong causal pressure or visible cost tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Missing pieces frame the premise from the opening ("missing pieces that once formed a complete path") and recur in the collection of fragments and the question "why some paths disappear." The concept shapes the protagonist's motivation and the final reframe (paths transform, not disappear). However, it remains thematic rather than altering on-page options or forcing a tactical choice under pressure. Present early, threaded through beats, and reprised at closure, but its causal role is abstract. Fits the 5.5–6.3 lyric-resonance allowance for early seed → final reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Transliterating emotions is introduced early ("transliterating emotions from their raw forms into something the mind could grasp") and demonstrated in the crater-glass beat (joy tastes purple, sorrow hums middle C, love smells of burnt sugar and rain). The trait is shown on the page and is specific to the character's work. However, it does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost; it describes her method without creating friction or altering tactics. Functional but replaceable—another archival or interpretive skill could serve the same plot role with minor edits. Mid-band for presence and demonstration, capped by lack of causal pressure or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Conjecture is named explicitly ("She could only conjecture") and the middle section explores her speculations on why paths disappear. It is integrated into the protagonist's reflective process and sets up the final reframe. However, it is not a decisive action that creates a key turn; rather, it is an ongoing stance or mental activity that threads through the narrative. Swappable with "interpretation" or "theorizing" without structural loss. Present across beats and linked to closure thematically, but lacks the causal weight or irreplaceability to score higher. Fits the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one thematic beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>The scattered seeds appear in the final third as sprouts pushing through crystal cracks and are reprised in the closing image ("from well-worn roads to scattered seeds"). The method is signaled late and its mechanics are metaphorical rather than operative in the protagonist's attempts or choices. It does not shape earlier tactics or constrain middle beats; it arrives to provide thematic closure. Late introduction (−0.6 to −1.0), ornamental use in closure (no causal pressure), and swappability (another growth or transformation image could serve) place it in the 3.0–4.0 range. The lyric reprise offers some resonance, nudging it toward the higher end of that band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode is established in the opening line, vividly detailed across multiple beats (smooth floor, breathing walls, luminescence, dimming as day wanes), and supplies the sprouts in cracks that charge the final image. The setting enables the protagonist's work ("this was where she worked best, in this liminal space") and the cave's physical properties (crystal, luminescence) are used in the crater-glass examination. It appears in setup, middle, and closure; it is causally active (provides the environment for discovery and the substrate for the sprouts) and irreplaceable. Scores in the 7.5–8.4 band for essential presence across beats and ending participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "before memory fades" is stated in the protagonist's reflection ("to gather more fragments before memory fades") and motivates her ongoing work. However, it does not create on-page urgency or tighten a specific decision; the cave's dimming provides a gentle time cue for her departure, but she leaves by preference ("time to go, before her own memories began to blur") rather than under a live clock that alters tactics. The timeframe is thematic and background rather than a pressure device. Functional mention without beat-level constraint—mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is introduced early (title phrase, repeated in reflection and closing) and structures the protagonist's reflective stance. It is coherent and drives her curatorial work. However, it is not dramatized through friction or conflicting desires that force a costly choice; she pursues it steadily without on-page obstacles or trade-offs. The final reframe (paths transform, not disappear) shifts her understanding but does not emerge from a choice between competing wants. Present across beats and tied to closure, but lacks the friction to score higher—fits the 5.5–6.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Cheerful gloom is established early ("cheerfully, though her voice carried the weight of a thousand such discoveries," "cheerfully gloomy smile," "bright melancholy") and modulates coherently through the narrative. The tone is consistent across beats (laughter "like bells wrapped in velvet," "singing softly, a tune that was both lullaby and funeral dirge") and charges the final image with its paradoxical texture. The oxymoronic pairing is specific, purposeful, and irreplaceable to the protagonist's voice. It appears in setup, middle, and closure, shaping the reader's emotional experience without flattening under pressure. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for essential tonal coherence and closure participation.</comment>
