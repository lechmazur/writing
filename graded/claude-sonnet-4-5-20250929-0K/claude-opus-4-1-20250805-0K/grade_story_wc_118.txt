<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thrain's sensitivity is embodied through tactile detail ("fingers trailing," "feel the words") and her role as keeper creates coherent motivation. Internal experience shows her perceptual gift expanding ("opened fully") and driving the climactic realization about the axis displacement. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; her final choice to "continue her work" reads as continuity rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The emotional arc lacks contradiction or struggle—she moves smoothly from discovery to understanding without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly in opening lines. The story accumulates density through layered discoveries (tapestry → diary → child's drawing → wall-whispers), building to a conceptual repricing where Thrain understands her role as tender of the echo and the axis displacement cycle. The closure reconfigures her isolation from abandonment to necessary function. Cost is conceptual (she is left behind, will wait through cycles) but felt in "bronze quiet" and "patient as stone." One modest friction: the escalation is primarily cognitive accretion rather than narrowing choice, which fits the lens but mutes urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silo is vividly particular: curved walls, spiral stairs, three levels, fireplace, grain-to-shelter-to-library history. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bronze-quiet," "misting breath," "taste of old paper"). The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting objects that constrain Thrain's investigation and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (third level fireplace, spiral descent) remains coherent. The silo's "walls dense with listening" directly shapes her perceptual gift and the ending reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Thrain must understand why she remains and what she tends. The accumulative lens allows density increase as sufficient escalation; each discovery (tapestry, diary, drawing, wall-whispers) deepens understanding and the cost crystallizes in her recognition that she will wait alone through vast cycles. However, the story lacks a moment where options narrow or a visible trade-off occurs. The protagonist's agency is primarily receptive (she "understood," "could feel") rather than decisional, and no live path is foreclosed on the page. Band guardrail: entering 8.0+ typically requires that tightening forecloses a live option; here the tightening is epistemological without clear sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—cyclical displacement, the duty of witness, stories as persistence—emerges organically from the silo's layered history and Thrain's discoveries. The displaced axis functions as both literal concept and metaphor for existential shift, avoiding heavy-handed statement. The final image ("bronze quiet," "patient as stone," "remember themselves into being") offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. "The bronze quiet of the world wasn't an ending but a pause" borders on explicit theme statement but stays grounded in the story's particulars. One friction: "They were never meant to dream in just one direction" briefly tips into abstract philosophizing, though the surrounding concrete detail (dragons, tapestry, wall-whispers) anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Thrain's heightened perceptual awareness. Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring clarity: "fingers trailing along spines that remembered being trees," "stories that walls had absorbed." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, contracting during the climactic perceptual opening. Diction stays within akeeper-scholar's lexicon (reclaimed, repository, stellar configurations) with purposeful elevation that matches her contemplative role. No dialogue to assess. One minor slip: "fundamental sliding of reality's centerline" in the diary's voice reads slightly more abstract-philosophical than the established register, though it's brief and attributed to a written source.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with high information density and varied rhythm. Strong images: "broken birds," "echo rather than sight," "bronze-quiet." Sentence structures vary purposefully. Two modest frictions lower the score: (1) "The dragons on the tapestry began to move. No—she was moving" employs a micro-cliffhanger deflation pattern; (2) "her sensitively perceptive awareness" and "that particular grace" use filter-adjacent constructions that slightly dull immediacy. No loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language (trees remembered as spines, walls breathing) is coherent and supports the accumulative texture. The opening and closing images effectively frame the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of medieval tapestry as displacement documentation, silo-as-echo-chamber, and post-human keeper role feels specific and non-obvious. The "displaced axis" concept is metaphysically ambitious and integrated through multiple concrete anchors (tapestry dragons as stellar markers, child's tilted drawing, wall-absorbed stories). However, the "last keeper tending remnants after humanity's departure" frame has widespread template precedent in speculative literary fiction. Transformation is present through the axis displacement mechanic and Thrain's perceptual gift, lifting the piece above pure derivative work. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and metaphysical stakes is notable but doesn't fully escape the curator-after-the-end archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thrain as odd historian/keeper is present throughout and her perceptual sensitivity drives the investigation. She appears in setup, middle discoveries, and ending reconfiguration. However, her choices are primarily observational—she handles objects, climbs stairs, places the fragment—rather than decisional turns that alter tactics under pressure. The ending crystallizes her understanding of her role, but this is realization rather than agency that forecloses options. Two-gate participation (setup + payoff) with middle development limited to accumulation; causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is introduced early ("discovered that morning"), handled on page ("cradled in her palm"), used actively when pressed against the diary to trigger understanding, and appears in the ending as she folds it into the collection. The dragons' embroidered eyes "following some invisible path" and later seeming "to move" create reweighted meaning. Three beats (discovery, revelation trigger, archival act) with strong causal pressure in the middle turn and closure linkage. One friction: the final appearance is archival gesture rather than charged reprise that transforms the image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Displaced axis is introduced in the diary fragment, explained through Thrain's realization about stellar configurations and existential centerline, and frames the ending where she understands the cyclical nature. The concept shapes her understanding of why she remains (to tend stories through axis shifts) and thus informs her stance. However, the axis displacement functions primarily as thematic backdrop and metaphysical world-rule rather than constraint that alters on-page tactics or decisions. Present in all three gates but causal pressure on immediate choices is weak; mostly operates at conceptual-thematic level.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is established early as Thrain's defining trait—she navigates by echo, feels words through pressure on paper, hears wall-whispers. The attribute enables her entire investigation and culminates in the full perceptual opening ("her gift...suddenly opened fully") that delivers the climactic understanding. Present across all three gates with clear causal work. One friction: while the trait enables discovery, it doesn't visibly constrain or impose cost; she succeeds through sensitivity without a tradeoff or moment where heightened perception becomes burden.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Probe" appears as physical action ("fingers probed the scorched edges") and thematic method throughout. Thrain probes diaries, feels impressions, and the ending commits to "continue her work" of probing remnants. The action drives the investigation's mechanics and is irreplaceable to her tactile-perceptual method. Present in setup (reading pressure on burned pages), middle discoveries, and ending purpose. Strong integration with her attribute and the story's investigative structure. Could score higher if a specific probe attempt failed or cost something, creating tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered on page, provide the crucial axis-displacement revelation through probed text, and supply the child's drawing. The fireplace on the third level anchors spatial choreography and creates the discovery site. The method (reading burned remnants through tactile pressure) is specific to Thrain's gift and mechanically essential. Present in all three gates: introduced as discovery site, delivers key information in middle, and she places the tapestry "between the pages of the least damaged diary" at the end, completing the archival cycle. Irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is established immediately and shapes every beat: spiral stairs create physical movement and metaphorical resonance, the three levels structure her investigation, the fireplace provides discovery site, curved walls that "held...whispered confession" enable her core gift and climax. The silo's own history (grain-shelter-library) mirrors cyclical displacement theme. It appears in the title position of her role and the final image ("The silo held its breath"). The setting is indispensable—remove it and both her perceptual method and the story's central metaphor collapse. Full three-gate integration with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream...three winters past" anchors the story's post-human present and explains Thrain's isolation. It shapes her role (only listeners remain) and the thematic question of what endures. However, the timeframe functions as static backdrop rather than pressure that tightens choices; no countdown, no urgency derived from when this occurs. Present in setup (established early) and thematically in closure (she will wait through future cycles), but absent from middle development. Does not meaningfully constrain tactics or alter options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is established through Thrain's role, demonstrated in her handling of tapestry and diaries, and crystallized in the ending when she understands she must "ensure that when the axis displaced again...the stories would be waiting." Present across all gates with thematic coherence. However, the motivation faces no meaningful conflict or friction—she pursues it smoothly without competing wants, costs, or obstacles. The desire is told and enacted but not dramatized under pressure; no moment where collecting costs her something she values or conflicts with another need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears immediately ("gone bronze-quiet"), anchors the sensory atmosphere throughout (misting breath, taste of old paper), modulates with the perceptual climax (bronze quiet as "pause, like space between heartbeats"), and charges the final image where Thrain "descended back into the bronze quiet." The tone coheres across turns, supports the post-human contemplative register, and directly shapes the ending's resonance where stillness becomes active waiting rather than death. Fully integrated with strong closure participation; the tone is indispensable to the story's emotional and thematic effect.</comment>
