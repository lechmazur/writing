<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through her manuscript-handling fingers and her listening to buildings, but her motivation lacks the contradictory impulses needed for higher scores. The relationship with Marcus develops from borrowed sugar to mutual recognition, yet the emotional progression feels preordained rather than conflicted. Marcus's admission about his grandmother and his "teach me" request arrive without visible internal resistance or cost. The final choice—to begin teaching—forecloses no path and carries no dramatized price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who (Elara), where (rooftop garden), and when (during meteor shower) anchor by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers architectural listening, dead languages, and the ritual of borrowed sugar toward a moment of shared recognition. Closure arrives as Marcus asks "Teach me" and Elara agrees, but this Resonant Reconfiguration lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The piece deepens through accumulation but the final image does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, meteor shower, brownstone facade, and desk seal are vivid and purposeful. The seal appears in Elara's pocket, is examined by Marcus, and pressed into his palm, constraining the teaching moment at closure. Sensory detail is selective: Earl Grey steam, wrought-iron groan, meteor trails. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the rooftop and implied apartment below. The seal as micro-setting charges the final exchange, lifting the score into the 7-band despite the broader setting being largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's desire to share her architectural linguistics and Marcus's parallel ability—is signaled early and coheres through their conversation. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's repeated visits and his revelation about his grandmother, but no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "teach me" moment is a natural convergence rather than a turn under duress. Cost is conceptual (mutual vulnerability) but not legible as a forfeited path or visible price. One tightening (his admission) raises intimacy but does not escalate stakes with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: architecture as agreed-upon lies about permanence, dead languages as bridges across voids of understanding. The desk seal inscription *Veritas Structura* and Elara's claim that "every building develops its own dialect" anchor the concept without didacticism. The final image—beginning the first lesson as the building recites—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of connection and decipherment. Minor slip: "agreed upon lies that shelter us" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, but the surrounding particulars (cornerstone handprint, Forbidden City lullabies) ground the abstraction enough to preserve resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully during the meteor shower and tea ritual. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "brittle manuscripts," "structural linguistics," "settling wood and shifting foundations." Dialogue pursues goals obliquely—Marcus's transparent excuses, Elara's "How do you know things"—and carries subtext. Filter verbs ("she felt," "he noticed") appear sparingly and do not dull immediacy. Minor slip: "This was how he interrogated her—gently, obliquely" tells the subtext that the dialogue already shows, costing a small amount of trust in dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "every word ever spoken was someone's attempt to build a bridge across the void of understanding" does multiple jobs. Figurative language is dense—meteor trails as threads, steam as incense, the building "settling into sleep"—but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor loop: "This was how he interrogated her" and "This ritual had evolved" use similar demonstrative openings within close proximity. The phrase "mysterious familiarity" in the final paragraph borders on abstract labeling where the prior scene work already established the tone. No major artifacts touch closure, keeping the score in the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—buildings speak a decipherable language—offers a fresh synthesis of architecture, linguistics, and intimacy. The desk seal, cornerstone handprint (1887), and Forbidden City lullabies provide specific, verifiable detail. Emotional truth (two isolated listeners finding each other) grounds the fantastical element. However, the "borrowed sugar evolving into deeper connection" follows a familiar romance template, and the escalation from stranger to student lacks a non-obvious turn. The piece transforms the architectural-listening conceit through Elara's scholarly particularity, but the relational arc remains median. No bold structural risks; the two-person tea conversation is conventionally staged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (dead language tutor) is present throughout and her choice to teach Marcus at the end is the story's closure action. Setup: established in opening lines. Development: her explanation of structural linguistics and revelation about the desk seal constrain Marcus's understanding and enable his request. Payoff: "Elara started the first lesson" is the final sentence. Causal role in two beats (explaining the cornerstone, handing over the seal) and closure participation. However, her teaching background is more credential than constraint—removing "dead languages" and keeping "architectural linguistics" would not break story logic. The occupation enriches texture but does not narrow a choice under pressure. Cap eligible ~6.0 with all three gates; slight discount for partial swappability yields 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in three distinct beats: Elara pressing it into wax (opening), producing it from her pocket and explaining its inscription to Marcus (middle), and pressing it into Marcus's palm (late). Each use advances intimacy and stakes: the opening establishes her ritual isolation, the middle dramatizes shared esoteric knowledge, the final transfer is a tangible grant of access that enables the teaching relationship at closure. Specificity: *Veritas Structura* inscription and "brass surface worn smooth" make it irreplaceable. The seal's physical transfer charges the final exchange. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure across beats and closure linkage support high-7 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "agreed upon lies" appears twice: once in the opening ("those agreed upon lies that architecture tells about permanence") and once near the end ("the agreed upon lies that shelter us"). The concept is echoed thematically but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Elara's work deciphering building murmurs and Marcus's parallel ability proceed without the "lies" framing mattering to their decisions. Setup present (opening), no development beat where the concept changes an option, payoff is thematic mention only. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; lyric reprise lifts slightly within that neighborhood to 4.2, but the lack of causal work prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears once: "Elara's fingers, patiently nimble from years of handling brittle manuscripts, gestured toward the kettle." The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates cost or constraint tied to patience or nimbleness. The gesture toward the kettle does not require special dexterity or measured calm. Setup present (early paragraph), no middle development or closure participation. Missing two gates caps at 2.8; the single embodied mention (handling manuscripts backstory) lifts slightly within allowable band to 3.8, but swappability ("skilled fingers" or "careful hands") and lack of dramatized tradeoff prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears once explicitly: "This was how he interrogated her—gently, obliquely, like someone learning a language through immersion." Marcus's questioning drives the middle conversation (asking about the building, about how Elara knows things) and his final request ("Teach me") is the closure turn. Setup: Marcus's questions begin early (borrowed sugar as pretext). Development: his gentle interrogation elicits Elara's explanations and the seal demonstration. Payoff: his request to be taught is the culmination of his questioning strategy. Two gates clearly satisfied (development, payoff); setup is implicit in the ritual rather than named early. Causal role in at least two beats and shapes the ending. Eligible ~6.0 with strong lyric charge; slight swappability (could be "question" with minor edits) and late explicit naming lower to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The borrowed-sugar ritual is established in the second paragraph: "This ritual had evolved from borrowed sugar into weekly tea sessions, then into something neither quite acknowledged." It recurs as Marcus arrives "carrying an empty sugar bowl, the third time this week" and Elara pours tea "she always kept ready." The method enables sustained proximity that allows Marcus to interrogate and builds the intimacy necessary for the teaching request at closure. Setup: second paragraph. Development: the tea session is the container for all middle dialogue. Payoff: the ritual's progression from sugar to "something neither quite acknowledged" is consummated in the teaching agreement. All three gates satisfied; the means shapes two beats (arrival, tea-pouring) and primes the ending. Specificity (weekly evolution) is clear. Eligible ≥6.1; strong causal scaffolding and closure linkage support mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower provides the spatial and atmospheric frame for the entire scene. Setup: opening sentence links meteor shower to Elara's ritual. Development: meteors punctuate the conversation ("A particularly bright meteor blazed overhead") and the garden's wrought-iron chair groans, grounding the dialogue in place. Payoff: "As the meteors continued their ancient dance above, the building below began its midnight recitation, and Elara started the first lesson." The setting charges the final image by contrasting celestial and architectural permanence. All three gates satisfied. However, the rooftop and meteors do not constrain a choice—the conversation and teaching decision could occur indoors with minor edits. The setting enriches tone and provides symbolic resonance but does not narrow tactics. Eligible ~6.0; closure participation and symbolic charge place it at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's desire to learn/decode building language is established in the opening ("her true obsession was deciphering the murmurs of old buildings") and dramatized through her explanation of the cornerstone memory and her dictionary project ("I'm compiling a dictionary, a Rosetta Stone for structural linguistics"). The motivation is tested when Marcus asks to be taught, and her agreement at closure fulfills the desire by expanding it into shared practice. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: her explanations and the seal demonstration enact the motivation. Payoff: teaching Marcus is the direct expression of her desire to share the language. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure across beats. However, no visible friction or cost—Elara's willingness to teach is uncontested. The motivation shapes choices but lacks the internal conflict needed for higher scores. Strong integration with minor reservation yields 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is established early ("This was how he interrogated her... like someone learning a language through immersion") and recurs in "this mysterious familiarity they'd discovered, two people who could hear what others dismissed." The tone coheres through the scene: Marcus's transparent excuses, Elara's knowing responses, their mutual recognition of shared ability. The final image—"the building below began its midnight recitation, and Elara started the first lesson"—sustains the tone of esoteric intimacy. Setup: early paragraphs. Development: each exchange deepens the familiar mystery. Payoff: the tone charges the closure as they formalize what was already implicit. The tone modulates subtly with revelation (Marcus's grandmother) but does not shift under pressure. All three gates satisfied; the tone is purposeful and legible. Eligible ≥6.1; coherent modulation and closure charge support low-6 range at 6.3.</comment>
