<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and particularized throughout, with clear embodied choices under pressure. Her motivation to apologize is dramatized through the perfume bottle scene and collaboration, showing growth from her prior brutal exorcism approach. Marcus's dual voice with Elisabetta is handled cleanly, though the grandmother's personality beyond "gentle composer" remains thin. The final choice to help complete the requiem is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in Vera's acknowledgment of past damage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera shifts from violent exorcism to collaborative completion with visible cost (her former approach is abandoned, the requiem replaces her triumphant column narrative). Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative accent—email summons, apology, perfume mechanics, collaborative transcription, Elisabetta's dissolution. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the orchard's destruction creates the deadline that forces the requiem's completion before Elisabetta's final departure. Cost is legible in Elisabetta's dissolution and Vera's realization that she "destroyed their first collaboration."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive and orchard work as linked pressure: chainsaws create urgency, perfume scent anchors the spectral mechanics, sheet music becomes active tool. Spatial choreography stays clear through "towering shelves," "above them," descent imagery. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting object that constrains the reconnection method and charges the final beat when corked empty. Sensory detail (bergamot, roses, yellowed paper, dust shaking from ceiling) is selective and tied to POV priority. Setting details integrate through action rather than static description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Vera helping Marcus/Elisabetta finish the requiem before the orchard dies) is signaled early and tightens through the falling trees. One clear escalation: the time pressure forces collaboration that Vera would have resisted, narrowing her options from her former "rip spirits out like weeds" approach. Agency is visible in Vera's choice to participate, applying perfume and transcribing. Cost is on-page: Elisabetta dissolves after completion, Vera's prior triumphant narrative is replaced. The orchard's destruction provides persistent constraint that shapes all tactics in the archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically through the perfume-mediated collaboration versus prior violent exorcism, never stated as thesis. The final image—empty bottle, finished requiem, Elisabetta's dissolution—offers non-literal answer to whether connection requires destruction. Vera's metaphors ("think of it like a dance," "leading means learning to follow") arise from concrete experience rather than assertion. The closing paragraph threatens thematic echo but stays in Vera's columnist voice, framing how she'll tell it "slant." Subtext operates in Elisabetta's line "apologies are just words floating in air" and Marcus's "the music remains" without grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Vera with clean psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture in metaphor-rich interiority that matches her columnist profession. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Marcus's dual-threaded voice ("both his voice and another's") handled clearly. Filter verbs ("she could hear," "she saw") appear but don't dull immediacy given the POV complexity required for spectral collaboration. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices metaphors, archives, scents. One slip: "Never considering that some roots run deeper than damage" reads slightly expository for peak confrontation, though recoverable as Marcus's accusation rather than author intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with archive atmosphere then tightening during the requiem scene. Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold appears in "She'd written about it triumphantly" which recaps rather than advances, and "The hush before destruction was over" feels slightly formulaic. The metaphor "damage became a door" skirts purple but stays voice-appropriate for a columnist. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language cluster in final paragraph ("story slant," "sometimes" anaphora) fits lyric closure mode under accumulative accent. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise (gossip columnist who exorcises ghosts, perfume-mediated spectral collaboration) offers fresh synthesis of urban fantasy elements. The specific inflection—grandmother composer finishing requiem during orchard destruction—feels earned rather than convenient. Transformation test passes: plot wouldn't work with generic "spirit" or "project"; Elisabetta's musical identity and perfume mechanics are integral. Risk-taking in dual voice handling and metaphor-dense columnist POV heightens without obscuring. Slight proximity echo to "things left unfinished by the dead" templates, but the perfume current and musical transcription specificity transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gossip-column exorcist Vera is present from opening, drives the apology motivation, and her columnist voice shapes narration throughout. Her prior exorcism of Elisabetta creates the central conflict. Key turns trace to her choices: agreeing to help, applying perfume, transcribing notes. Appears in closure as she considers tomorrow's column framing. Three beats: arrival, apology/realization, collaboration. Causal pressure: her profession as both columnist and exorcist shapes the stakes and her metaphor-driven perception. Specificity: the gossip-column detail reappears in opening and closing, charging the frame. Cost: her prior "triumphant" narrative is replaced.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Antique perfume bottle introduced early ("holding an antique perfume bottle that glowed faintly green"), used in three beats: Marcus presents it, Vera applies it to enter the current, Marcus corks the empty bottle at end. Mechanics matter: "scent creates a current between her world and ours" enables the collaboration method. Reweighted meaning: glowing green → no longer glowing marks Elisabetta's departure. Constrains choice: without it, reconnection impossible. Charges closure: "corked the empty bottle" signals finality. High irreplaceability: the perfume's link to Elisabetta's composing ritual makes it non-swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core concept "imperfect miracles" shapes the central conflict: collaboration via possession versus violent exorcism, grandmother-grandson shared breath. Alters tactics: Vera must abandon her prior extraction approach. Thematic throughout but most clearly dramatized in "damage became a door" and the requiem's completion alongside Elisabetta's dissolution—neither perfect salvation nor pure tragedy. Not merely echoed as label; the imperfection (temporary, ending in dissolution) versus miracle (requiem completed, apology delivered) structure drives the plot. Middle development beat when Vera realizes "I saw an invasion where there was an invitation."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Attribute "advises through metaphors" is visible in Vera's columnist writing ("Think of possession like water finding cracks," "Think of it like a dance"). Constrains her voice throughout narration. Cost/tradeoff: her metaphor-first perception initially blinded her to literal family collaboration ("I saw an invasion"). The metaphors appear in opening context (last week's column), middle realization, and closing frame (how she'll write tomorrow's column). Shapes one key choice: her final understanding that "leading means learning to follow" enables participation. Trait-specific rather than generic; consistently colors her interiority.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Action "reconnect" is the central goal driving all beats: Marcus's email seeks reconnection, Vera destroyed their prior connection, the perfume enables reconnection, completing the requiem enacts reconnection before final separation. Major turns trace directly to this: Vera's apology, her choice to participate, the collaborative transcription. Mechanics (perfume current) exist solely to enable reconnection method. Not swappable; "reconcile" or "help" would miss the spectral-collaboration specificity. Closure image (empty bottle, finished music) demonstrates reconnection's completion and cost. Irreplaceable: the story's logic pivots on reconnecting what Vera severed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Method "through induced currents" appears as "scent creates a current between her world and ours" and "carried her into the current between worlds." Signaled at midpoint when Marcus explains mechanics. Shapes the collaboration attempt: Vera must apply perfume to access Elisabetta's memories, enabling transcription. Not merely decorative; the current metaphor structures the reconnection method versus Vera's prior violent "ripping." Appears in closure zone as the current facilitates the requiem's completion. Swappability test: partial; "through scent-memory" would work, but "current" ties to the electrical/flow imagery ("not possession but collaboration") with modest specificity gain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sheet music archive introduced in opening line, provides spatial grounding throughout. Setting pressures choices: the archive's "old energies" will scatter after the orchard dies, making it the last viable location for Elisabetta's return. Supplies key resource: the scattered compositions that must be gathered. Constrains action: "towering shelves of bound scores," descent imagery, dust shaking from ceiling anchor the collaboration physically. Micro-setting detail (yellowed paper, stone steps) integrates through action rather than postcard mode. Alters tactics: the archive's connection to the orchard's energy creates the urgency. Appears in closure as the space where the requiem takes final shape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "during the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is signaled early ("she could hear the chainsaws warming up; the cathedral's historic orchard would be gone by noon") and tightens decisions throughout. Live clock: "each fallen tree adding urgency," "when the last note was written" links directly to tree-cutting completion. Alters tactics: the deadline forces immediate collaboration rather than Vera's default resistance. Tracked clearly: "The hush before destruction was over" marks pressure shift, "above them, the first tree fell" signals urgency escalation. Shapes ending: requiem completion coincides with orchard's death, "After today, Elisabetta couldn't return." High causal integration: without this timeframe, stakes collapse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to deliver an overdue apology" is dramatized through Vera's arrival ("drawn by an email from someone she'd exorcised badly five years ago"), the confrontation where she says "I'm sorry," and her realization "I saw an invasion where there was an invitation." Conflicted: apology alone isn't enough ("Apologies are just words floating in air"), requiring the requiem's completion as enacted amends. Friction between want (absolution) and cost (admitting professional failure, abandoning her extraction method). Drives key choice: her decision to help complete the music. Not merely told; the apology scene shows her "throat tightened," words "scraping her throat raw."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone "ethereal grit" coheres throughout: perfume ghosts and spectral collaboration (ethereal) grounded in stone archives, chainsaws, yellowed paper, and Vera's past brutality (grit). Modulates with pressure: opening atmospheric descent shifts to confrontational mid-section ("ripping spirits out like weeds") then lyric collaboration while trees fall. Charges final image: the empty bottle and finished requiem balance transcendence (Elisabetta's dissolution "into the scent of roses") with material cost (no longer glowing, "She's gone"). Sensory detail (bergamot, dust, stone) maintains tactile grit even during spectral beats. Diction choices ("exorcised badly," "brutal and complete") prevent drift into pure fantasy register.</comment>
