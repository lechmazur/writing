<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception (the gauge "warm in her hand," matching breath with the rower), and her micro-choices—kneeling, wedging the gauge, walking away—ground the arc. However, the character work leans heavily on reflective summary ("it was about more than vegetables"; "she understood now why she'd come") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation reads as pre-decided meditation rather than a choice forced by live pressure, and the closure cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Marina, harbor dock, post-petal-drop night). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through reflection and sensory detail rather than causal turns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Marina wedges the gauge and walks away lighter. The closure reweights prior material with felt cost—releasing the grandfather's tool and the rosebush cycle. One meaningful deepening occurs (the decision to leave the gauge as monument), sufficient for this length and lens, though the cost is more oblique than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vividly rendered ("moonlight like mercury," "barnacles formed a rough border") and sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The gauge tooth functions as micro-setting: Marina handles it across multiple beats, and it constrains her final gesture (wedging it into the dock crack). The luminous harbor charges the closure image, making environment indispensable to the ending's resonance. Spatial choreography (fire escape to dock to return path) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing what has served its purpose to make space for renewal—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece tightens through accumulative pressure: the petal falls, Marina climbs down, the rower's rhythm instills patience, and the gauge is wedged as monument. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the decision to leave the gauge) forecloses a path with cost. However, the cost is more conceptual than felt; Marina's choice reads as contemplative inevitability rather than a trade-off forced by live pressure, keeping this in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (cycles, transitions, measurement of what matters) emerges organically from the gauge's evolving use and the petal-drop framing. The final gesture—wedging the brass tooth as monument—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and action (the rower's rhythm, the luminous harbor, the empty dock). However, the piece occasionally abstracts into direct thematic claim ("measured the distance between isolation and connection") rather than letting particulars do the work, and "protected vulnerability" appears as a label near the end rather than fully dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: Marina notices tactile warmth, measures depth, tracks light and rhythm. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with register matching her contemplative stance. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence support the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity. Minor artifice: a few filter verbs ("she'd known," "she understood") signal reflection, acceptable here as the mode is reflection-led and anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the gauge's function is restated across paragraphs ("measuring precise depths," "measuring the distance," "every gauge eventually finds its proper depth"), and reflective blocks recycle the same conceptual claim ("cycles must end," "transitions," "season of rest and renewal") without adding pressure. These loops cluster in the reflective middle third, dulling momentum slightly. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though "quivering hush" and "luminous" recur without evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—fire escape gardener leaving grandfather's tool at the harbor as monument to transitions—offers a specific, grounded angle on renewal and inheritance. Sensory and occupational detail (bitting gauge tooth, canal locks, composted soil) feel researched and particular. However, the emotional arc (letting go after the last petal falls) follows a familiar template, and the story does not fully transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or risk. The final image is purposeful but predictable; no bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes beyond the median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's choices (climbing to the harbor, kneeling, wedging the gauge, walking away) create the key turn at closure. Present from the opening and causally active in the ending gesture, satisfying setup and payoff. However, much of her arc is reflective rather than decision-under-pressure, and the middle beats are observation more than agency, limiting score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gauge tooth appears in the opening line, is handled across multiple beats (measuring soil, held at the dock, pressed into the crack), and its final wedging is the physical closure act. The object's meaning evolves from functional tool to monument, and its brass edge catching moonlight charges the final image. Causally essential and present in all three gates with clear reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears once as atmospheric descriptor ("a quivering hush that seemed to press against her eardrums") and returns near the end ("the quivering hush of the luminous harbor"), but it does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The concept functions as mood label rather than stake-shaping force, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is named once explicitly ("wistfully pragmatic certainty that some cycles must end") and implicitly demonstrated in Marina's decision to release the gauge without sentimentality. The trait enables the closure choice with a visible tradeoff (letting go versus holding on), satisfying two gates. However, the trait is more told than shown through contradictory impulses in action, capping it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Instill" appears twice: Marina presses the gauge "to instill it there" at the dock, and the rower's rhythm "instill[s] in her the patience of tides." The action is present at closure and shapes her final stance (patience enabling release), satisfying setup and payoff. However, the action could be swapped for "embed" or "leave" with minor edits; its specificity does not alter story logic, keeping it in the causal-but-not-indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rower's rhythm appears in one sustained middle beat ("splash, pull, lift, return") and Marina matches her breathing to it, which instills patience that enables her final release. Present in middle development and shaping the ending stance, satisfying two gates. However, the method is observation-driven rather than enacted by Marina herself, and it could be replaced by another meditative prompt without fundamentally breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is anchored early, sustained across beats (rowing shell, barnacles, ripples as silver threads), and charges the final image when Marina sits "in the quivering hush of the luminous harbor." The setting pressures Marina's choice by providing the space and atmosphere for release, and the dock's physical crack becomes the closure anchor. Present in all three gates with clear causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" is signaled in the opening paragraph and frames the entire journey: the petal's fall is the inciting event that sends Marina to the harbor. The timeframe tightens her decision by marking a cycle's end, making renewal urgent. Present in setup and shaping the stakes, though not actively tracked or evolved in the middle, placing it in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is named explicitly midway ("it was about more than vegetables... reflecting light into dark corners") with examples (basil for Mrs. Chen, sunflowers for the Morrison kids). The desire drives Marina's gardening and contextualizes her final gesture (leaving the gauge as light-marker), satisfying development and payoff. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through live friction or cost in the present scene, capping it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once near the end ("This was her protected vulnerability—this willingness to release") and is demonstrated throughout: Marina's tender care for the garden, her willingness to let the rosebush go, her solitary night visit. The tone modulates appropriately (contemplative at the dock, lighter when walking away) and charges the final image of unburdened return. Present across beats and shaping closure, though the label arrives late, keeping it in the essential band.</comment>
