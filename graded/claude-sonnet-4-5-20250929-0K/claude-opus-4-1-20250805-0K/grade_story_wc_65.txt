<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is often told rather than dramatized—"she called herself," "she'd watched"—and her motivations remain abstract. The Council members are sketched via label-only traits ("engineer who dreamed in colors") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that test commitment. The ending renunciation ("not by forcing change but by making it inevitable") reads as philosophical summary rather than a choice with visible cost. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (Obsidian Spire, frozen lake, Mira). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "making change inevitable," but the transformation occurs off-page in the Council's minds; Mira herself faces no stakes-altering choice or cost in the final beat. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the ending mechanics—maps "unconsciously guide discussions"—lack dramatized causality linking Mira's night work to the Council's pivot. The cost (her ongoing labor, beginning another map) is continuity, not foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Obsidian Spire and frozen lake anchor the frame vividly ("darkness cannot darken what already gleams black"). The kingfisher nib and the maps constrain Mira's method and return in the closure beat (cleaning the nib, beginning another map). Spatial choreography is clean across tower, meeting chamber, and window. The final image charges the Spire ("reflected nothing, but within its dark walls, everything became possible"), linking environment to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seeding innovation within the Council's constraints—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Mira completes her maps unopposed, the Council arrives predictable, and her plan succeeds exactly as intended with no reversal or tightening. The ending deepens thematic resonance but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. No on-page cost alters Mira's tactics; she simply continues her work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (transformation through evolution, not revolution) emerges from image and action—maps as gateways, the kingfisher diving beneath surfaces—and avoids overt statement until the penultimate paragraph's "This was how transformation sustained itself," which tilts toward thesis. The final image (cleaning the quill, charting more blank spaces) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "how does change sustain" without moralizing. The Council's pivot is told rather than shown, diluting thematic embodiment at the peak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent ("visual symphonies of probability," "creatures that saw beneath surfaces"). Diction elevates appropriately for a specialized craftsperson. Brief Council dialogue is functional but generic ("measured progress," "sustainable innovation"). Psychic distance remains controlled. The phrase "visual algorithms within them, patterns that would unconsciously guide" risks explaining the effect rather than trusting dramatization, a minor filter-verb stack that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong, rhythm varies, and information density is high in the opening third. Mid-story, paraphrase loops appear: "not about recording what was, but revealing what could be" echoes "maps of places that didn't exist—yet" without added pressure. The penultimate paragraph's "not through revolution but through evolution, not by destroying systems but by teaching them to dream" stacks parallelism into thesis statement, dulling propulsion. Template cadence in Council description ("The engineer would notice… The botanist would see… The programmer would recognize") across three beats merits −0.4 per the loop screen. Final aggregate: −0.6 for paraphrase/template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (cartographer of ignorance, maps that unconsciously seed innovation) is conceptually fresh and voice-specific. Execution trends familiar: the lone visionary whose subtle intervention transforms a rigid institution without conflict is a template arc. The kingfisher detail and "darkness cannot darken" line show craft. Transformation test: the emotional arc (persuasion by stealth) would function with different proper nouns. Risk is conceptual rather than structural; no bold perspectival or tonal gamble heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (ignorance cartographer) frames the story, makes the choice to embed visual algorithms in the maps (middle beat), and observes the outcome from her tower (closure beat). Setup, development, and closure gates are met. Her decisions enable the Council's shift, but she faces no reversal or cost that narrows her own options; the story tracks consequences for others, not her tactical alterations. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity (her unique title and methods) is high. Band guidance suggests ~5.5–6.3 for three gates with moderate pressure and observer rather than decider role at closure. Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears early ("azure against her ink-stained fingers"), is used to complete the maps (middle), and returns in the final beat ("cleaning the kingfisher nib with practiced care"). Three-gate integration; two distinct beats. The object's symbolic charge (creature that "saw beneath surfaces") supports theme but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Closure linkage is cameo rather than causal. Lyric resonance is present. Band guidance for three gates with thematic charge but no causal pressure: ~6.0–6.5. Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Core concept (writing the future) is seeded immediately ("maps of places that didn't exist—yet"), drives Mira's night work ("she would complete her masterwork"), and charges the closure ("There were always more blank spaces to chart, more futures waiting to be written"). Setup, development, payoff gates met. The concept shapes stakes (Council seeks rigid frameworks; Mira writes pathways into being) and tactics (predictive models, embedding algorithms). Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage direct. Band guidance: ≥7.0 for concept shaping two beats and the ending with irreplaceability. Score: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is not explicitly labeled but implied through Mira's methods (imaginative: maps of voids and visual symphonies; grounded: "specific events," "predictive models"). The trait enables her approach but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it is descriptive rather than friction-generating. Setup present; development and payoff indirect. Swappability moderate. Band guidance for one-gate functional presence: ~3.0–4.9. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Prevail" structures the entire arc: Mira's goal is transformation, the Council's arrival is the test, and the ending declares "Mira had prevailed not by forcing change but by making it inevitable." Setup, development, payoff gates met. The action drives the resolution but is told rather than dramatized in a peak confrontation; the mechanism (unconscious influence via maps) diffuses agency. Causal role in closure is strong; cost (ongoing labor) is continuity rather than foreclosure. Band guidance: three gates with told climax and moderate irreplaceability ~6.5–7.0. Score: 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is mentioned early ("Her predictive models covered every wall") and frames Mira's method throughout (mapping pathways, visual algorithms). It enables the Council's shift but the mechanics remain abstract; no on-page scene shows a model constraining a tactical choice under pressure. Setup and development gates met; closure participation indirect. Functional but replaceable with "strategic design" or similar. Band guidance for two gates with abstract use: ~5.0–6.0. Score: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Obsidian Spire by a frozen lake is anchored early ("cast no shadow," "darkness cannot darken what already gleams black"), houses the meeting chamber (middle), and charges the final image ("reflected nothing, but within its dark walls, everything became possible"). Setup, development, payoff gates met. The setting provides atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is symbolic rather than tactical. Band guidance for three gates with strong symbolic payoff: ~6.0–6.5. Score: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" frames the opening urgency ("But tonight, before the pen meets the blank page, she would complete her masterwork"). The timeframe tightens Mira's work window but does not create on-page tension or alter tactics; by paragraph five the work is complete. Setup present; no middle or closure pressure from the clock. Band guidance for one-gate with no escalation role: ~3.0–5.0. Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is Mira's explicit goal (stated in the opening third, dramatized through her map-making, and fulfilled in the Council's pivot). Setup, development, payoff gates met. The motivation drives two beats (creating maps, observing outcome) and shapes the ending ("not by destroying their system but by seeding it with controlled chaos"). Cost is told rather than felt: Mira continues her work without foreclosing a path. Band guidance for three gates with strong causal role but told cost: ~6.5–7.2. Score: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" governs tone throughout: calm certainty in the opening, reflective patience during the meeting, and continuity in the ending ("There were always more blank spaces to chart"). The tone is consistent, modulates subtly with the Council's arrival, and charges the final image's declaration of inevitability. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Coherence is strong; the tone does not tension or escalate under pressure, remaining static in register. Band guidance for three gates with coherent but non-escalating tone: ~6.5–7.0. Score: 6.7.</comment>
