<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's arc from violence to "operatively gentle" is grounded in embodied grief (brother's death, her retaliatory killings) and drives her breach of ritual protocol. Her stance crystallization—"we're not the heroes"—emerges from prior causality and forecloses the old narratives with visible cost. The Theren and Kolani delegates remain somewhat generic beyond their physical descriptions, and the younger Kolani delegate's kneeling feels slightly convenient, but Mara's contradictory impulses (fury reformed into patience) act simultaneously in scene. Minor therapy-speak ("redemption," "violence reformed") in peak beats and the delegates' quick pivot strain believability slightly, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Mara on terrace, twin suns, biennial alignment) and holds a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through Mara's protocol breach and the clipboard revelation until the final image of delegates approaching it in shared recognition. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "something in between, like suns touching" crystallizes the shift from certified hatred to the "first crack," with cost legible in the renunciation of pride and righteousness. The single-scene design with clear spatial choreography and one meaningful deepening (from recitation of grievances to collective recognition of personal grief) fits 600–800-word scope. One causal convenience—delegates' rapid understanding—slightly weakens the tightening but does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace and clipboard are concretely rendered and constrain Mara's opening move: she sets the clipboard between delegates, turning it from a dividing line into a connecting object. The twin suns' alignment provides a temporal and symbolic frame that charges the final image ("suns touching—painful and necessary and true"). Spatial choreography is clean (terrace, lower chambers, delegates emerging, kneeling). Sensory detail is selective (bones chiming, corona bleeding) and filtered through Mara's urgency. The Theren's translucency and Kolani's darkness are described but not deeply integrated into choice or perception beyond the single observation that they "blurred into something neither beautiful nor ugly." Minor reliance on abstract descriptors ("ancient and patient," "broken music") and the terrace's ritual significance told more than shown prevent a higher score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the endless cycle of failed treaties and inherited hatred—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Mara breaks protocol ("Not in celebration, but in recognition of what we've broken") and narrows options by rejecting the traditional grievance recital, forcing delegates to confront personal loss via the clipboard. The senior Theren's challenge ("You propose we abandon justice?") and Mara's rebuttal create one meaningful reversal. The final shift—delegates approaching the clipboard and recognizing names—feels somewhat rapid and convenient, as if understanding arrives too easily after three hundred years of failure. Cost is legible (renunciation of righteousness, admission of complicity) but the delegates' collective pivot could use one more beat of resistance to fully earn the tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The price of redemption emerges organically from Mara's actions and the clipboard's transformation: "redemption isn't purchased with forgiveness—it's bought with the admission that we've all become what we fought against." Theme deepens through specific embodied grief (brother's death, three Theren killed in return) rather than abstraction, and the final image—light "something in between... painful and necessary and true"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The clipboard's shift from recording marriages to cataloging failures to gathering new light threads the conceptual question through particulars. Minor thematic echo in Mara's articulation ("redemption," "justice and vengeance have become indistinguishable") slightly over-states the thesis but remains anchored in scene pressure and does not flatten the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mara's perceptual signature: her touch on the clipboard, recognition of delegates' exhaustion, ironic laughter as "broken music." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with the Theren's "bones chiming" providing character-specific idiom and Mara's speech pursuing the goal of breaking deadlock through indirection and image. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("her fingers still moving") to wider observation of the delegates. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watching," "recognizing") in a few lines and slightly elevated diction ("operatively gentle," "certified hatred") in peak beats nudge the score down from the 8+ band, but voice remains coherent and the ending's perceptual control is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweight the clipboard effectively. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters: "constellation of almost-peace," "broken music," "violence reformed into patience," "grief made infinite" stack metaphors without always sharpening clarity. A few paraphrase loops: "We've mustered here forty-seven times" echoes "For three hundred years, they had failed," and "recognizing names, understanding suddenly" restates within two beats. Stock phrasing ("ancient and patient," "slow art of listening") and one template cadence in the final paragraph ("Not red this time. Not yet gold.") slightly dull propulsion. These artifacts do not obscure causality or closure but prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setup—forever war, biennial celestial alignment, clipboard holding memory-glass—offers a specific synthesis of SFF trope and emotional stakes. Mara's "particular brand of damage" (grief transformed into listening) and the protocol breach feel fresh within the negotiation frame. The dual-sun midsummer kiss and terrace setting are vivid and purposeful. However, the core beats—bitter negotiator confronts cycle of hatred, proposes honesty over righteousness, others recognize shared grief—follow a familiar emotional-maturity arc common in reconciliation narratives. The transformation is specific enough to avoid pure template, and the clipboard's physical presence elevates particularity, but the story does not take structural or perspectival risks that would push it into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara, the forever war peace negotiator, drives every key turn: she breaks protocol, reframes the clipboard's meaning, and confronts delegates with the cost of inherited hatred. Her choices narrow options (rejecting traditional recitation) and her speech catalyzes the final shift. Present by paragraph one, active in the peak breach and closure beats, and irreplaceable (her specific grief and role anchor the story's logic). Cost is visible (renunciation of righteousness, admission of complicity). Not quite indispensable because the story could function with a similar negotiator role, but deeply integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard is handled in paragraph one (Mara tracing it), paragraph two (holding memory-glass), the breach beat (Mara lifts and turns it toward delegates), and the closure (lying between them, gathering new light). Its properties—absorbing tears, holding failed treaties as red lights, carved from the last border tree—are specific and irreplaceable. It constrains Mara's opening (she uses it to show failure) and charges the final image (light changing from red to "something in between"). Causal pressure is strong: the clipboard's presence enables the protocol breach and the delegates' recognition of personal names. Setup, development, and payoff all met with high specificity and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The price of redemption is named in Mara's speech ("redemption isn't purchased with forgiveness—it's bought with the admission") and shapes her breach of protocol: she demands delegates admit complicity rather than recite grievances. The concept constrains tactics (honesty over pride) and the final image ties cost to the "painful and necessary" work. However, the phrase "price of redemption" itself is stated overtly rather than fully embodied through action, and while it alters the negotiation's frame, the mechanical link between concept and delegate behavior is somewhat abstract. Present in setup (Mara's grief-to-patience arc), development (the breach), and payoff (the first crack), but could be more tightly woven into micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is attributed to Mara in paragraph three: "violence reformed into patience, fury into the slow art of listening." It motivates her breach of protocol (she speaks softly, proposes acknowledgment rather than combat) and contrasts with her past killings. The trait is more labeled than demonstrated in distinct on-page action; we see her speak and set down the clipboard, but no scene beat explicitly tests the tension between operational pressure and gentleness. Present in setup and implied in the breach, but the visible tradeoff or cost tied specifically to "gentle" versus another approach is not sharp. Mid-band for thematic coherence and motivation linkage, but replaceable with "reflective" or "patient" without major structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: delegates "beginning to muster in the lower chambers" (paragraph two) and "We've mustered here forty-seven times" (Mara's speech). It frames the ritual gathering and Mara's critique of repetition, but the word itself is functional rather than causal. The action of gathering is necessary for the scene, yet "convene," "assemble," or "gather" would serve nearly as well. Present in setup and thematically echoed, but does not constrain tactics or drive a turn that depends on "mustering" specifically. Mid-band for coherent use across beats but high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early: the terrace "held the ritual significance of ten thousand ceremonies," and the negotiation itself is a three-hundred-year ritual with a "traditional opening." Mara's breach—refusing to recite grievances—depends on the ritual's mechanics: she inverts the expected form, and that inversion creates the story's pressure. The method shapes her tactic (protocol as leverage) and charges the ending (moving from ritual division to shared recognition). Present in setup, active in development (the breach), and implicit in payoff (the ritual space "held them all"). Not fully indispensable—other framing devices could work—but the ritual layer meaningfully shapes Mara's choices and the delegates' response.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is introduced in paragraph one, described as built "when both civilizations still shared one language" and holding "the ritual significance of ten thousand ceremonies." It provides the spatial frame for the entire scene, enables Mara's gesture of setting the clipboard on "the ancient stone between them," and is invoked in the closure: "The terrace held them all, ancient and patient." The setting supplies symbolic weight (shared history) and a physical resource (the neutral ground on which the clipboard rests). Micro-setting test met: the stone's presence constrains choice (where the clipboard goes) and charges the final image. Present across all three gates with strong specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The celestial timeframe is signaled early: "twin suns crawl toward their midsummer kiss," "biennial alignment," "as the suns aligned, casting no shadows," "suns touched at their edges," "continued their slow dance toward separation." The alignment brackets the scene and provides symbolic resonance (balance, touching, painful necessity). However, the time constraint does not tighten tactics in a legible way—no character references running out of time, and the negotiation's pacing is not shaped by the suns' movement. Present in setup and closure, thematically coherent, but the clock does not alter moves or narrow options on the page. Mid-band for atmospheric and symbolic contribution without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to anchor ideals in practice" is embodied in her final line of the prompt-action: "they began the flawed, beautiful work of anchoring their ideals in the terrible practice of survival." This want drives her breach of protocol (she rejects abstract recitation for concrete recognition of personal loss) and shapes the closure (moving from ideal peace to "the first crack" of practice). The friction between ideals (justice, righteousness) and practice (survival, complicity) is dramatized in Mara's confrontation with the senior Theren and the cost of admitting "we've all become what we fought against." Present in setup (her arc from violence to listening), development (the breach), and payoff (the shift to "flawed, beautiful work"). Strong causal linkage and cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is coherent throughout: the clipboard "worn smooth by... hands," Mara's laughter as "broken music," the suns' corona "bleeding into corona," delegates in light that is "neither beautiful nor ugly, but honestly damaged," and the final light "painful and necessary and true." Tone modulates from elegiac reflection to confrontation to tentative hope without breaking consistency. The ending's image—light "something in between"—charges the flawed-beauty frame with undeniable pressure. Tone shapes the story's texture and reweights at closure, meeting the high-band test. Not quite indispensable (another tonal frame could work), but deeply integrated and purposeful across all beats.</comment>
