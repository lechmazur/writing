<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her journey shows determination, but her interiority relies heavily on interpretive leaps ("intuited what others had missed") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The father exists only as backstory and symbolic absence; no secondary character applies pressure. The final "choice" to build bridges feels declared rather than earned through visible cost—she simply begins drawing codes without foreclosing a dramatized path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with atmospheric density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit (Marina at the threshold, whispering back, choosing to "build bridges") reconfigures her stance from seeker to architect, but the cost remains abstract: no on-page action is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no prior capability spent. The final image charges prior motifs (weather codes, thresholds, distances) yet the felt price is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, grain patterns, and maze geometry are vivid and purposeful. The terrace's counterclockwise spiral mirroring the maze is a strong anchoring detail. The pressure differential at the center—three degrees cooler—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (terrace descent, maze navigation, central circle) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the "fractured hush" and corn whispers supply atmosphere without deeply constraining Marina's choices on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding her father and understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early. Marina's navigation through the maze (turning at pressure differentials, counting steps) shows agency, but the tightening is mild: she follows the logbook without meaningful friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the maze "responds" cooperatively. The cost at closure (choosing to inhabit the threshold herself) is conceptual rather than felt on the page. One deepening occurs (discovering the permanent differential) but it arrives without obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—love as necessary distance, presence and absence coexisting—emerges from the maze's geometry and weather codes. The final image of Marina whispering back resonates with the opening's isolation. However, the penultimate paragraph ("some thresholds feel sacred because they hold space...") borders on thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than letting the image carry it. The particulars (spiral grain, pressure differential, seven-foot rows matching her father's span) ground the abstraction but the ending leans toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and strong perceptual signature: Marina notices grain, measures distances, interprets weather codes. Diction is consistent and elevated ("featherly determined," "fractured hush") but some phrases—"intuited," "sacred geometry," "drifting soul"—drift toward stock lyricism. No dialogue; interiority is clear. Filter verbs ("felt it," "knew better") are voice-motivated. One minor slip: "the corn maze exhaled" personifies setting in a way that softens POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and vivid imagery. "Featherly determined" and "fractured hush" recur without pattern-payoff—decorative rather than causal. Minor loops: "necessary distances" appears four times without evolving meaning; "sacred" and "threshold" churn across paragraphs. "Drifting prism terrace" and "pneumatic supports" supply texture but the terrace's drift never affects action. No major artifacts obscure closure, but density is uneven—some sentences (sunset casting rainbow shadows) add atmosphere without advancing pressure. Line-level clarity is strong; momentum sags slightly in the reflective middle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather mapping, sacred geometry, and grief is fresh; the maze as atmospheric chart is non-obvious. The father's vanishing into a threshold rather than death transforms the familiar lost-parent trope. However, "necessary distances" and "fractured hush" read as prompt-facing labels; the ending's phrasing ("love itself is a necessary distance we're always crossing") edges toward thematic summary. The grain-matching detail and pressure differential show specificity. Risk is moderate: the lyric register and symbolic architecture commit to a vision, but the closure's abstractness hedges emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marina (the lost child) is present throughout and drives the journey, but her choices are largely interpretive (following codes, intuiting meanings) rather than decisions that narrow options. She descends, navigates, discovers, and begins drawing—each move motivated but unchallenged. The ending choice to "build bridges" is stated, not enacted with cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; functional across beats but swappable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in the opening (clutched on the terrace), guides middle navigation (weather codes reveal turns), and reappears at closure (Marina opens it to draw her own codes). Handled concretely across three beats. Its symbols constrain her path and the final act of adding to it reweights its use from inherited map to active creation. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named in the opening exposition, recurs as theme (seven feet, twenty-one feet, three degrees), and is restated in the final paragraph's moral. It shapes setting detail (measurement) but does not constrain a choice or tactic on the page—Marina never navigates a trade-off about distance. Present across beats as motif; payoff is thematic statement rather than charged image or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a descriptor of Marina's resolve but does not enable or constrain action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to this trait; it functions as adjective rather than dramatized attribute. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears three times and drives key turns: Marina intuits the maze as weather map, intuits the final truth about thresholds. The action is pivotal but occurs off-stage as realization rather than embodied process. It redefines her understanding and enables the closure choice, yet the mechanics remain vague. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal role strong but swappable with "realize" or "understand."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Grain analysis is introduced early (tracing the terrace railing), applied causally (grain matches maze spiral "down to the degree"), and echoed at closure (soil spirals matching both railing and storm). The method reveals hidden pattern and validates Marina's inherited skill. Constrains her interpretation across two beats and charges the final discovery. Specificity high; removal would break the logic of her navigation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid in the opening (glass platform on pneumatic supports) and reappears briefly at the end (casting rainbow shadows). It supplies observation vantage and atmosphere but does not constrain Marina's choices—she descends easily and the maze is navigable from ground level. Micro-setting (the terrace itself) is striking but postcard-functional; the maze proper does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames backstory (the storm nine years prior when Marina was eight) but does not tighten present decisions. No live clock or temporal pressure; the maze navigation unfolds at Marina's pace without urgency. Time is static context rather than escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—to discover why thresholds feel sacred—is stated in exposition and drives her journey into the maze. It shapes her goal but faces no friction or conflicting want. The closure (finding the answer, choosing to inhabit it herself) resolves the desire cleanly without visible cost or internal conflict. Desire is clear and consistent; dramatized through action but not tested by competing stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named twice and evokes the corn's whisper and the maze's quiet. Tone is lyric and contemplative throughout, modulating gently from isolation (opening) to communion (ending whisper exchange). Coherent and atmospheric but static—no tonal shift under pressure. The phrase itself is decorative; the mood it names is consistent and supports the final image without charging it decisively.</comment>
