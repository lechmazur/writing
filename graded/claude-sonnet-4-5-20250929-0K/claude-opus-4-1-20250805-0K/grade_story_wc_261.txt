<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's wound-seeking compulsion is established and her interior voice is distinctive (vegetable grief, libraries written in collagen), but the final "learning" feels more declared than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The scar-reading motivation drives several micro-choices (examining coffee rings, pressing palm to glass), yet the epiphany that "wounds were meant to stay open" arrives as insight rather than a dramatized cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present (unsteady walk, examining bandaged hands) but the piece leans toward poetic articulation over messy contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (medical bay, tower, dawn, post-surgery). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya collects signs (coffee rings, plant whispers, scars) until the final paragraph reweights her premise from "closure" to "remaining open." Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reconfigures her wound-opening project with felt cost (she will "begin again," staying wounded). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the miracle is dispersed. Cost is legible but oblique: her surgeries continue, her body remains a map. The midpoint teaches the pattern and the ending holds the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower, medical bay, narrow windows, and rooftop garden are anchored early and used selectively. The coffee-ring stain constrains a key recognition (tree-ring analogy), and the window becomes a tactile interface when Maya presses her scarred palm to glass, enabling plant communion. The frosted hourglass recurs three times with evolving weight. Spatial choreography is clean (bed → window → garden view). The micro-setting (body as map, palm-print on glass) charges the final choice to "begin again," meeting the 9-band gate for constraint or closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya seeks to decode scar-stories and understand the displaced miracle. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the miracle is scattered and her scars are "maps of possibility" rather than records needing closure. Agency is present (she stands, walks, examines, presses palm to glass) but the final stance—"remaining open"—is a renunciation that forecloses the closure-seeking path with visible cost (continued surgery, perpetual wounding). The cost is felt but not as viscerally tested as higher bands require. Escalation is conceptual rather than situational pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: scar-tunnels, coffee rings, plant telepathy, and the displaced miracle converge without overt thesis. The final image—turning the hourglass, wounds as invitation—answers the central question (what are scars for?) non-literally and reweights prior material (each surgery was creating channels, not seeking closure). The frosted hourglass, coffee ring, and tree-ring analogy recur with shifted meaning, avoiding token motif lists. No sermonizing in the final beat. The piece risks abstraction ("grace might travel") but roots it in concrete actions (pressing palm, examining stains) enough to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds stable distance and interiority throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maya notices microscopic variations, tree rings, coffee-stain imperfections, and root-whispers—a scar-reader's selective attention. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated (meteor hush, chlorophyll dreams, collagen libraries). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "believed") are dense but not stacked to the point of dulling immediacy. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority in the anesthesia fade, wider at the window vista). The prose texture reflects Maya's obsessive cataloging mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (frosted hourglass, meteor hush, vegetable grief) without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is thick (hourglass, meteor hush, tree rings, coffee rings, seed metaphor) but coherent and pattern-taught early; the density serves the accumulative lens rather than obscuring it. Minor register drift: "pathological," "collagen," "ambient, democratic" lean clinical/abstract but remain plausible for a scar-obsessed POV. Zero scaffold or synonym churn. The final line ("smaller doors") charges prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of scar-reading, plant telepathy, and displaced miracle is specific and non-obvious; the coffee-ring → tree-ring → scar-map progression feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise risks abstraction (miracle as metaphor, scars as doorways) but grounds it through tactile beats (drilling tunnels, pressing palm to glass, examining stains). The twist that Maya's wound-opening was creating channels rather than seeking closure reframes prior material without late rule changes. Transformation test: plot and arc depend on these exact elements (scars, plants, frosted time, scattered healing). Risk-taking (lyric density, abstract miracle) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's "closure seeker who opens wounds" trait is established in paragraph three and drives her surgery choice, her scar examination, and her final realization that she seeks not closure but channels. She makes on-page decisions (standing, walking to window, examining coffee ring, pressing palm to glass) that alter her understanding. The trait shapes two beats (surgery motivation, final stance shift) and is causally active at closure when she decides to "begin again." Early signal present, two-beat involvement, closure linkage, but the causal pressure is conceptual rather than narrowing tactical options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in three beats: beside her bed (paragraph four), "continued its patient count" (paragraph nine), and she "turned the frosted hourglass once more" in the final line. It frames time as accumulation rather than loss (thematic reprise) and the final turn signals her decision to continue. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thematic (paragraph nine) rather than constraining a choice. The object is handled twice (initial mention, final turn) and reweighted at closure but does not narrow options or enable tactics. Lyric-resonance allowance applies but causal pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The displaced miracle is introduced in paragraph two, drives Maya's stake (understanding what happened), and is resolved in paragraphs seven–eight when she learns it is "dispersed into ten thousand tiny healings." The concept shapes her investigation (examining scars, listening to plants) and the resolution (her scars are channels for scattered grace). It appears in setup, middle revelation, and closure reframing ("miracles… learned to travel through smaller doors"). Early signal, two-beat involvement, closure linkage. The concept alters Maya's understanding and final stance but does not impose a tactical cost or narrow her options in scene. Swappability moderate: another abstract event could serve similar thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced in paragraph three, enables Maya's discovery in paragraph seven (plants show her the miracle's new form), and does not constrain a choice with cost. The trait is label-heavy ("accidental telepathy," "root-whispers," "chlorophyll dreams") and functions as an information channel rather than a pressure that alters tactics. Setup and development present; closure participation is thematic (plants "agreed" in paragraph nine) but not causally active. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the telepathy itself. One distinct beat (paragraph seven revelation) plus thematic echo. Swappable: another mystical insight mechanism could deliver the same knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears as surgery action (paragraph one: "drilling microscopic tunnels through scar tissue") and metaphor (paragraph nine: "each one a tunnel through which grace might travel"). The surgery is her "final attempt" and motivates her presence in the medical bay; the metaphoric reprise reweights her scar-opening compulsion at closure. Setup and payoff clear; middle development is absent—no on-page tunneling choice in the present action. The action frames the story and charges the final realization but does not drive a second beat or narrow options. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; the metaphoric return is purposeful but the action itself is past-tense and does not alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings is dramatized in paragraph four: Maya traces the stain's edge, reads "microscopic variations," and connects it to tree rings. The method is signaled, used once on-page, and echoed in paragraph ten ("she examined the coffee ring again") where it confirms her scar-pattern insight. Setup and payoff present; middle development thin (the second examination is confirmatory rather than generative). The method shapes one key recognition (pattern-reading as viable) and is reprised at closure but does not constrain a choice with cost. Two touches across two beats; both are observation rather than decision. Swappability moderate: another pattern-reading object could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn is anchored in paragraph one and recurs in the final line ("In the quiet tower at dawn"). The setting provides the medical bay, narrow windows, and rooftop garden; the garden supplies the plants for telepathic contact (paragraph seven). The tower's quietness matches the "meteor hush" tone and the dawn light paints "amber stripes" that frame her waking. Setup and payoff clear; middle development moderate (the window in paragraph seven enables her palm-press choice). The setting does not impose a tactical constraint but charges the final image and supplies the rooftop garden resource. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final line) reweights the opening frame at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" is dramatized in the opening line and paragraph four ("The anesthesia's last traces lifted"). The waking progression structures the narrative: foggy consciousness → clarity → decision. The timeframe does not impose a deadline but tracks Maya's cognitive emergence and enables the final epiphany ("with full clarity, Maya finally read the story"). Setup and development present; closure participation is causal (full consciousness permits the realization). The time does not tighten tactics but it shapes the arc from emergence to insight. One clear beat (waking) and closure linkage (clarity enables reading). Cost is cognitive rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars" is stated in paragraph three and drives her surgeries, her coffee-ring examination (paragraph four), her scar-tunneling project, and her final realization (paragraph ten). The motivation is told ("she believed," "Maya knew better") and dramatized through her examining, standing, walking, and pressing actions. Setup, development (coffee-ring beat, window beat), and payoff (final reading) all present. Friction between want (closure) and discovered truth (remaining open) creates cost at closure. The motivation drives three beats and shapes the ending but leans toward articulated insight rather than a choice under duress. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, visible cost in reframing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced in paragraph two ("the city held the meteor hush that follows great catastrophe") and recurs in paragraph eleven ("The meteor hush began to lift as the city woke"). The tone is coherent throughout: quiet, post-catastrophe stillness modulates as Maya gains clarity and the city awakens. The hush charges the opening frame, maintains somber restraint through the middle investigation, and lifts at closure to signal transition. The tone does not constrain a choice but it modulates with pressure (waking, realization, decision to begin again) and charges the final image. Setup and payoff present; middle coherence strong. The tone is distinct, purposeful, and integral to the story's emotional arc.</comment>
