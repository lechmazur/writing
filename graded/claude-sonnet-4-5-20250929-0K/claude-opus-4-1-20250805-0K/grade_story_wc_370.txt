<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ezra's empathetic nature constrains his choices (hiding vs. approaching) and the ending delivers Earned Stasis with visible cost—he teaches through staying-while-leaving. The internal contradiction (feeling too much to help yet unable to stop feeling) acts simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstract therapy-speak ("keenly empathetic nature," "enlarged tranquility he projected") that softens embodiment at key beats. The woman's grief registers concretely but her arc compresses too quickly from telegram shock to folded-paper wisdom without intermediate resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ezra's teaching moment reweights his three-year-late invitation from mistake to wisdom, with the conceptual cost legible in his acceptance of perpetual distance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two (Ezra, library, eleven forty-seven). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the invitation's meaning accretes through repeated handling until the final fold-and-share recharges it. One meaningful deepening occurs when Ezra moves from solitary study to shared solitude, narrowing his former total-withdrawal stance. Minor causality slip: the woman recognizes him as "another empath" without prior cue that she shares the trait.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library's impossible architecture ("defying the building's exterior dimensions") and liminal midnight moment constrain the encounter's tone and Ezra's teaching choice. The crumpled invitation functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image when matched by the woman's folded telegram. Sensory detail remains selective (clock chime, raised seal through paper) and filtered through Ezra's practiced calm. The train station below is mentioned but never pressures action; the third-floor perch stays ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Can Ezra use his empathetic gift to help without drowning in another's pain? One meaningful tightening occurs when her grief threatens to overwhelm him yet he chooses closeness at calculated distance. The woman's recognition and Ezra's teaching both narrow options—he can no longer hide, she gains a new frame for her loss. Agency is clear (his decision to approach, her nod), and the cost is felt: both accept perpetual isolation as the price of compassion. However, the woman's telegram problem resolves via Ezra's reframe without her enacting a costly choice of her own, reducing escalation pressure in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the crumpled invitation's progression from bureaucratic error to purposeful delay, teaching that "contradictions aren't flaws to resolve but truths to inhabit." The final image (two folded papers, "separate solitudes") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Ezra's double-negative question and the woman's whispered sister-grief. Minor slip: "The enlarged tranquility between them expanded until it filled the entire room" abstracts the ending's emotional texture when a concrete image would sharpen resonance. The founder's journal entry risks thematic echo but Ezra dramatizes its cost on the page by enacting "cruelty to themselves."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Ezra; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during empathetic overwhelm, cooler during teaching). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices grief as "physical weight," reads the woman's breathing, filters the library through his recluse lens. Dialogue carries subtext ("Would you like to not be alone?" with intentional double-negative) and the woman's whisper advances plot economically. Minor register drift: "nestled paradoxes," "linguistic inversions carried weight" briefly elevate diction beyond Ezra's established voice during peak empathetic pressure. No head-hopping; the woman's interiority remains opaque until she speaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflection blocks) and information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Paraphrase loop at "The woman's breathing steadied slightly" / "By then, I'd already found my way here" / "If I'd known earlier..." compresses three restatements of late-arrival regret without added pressure (−0.4). Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("let him feel," "had driven," "had only sharpened") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. Opening line anchors stakes cleanly; final line recharges "enlarged tranquility" motif. Metaphor coherence holds (crumpled/folded papers as externalized internal states). No loops touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "secret society for paradox-lovers" premise echoes familiar magical-library templates, but the story transforms it through Ezra's specific empathetic constraint and the invitation's causal role (arrives late, becomes teaching tool). The staying-while-leaving method and double-negative dialogue offer fresh idiom. Transformation test: swapping names/places would weaken but not break the arc since the emotional truth (isolation as survival strategy) grounds the fantastical frame. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric ending heightens meaning without gimmickry. However, the Paradox Society itself remains lightly sketched—members are "scattered," rules implied but not tested—limiting the premise's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ezra (compassionate recluse) drives two key beats: the choice to approach despite empathetic overwhelm, and the teaching moment that reframes his own mistake. His reclusiveness constrains tactics (careful distance, projection of calm) and his compassion enables the woman's solace. Present in setup (mountain cabin, hiding in corner), middle (approach decision), and closure (teaching through shared isolation). The trait's cost is visible: perpetual solitude as the price of helping. Swappability is low—a non-empathetic character could not teach this lesson. Minor friction: his recluse status is narrated more than embodied in micro-choices during the library scenes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in three beats: pocket press (paragraph one), smoothed on table (teaching beat), matched by folded telegram (closure image). Its meaning evolves from proof-of-belonging to symbol of productive error to teaching tool. The woman's mirroring fold charges the final image and reweights Ezra's three-year delay as wisdom rather than mistake. Setup clear (paragraph one), middle use (he shares it), closure linkage strong (folded papers = separate solitudes). Specificity high: the raised seal, the creases, the bureaucratic delay all matter. Cost connection: accepting the invitation's timing means accepting he couldn't have helped earlier. Irreplaceability: no other object carries the error-as-wisdom freight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Nestled paradoxes (core concept) frames the library's ethos and Ezra's method but mostly operates as thematic backdrop rather than on-page constraint. The concept enables his "staying while leaving" and the woman's "separate solitudes," shaping the ending's resonance. However, it does not narrow options in middle beats—Ezra would approach and teach regardless of whether the Society valued paradox. Present in setup (Society description, founder's journal), echoed in closure (shared isolation), but absent from the middle decision pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately. Swappable with "hidden truths" or "balanced opposites" without breaking causality. No visible cost tied specifically to the paradox frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Keenly empathetic (attribute) constrains Ezra's approach twice: he hides initially because feeling overwhelms, then projects calm at calculated distance when he does approach. The trait enables his recognition of the woman's empathy and his teaching method. Cost is visible: his sensitivity drove him to the mountain cabin and keeps him isolated even while helping. Present in setup (paragraph two label, then embodied as "anguish washed over him"), middle (threatens to drown him, forces distance calibration), closure (both empaths share isolation). Specificity moderate—another sensitive type could substitute with edits. Label-only mention in paragraph two (−0.3) before embodiment begins.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Hide (action) motivates Ezra's years-long mountain retreat and his corner-seat habit, setting up the reversal when he chooses visibility to help the woman. The founder's journal counsels "learn cruelty to themselves, denying their nature to preserve it," which Ezra enacts by hiding to sustain compassion. Present in setup (solitude backstory, corner observation), middle (instinct to retreat vs. decision to approach), closure (teaches "hide in the open"). Two beats involve the action causally. However, the final teaching moment would remain coherent if reframed as "distance" or "withdrawal"—hiding's specificity matters less than the paradox it enables. Swappability moderate (−0.5). No single pivotal turn hinges solely on hiding rather than its synonym acts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Staying while leaving (method) is signaled in paragraph two ("neither fully present nor absent"), enacted when Ezra sits "close enough to offer presence, far enough to maintain boundaries," and crystallized in the closure teaching. The method shapes his approach tactic and differentiates his help from simple consolation. Present in setup (description of his Society membership), middle (distance calibration during the encounter), closure (named explicitly as the lesson). Cost visible: he can never fully connect. Mechanics matter: the physical staging (careful distance) and psychological stance (separate solitudes) both rely on this method. Irreplaceability high for the ending's thematic charge. Two distinct beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret society library (setting) enables the encounter (both present there) and supplies the founder's journal that primes Ezra's teaching. The impossible architecture and midnight liminality charge the tone but do not constrain tactics—the conversation would unfold similarly in any private space. Present in setup (third floor, invisible to passersby, reading room), absent from middle pressure (no spatial resource or barrier alters choices), cameo in closure (vast room mentioned as backdrop). The hidden-in-plain-sight detail mirrors theme but does not force a choice. Lyric reprise moderate. Swappable with "private study" or "hidden salon" without breaking causality (−0.6). No micro-setting element (tool, body) alters the encounter's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe (within arm's reach of midnight) is announced at eleven forty-seven, marked by clock chime at eleven fifty-nine, and crosses midnight during the encounter. The liminal moment supports tone (day's end, transitions) but does not tighten decisions—Ezra's choice to approach and the woman's acceptance occur without time pressure. Present in setup (paragraph two timestamp), noted at closure (midnight whisper), but absent from middle escalation. The clock does not alter tactics or impose a deadline. Ornamental use (−0.8): time description enhances atmosphere without affecting outcome. Swappable with "late evening" or "closing hour" with minor tonal loss but no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To unearth wisdom in a mistake (motivation) drives Ezra's journal study, frames his approach to the woman (sharing his invitation story), and resolves in his realization that the late invitation was purposeful. The desire is dramatized in his choice to share the error rather than console directly, and friction appears when helping risks repeating his isolation mistake. Present in setup (paragraph three: "sought wisdom in his greatest mistake"), middle (tells invitation story to reframe her telegram regret), closure (understands the timing as teaching opportunity). Cost visible: accepting the mistake means accepting he couldn't have arrived earlier to help others. Two key beats shaped by this want. Specificity high: no other motivation produces this exact teaching method.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Enlarged tranquility (tone) is introduced as Ezra's "deliberate calm" and "shelter others could enter," sustained through the quiet encounter, and named in the final line as filling the room. Tone modulates subtly: sharpens during empathetic threat ("threatened to drown him"), steadies during teaching, expands at closure. Coherent through turns without flattening pressure. Present in setup (paragraph five), embodied in middle (his projection calms the woman), charged in final image (the quiet "contained multitudes"). However, "enlarged" as descriptor risks abstraction—on-page beats show calm more than enlargement. Lyric reprise reweights the opening projection. Swappability moderate: "deep peace" or "shared stillness" could substitute with tonal shift but structural integrity (−0.4).</comment>
