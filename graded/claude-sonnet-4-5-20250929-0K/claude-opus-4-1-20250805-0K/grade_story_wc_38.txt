<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poetic assertions ("lyrical code breaker," "choreography waiting to be performed") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother revelation arrives as exposition rather than earned through prior micro-choices that test commitment. Her competence is asserted globally without meaningful struggle or blind spots that force mistakes—she succeeds linearly through inherited destiny rather than flawed agency. The final understanding ("both the lock and the key") reads as thematic summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative imagery building toward conceptual repricing) but the closure—"Welcome home, granddaughter" plus the spiral holding shape—remains largely declarative rather than a decisive act or renunciation with felt cost. Causality is loose: the dance "responds" and systems "begin responding" without clear because/therefore linkage between specific movements and specific data unlocks. The final spiral and warm dice offer charged images, but Maya's options before and after feel identical (she already knew her heritage mattered; the water spiral confirms rather than reweights). Orientation is clear early, avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flooded laboratory supplies vivid, purposeful detail: green-filtered light, brackish water at knee-depth, submerged desks that allow the dice's impossible balance. The water's tidal rhythm and the spiral formation at closure charge the final image with spatial specificity. Sensory selection modulates appropriately (splashes are "deliberate," eddies "mirror" screen patterns) and the space constrains Maya's movement vocabulary. The sunken setting enables the convergence of grandmother's research, coded journal, and Maya's inherited dance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—unlocking the encrypted research—is signaled early and pursued linearly. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening or cost: Maya performs the dance, systems respond in rhythm, reversal completes without friction or mistake. No live option is foreclosed; the "patient defiance" described in narration never translates to an on-page trade-off (stamina cost, risk of structural collapse, moral calculus about releasing dangerous knowledge). The backward-step reversal offers structural elegance but no visible price that alters her final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of encoding vulnerability as strength and the premise of "movement as decryption" emerge through specific images (the dice's impossible balance, the spiral holding shape, dance as translation). The journal's transformation from formulas to disguised steps grounds the concept in particulars. However, the final paragraph's thematic summary ("some codes were meant to be broken not with logic, but with the lyrical truth of inherited motion") states rather than enacts, and Maya's arc from suspicion to understanding arrives without ambiguity or counter-pressure. The closing image (spiral holding shape) offers resonance but the ending explains its meaning rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Maya's perceptual filter. Diction control is strong in descriptive passages ("brackish water," "half-life power," "impossible geometries") and the prose texture reflects the piece's lyric ambition. However, filter verbs and passive constructions ("she was known," "she had always suspected," "she understood now") dull immediacy in key moments, and the final two paragraphs shift into expository summary that explains what Maya has learned rather than showing her synthesis through embodied choice. Voice remains consistent but peaks in explanation rather than image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong figurative control ("the familiar weight of destiny settled on her shoulders like an old coat found in an attic, smelling of memories she'd never lived"). However, scaffold redundancy appears: "The dice had always done that" immediately after showing it, and the final three paragraphs loop through thematic restatement ("understood now," "understood finally"). Template cadence emerges in the closing beat with repeated "some [noun]" constructions. The "patient spider" simile and "lyrical truth of inherited motion" elevate diction beyond Maya's established register without voice motivation. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and register drift touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—decryption through dance, coded journal as choreography—offers a fresh synthesis of cipher-breaking and embodied knowledge. The flooded lab and impossible dice add atmospheric specificity. However, the inherited-destiny frame and "chosen one" structure follow familiar template: protagonist discovers grandmother's work, performs ritual movements, unlocks hidden knowledge without genuine obstacle. The piece hedges on stakes (research is "too dangerous" but we never see the danger tested) and the resolution—Maya was always "both the lock and the key"—arrives through revelation rather than transformation of prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya appears throughout and her choice to descend and dance drives the action. However, her decisions arrive without visible friction or cost—she interprets, dances, completes the reversal in linear success. The "lyrical code breaker" trait is asserted as reputation rather than tested through competing methods or failure. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but agency is observational; the dance "responds" rather than forcing a high-stakes choice between options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appears in three beats: tumbles and balances impossibly, begins to glow, retrieved warm and humming at closure. Each mention reweights its function (defying probability → revealing engravings → warm with possibility), meeting the object reprise test. However, it does not constrain Maya's choices or enable a tactic under pressure—it validates rather than complicates. Setup and payoff present; middle development is descriptive rather than causal. Swappable with another "mysterious heirloom" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" appears once in narration ("a calm defiance of everything the original programmers had expected") as thematic label rather than enacted stance. Maya's approach is patient and confident but never contrasts defiance against compliance or tests calm against urgency. The concept does not shape a visible choice or create friction; it describes her method retrospectively. Ornamental use without causal pressure or cost. Present in development as label only; no setup or payoff that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" structures the entire middle sequence: Maya translates journal movements into physical steps that unlock the console. The attribute enables the core action (systems respond to her rhythm), appears in setup (her reputation for movement-based decryption), drives development (the dance itself), and charges the ending (backward reversal completes the sequence). However, it does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—grace and stamina are infinite, no misstep or fatigue complicates execution. Essential to plot logic but lacks friction; two beats plus closure participation without price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Liberate" governs the dominant stake: Maya frees information "imprisoned for decades" through dance. The verb choice and its passive construction ("liberating information") appear in setup and drive the middle action (systems respond, data rearranges). The closure message ("Welcome home") and spiral formation enact the liberation's completion. The action is specific to this story's logic (dance unlocks encryption) and irreplaceable—"decode" or "retrieve" would not carry the same weight of freeing versus merely accessing. Three beats, closure-active, but the lack of a countervailing capture/constraint cost limits top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The coded journal enters immediately (Maya carries it in her satchel), supplies the movement instructions throughout development ("movements disguised as words, steps hidden in syntax"), and the marginalia about "those who would understand" primes the final revelation. The journal's transformation from coffee-stained formulas to choreography demonstrates the method's specificity. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we never see a specific notation translated into a specific step with a specific result, so the journal functions as enabling device rather than constraining puzzle. Setup, development, payoff present; causal role in one major beat (the dance sequence) but swappable with "encoded music" or similar artifact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is anchored early (collapsed ventilation shaft, broken skylights, knee-deep water), supplies resources throughout (submerged desk for dice balance, screens that flicker and respond, tidal rhythm), and the final spiral formation in water charges the closure image with spatial proof of success. The flood itself constrains Maya's approach (wading, splashing as deliberate percussion) and the "green-filtered sunlight" establishes atmospheric coherence. Environment shapes tactics (water as medium for pattern-carving) and the ending image (spiral holding shape) would fail without this exact setting. Three beats, closure-essential, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" appears once as simile describing Maya's movement ("patient precision of a spider spinning its web"). The timeframe element is metaphorical rather than a live clock—no urgency, no ticking countdown, no exhaustion that forces choice. The piece tracks elapsed time only once ("three hours ago" descent) without later consequence. The spider image offers textural resonance but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Ornamental use in development; no setup or payoff that pressures pacing. Late metaphor without causal function; cap 4.6 for missing setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is quoted from the grandmother's journal and repeated in Maya's realization that Dr. Voss "discovered how to encode human consciousness" as "transformation" rather than transcendence. The motivation shapes the thematic question but remains abstract—Maya's own vulnerability is never dramatized or tested as weakness that must be encoded. She inherits the goal rather than choosing it through friction between wanting and fearing. Present in development and payoff as concept; no setup that dramatizes Maya's stake in this specific transformation. Told-only motivation without on-page cost or conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" coheres in the opening's "green-filtered" atmosphere, the journal's aging pages, the dice's impossible behavior, and the closing revelation of inherited knowledge ("memories she'd never lived"). The tone modulates appropriately: wonder in the middle dance sequence, inevitability in the final recognition. The "Welcome home, granddaughter" message delivers the familiarity's source with restraint. However, mystery deflates into explanation in the final paragraphs rather than holding tension, and the tone does not pressure Maya's choices—she moves through discovery without doubt or disorientation. Coherent and present through ending but static; charges the final image without complicating it.</comment>
