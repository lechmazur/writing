<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's interior is well-embodied through physical trembling and concrete choices under pressure. Her moon-phase limitation creates genuine constraint ("could hardly lift the heavy bronze artifact") that shapes tactics. The brother's call crystallizes her renunciation—"some of us are meant to stay"—but the decision feels more declared than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her competence (precise navigation instructions) lacks visible struggle or blind spots that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina explicitly renounces the reverse migration pull, accepting her role as guide with the cost of permanent separation. The final image—"She would not leave. She would build bridges from words until the last caller found their way home"—reweights her patchwork identity and the bronze foot's warmth into a called vocation. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Diego's call forces her to articulate the endurance choice, foreclosing the path of return with felt cost ("I learned that some of us are meant to stay").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The signal station is spatially coherent (manual crank, radio array, receiver) and the bronze foot functions as micro-setting—used as lever, anchor, and warmth source—constraining her physical capability under the moon-phase weakness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "sulfur fields," "poisoned corridor," "burned church" anchor the geography Marina navigates. The final image charges when the bronze foot "sat heavy in her lap, warm as a living thing, holding her to this place between worlds." Minor: the broader poisoned landscape remains somewhat abstract; specifics like "toxins settle lower at night" are instructional rather than experientially grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: guide scattered families through safe passage while resisting her own biological pull to migrate. The hydraulics failure creates immediate pressure (frozen array, three-hour window) and Diego's call in the sulfur fields delivers the peak tightening—she must guide someone she loves through lethal terrain while articulating why she herself will not follow. The cost of her choice is legible on the page: permanent separation, endurance of "terrible longing," and acceptance of solitary duty. One reversal when the array finally moves "close enough" enables the brother's call, then her final stance crystallizes with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of duty versus belonging emerges from Marina's concrete choices rather than statement, though the final paragraph edges toward articulation ("this was her calling"). The bronze foot's transformation—from grief relic to working tool to "warm as a living thing"—reweights loss into vocation without stating a moral. "Geography of loss" and "reverse migration" operate thematically but risk abstraction; the piece grounds them through specific navigation choices (satellite shadows, salt in left pocket). The ending offers a resonant answer to whether Marina will follow the pull, but "bridges from words" in the final line feels slightly declarative rather than leaving ambiguity for the reader to complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with Marina's perceptual signature (sees in terms of maps, frequencies, constellation paths). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: short, breathless sentences during the crank scene, longer reflection after dawn. Dialogue carries subtext—Diego's "Build me a path" echoes childhood games, Marina's instructions conceal desperation. Minor: some diction drifts elevated for the focalizer ("vast indifference," "inextricable from ancestral soil") and the child's voice lacks distinct texture. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated rather than artifactual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. Information density is generally high (most sentences advance character or situation). Paraphrase loop detected: "The reverse migration wasn't voluntary" followed immediately by restating the same concept with "something in their blood responded to the dying earth's pull" (−0.2). Template cadence in the phone-call sequence: "Seven degrees...Wait for dawn" / "Avoid the eastern bridge" / "Little one, listen" uses repetitive instructional stems across multiple beats without taught pattern (−0.4). Stock metaphor "stitched together from loss and duty" in the final paragraph (−0.2). Cumulatively −0.8 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "reverse migration" premise offers a fresh angle on displacement narratives, and the signal-station guide role is specific rather than generic. Marina's moon-phase weakness and the bronze foot as both anchor and tool show particular synthesis. The emotional core—choosing to stay as shepherd rather than follow the pull—feels earned rather than convenient. Deduction: the "dying earth pulling descendants back" setup closely matches apocalyptic migration templates; while Marina's role transforms it, the world-logic itself (biological pull, poisoned corridors, detection drones) assembles familiar post-disaster elements without deep transformation (−0.6 per Derivative Premise Guardrail).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina (patchwork navigator) is present throughout and drives two key turns: cranking the array despite moon-phase weakness to enable contact, then explicitly choosing to remain as guide when Diego's call crystallizes the choice. Her navigation instructions (satellite shadows, salt, quarantine road) are concrete decisions that alter tactics for callers. The final stance—"She would not leave"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the migration path with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot appears in three distinct beats: initial grip for anchor, use as lever against the crank, and final warmth in her lap. Its properties (weight, patina, warmth) constrain and enable action (she can barely lift it under the waning moon; it serves as brace; it "grew warm" during Diego's call). The object returns in the ending image "warm as a living thing, holding her to this place between worlds," reweighting grief relic into vocation anchor. Slight swappability: another heavy heirloom could function similarly with minor edits, preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" is introduced early, shapes the dominant stake (families seeking return despite danger), and drives Marina's tactical choices (route guidance through poisoned geography). It creates the core conflict when Diego calls from the sulfur fields, forcing Marina to guide someone back while articulating her own renunciation. The concept charges the closure: her decision to remain as shepherd rather than follow the pull. Cost is visible (permanent separation, enduring "terrible longing"). Strong causal pressure and closure participation; the concept is essential to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is signaled early ("strength fluctuated with moon phases now") and constrains on-page action: the waning crescent makes her weak ("could hardly lift the heavy bronze artifact"), forcing her to use the censer foot as lever and requiring visible physical struggle to crank the array. The trait enables a credible cost (trembling arms, violent shaking) and the promise that "when the moon grew fuller...her strength returned" establishes a recurring constraint. Missing: the trait does not decisively shape the closure moment or Marina's final choice, limiting its integration to middle-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Build" is signaled early and appears in multiple forms: building with the manual crank (physical), building paths through navigation instructions (metaphorical), and building bridges from words (vocational). The verb drives Diego's request ("Build me a path") and the final image ("build bridges from words until the last caller found their way home"). The action redefines Marina's role from technician to shepherd. Minor swappability: "guide" or "construct" could replace with edits, though "build" carries specific resonance with the patchwork/assembly motif.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Cryptic phone calls at midnight" is the primary method shown on the page. Four distinct calls dramatize the work: Portuguese speaker, child seeking parents, brother Diego. The cryptic nature (coded instructions, constellation maps, no direct routes) shapes the attempts and reflects the hostile surveillance context (detection drones). The method is signaled early, drives multiple beats, and remains active through closure ("one cryptic midnight message at a time"). The specificity (midnight timing, telephone receiver, whispered codes) is irreplaceable; radio or daylight contact would change the tone and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored in the opening line and provides concrete resources (manual crank, radio array, receiver) that Marina uses. The failed hydraulics create the immediate problem requiring physical labor. Starlight is purposeful: needed for navigation, fading at dawn when stronger daylight signal arrives. The station's isolation ("place between worlds") charges the ending image. Minor: while the station enables the action, the specific "starlit" quality beyond basic night setting is more atmospheric than causally decisive; removing stars would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hydraulics failure is introduced immediately ("three hours ago") and creates urgency: Marina must manually crank the array before dawn when the scattered families lose contact. The time constraint (night → approaching dawn → "Dawn approached") tightens the physical task and shapes the emotional crescendo of Diego's call. The timeframe enables the closure by creating the bounded window in which she must act and decide. Missing higher score: the clock is somewhat loose (three hours mentioned but not tracked beat by beat), and the dawn arrival feels more transitional than decisive to the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina's motivation "to navigate the geography of loss" is embodied through specific choices: cranking despite pain, delivering precise instructions, promising hope to a child. The desire is conflicted—"Her own cells sang with the same terrible longing"—creating friction between her pull to migrate and her duty to guide others. Diego's call forces the conflict to crisis, yielding the articulated renunciation: "some of us are meant to stay, to be the voice in the darkness." The cost of this choice (enduring longing, permanent separation) is visible on the page and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is coherent throughout: the piece balances grief (grandmother's lost temple, drowned evacuation, brother in the sulfur fields) with quiet purpose (precise navigation, warmth of the bronze foot, "shepherding" as calling). Tone modulates appropriately under pressure—spare syntax during the crank struggle, warmer reflection at dawn—without flattening into single static mood. The final image synthesizes both raw (visible cost, "terrible longing") and solace (warmth, vocation, holding). The tone charges closure by making the endurance choice feel both painful and sustaining.</comment>
