<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and grounded in his profession, with his grandfather's confession forcing a reckoning. The decision to close his business and destroy files reads as genuine renunciation with visible cost. Interior work is solid—"the weight of unspoken words pressed against his chest"—though the epiphany leans slightly toward articulation rather than embodied realization. The piece stays strictly within Elias's knowledge bounds with no leakage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: watch hand arrival → shore visit → carved evidence → family complicity → career parallel → closure choice. The closure is a Decisive Change (ending the business, placing the watch hand) with visible cost (income, identity, complicity broken). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes his grandfather's crimes and his own inheritance of silence. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and shore are established early with atmospheric specificity ("bruised purples," "salt-worn wood"). The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's discovery and charges the final image when he adds the watch hand to the collection. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias sorting, lifting, picking up pieces in sequence. Setting detail remains selective and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: confronting inherited guilt and complicity. The discovery sequence escalates pressure causally—dates → coordinates → pattern → realization of family silence → career parallel. Agency is strong at closure: Elias chooses to destroy his files and end the "sieved hush" with visible cost (livelihood, professional identity). The tightening forecloses his prior path and the cost is legible in "even if speaking the truth came too late to matter."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between grandfather's betrayals and Elias's career manufacturing false genealogies—both trade truth for comfort. The driftwood carvings function as concrete particulars that accumulate meaning without stating a moral. The final image offers a resonant answer: setting down the watch hand literalizes releasing "the weight of withheld truth" without spelling it out. "Some weights...could only be lifted by setting them down completely" borders on statement but is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "the sieved hush," "cartographers had stopped marking," "salt-worn wood." Distance is controlled; narrative certainty matches what Elias can know. Some filter verbs ("understood," "realized") cluster near the end but remain voice-motivated rather than scaffolding. Diction stays consistent within educated register appropriate to a genealogist. No dialogue present, correctly not scored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or character. Minor template cadence in the realization paragraph: "He'd inherited...He'd inherited...He'd doctored...he'd helped" creates a brief drumbeat (−0.3). "The weight of unspoken words" and "weight of withheld truth" form a purposeful echo rather than loop. One paraphrase near the end: "manufactured memories" restated as "false genealogies he'd created" (−0.2). Clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—black market genealogist confronting family silence—offers a fresh synthesis. The parallel structure (grandfather's crimes carved in wood, Elias's crimes in documents) is specific and non-obvious. The watch hand as single remaining artifact is a strong particular. Risk in choosing "manufactures false memories" as a profession pays off thematically. The coastal confession museum feels earned rather than convenient. Slight proximity to familiar "sins of the father" frames, but execution through occupational specificity transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is established immediately as "genealogist who'd spent fifteen years manufacturing false memories" and drives every key turn: interprets the watch hand, reads the carvings, draws the map, recognizes the parallel to his own work, makes the closure choice to end his business. His guilt and profession are causally active across all three structural beats and shape the final renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Watch hand arrives in paragraph two as inciting object, is handled physically ("felt heavy in his pocket"), returns with reweighted meaning when Elias understands "its message," and appears in the closure beat when he places it among the carvings. Present in setup, middle realization, and payoff. Could score higher if its specific properties (brass, minute hand, stopped at 11:47) constrained tactics rather than serving as symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is coined early ("the sieved hush that fell over his family") and returns at closure ("The sieved hush...would end with him"). It names the family's filtering of truth and shapes Elias's final choice to speak. Functions as charged frame rather than tactical constraint—present in setup and payoff with thematic weight but doesn't alter middle options. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Manufactures false memories" is established in paragraph two, enables his wealth and career, creates the thematic parallel when he recognizes "he'd inherited the same corrupt bargain," and drives the closure choice to "destroy his files, let the false genealogies...crumble." The attribute constrains his moral reckoning and appears across setup, middle realization, and ending with visible cost (ending livelihood). Specific occupational detail matters to the parallel structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quell" appears twice: "quell the restless ghosts of their histories" (paragraph six) and implied in the closure's refusal to continue that quelling. The action names what Elias's career does and what he now refuses, shaping the final choice. Present in middle reflection and closure implication, but doesn't drive a distinct beat beyond the general stakes. Functional role in thematic articulation but not tactically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled in the opening line, occupies the entire discovery sequence (paragraphs 3–5), and provides the mechanism for revelation: dates, coordinates, and pattern emerge through his physical sorting. The method is irreplaceable—no other means would yield this specific map of his grandfather's crimes. Present and active in setup, middle beats, and shapes the ending when he adds the watch hand to the collection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace is anchored in the opening line and provides the deliberate staging ground where "someone" arranged the carvings for Elias to find. It's specified early, supplies the confrontation space, and returns in the closure beat ("As the last light faded from the cobalt terrace"). The setting enables discovery but doesn't constrain tactics—any isolated location would serve. Atmospheric contribution is strong; causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weight of unspoken words" appears in paragraph six and returns transformed as "weight of withheld truth" at closure, framing the emotional pressure. Functions as metaphorical timeframe rather than literal clock. Present in middle and ending, charges the theme, but doesn't tighten decisions beat-to-beat. The piece tracks dusk-to-dark progression minimally. Lyric presence with thematic weight but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Discovering "the weight of a withheld truth" drives Elias to the shore, structures the entire revelation sequence, and culminates in his choice to end the family silence. The motivation is dramatized through physical action (sorting carvings), opposed by cost (career loss), and resolved on the page. Setup, middle pressure, and closure all trace to this desire. Friction between professional identity and moral reckoning is clear and costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tempered regret saturates the prose from "bruised purples" and "hands now dust" through "museum of tempered regret" (direct naming in the final paragraph). Tone modulates appropriately: measured discovery, rising recognition, quiet renunciation. Coheres through turns without flattening into single static mood. The understated closure—"even if speaking the truth came too late to matter"—charges the final image with restrained sorrow rather than catharsis. Strong tonal control that supports rather than announces theme.</comment>
