<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ira's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. Her actions follow a smooth technical path without struggle or cost to personal values. The "subdued awakenings" of the creatures and her own temporal observations remain abstract rather than forcing hard choices. Dr. Vasquez's alarm is deflected without consequence, so no relationship pressure shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through escalating sensory paradoxes ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm") and temporal imagery. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Ira's realization that "time moved sideways" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—her colleagues will dismiss it, isolating her discovery. However, orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words), warranting a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0. The reweighting feels philosophical rather than materially consequential on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The research station, xenobiology tanks, and magnetic nexus are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (amber glow, frost forming on glowing surfaces). The "magnetic nexus at twilight" constrains Ira's experiment window and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear. Cap applied at 7.0 per Q2 Orientation Test penalty, preventing higher band entry despite strong atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. Ira pulls the lever further, the station shudders, Vasquez protests, yet Ira continues without trade-off or consequence. The "unexpected resonance" complicates but does not escalate pressure into a choice that forecloses options. Closure reconfigures meaning conceptually but lacks visible on-page price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image: time as web, twilight alignment, holographic fractals. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer ("sideways from now") that reweights the opening question. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("navigator of time's hidden dimensions") rather than trusting the image alone. The paradoxes (icy warmth, subdued awakenings) feel ornamental rather than constraining choice, weakening thematic integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is moderately distinct (scientific precision, metaphor bias). However, the voice converges with the prompt's conceptual register ("holographic principles," "temporal displacement") rather than Ira's lived idiom under pressure. Phrases like "she had come to recognize" and "she could see" stack filter verbs in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue is functional but minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Significant figurative density in high-pressure beats: "time folded like origami," "honey through water," "web with every strand vibrating." Mixed metaphor: frost forming on surfaces "even as they glowed with heat" contradicts physics without pattern-teaching the paradox early. Template cadence: "She could see… She could see…" repeats stems. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 5–6 restate "icy warmth" and "paradox" without added pressure. Apply −0.9 total for density + coherence + loop issues, all touching the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—time moves sideways on an alien world—closely matches speculative-fiction templates (scientist proves counterintuitive physics via alien biology). Specific execution (xenobiology specimens, magnetic nexus, holographic display) adds flavor but the arc (lone researcher defies skeptics, proves radical theory, faces dismissal) follows familiar beats. The paradoxes (icy warmth, mechanically warm) are stated rather than transformed through lived constraint. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 adjustment within Q8 for template adherence without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ira (obliging sky mechanic) is present throughout and her technical role enables access to the atmospheric processors and magnetic nexus. However, her "sky mechanic" identity is setup-only; the closure turns on her temporal discovery, not her maintenance role. The character trait does not constrain a key choice or create visible cost. Swappable with "research physicist" with minor edits. Setup present, middle functional, closure absent: cap 4.6. Swappability: cap 3.8. Use 3.8 as baseline; add +0.4 for one beat involvement (adjusting processors creates resonance). Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is signaled early (first third), manipulated in the middle (lever adjustments), and charges the closure image ("magnetic nexus dimmed"). It shapes Ira's experimental window (twilight hour) and enables the temporal proof. All three gates present; multiple beat involvement; closure linkage strong. Baseline ~6.5; add +0.9 for two beats, +0.7 for closure, +0.3 for specificity (twilight alignment is unique). Total: 8.4, round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Subdued awakenings describe the xenobiology specimens' state during twilight alignment. The concept is mentioned twice (paragraph 6, paragraph 11) but does not shape stakes or tactics. Ira observes the creatures; they do not alter her choices or the closure. Present but ornamental. Setup present, middle absent, closure absent: cap 2.8. Add +0.3 for atmospheric contribution. Final: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" describes Ira's workstation and the atmospheric processors. The attribute appears in paragraph 5 (workstation) and paragraph 12 (atmosphere settles), creating micro-distortions that let her perceive temporal anomalies. Functional but the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; swappable with "thermally active" or "resonant field." Setup present, middle functional, closure absent: cap 4.6. Add +0.3 for specificity. Final: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lever controls magnetic field intensity; Ira adjusts it twice (paragraphs 7, 9), triggering the holographic display and station shudder. The action is irreplaceable: pulling the lever further causes the resonance and proof. All three gates; strong causal pressure. Baseline ~6.5; add +0.9 for two beats, +0.7 for closure linkage, +0.5 for causal necessity. Total: 8.6, round to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Holographic principles are named repeatedly (paragraphs 4, 5, 9, 15) and enable Ira's temporal proof. The method is setup early, used in middle beats (holographic display explodes into fractals), and present at closure (holographic readouts confirm data). However, the mechanics remain abstract; "holographic principles" could swap with "quantum field theory" without altering tactics. All three gates; multiple beats. Baseline ~6.5; subtract −0.6 for swappability. Final: 5.9, round to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station orbits Kepler-442b, houses atmospheric processors, and constrains Ira's work environment. The setting provides resources (containment fields, intercom, workstation) and the twilight alignment window. Present throughout; middle functional; closure mentions the station context. Baseline ~6.0; add +0.4 for one beat involvement, +0.3 for constraint (twilight window). Total: 6.7, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" frames the twilight hour as a precise experimental window. The timeframe is setup (paragraph 2), structures middle action (twilight alignment), and closure notes the hour ending. The constraint shapes Ira's tactics (must act during alignment). All three gates; strong temporal pressure. Baseline ~6.5; add +0.5 for causal constraint, +0.3 for closure. Total: 7.3, round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ira's motivation to prove time moves sideways is declared in paragraph 2 and drives her experiment. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction with cost. No tension between this want and competing fears or values appears on the page. Setup present, middle functional (she pursues proof), closure restates the goal. Baseline ~5.0; add +0.9 for two beats, +0.3 for closure mention. Total: 6.2, round to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" recurs throughout (paragraphs 7, 12, 16) as an oxymoronic tone marker. The paradox is consistent and charges atmospheric description but does not modulate with pressure; it remains static across turns. Setup present, middle functional, closure reprises the phrase. Baseline ~5.5; subtract −0.3 for static application. Final: 5.2, round to 5.3.</comment>
