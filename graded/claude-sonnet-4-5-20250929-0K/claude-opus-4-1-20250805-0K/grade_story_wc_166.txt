<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to create defiance-art is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—"obsidian grace," "cosmic verse"—without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The dance sequence tells us she transforms but does not dramatize a conflicting desire or miscalculation that forces a trade-off. The ending renunciation (knowing capture will come) reads as pre-determined rather than earned through on-page friction. No visible cost beyond acceptance of an inevitable consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates celestial imagery and spreads moonstone dust across the garden to seed future rebellion. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the garden becomes a living document of resistance. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. However, the cost remains abstract—"tomorrow she would be gone"—without specifying capture, injury, or forfeiture on the page. The escalation is atmospheric (dust multiplying, light spreading) rather than a choice-driven tightening, which lowers pressure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden, wisteria, and clifftop dwelling anchor space and mood effectively. Celestial choreography (meridians, orbits, galaxies) gives the dance spatial logic. The moonstone dust constrains the final image: it seeds the soil, altering the environment's future function. The setting evolves from performance space to archive of memory, charging the closure with micro-setting specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: create defiant art before the Council detects her. The piece signals the authority threat early and the dance becomes the tightening act. However, Mira faces no on-page obstacle—no misstep, no tool failure, no temptation to stop—so pressure is declared rather than tested. The ending accepts capture as inevitable rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses an alternative. Cost is conceptual (imprint in the garden) but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme: memory as resistance to authoritarian erasure. The piece integrates this through the grandmother's necklace, the nostalgia ban, and the garden imprint without stating a moral. The final image—dust seeding future rebellions—offers a resonant answer. However, the climax leans on cosmic-verse metaphor and "living document of defiance" rather than specific, grounded action, which keeps resonance mid-high but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance consistent. Perceptual signature: Mira notices gaps, tides, intervals. However, diction drifts into elevated register—"spontaneously anchored," "meridians that mirrored planetary orbits"—that reads more authorial than character-bound. Psychic distance remains steady, but the narrator's texture is not strongly differentiated from generic literary fantasy voice. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "obsidian grace," "ink waiting to be written," "cosmos speaks through flesh," "incantation," "patient light." The metaphors pile without clarifying mechanics or choice. Paraphrase loop: "The moonstone dust began to glow... The dust multiplied impossibly" restates transformation. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She" or "Mira" in paragraph 2–3. Register drift into cosmic abstraction flattens urgency at the climax. Artifacts pervade the final third, preventing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Premise: artist in exile defies authoritarian memory ban through forbidden dance. The nostalgia-ban and dance-as-resistance frame is familiar from dystopian/fantasy templates. The piece does not transform the template through lived occupational detail, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus—Mira's choice is preordained and unopposed. The cosmic-verse metaphor layer adds texture but not narrative surprise. One fresh inflection: dust seeding the soil for future rebellions, but it arrives late and is told rather than shown altering a present choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her dance drives the visible action. However, her skill (tide dancing) is described but not tested—no misstep, no improvisation under constraint. Her choices (begin the ritual, continue dancing) do not narrow options or force trade-offs. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is atmospheric rather than decisional. Replaceable with "exiled performer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moonstone cabochon dust appears in paragraph 3 (early signal), is handled and transformed (glow, multiply, spread) across paragraphs 5–7 (beat involvement), and seeds the soil in the ending image (closure linkage). Three gates met. However, the dust does not constrain a choice—it behaves conveniently (spontaneous multiplication) to solve the imprint problem it did not help create. Functional across beats but no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elective exile is signaled in paragraph 1 and frames Mira's isolation. It enables her to practice forbidden art without persecution, shaping the stakes (avoiding Council detection). Development: her clifftop solitude taught her to observe gaps. Closure: exile transformed into artistry. Three gates met. However, exile is more theme than active constraint—she could have chosen any remote location. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears once in paragraph 3 as a descriptor for how the dust adheres to her fingertip. No on-page cost or constraint tied to this property—it simply happens. Label-only mention without development or closure participation. Missing middle and closure gates; ornamental detail.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fledge is signaled in paragraph 2 ("to finally emerge from her chrysalis"), developed through the dance transformation (paragraphs 5–8: "felt herself fledging at last"), and realized in the ending ("transformed exile into artistry"). Three gates met. The action is metaphorical (becoming a living document) rather than physical, but it drives the thematic closure and is irreplaceable—"emerge" or "transform" would dilute the chrysalis/flight motif. Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Observing gaps is introduced in paragraph 4 as Mira's method: "spaces between heartbeats, between waves, between one breath and the next." Development: watching tides revealed hidden patterns. Closure: the dance channels intervals. Three gates met. However, the method is told rather than shown constraining a choice—we do not see her use gap-observation to solve a problem on the page. Functional thematic reprise but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Twilight garden is present from the title and opening line (setup). The wisteria, marble statues, and clifftop anchor space and provide the canvas for the dust imprint (development and closure). The garden evolves into a living archive, charging the final image. Three gates met. However, the garden does not constrain a choice—it is backdrop and recipient rather than obstacle or resource that alters tactics. Essential to the closure image but not to pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is signaled in paragraph 1 (three years ago) and creates the threat: authorities will detect the energy signature by dawn. Setup and closure gates met. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Mira completes her ritual without interruption or time pressure dramatized on the page. The "by dawn" deadline is declared but not felt. Missing middle development; functional but replaceable with any regime threat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin is stated in paragraph 4 and enacted through the dance (paragraphs 5–8), which writes nebulae across her body. Three gates met. The motivation is clear and drives the arc. However, it is not conflicted—no competing want or fear tests her commitment. The verse is completed without friction. Functional and essential to the closure image but lacks on-page cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Obsidian grace appears in the opening line and closing paragraph, framing Mira's poise. The tone is lyric-elevated and consistent through the dance sequence. However, it does not modulate with pressure—the register remains static even as stakes theoretically rise. The final image repeats "obsidian grace" to bookend but does not reweight it. Purposeful reprise but no cadence shift or intensification. Mid-band lyric consistency without closure charge.</comment>
