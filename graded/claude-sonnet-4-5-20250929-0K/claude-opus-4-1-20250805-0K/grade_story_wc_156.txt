<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("methodical nature warred with an inexplicable playfulness") rather than embodied contradiction in action. The coin-flipping choice at the climax feels unearned—no prior causality establishes why *this time* she would "choose differently" or what concrete cost that choice forecloses. Marcus remains a prop with no pressure function, and the "nested awakenings" frame is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal character under stress. The final decision to paint over the mural and "seal away the magic" lacks visible consequence that would make the renunciation credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn Elena is a restorer mid-paragraph, and the garden's acoustic function is told rather than anchored through concrete spatial detail. The "nested awakenings" closure (Elena realizing she's lived this loop before and choosing to repeat it) is asserted via disembodied voice rather than earned through on-page causality—nothing in her prior three months of restoration foreshadows this metaphysical recursion. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: anchors arrive late and the garden's mechanics remain vague. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost (painting over her work) is undermotivated and the lens wavers between metaphysical reveal and character choice without teaching the pattern early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden's acoustic architecture is described in vivid but static terms ("surfaces designed to bend and reflect every whisper into a symphony") without showing how it constrains Elena's movement or choices during the restoration. The hobo nickel's shadow on the spiral triggers the sound shift, so the setting does participate in the turn, lifting it above ornamental. However, spatial choreography remains unclear—we never learn where Marcus stands, how close Elena is to the panels, or how the curved walls shape her access to the mural.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the mural's "true purpose"—is signaled early but never tested with a trade-off or visible cost. The nested-awakenings reveal arrives as exposition ("You've restored this mural before") rather than through Elena's choices narrowing options. Her decision to "choose differently" by flipping the coin and then re-hiding it does not foreclose a live alternative; Marcus's frozen state is reversed without consequence, and the ending loops back to the start with no felt price. Escalation under any lens is minimal: the garden hums, the coin alternates faces, but no protagonist agency tightens the spiral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of curiosity versus certainty is stated explicitly ("I choose differently... exchange certainty for curiosity") rather than emerging from concrete actions. The hobo nickel's sleeping/waking faces function as an on-the-nose symbol without accumulating pressure across beats. The final image—Elena painting over the uncovered work—could suggest a resonant Conceptual Repricing (treasures "meant to be found again and again"), but the assertion is delivered via direct authorial thesis ("each time by someone who's both the same person and completely different") instead of a charged image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading is invited; the ending explains itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elena's perceptual signature (methodical restorer noticing layers) is established early. However, the disembodied voice ("she heard herself say, though her lips hadn't moved") introduces unexplained dual consciousness that blurs focalization without teaching the pattern or paying it off as unreliable narration. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Marcus's single line lacks subtext. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to be watching") cluster in the opening without voice motivation. The prose modulates toward lyricism under pressure ("bewitched the space itself") but the elevated diction ("methodically painting over what she'd just uncovered") does not always match a restorer's working register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "painted dreams began to move" → "Each nested layer rotated independently" restates the same visual without added detail. Template cadence runs in the middle section: "She pressed... She laughed... She flipped... She caught..." Stack of subject-verb constructions flattens rhythm (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "voice fracturing into harmonics" clashes with "creating a rhythm that the garden's architecture transformed into a heartbeat"—sound becomes rhythm becomes heartbeat without coherent vehicle (−0.3). The opening line's "spiral of interlocking dreams that seemed to pulse" is vivid, but "seemed" hedges immediacy. Information density is uneven: the three-month restoration backstory is summarized in one clause, while the coin's shadow effect receives prolonged abstract description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The nested-awakenings premise echoes familiar time-loop and recursive-reality templates (Groundhog Day, mise en abyme) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The hobo nickel's carved faces (sleeping/waking) function as transparent symbolic shorthand. The acoustic garden is a fresh setting detail, but its mechanics remain vague and do not drive the turn. The ending's explicit statement ("some treasures are meant to be found again and again") summarizes the concept rather than letting the particulars surprise. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for close match to metaphysical-loop templates without substantive transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elena is present in all beats and her role (mural restorer) frames the scenario. However, her choices are reactive or asserted: she "chooses differently" without prior causality showing what she chose *before* or what concrete cost this choice forecloses. The final act (painting over the mural) is summarized rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. Present throughout but swappable with a generic "person in time loop."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in three beats: discovery, examination (both faces seen, shadow triggers sound shift), and re-hiding. It enables the middle turn (shadow on spiral makes the garden shift) and is present in the closure (Elena presses it back into hiding). However, the coin's properties are told rather than tested—its "key" function is declared by Marcus, not proven through Elena's choices. Causal role is moderate; the ending would still function (Elena loops back) without the coin being physically re-hidden, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nested awakenings" is asserted via disembodied narration ("You've restored this mural before") in the final third and never constrains a prior choice. The mural's nested layers are described visually but do not alter Elena's options or tactics. The recursion concept charges the ending thematically but does not shape the escalation—Elena does not wrestle with evidence of past loops or make a trade-off between waking states. Concept is present and consistent but ornamental to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is stated as a label ("Elena's methodical nature warred with an inexplicable playfulness") without embodied demonstration. Her laugh ("the sound bewitched the space") is asserted effect, not shown contradiction between method and play in a choice with cost. The attribute does not constrain action—she could restore the mural and flip the coin identically if she were purely methodical or purely impulsive. Label-only use (−0.3); no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears once, describing Elena's laugh transforming the garden ("the sound bewitched the space itself"). The verb is metaphorical and does not drive a major turn—the garden was already shifting before the laugh. The effect (sound becoming visible, dreams breathing) is told rather than shown through altered choices or consequences. Swappable with "enchanted" or "transformed" with no structural change. Ornamental use, late first functional mention (second half), no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled early ("acoustic panels... bend and reflect every whisper") and appears in three beats: Elena's voice fractures into harmonics, the garden reflects her suspended conversation, and she hears her own voice answering unasked questions. The method enables the nested-awakenings reveal (she hears herself via reflection). However, the mechanics remain vague—how does reflection create recursion?—and the ending does not require sound reflection to function (the coin and mural loop would hold without it). Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is named and described early, its acoustic architecture appears in multiple beats (footsteps create heartbeat, garden reflects Elena's voice, sounds normalize at the end), and the setting enables the middle turn (reflected sound reveals nested time). The garden also frames the closure: Elena returns to restoration work within it, and the final line references "the next awakening" within this space. However, the setting does not constrain Elena's movement or choices—she could have the same realization in any recursive-metaphysics frame. Causal role is moderate; the garden supplies atmosphere and mechanism but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("pause between question and reply") is invoked explicitly when Marcus freezes mid-question and the moment "crystallizes into something tangible." This pause enables the nested-awakenings reveal and structures the story's recursive logic. Elena experiences the pause as expanded space where she hears her reflected future voice, and the ending completes the bracket when Marcus unfreezes and finishes his question. The timeframe appears in setup (implied in the restoration's methodical pace), becomes the hinge of the middle turn (the frozen pause), and shapes the closure (the loop resets as the pause ends). Causal pressure is strong; without the pause, the recursion collapses.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("exchange certainty for curiosity") is stated explicitly by Elena in dialogue ("Instead of seeking the certainty of understanding... she embraced the curiosity of not knowing") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The desire does not create friction with cost—Elena's choice to re-hide the coin and loop back is asserted as playful without showing what she sacrifices (her three months of restoration? understanding? exit from the loop?). The motivation is present in the closure but told-only, no visible tradeoff. Label-speak in final third (−0.3).</comment>
