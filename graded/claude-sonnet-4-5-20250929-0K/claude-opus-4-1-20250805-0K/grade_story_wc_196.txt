<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with his excavation of files driven by personal wounds and the need to witness grace. His micro-choices—photographing the note, building his private index, leaving breadcrumbs in his own file—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost (the relationship with Sarah). Internal contradiction operates subtly: he searches for his mother's file while simultaneously finding solace in others' stories, suggesting both avoidance and preparation. The ending choice to continue searching rather than finding feels earned by the accumulative pressure of small kindnesses, though the final stance leans slightly toward summary rather than a fresh micro-choice that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph (Marcus, file room, post-emancipation archivist position). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, marginalia, and small artifacts accrue meaning until the final image reweights Marcus's quest—healing comes not from finding his mother's story but from witnessing imperfect attempts at love throughout the archives. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final paragraph explicitly restates that "some wounds required archaeology to heal; others needed only a witness," shifting from a search for personal answers to a validation of accumulated grace. The cost is felt—Marcus accepts延ed searching over immediate resolution—though the closing lines veer toward thematic summary rather than a charged image, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room setting constrains every beat: dust as language, concrete floor, fluorescent light, yellowed folders, and the physical archive structure Marcus's choices and anchor his emotional arc. Micro-setting excels—the button's weight and oxidation, paper clips, fading ink colors, and disturbed dust patterns all function as tactile evidence and pressure. The final image of Marcus turning off lights and leaving "the archives to their patient dust" charges the closure by converting setting into thematic resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects both professional focus (archival details) and personal need (the warmth of the button in his palm), with selective attention that never catalogs but always advances understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's need to find meaning in foster care records—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery of Timothy Walsh's file, where he finds not grand revelation but "accumulated kindnesses preserved in dust and marginalia." Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each artifact (button, note, marginal notation, forwarding address, returned button) tightens the thematic question until Marcus recognizes that healing requires witnessing rather than solving. Agency is visible in his photographing, cross-referencing, and decision to add Timothy's name to his private index, all micro-choices that foreclose other paths. The cost is legible—he accepts延ed searching and solitary nights over the relationship with Sarah—though the final moves summarize his realization rather than dramatizing a fresh tactical shift, keeping this from 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the button, handwritten notes, pencil marginalia, and dust patterns all embody the central question of how small kindnesses persist despite institutional indifference. The piece resists moralizing until the final two paragraphs, where "some wounds required archaeology to heal; others needed only a witness" approaches thematic statement but remains grounded in Marcus's on-page labor. Subtext operates effectively in the Sarah relationship (mentioned once, compressed to show cost without melodrama) and in the returned button (Timothy's message-in-a-bottle gesture). The ending offers a resonant answer—witnessing accumulated grace rather than finding perfect love—that reweights prior material, though the closing lines edge toward articulation rather than pure image, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature throughout: Marcus reads dust "like braille," interprets files "not for what they said, but for what they desperately tried to say," and his professional vocabulary (intake form, placement record, digitization priorities) anchors his focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the button discovery and widening slightly for the final thematic reflection. The prose carries distinct texture—"dust motes unfurl...like tiny spirits released from bondage," "the broken-hearted learned to speak in artifacts and silence"—that reflects Marcus's professional precision and emotional need. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve voice. The final paragraph's elevated register ("repository of society's most vulnerable histories") fits the archival lens but brushes against over-articulation, a minor friction that prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: sentences vary in rhythm, information density is high (each detail advances character or world), and metaphors cohere (dust as language, archaeology of wounds, breadcrumbs for future children). The opening sentence establishes voice and stakes immediately. Minor frictions accumulate: "dust motes unfurl...like tiny spirits" verges on purple; "the broken-hearted learned to speak in artifacts and silence" feels slightly generic; the final two paragraphs contain light paraphrase loops ("wounds required archaeology...witness willing to unfurl the delicate patterns"). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Clarity remains high throughout, and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. The accumulation of small elevations in the ending keeps this from breaking into 8+, but no single artifact harms closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The foster-care-archivist premise offers a fresh synthesis: the physical archive setting literalizes the metaphor of excavating personal history, and the choice to make Marcus both searcher and witness transforms familiar found-family material. The button's return to the file—Timothy's breadcrumb gesture mirroring Marcus's own—feels earned and specific. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its accumulative structure and trusts particular artifacts over dramatic revelation. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends heavily on the archival particularities (dust patterns, marginalia, the button's return), though the core insight about witnessing imperfect love could theoretically transfer to other settings. The final paragraphs' thematic articulation reduces the piece's specificity slightly, preventing entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus (broken-hearted archivist) is present throughout, and his choices drive key turns: taking the archivist job for access (setup), photographing the note and cross-referencing Timothy's file (development), and deciding to add Timothy to his private index while continuing his own search (payoff). His broken-heartedness manifests in the lost relationship with Sarah and his solitary nights, both constraining his present tactics. The character is essential to the story's logic—an ordinary researcher would lack the emotional need that charges each discovery—but his interior reflection dominates over fresh on-page choices in the final third, making his agency slightly more observational than decisional at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in three beats: discovery (falls from the 1967 file), handling (Marcus feels its weight and oxidation), and conceptual return (the notation that Timothy received it at eighteen but returned it as a message). It functions causally—the button triggers Marcus's engagement with Timothy's file and exemplifies the story's central idea of "inherited kindnesses." The button's physical properties (brass, green edges, heavier than modern buttons) are specific and irreplaceable. It charges the thematic insight but does not appear in the final image itself, limiting its closure participation to conceptual linkage rather than visual reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" shapes the premise (Marcus works in forgotten foster care files), drives his stakes (seeking his mother's untold story), and structures every beat (discovering Timothy's hidden narrative, the forwarding address added by someone who cared, the private index Marcus builds). The concept pressures his tactics: he reads files "not for what they said, but for what they desperately tried to say," looking for marginalia and artifacts that official records omit. It charges the final realization that witnessing these unknown histories is itself healing. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic, though its articulation in the closing paragraphs leans slightly toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is signaled in the opening (Marcus's belief that wounds require archaeology) and enacted through his careful handling of files, his private index of grace, and his breadcrumb-leaving for future children. The trait constrains his approach—he doesn't force discovery but trusts accumulated evidence—and shapes the ending choice to continue searching with patience. The cost is visible in his solitary nights and the lost relationship. However, the attribute is more told ("careful, tactful hope" appears explicitly in the final paragraph) than shown through specific micro-choices that trade off hope against urgency, keeping it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears twice: dust motes unfurl in fluorescent light when Marcus opens Timothy's file (midpoint), and the final sentence references "a witness willing to unfurl the delicate patterns of love." The first instance is concrete and triggers engagement with the file's contents; the second is metaphorical and charges the thematic closure. The action is somewhat swappable—other verbs (reveal, release) could serve similar functions with minor edits—and its mechanics don't uniquely shape Marcus's tactics. The lyric reprise elevates it, but the action itself doesn't drive a turn that other choices couldn't replicate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled immediately ("dust had its own language...mapping decades of forgotten children") and shapes Marcus's method throughout: he traces dust like braille, notes disturbed patterns on Timothy's recent file, and recognizes dust resettlement as "a small rebellion against forgetting." The method is irreplaceable—it literalizes the story's accumulative structure and provides concrete evidence of who has searched before. It constrains tactics (Marcus must physically navigate the stacks, handle files carefully) and charges the final image (leaving "the archives to their patient dust"). The method drives at least three beats and is causally essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The foster care file room is indispensable: it provides the archive Marcus searches, the dust patterns he reads, the concrete floor where the button falls, the fluorescent light that reveals dust motes, and the stacks he navigates. Setting pressures every choice—the physical labor of searching, the yellowed folders that must be handled carefully, the isolation that cost him his relationship. The room's particulars (shelves, concrete, files dated back to 1967) are irreplaceable and shape both tactics and theme. The final beat of turning off the lights and leaving the archives to their silence charges the closure image. The setting functions as both literal workspace and metaphor without becoming merely symbolic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" (six months post) is established in the opening and frames Marcus's access and motivation—he took the archivist job specifically for this search. The timeframe enables his present tactics (he has legal adulthood and employment) and implies the emotional urgency (recent enough that wounds are fresh, distant enough for tactical patience). It appears in setup and subtly constrains his approach, but doesn't tighten as a live clock during the narrative—no countdown or escalating deadline pressures his choices within the single evening depicted. The timeframe is functional but somewhat replaceable; a similar search could occur at other post-emancipation intervals.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is dramatized throughout: Marcus photographs the handwritten note, recognizes the social worker's faint pencil addition, interprets Helen Martinez's marginal notation about tomatoes, and builds a private index of grace. The motivation shapes his tactics—he looks for "spaces where someone had tried to magnify kindness despite the system's weight"—and drives the ending realization that witnessing these attempts is itself healing. Friction appears in the cost: solitary nights and the lost relationship with Sarah, who "couldn't understand why he spent nights here instead of with her." The motivation is essential and irreplaceable, though the final articulation leans slightly toward summary rather than a fresh choice that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" coheres throughout: the tone is meditative, archaeological, and respectful, matching Marcus's professional care and emotional need. It modulates purposefully—tightening during the button discovery and file examination, widening during the reflection on his private index. The tone charges the final image: "the dead and forgotten spoke too, if you learned their language of accumulated silence and careful, tactful hope." However, the closing two paragraphs risk over-articulation, where the examination becomes slightly pedagogical ("This was why he stayed..."), reducing the tonal pressure slightly. The tone is essential to the piece's effect but flirts with explaining rather than embodying at closure.</comment>
