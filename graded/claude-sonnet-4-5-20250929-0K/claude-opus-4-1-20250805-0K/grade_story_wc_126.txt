<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's choice to play and her understanding of incompletion show embodied motivation. The grandmother's teaching ("You must learn to hear what wants to emerge, not force what you think should be") grounds her arc, and the final smile with comprehension earns the shift. Minor slip: the acoustically perceptive gift is mentioned but not dramatized through a specific micro-choice that tests it under pressure. The community's arrival feels reactive rather than driven by distinct secondary motives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the chronic hush transforms into "a quietude that held space for the incomplete" with visible cost (the forest is gone, polished performance replaced by imperfect music). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered motifs (ash, water, shipwrecks, the bowl filling with non-monetary offerings). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One micro turn when the child and accordion player arrive deepens the pressure without requiring multiple reversals. Cost is legible in the line "The rainforest would not return, but from its ashes, something else was growing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with seawater lapping at lower windows and shipwrecks providing percussion actively shapes the music's transformation. Spatial choreography is clear (ash-dusted doors, stone bench between apple trees, flooded foundation, broken roof). The setting constrains and enables: "The greenhouse captured their imperfect music and transformed it, the water below adding its own rhythm." The hearth's return for the bonfire at evening charges the closure by recalling tradition. Micro-setting (the bowl on the stone bench) becomes a vessel for community offerings, linking environment to stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming silence into new music—is signaled early and tightens when Mara hears "not an echo, but a harmonic born from the collision of her note with the greenhouse's peculiar architecture." The arrival of other musicians deepens pressure without forced reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to play slowly and let notes "find their partners" alters tactics and forecloses the old polished performance. Visible cost: the rainforest is gone, Echo Harbor's former music cannot return. The piece meets the 8.0+ gate (tightening forecloses a live option), but lacks an explicit trade-off moment that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in incompletion—emerges organically through damaged instruments (accordion with damaged reeds, warped flute) and the transformation of chronic hush into productive quietude. The final image of "perfect incompletion" answers the thematic question without moralizing, reweighting the opening silence. The mendicant's bowl filling with non-monetary offerings (sea glass, salvaged string, child's drawing) provides concrete particulars. The grandmother's teaching recurs purposefully, not as a thesis but as lived wisdom Mara now embodies. Subtle slip: "magnificent simplicity of survival itself" trends slightly abstract in an otherwise grounded passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: "able to hear melodies in the spaces between sounds" and "not an echo, but a harmonic." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("ash-dusted glass doors," "chronic hush," "acoustically perceptive"). The choice to avoid dialogue during the musicians' gathering ("for words would have shattered the delicate emergence") is purposeful and preserves tone. Minor slip: "the magnificent simplicity of survival itself" briefly elevates register in the final third, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "broken teeth," "canvas of quietude," "ash-dusted." No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor density slip: "This was not the polished performance Echo Harbor had once prized. This was rougher, more honest" restates across two sentences without added pressure, costing −0.2. The final image ("perfect incompletion") recharges earlier motifs cleanly. Propulsion remains strong through to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-catastrophe silence, acoustic transformation via damaged architecture, and communal rebuilding through imperfection feels specific and earned. The turn from "chronic hush" to "quietude that held space" is non-obvious. The damaged instruments creating unexpected harmonies adds freshness. The premise avoids the resilience-after-disaster template by focusing on transformation rather than restoration. Minor conventionality: the wise grandmother's teaching and the bonfire storytelling tradition lean toward familiar framing, though they serve the narrative without derailing originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in the opening, drives the inciting beat by choosing to play, and her final understanding ("smiled as she finally lowered her violin, understanding at last") anchors closure. She shapes three beats: initial entry, the decision to play slowly and let notes find partners, and the closing realization. Causal pressure: her playing draws the community and her acoustically perceptive gift enables her to hear the harmonic, though the gift is more labeled than tested with visible cost. Closure linkage strong. Moderate irreplaceability: another musician could theoretically serve, but the grandmother's teaching and family legacy tie her specifically to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl is set down early (paragraph four), used passively when it "began to fill" with offerings in the middle, and its filling reweights the stake from monetary survival to community rebuilding. Two beats: placement and filling. The offerings are specific (sea glass, salvaged string, drawing), charging the closure theme. Friction: the bowl does not constrain or enable a choice under pressure; Mara never handles it again after placing it. It functions as a receiver rather than an active tool. The reprise at filling is purposeful but lacks causal pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" appears early as the oppressive silence post-fire, is named repeatedly as a condition shaping stakes, and transforms into "quietude that held space for the incomplete" at closure. It constrains tactics: Mara must find a way to work with, not break, the silence. The concept directly alters options—the musicians play "something new and deliberately incomplete" rather than polished old songs. Visible cost: the old music is gone. The transformation of hush into productive quietude is the core closure mechanism. Strong causal role and irreplaceability; the story would collapse without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is introduced early and described as the ability "to hear melodies in the spaces between sounds." It enables Mara to hear "not an echo, but a harmonic born from the collision" in the middle beat. However, the trait is largely label-only; we are told she possesses the gift but never see a moment where it creates a tradeoff or cost. It does not constrain her (she could have proceeded without it being named), and no other character lacks it in a way that dramatizes its necessity. Swappable with "musically gifted" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unbind melodies from silence" is seeded in the grandmother's teaching ("where her grandmother had first taught her to unbind melodies from silence"), returns implicitly when Mara plays and draws harmonics from the greenhouse, and is conceptually reweighted at closure when the community unbinds new music together. The action shapes the middle turn: by playing slowly, Mara unbinds harmonics that draw others. Causal role in two beats. Friction: the action could be reframed as "create" or "discover" without major structural loss. The term "unbind" is poetic but not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire is introduced early in the grandmother's teaching, returns at evening when "someone built a fire in the old hearth. The tradition continued, but changed," and is reweighted at closure: "instead of stories about what was, they spoke fragments of what might be, leaving sentences unfinished." The method shapes two beats and participates in closure transformation. Causal pressure: the tradition's shift from complete stories to unfinished fragments mirrors the theme. Irreplaceability: the bonfire/storytelling specifics matter less than the pattern of tradition-transforming. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks appears in the opening, provides the acoustic architecture that creates harmonics in the middle ("The greenhouse captured their imperfect music and transformed it, the water below adding its own rhythm, the shipwrecks providing percussion"), and frames the closure as a communal amphitheater. It constrains tactics: Mara chooses this location because it transforms sound. The flooded foundation, broken roof, and shipwrecks are irreplaceable; another setting could not produce these effects. The setting drives three beats and is causally essential to the story's central transformation. Cost: the greenhouse's damage is part of the larger loss but enables the new music.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Three months had passed since the rainforest burned" anchors the piece early and establishes enough distance for ash to settle yet the hush to persist. The timeframe tightens decisions implicitly: recovery cannot wait indefinitely. "When evening came" and "until the moon rose" track a single day's arc that gives the closure ceremonial weight. The timeframe enables the gathering and bonfire, charging the ending. Friction: the three-month backstory is largely static; the urgency is more thematic than clock-driven. The day's progression matters more than the months. Functional but mid-replaceable with "weeks" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation to find beauty in the unfinished is seeded in the grandmother's teaching ("Every unfinished song holds its own perfection"), dramatized when Mara plays "something new and deliberately incomplete," and fulfilled at closure when she understands "perfect incompletion." It shapes choices: Mara plays slowly, letting imperfect harmonics emerge rather than forcing polished notes. Friction between want (to restore music) and acceptance of loss creates visible cost (the forest won't return). The motivation drives three beats and anchors the thematic closure. Strong causal integration and irreplaceability; the story's logic depends on this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone of "magnificent simplicity" is established through clean, restrained prose and Mara's attentive unfolding of sound. It modulates: tentative in the opening ("The first note she drew was tentative"), gathering warmth as musicians arrive, and crystallizing at closure in "the magnificent simplicity of survival itself" and "perfect incompletion." The tone charges the final image by holding wonder and loss in balance. Coherent through turns. Minor friction: the phrase "magnificent simplicity" appears only once explicitly, trending slightly tell-rather-than-embody, though the prose texture supports it throughout. The quietude that transforms aligns with tone and deepens the ending.</comment>
