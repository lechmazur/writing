<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus's "uncommonly serene" stance is declared but rarely embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His decision to prepare tomorrow's performance feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle; we're told he's wrestling with ethical storytelling, but no micro-choice reveals competing values with visible cost. The reflection dominates (well over 30% of text) without interleaving enough present-tense decisions that alter his options, and the final preparation montage summarizes intent rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—Marcus begins preparing a performance and ends preparing it, with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The piece reads as setup and exposition for a future performance rather than a story with closure; the "meteor hush" and final smile restate his existing stance without cost or transformation. Under a situational or accumulative lens, pressure should crystallize or a pattern should break with felt consequence, but the ending restates the premise.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The radar dome's acoustic properties and visual gaps (meteor showers visible through broken panels) are vivid and specific, and the dome functions as workshop setting that mirrors his narrative philosophy. The story stick's notches and the campfire are handled tactilely across multiple beats. However, the "seedy bars" where he performs remain abstract placeholders—no sensory detail of the dive bar audiences or spatial choreography during a puppet show appears on the page, weakening the micro-setting that should ground his ethical practice.</comment>

<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to tell necessary truths without violence—is signaled early, but no on-page escalation or tightening occurs; Marcus remains in his reflective preparation from start to finish with no reversal, complication, or price paid. The heated argument with collaborators happened twenty minutes before the story opens, so its pressure is pre-existing rather than dramatized. His decision to prepare tomorrow's performance is uncontested and involves no trade-off or foreclosed option, leaving the conflict abstract and the cost unlanded.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The theme of ethical storytelling emerges clearly through the radar dome's echo metaphor, the story stick's weight, and Marcus's puppet practice, but it's articulated primarily through exposition rather than earned through on-page choices with consequences. The final paragraph edges toward Thematic Echo ("quiet revelation that every ending could be a different beginning") by restating the premise in near-prompt language. A resonant image or action at closure would allow the theme to land without declaration, but instead we get summary of intent and direct statement of the revolutionary heart.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and the perceptual signature—Marcus noticing acoustic properties, shadow play, ink-wash techniques—feels character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("urbane demeanor," "diplomatic calligraphy commissions") that reads more like external assessment than his lived interiority. The prose carries a consistent meditative rhythm, but under the story's reflective weight, we lose the compression and propulsion that would modulate with pressure; the cadence stays uniformly contemplative throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Clarity is high and figurative language (meteor hush, cathedral echo, half-lit epiphanies) is purposeful, but paraphrase loops appear: "experiments in narrative ethics, attempts to reverse the damage" and "attempts to make sense of chaos" restate concepts without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the preparation montage: "The story would be... His puppets would be... The story stick would be..." Sentence openings repeat "Marcus" and "His" across adjacent paragraphs, and the reflective register flattens momentum in the final third, preventing the closure beat from gaining propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, shadow puppetry, and narrative ethics in a decommissioned radar dome offers surface novelty, but the premise—artist wrestling with ethical representation of trauma through experimental performance—follows a widely used literary template without transforming it through lived contradiction or non-obvious cost. The backwards puppet show and luminescent calligraphy feel like ornamental details rather than tactics that emerge inevitably from character limits. Marcus's "revolutionary heart" beneath "urbane demeanor" and the framing of "subversive puppet shows" read as declarative rather than demonstrated through specific, risky choices with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus (urbane calligrapher) is present throughout but makes no key turn—his decision to prepare tomorrow's performance is his stance at the opening and remains unchanged at closure. The calligraphy activity (grinding ink, brush to paper) appears in beats but doesn't constrain or enable a choice with cost; it's atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The campfire story stick appears early (setup), is handled and described in multiple beats (tracing carvings, holding to firelight, resting across lap), and returns in the final image as "baton, conducting an orchestra of shadows." The reprise reweights its meaning from artifact to active tool. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or drive a turn—it remains symbolic without causal pressure, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>2.8</grade>
<comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is named once in exposition ("those moments when understanding hovers just beyond full comprehension") and echoed thematically, but it never shapes an on-page tactic or choice. It remains a thematic claim rather than a stake-altering concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>"Uncommonly serene" is stated in the opening beat ("Marcus remained uncommonly serene") and contrasted with others' passion, but it never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. It's a label without dramatized tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Reverse" appears in his narrative method (reversing traditional flow, story told backwards) and is signaled in the middle third, shaping the concept of tomorrow's performance. However, no on-page turn traces to this action—it's described as future intent rather than dramatized, and the closure doesn't hinge on a reversal occurring now.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is named and explained (shadow play, ink-wash techniques, dive bar audiences) in the first half, shaping his three-year practice. It frames his ethical exploration but doesn't drive an on-page beat or choice—his current action is preparation, not performance, so the method remains backstory.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>The decommissioned radar dome is anchored early with vivid detail (curved overhead, acoustic properties, broken panels) and its function as workshop is established. The dome's echo metaphor ("translating echoes into meaning") mirrors his storytelling practice, and meteor showers visible through gaps frame the final image. However, it doesn't pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it's atmospheric setting rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the opening temporal anchor (twenty minutes after the others stormed out) and the "meteor hush" recurs in the final beat. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—Marcus's preparation proceeds at his own contemplative pace with no urgency or deadline pressure altering his moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is stated explicitly and drives his three-year practice and the argument with collaborators, but the desire remains told rather than conflicted in present choices. No on-page moment shows him wrestling between wants and costs—his commitment is steady and unchallenged throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Meteor hush" is defined early ("that breathless silence when cosmic debris burns through atmosphere") and recurs in the final paragraph ("that perfect silence between ignition and impact"), modulating from metaphor to literal meteor showers outside. The tone remains coherent—contemplative, meditative—and the final image charges the hush with anticipation. However, the tone doesn't shift under pressure or escalate, maintaining one static register throughout.</comment>
