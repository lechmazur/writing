<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mari's interior world is richly textured through her filter of memory perception and bureaucratic dissolution, with strong embodied moments (the poison label as compass, pressing against cold metal). However, the piece largely observes rather than forces Mari into high-stakes micro-choices under pressure—she moves through the container maze collecting annotations without meaningful internal contradiction or difficult trade-offs. The final signing of names carries symbolic weight but lacks the visible cost of a renunciation or choice that forecloses a lived path. The character reads as contemplative witness rather than agent tested by conflicting impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mari layers observations across tides until the congregation revelation crystallizes a charged poise moment. Orientation anchors cleanly (harbor, containers, Mari's legal death, tidal rhythm) by the opening paragraphs. The closure—signing multiple names in Container 47-B and recognizing her community of the erased—reconfigures her stake from solo collector to testifying witness with felt cost (accepting permanent namelessness, committing to return). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the fresh annotation and realizes others share her condition, which reweights her solitary purpose. Closure lands on the page under the accumulative lens with conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains Mari's navigation (sound-based pathfinding, tidal access windows) and charges the final image—Container 47-B becomes the physical site of erased testimony. Rust, tide rhythms, steel voices, and echo patterns are filtered through Mari's memory-texture perception, creating a sensory signature. The poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting (tactile anchor in pocket, "compass pointing toward memories"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the shifting maze, and the spring tide directly enables the climactic discovery. Environment shapes choice and amplifies the thematic resonance of permanence-as-rust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning in erased existence—is signaled early and deepens when Mari discovers the congregation's annotations. However, escalation reads as accumulative density rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The spring-tide discovery and the act of signing are pivotal beats, but Mari's agency remains observational and symbolic; she doesn't face a live trade-off or renunciation that alters her tactics. The final signing carries conceptual weight (committing to witness-role) yet lacks the dramatic pressure of a difficult choice made under conflicting pulls. Pressure coheres but does not meaningfully tighten through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories testifying through texture emerges organically from Mari's filter, the layered annotations, and the container as archive. The final image—signing in-between her mother's name and her own, surrounded by unreadable signatures—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the administratively dead can leave marks. Subtext operates through the poison label's compressed tragedy, the tidal rhythm as measure of unlived lives, and rust as permanence. However, the piece leans toward overt articulation ("We who don't exist must testify") rather than letting the image fully carry meaning. Strong thematic coherence with minor articulation at the threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyric, and consistent with Mari's contemplative, memorial focus. Perceptual signature—memory as texture, reality filtered through erasure—remains distinct throughout. Diction ("labyrinth of steel and secrets," "texture on objects") fits the introspective register. The overheard foreman dialogue reads natural and purposeful, advancing Mari's discovery without head-hopping. However, runs of similar syntactic structures ("She'd discovered… She'd learned… She kept…") and a few filter-verb stacks ("she would read," "she noticed") slightly dull immediacy in high-density passages. Psychic distance is stable, and the prose reflects Mari's state without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer world-building, character history, and thematic texture efficiently. Figurative language (poison label as compass, memories refusing to die correctly) enriches without overwhelming. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "She began visiting… she would read… she wrote about… she wrote about…" creates a repetitive stem pattern across four sentences. A paraphrase loop occurs when "erased histories" and "dissolution" are restated across adjacent lines without added pressure. Clarity and momentum remain strong overall, but these artifacts prevent entry to the high band. No loops touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic error, container labyrinth, and tidal congregation of the administratively erased offers a fresh, specific premise. Mari's memory-texture filter and the poison-label-as-compass are particular inventions that deepen character and theme. The discovery of layered annotations as testimonial archive feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the "official non-existence grants special perception" trope echoes ghost-story conventions without full transformation, and the ending's articulated thesis ("We who don't exist must testify") edges toward the safety middle rather than bold risk. Strong originality within the concept, with minor reliance on familiar scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mari (death certificate error survivor) is present throughout and her legal erasure frames all choices. She navigates the maze, visits Container 47-B, reads annotations, and signs names at closure—three distinct beats. However, her decisions remain observational and symbolic rather than causing key turns that narrow options or create visible trade-offs. Her participation at closure (signing) is active but does not drive a decisive change; it crystallizes a stance she already held. Setup strong, development observational, payoff present but not causally transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in paragraph 4 (setup), is described as "proof that truth could be compressed," reappears in paragraph 11 ("complex weave" of memory texture), and returns in the final line as compass metaphor. Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. The label charges Mari's relationship to her mother's death and functions as a tactile anchor. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; its role remains symbolic and metaphorical rather than causal. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the core premise (Mari's legal death, Container 47-B as archive, the congregation of the administratively erased) and drive the dominant stake. The concept appears in setup (paragraph 2), develops through the annotated journals (paragraphs 7–10), and resolves at closure when Mari signs and recognizes the community. It constrains her perception (special filter), enables her navigation (ghost access to containers), and structures the final image (testimonies of the nameless). The concept is indispensable to story logic and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mari's attribute (filters reality through memory texture) is established early (paragraph 2: "filter reality through the lens of the officially dead"; paragraph 11: "her filter was memory"). It enables her to perceive memory textures on objects, which informs her relationship to the poison label and the annotated writings. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost or create a tactical trade-off. The trait enriches characterization and thematic resonance but remains observational rather than pressuring choice. Setup and development present; closure linkage oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mari's layering of observations (writing in Container 47-B, adding her own annotations in pencil) appears in paragraph 10 and connects to the final signing. The action is present in two beats and participates in closure. However, it does not create a major turn or redefine options; Mari's layering is continuous and additive rather than a pivot that narrows stakes or forecloses a path. The action could be replaced with other forms of testimony (spoken word, artifact placement) without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method (collecting fragments of overheard stories) is signaled in paragraph 2 ("collector of lost stories") and demonstrated in paragraph 6 (eavesdropping on foremen). Mari uses overheard dialogue to discover Container 47-B, which drives one key turn. However, the method does not shape her final choice or reappear at closure; the ending turns on reading written annotations and signing, not on collecting spoken fragments. Setup and one middle beat present; closure participation absent. Functional but not essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures Mari's navigation (sound-based pathfinding, tidal access, daily rearrangement by cranes) and provides the physical site of closure (Container 47-B). The setting enables discovery (annotations in the container), constrains movement (high tide forces retreat), and charges the final image (steel voices harmonizing with testimonies). Setup, development across multiple beats (paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 7, 12), and strong closure participation. The labyrinth is indispensable to the story's logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm appears in paragraphs 1, 3, 8, and 12, framing Mari's visits and enabling the spring-tide climax. The timeframe structures pacing (weeks pass "following the rhythm of tides") and the highest tide triggers the final discovery. However, the tide does not create urgent pressure or force a tactical choice with visible cost; it functions as atmospheric pacing rather than a live clock that alters moves. Setup and closure participation present; causal pressure on decision-making limited. Lyric structure without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mari's motivation (to discover the texture of memories) is stated in paragraph 11 and implied throughout her handling of the poison label and her reading of annotations. It drives her repeated visits to Container 47-B and her final act of signing. However, the motivation is asserted more than dramatized through conflicted choices; Mari pursues it consistently without friction between desire and cost. The want shapes two beats (middle visits, final signing) but lacks visible trade-off or renunciation. Setup, development, and closure participation present; dramatized friction limited.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone of nameless identity is established early ("existed between names now," "the officially dead") and held coherently through contemplative, lyric diction. The tone modulates with pressure (observational in early passages, more charged at the spring-tide discovery) and supports the final image (signing multiple names, becoming "something in between"). Syntax and imagery maintain the tone's ghostly, memorial quality throughout. The tone charges the closure image by reinforcing Mari's acceptance of in-between status. Coherent and purposeful across turns.</comment>
