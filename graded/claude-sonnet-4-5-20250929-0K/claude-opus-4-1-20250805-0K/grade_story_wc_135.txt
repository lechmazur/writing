<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation to compile fragments is consistent and her archive work shows purposeful micro-choices (arranging documents emotionally, incorporating the valve's whispered percussion). However, her interiority remains largely abstract—we get conceptual statements about absence and grammar rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final valve-turn reads as symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Matthias appears briefly but applies no pressure that forces Kessa to alter her approach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kessa's archive work layers meaning through staggered intervals and fragment compilation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—turning the valve "one final time" to produce "a mechanical sigh"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the community's dual state of presence/absence, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a specific forfeiture. The anniversary opening reweights prior accumulation but doesn't narrow options through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor's salt-crusted surfaces, pearl-white towers, and rain-washed windows create vivid micro-setting that constrains Kessa's archival method—different light reveals different ink layers, directly shaping her staggered-interval approach. The herald's trumpet valve functions as charged object-as-setting, its corroded state reflecting the exile's duration and its whispered percussion becoming part of the archive's grammar. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Kessa's professional lens (ocean-spray patterns, water-marks as "ghostly images").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into coherent meaning after exile—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation reads as accretion rather than tightening: the archive simply grows through "accumulated patience" without a moment where Kessa's method is tested or a trade-off forces her to choose between competing goods. The anniversary opening is narratively convenient rather than driven by protagonist agency. The valve's transition from seized to manually operable offers a small reversal but one discovered rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—how absence possesses its own grammar and communities exist in multiple states—emerges organically from specific archive work: pairing tide charts with wedding announcements, photographing children's height marks. The final valve-turn offers a resonant non-literal answer ("we are the sum of our presence and our absence") that reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece resists false equivalence (exile caused real transformation) while embracing complexity. Minor slip: "navigated absences" and "compile fragments into meaning" edge toward thesis statements rather than purely dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Kessa notices through an archivist's lens (palimpsests, water-marks, "topology of loss"). The brief dialogue with Matthias feels natural and advances understanding. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility ("reactively visionary," "emotionally," "accumulated patience" as explanatory phrases). Free indirect style is clean. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative voice and maintains it, though some passages read as thematic summary rather than filtered perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("salt crystals clung to every surface like memories," "droplets on windows"). Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding of the archive or exile. However, several text artifacts dull momentum: "staggered intervals" recurs as formula; "fragments" appears in template patterns across multiple paragraphs; the phrase "compile fragments into meaning" loops without adding pressure. The final paragraph's triple construction ("we are here, we were there, we are the sum") edges toward summary rather than image. No major loops obscure causality, keeping damage non-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist premise and the corroded herald's valve offer fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The staggered-intervals method (light revealing different ink layers at different times) transforms archival work into something specific and memorable. However, the exile-and-return frame is familiar, and the piece doesn't fully escape the safety middle—Kessa faces no genuine obstacle, ethical friction, or resistant community member who challenges her compilation method. The transformation test is borderline: swap "ocean-spray archivist" for "memory curator" and the emotional arc remains largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kessa's choices (visiting archives at staggered intervals, arranging fragments emotionally, incorporating the valve's percussion, opening the archive to the public) shape the narrative arc across multiple beats. She appears in the opening, middle development (arranging documents, discovering the valve's function), and closure (final valve-turn). However, her decisions don't narrow options or force visible trade-offs—the archive simply grows without resistance. The role is essential to the story's logic but her agency doesn't create key turns with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The valve appears in three distinct beats: left corroded on the desk (setup), discovered to still compress air manually (development), and turned "one final time" in the closing image (payoff). Its frozen state at the exile's start and whispered percussion between documents create specific causal texture. It charges the final image with the "mechanical sigh" that embodies the story's theme. Strong integration, though its discovery and use feel more symbolic than tactically constrained—Kessa doesn't struggle to incorporate it or pay a cost for its inclusion.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" appears early ("navigated absences—the careful spaces where people had learned to live around what was missing") and shapes Matthias's observation and Kessa's methodology (reading gaps as grammar). The concept recurs in the ending's formulation. However, it functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint—we don't see Kessa's specific choices altered by navigating what's missing versus what's present. The concept illuminates meaning but doesn't force trade-offs or narrow tactical options during archive work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" appears once as explanatory label ("This rhythm wasn't planned but reactively visionary") to justify the staggered-intervals discovery. The attribute describes rather than constrains—Kessa doesn't face a choice between reactive response and planned vision, nor does the trait create friction or cost. It's told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The light-revelation mechanic could have emerged without this specific label, making it largely swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears in Matthias's observation ("You're trying to hearten them") as thematic diagnosis. Kessa's archive work does implicitly serve this function—opening to the public, inviting contributions—but "hearten" as specific action isn't foregrounded in her choices. She could be "preserving," "honoring," or "connecting" with similar structural effect. The verb illuminates motive but doesn't drive a major turn; Matthias names it rather than Kessa choosing it against an alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" is signaled early (two hours at dawn, three at midday, one at dusk) and its mechanics matter—different light reveals different ink layers, directly shaping Kessa's discoveries and method. The concept recurs in the ending (people moving through "their own staggered intervals"). However, the method isn't tested or constrained—Kessa doesn't struggle with the rhythm or face trade-offs between interval choices. It enables rather than pressures, making it functional but not indispensable to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor "after rain" anchors the opening (puddles mirroring towers, salt crystals) and returns in the penultimate paragraph (rain-washed windows fracturing sunlight). The post-rain atmosphere supplies the water-marks and light-through-droplets that enable Kessa's discoveries. The setting participates in setup and closure payoff. However, the "after rain" specificity could be "after storm" or "at dawn" with minor adjustments—the moisture matters more than rain per se, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" frames the entire piece (opening "three days after") and culminates in "the anniversary of return" when the archive opens. The timeframe establishes stakes and provides the narrative occasion. However, it doesn't create urgency or tighten tactics—Kessa's work unfolds at her own pace without deadline pressure. The seven-year duration matters for context (corroded valve, blank ledger pages) but doesn't constrain present choices or drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kessa's desire to "compile fragments into meaning" is stated directly to Matthias and demonstrated through her archive work across multiple beats: pairing documents, arranging emotionally, photographing height marks, incorporating the valve's percussion. The motivation drives her actions and shapes the ending's realization. However, it's largely uncontested—no friction between different compilation methods, no community resistance, no internal doubt. The want is clear and consistent but doesn't collide with competing needs or costs in a way that forces hard choices.</comment>
