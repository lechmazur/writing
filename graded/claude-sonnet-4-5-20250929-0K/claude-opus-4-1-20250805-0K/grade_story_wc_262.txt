<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is rich and embodied ("tasting silver and salt"), with her psychometric gift shaping perception consistently. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective processing of absorbed emotions rather than dramatized choices under pressure—Vera observes and feels but makes only one concrete decision (taking the film). The final act of kissing and pocketing the strip arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading more as symbolic gesture than character-altering choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: psychometric discovery deepens throughout, layering goodbye letters until the final decision to preserve them. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights Vera's mission and the building's meaning—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear early (projection booth, Vera, demolition eve), and the lens holds, but the ending gesture lacks the sharp trade-off or visible price that would elevate it into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly realized with Art Deco curves, spatial "emotional geography" (regret in the northwest corner, hope in the ceiling), and the film strip as tactile object. The setting constrains Vera's psychometric reading and charges the final image—she navigates the booth's stored grief to make her choice. The booth functions as both micro-setting and conceptual vessel, meeting the high-band test for environment shaping choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve the building's emotional archive—emerges clearly and deepens through psychometric accumulation. However, escalation is primarily textural (more letters, more grief) rather than a narrowing of options or trade-off. The final choice (taking the film) does not visibly foreclose an alternative or impose a felt cost; Vera's professional report will be "clinical" regardless, so the pocket-rescue feels like addition rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—unused love as sacred archive—arises organically from concrete images (film emulsion, splice marks, projection beam). The final image ("carrying its secrets like seeds") reweights prior material without moralizing, and the question of how to honor invisible histories resonates beyond the plot. One deduction: the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("Some things were too sacred for demolition") where implication alone would have been stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, with a distinct lyric-romantic register ("cupped hands holding secrets," "rhythm of forgotten lyrics"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and Vera's perceptual signature (spatial, emotional layering) is consistent. Minor penalty: the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction during peak psychometric beats ("the spatially imaginative part of her gift") that feels more explanatory than embodied, and one filter-verb stack in the middle third ("she could see… she realized… she understood") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "brittle celluloid holding frames of a movie nobody remembered," "velvet seats like closed mouths." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Two issues prevent higher scoring: a paraphrase loop in the middle ("The building itself began to reveal its secret—it was an incubator… The projection booth had absorbed it all") and light overwriting in the climactic beats where nearly every sentence carries metaphor without breathing room, risking density fatigue. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>9</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—psychometric farewell archive in a doomed theater—feels fresh and internally coherent. The specific synthesis (projection booth as confession vessel, emotion absorbed into film emulsion) is non-obvious and well-grounded. Risk: the piece leans heavily on lyric accumulation rather than dramatized pressure, which some readers may find static. No template echoes, and the concept commits fully without hedging, but the lack of a sharp on-page trade-off limits the sense of stakes-driven ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her psychometric gift enables the discovery arc. She makes one key choice (taking the film strip) that alters the story's meaning. However, much of her involvement is receptive—feeling, understanding, swaying—rather than goal-driven action under pressure. Her decision arrives late (final third) and does not visibly narrow earlier options or impose a felt cost, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The film strip appears early ("coiled in the corner like a sleeping snake"), is handled psychometrically in the middle (Vera lets it "run through her fingers"), and returns charged at closure (she kisses it, tucks it into her coat, will project it tonight). It is irreplaceable—the specific emulsion holds the letters—and its final use (projection at her apartment) reweights the story's archive theme. Minor gap: no visible cost tied directly to possessing it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape the discovery arc and Vera's understanding of the booth's archive. They are signaled early (absorbed into emulsion during the 1967 screening) and layered through multiple voices ("Marie, I watch you…" / Eleanor's final letter). The concept structures the thematic question (how to honor unspoken love) but does not constrain Vera's tactics or narrow her options on the page—she receives rather than wrestles with them.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is named explicitly ("The spatially imaginative part of her gift showed her how love had traveled") and described (Vera sees the booth as emotional geography, regret in corners, hope in the ceiling). However, the trait functions as lens rather than constraint—it does not enable a choice unavailable to a non-spatial psychometrist or impose a trade-off. Label-only use without on-page cost trends low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Incubate" anchors the central metaphor: the booth "was an incubator… where unused love had been carefully stored, developing slowly like photographs in chemical baths." The concept is established mid-story and charges the thematic frame, but it does not drive a major turn or alter Vera's tactics. It is more descriptive summation than causal action. Present and thematically resonant, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is Vera's method throughout: touching the projector, the film strip, receiving voices and emotional geography. It is signaled immediately ("hired… to psychometrically read the building") and structures every discovery beat. The mechanics matter—her gift reveals what sight alone could not—and the reading shapes her final decision to preserve the film. Essential to story logic and present across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The projection booth is irreplaceable: its Art Deco curves, film projector, film strip coil, window onto the theater, and spatial layout (northwest corner, ceiling, floor) all function in Vera's psychometric work. The setting supplies the archive she reads and frames the final image (she walks out carrying its secrets). Booth-specific details constrain her perception and charge the closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics searching for tune" appears once as metaphor: "words without melody that had been spoken in this room, declarations that had played out only in the speakers' minds." It characterizes the letters' incompleteness but does not structure the narrative timeframe or tighten decisions. The story unfolds during Vera's single evening reading, but that practical clock is unmarked. Ornamental poetic frame, not a functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation—"to find where unused love is stored"—is the hinge of her psychometric quest and is dramatized through discovery (emotional geography, Eleanor's letter). However, the motivation is more receptive than conflicted: she seeks and finds, without visible friction between competing desires or costs. The final choice (preserving the film) aligns seamlessly with her empathy; no trade-off or renunciation appears on the page. Functional but lacks sharp on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is embodied in the prose: "the hushed thunder of her own heartbeat" at the climax, and the booth "held its breath one last time." Tone coheres as reverent, layered, and charged throughout, modulating from observation to immersion to quiet resolve. The final image carries the tone forward ("listening dark," "seeds waiting to bloom"). Coherent and purposeful, charging the closure without static uniformity.</comment>
