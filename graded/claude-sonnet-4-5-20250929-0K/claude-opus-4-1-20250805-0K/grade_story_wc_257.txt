<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is established through concrete, embodied detail (silver wire coiling beneath steady hands, recognizing fresh grief in the stranger's posture), and her micro-choices reveal her values—lighting candles as a beacon, folding cranes with coordinates, deciding to attempt the phoenix tattoo "tomorrow." The transformation from suicidal despair to subdued healing is credible, though the final pivot to applying the stencil feels slightly telescoped. Secondary character (the visiting woman) applies immediate pressure by mirroring Elena's past state, forcing her to articulate her own progress, but the interaction remains more illustrative than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through recurring imagery (candles, cranes, phoenix stencil) and deepens Elena's stance from passive survival to active beacon-tending. Orientation is swift (jeweler's bench, observatory, three years post-loss by line 3). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena picks up the tattoo needle with genuine intent, the final crane encodes the observatory itself, marking a shift from recipient to guide. Felt cost is present but muted—the decision to ink is deferred ("tomorrow, perhaps"), which slightly softens the on-page commitment even as the pattern coheres.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory as timeless refuge (no clocks, stars marking time) and candlelit workshop constrain Elena's ritual-making and signal the refuge's open-door ethos. The phoenix stencil on vellum is handled twice (traced, then pressed to skin) and the rice paper cranes accumulate materially. The workshop window functions as beacon, drawing the stranger in. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, window, door, single chair). The timelessness motif charges the closure image but does not force a high-pressure choice on the page, keeping this slightly below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's recovery and her emerging role as guide for others. The visitor's arrival tests Elena's progress—she must now articulate and enact what she's learned—but this moment deepens more than it tightens; the stranger's need is met cooperatively with no refusal or trade-off dramatized. The decision to prepare the tattoo needle at the end signals commitment but is not yet executed on the page. One meaningful deepening is present (from passive refuge-dweller to active light-keeper), but no on-page reversal forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through ritual, grief as forge, the shift from withering to bloom—emerges through concrete particulars (memorial jewelry, origami coordinates, the half-ash/half-flame phoenix) rather than statement. The phrase "genuinely artificial in its perfection" and "learning to burn without dying" risk on-the-nose articulation but stay grounded in Elena's craft. The final image (illuminating another candle, the workshop glowing) reweights the opening's candlelit solitude with quiet, non-literal resonance. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing, though the visitor's line "like learning to burn without dying" edges close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is character-specific (jeweler's eye for wire coiling, astronomer's gift of keys, recognition of grief posture). Diction remains consistent ("subdued ardor," "curtains of intention") with purposeful elevation that fits the reflective, ritualized tone. The visitor's brief dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven. One mild filter-verb cluster ("watched," "recognized," "knew") in mid-passage slightly dulls immediacy but does not flatten voice under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, paragraph breaks create visual breath. Some stock constructions appear: "dark circles beneath her eyes," "voice barely above a whisper," "the expression still feeling foreign on her face" echo genre template. "Curtains of intention" and "subdued ardor" read as elevated vocabulary chosen for thematic weight but risk register drift from the otherwise grounded jeweler's idiom. Two paraphrase loops: "tomorrow, perhaps, she'd have the courage" immediately follows "she couldn't bring herself to commit. Not yet." Information density is generally high, but the final paragraph recaps rather than advances ("Her subdued ardor for life was returning" tells what the scene has already shown). No major scaffold or syntax monotony; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mourning-jewelry-maker premise is familiar grief-work territory, but the specific synthesis—observatory refuge, origami coordinates encoding light-breaking places, the phoenix stencil as liminal promise—offers fresh texture. The emotional arc (suicidal despair to tentative beacon-tending) is honestly rendered without tidy resolution. "Curtains of intention" and "genuinely artificial" feel somewhat imposed by prompt rather than organically character-discovered, and the visitor's appearance is convenient (arrives exactly when needed to dramatize Elena's progress). The piece commits to its premise and avoids median hedging, but the core grief-to-healing template is not fully transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout; her choice to light candles deliberately as beacon, to fold cranes with coordinates, and to finally pick up the tattoo needle with intent to apply the stencil all advance the narrative. Setup early, drives two beats (encounter with visitor, final needle decision), and participates in closure. The jewelry-making shapes her refuge role and memorial-piece craft constrains her interaction with the visitor (reshaping the wedding band into pendant). Causally active across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phoenix stencil appears early (paragraph 2), is traced mid-story, lies between Elena and visitor as "promise or prayer," and Elena presses it to her forearm in the penultimate paragraph. It returns with reweighted meaning (from paralyzing symbol to actionable commitment) and shapes two beats (the visitor's comment, Elena's final decision). Not yet executed on the page, so closure participation is preparatory rather than fully realized. Strong reprise, but the deferral ("tomorrow, perhaps") slightly softens indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is mentioned once as metaphor for the refuge's filtering quality—letting in only those who need transformation—but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. It enriches atmosphere and theme but remains ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or stakes. Label-level use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" describes the phoenix stencil's precision once ("too precise for nature, yet somehow more truthful") and is echoed in the final paragraph ("both genuinely artificial and absolutely true"). It enriches the paradox of crafted transformation but does not enable or constrain an action with cost. The trait is thematic rather than causal; swappable with "crafted yet authentic" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena lights candles throughout as deliberate beacon (paragraph 5: "She lit another candle, its glow joining the constellation...deliberately"; final line: "She illuminated another candle"). The action signals her shift from passive refuge-seeker to active guide, draws the stranger in, and charges the closure image ("The workshop glowed"). Present in setup, middle encounter, and ending; causally linked to the visitor's arrival and Elena's emerging role. Essential to the light/darkness motif and the piece's central transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Origami cranes with coordinates appear in paragraph 4 (Elena has been folding them nightly for weeks, encoding places where light broke through darkness), paragraph 6 (she folds another and presses it into the visitor's palm), and the penultimate paragraph (she folds one encoding the observatory itself and leaves it for the next person). The method shapes two beats (gift to visitor, final self-encoding) and participates in closure by extending the beacon practice forward. Signaled early and used consistently, but the mechanics (coordinates tucked inside) are more symbolic than pressure-creating; the visitor is told to open it "later," deferring on-page impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The observatory is established early (no clocks, stars wheeling, great dome, unused workshop beneath) and its timeless quality mirrors Elena's healing outside linear grief stages. The old astronomer's gift of keys and the unlocked-door policy enable the refuge structure. The workshop window allows candlelight to beacon, drawing the stranger. Setting provides resources (workspace, symbolic timelessness) and pressures the tone, but does not force a micro-choice with visible cost. Strong atmospheric integration and closure linkage (stars above, workshop glow), but no moment where spatial constraint alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom six months ago" anchors the story in early recovery; "three years since Marcus died" establishes the grief timeline. The timeframe shapes Elena's cautious progress (she can now act as guide, though she still defers the tattoo to "tomorrow") but does not tighten on-page decisions—no live clock forces the needle application or the crane-folding. The temporal framing enriches context without creating urgency; removing specific durations would weaken credibility but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena's desire to teach others to transform grief is dramatized through her beacon-keeping (candles, cranes with coordinates, unlocked door), the reshaping of the visitor's wedding band, and her own tentative approach to the phoenix tattoo. The motivation is present in setup (memorial pieces, coordinates to light-breaking places), drives the encounter beat (she folds a crane for the visitor, reshapes jewelry), and participates in closure (folding a crane for the observatory itself). Friction exists between wanting to commit (picking up the needle) and hesitation (deferring to "tomorrow"), showing cost. The motivation is more enacted than conflicted; no moment where teaching others competes with self-protection in a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Subdued ardor is maintained through controlled diction ("the expression still feeling foreign," "something that could almost be called hope," candlelight and quiet ritual rather than dramatic catharsis) and modulates appropriately with the visitor's arrival (companionable silence, gentle guidance). The tone coheres across turns and charges the final image ("Her subdued ardor for life was returning...refined by fire"). Rhythm and restraint support the accumulative design. The phrase "subdued ardor" appears explicitly in the final paragraph, risking label-reliance, but the mood has been embodied throughout via pacing and image selection.</comment>
