<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is mentioned but never constrains a choice or generates embodied tension in the cramped facility. Her motivation "to stand by the unremembered" remains abstract throughout; no micro-choice forces her to weigh competing costs or forecloses a path with visible consequence. Interiority defaults to stock formulations ("her breath shallow," "her claustrophobic heart finally at ease") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act buries the codex without dramatizing what she sacrifices or refuses to achieve closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the opening window, but causality is weak: Mara arrives, aligns the codex, activates phase transition, and emerges in a new chamber through steps that feel like checklist execution rather than because/therefore linkage. The "return protocol" at the end lands as a label without prior setup of what it costs or forecloses. A Resonant Reconfiguration is attempted in the final image (burying the codex, heart at ease), but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated—no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible. Lens reads as attempted Causal but drifts toward summary at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Facility details (rusted doors, coiled cable farms, translucent walls) are vivid and purposeful, and the tidal apex triggers the phase arrays, giving environment a role in the sequence. The codex itself—water-soaked vellum, phosphorescent ink, gold flecks—is handled in multiple beats and charges the final image. However, the cavernous chamber and the sand outside remain postcard backdrops; spatial choreography inside the facility is vague, and no micro-setting detail (tool, body constraint, or object proximity) alters a tactic at a choice point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (track invisible things via the codex), and the tidal clock implies urgency. The phase-field shimmer provides one moment of escalation, but protagonist agency is minimal: Mara performs scripted steps (align, whisper sequence, activate protocol) without on-page friction or a decision that narrows options. The "misstep could strand her" threat is declared but never tested. Closure involves burying the codex, but the text does not show what she sacrifices or refuses to secure that outcome, leaving cost asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—honoring the forgotten, charting the invisible—is present and reinforced by the codex and cable imagery, but it surfaces through repeated assertion ("stand by the unremembered," "invisible threads… never be forgotten") rather than emergent from concrete choice. The final image (burying the codex, heart at ease) attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the question it answers is never dramatized in scene: no on-page conflict between memory and erasure, no trade-off that tests Mara's commitment. Gold flecks recur but function as ornament rather than accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the opening line establishes a lyric register ("hulking mouth," "crashing hush") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Mara notices facility details in a way that could suit any cautious explorer. No dialogue appears, so character distinction is not tested. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear in moderate density without overwhelming immediacy. The final paragraph's "quiet triumph" and "claustrophobic heart finally at ease" tip into tell-summary that asserts resolution rather than trusting the image to land it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("hulking mouth," "serpents waiting," "jellyfish bellies," "veil of pressure that tasted of brine"), and several metaphors strain coherence (sea "inhaled and held its breath" while also pressing, walls "translucent like jellyfish bellies" without clear light source). Template cadence runs appear: "She aligned… she whispered… she felt… she raised… she activated… she stepped… she buried," a seven-beat stem repetition that flattens propulsion in the second half. Paraphrase loops recur: "invisible things" appears five times, "gold flecks" six, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere or codex properties rather than advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—spelunker in undersea research facility uses codex and phase tech to track invisible data currents—combines multiple speculative elements but executes them at surface level without transformation. The core arc (retrieve codex, activate tech, complete mission, bury artifact) follows a stock quest template, and the emotional resolution (claustrophobe finds ease in open sea) is signaled early and delivered without friction. Turns feel procedural rather than inevitable in hindsight. One fresh inflection—names etched in sea-foam on concrete—is vivid but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and performs all key actions (lift codex, align console, activate protocol, bury artifact), but her claustrophobia does not constrain a single choice. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; she executes a memorized sequence without friction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met by presence, but causality is weak—observation and procedure dominate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The codex appears in the opening third, is handled in at least three beats (lifting, aligning with console, floating with turning pages, projecting map, burial), and anchors the final image. However, its gold flecks function as description rather than constraint: they "catch torchlight," "align with nodes," and "flare" without forcing a tactical choice or revealing a cost. Lyric reprise (opening trembling hands to final glimmering) reweights meaning modestly but lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Undersea cables are present throughout (coiled like serpents, pulsing amber, marking data paths) and the facility is explicitly a cable farm. The cables enable the phase transition and map projection, shaping the central sequence. However, they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—Mara interacts with them via the codex interface rather than handling or navigating them directly. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is the mission premise and recurs as theme claim, but the attribute is label-only: the codex "supposedly held the key" and later "projected a map," yet the text never dramatizes what is tracked, why it matters on the page, or what cost the tracking imposes. No on-page action hinges on the trait. Introduced early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Return" bookends the story (arrive, complete return sequence, step onto sand) and the "return protocol" triggers the phase-field collapse that brings Mara back. However, the action is procedural: she "activated the return protocol, trusting" without friction, cost, or a choice that redefines options. The sequence could swap for any exit mechanism with minor edits. Present across beats but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phase transitions are signaled early (experimental devices, misstep warning) and enacted at two beats (room folds, Mara pulled through veil; return protocol collapses fields). The method shapes the central move and closure sequence. However, mechanics remain vague—"align codex… whisper sequence… activate protocol"—and no on-page cost or failure mode tests the method. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but swappable with another transition tech.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility frames the entire story, supplies the cable arrays and phase tech that enable the mission, and the tidal pressure ties to the timeframe. The rusted doors, coiled cables, and translucent walls create vivid atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Mara navigates it without friction, and no spatial detail alters a tactic. Setup and payoff strong; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between tidal changes" is declared early ("tide outside rose and fell," "tide reached its apex," "sea receded to its low") and the apex triggers the phase arrays, giving the timeframe a role in escalation. However, the clock is not tracked moment-to-moment, and no decision is tightened by running time. The facility doors groan open "just as the sea receded," a coincidence that resolves timing rather than forcing a trade-off. Present but not pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To stand by the unremembered" is stated in the opening third and echoed at closure ("quiet triumph of standing by the unremembered"), but the motivation is never dramatized through a conflicted choice. No on-page friction tests Mara's commitment—no scientist's ghost she must refuse, no alternate use of the codex she must forgo. The desire is told rather than shown under pressure. Setup and payoff by assertion; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" appears in the opening, recurs at closure ("crashing hush outside now a soft echo"), and the oxymoron modulates purposefully (deep pressure inside, soft echo outside). The tone—salt-thick, breath-held, vibrating—is coherent and charges the final image modestly. However, tone remains static through the phase transition and chamber discovery, where urgency or awe might have shifted cadence. Lyric reprise present but does not fully reweight prior pressure.</comment>
