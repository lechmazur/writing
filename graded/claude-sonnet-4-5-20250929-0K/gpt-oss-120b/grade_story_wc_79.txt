<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her "quiet resolve" functions as a label; we never see her waver, doubt, or pay an internal price for her choices. The shift from "questioning the watchers" to "carrying the pattern forward" is asserted in summary rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict. Micro-choices exist (tracing ink, blowing the whistle) but they advance plot without revealing competing desires or visible cost that would foreclose alternate paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early enough and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through pattern motifs (spirals, shell ridges, whistle resonance). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira reframes the expedition as the city's lost willingness to listen and vows to continue. However, cost remains abstract—"sunwashed dread dissolve[s] into quiet resolve"—without a visible forfeiture or constraint that alters her options on the page. The final vow ("forever") reads as declaration rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path, weakening the closure's felt cost and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific: "layered like ancient scarps," terraces, observatories, bronze gate, cracked mosaic. The mosaic functions as micro-setting that encodes coordinates and triggers the hidden passage, constraining Mira's path and charging the middle turn. Spatial choreography (spiral corridors, flanks, cliffs) remains coherent. The setting returns at closure ("redraw its spirals with new meaning"), reweighting the opening image. Strong integration lifts the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the city from fossilizing by questioning the watchers. The mosaic discovery and whistle's second use provide a meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's path. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on felt cost, and here the resolution—"carry the pattern forward"—arrives without a visible trade-off or renunciation. The watchers' light-pattern answer and Mira's realization that the expedition "had become part of the pattern" feel like convenient revelations rather than choices that foreclose options, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (listening, living patterns vs. fossilization) emerges through concrete images: rusted gate, cracked mosaic, whistle resonance, watchers' light language. The final realization—"the true lost expedition was...the city's own willingness to listen"—offers a non-literal answer but edges toward overt articulation ("she vowed to keep listening, forever"). The mosaic and whistle motifs constrain choice and return with reweighted meaning, supporting thematic coherence. However, the ending's summary tone and lack of dramatized cost prevent full resonance, holding the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, lyric texture: "molten ribbon," "amber dread," "sea-green glow." Perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic, pattern-focused). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reverence," "silent watchers perched...like statues...awaiting judgment") that reads generic rather than Mira-specific. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to stir," "seemed to") and phrases like "quiet resolve" flatten immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled. The piece earns mid-6s for texture but misses higher bands due to stock phrasing and slight register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language ("molten ribbon," "feather," "sea-green glow") is vivid but occasionally dense without clear pattern-teaching payoff. Minor loops: "the silent watchers" appears six times with minimal variation; "pattern" recurs frequently in the final third, edging toward synonym churn. Sentence openings vary. Information density is reasonable, though some lines serve primarily atmospheric goals ("bathing the turtles in gold that felt both hopeful and foreboding"). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor issues (figurative density, repetitive anchor phrases) prevent entry into the 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The turtle-city premise is fresh and vividly rendered; the cracked mosaic as deliberate language and the whistle as resonance tool offer specificity. However, the emotional arc—curiosity → discovery → vow to continue—follows a familiar template: lone scholar deciphers ancient code, receives mystical confirmation, accepts mission. The watchers' light-pattern response and Mira's insight that "the expedition had become part of the pattern" resolve stakes without friction or surprise. Risk-taking in world-building elevates the score, but the plot's arc and moral clarity (listening good, fossilization bad) remain conventional, holding the piece in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira (spiral-shell cartographer) is present throughout and makes two key choices: tracing the mosaic to reveal the passage, and blowing the whistle twice to contact the watchers. Setup is immediate; she drives the middle discovery beat and is present at closure. However, her choices feel observational and procedural—decoding rather than deciding under competing pressures. The final "vow to keep listening" is declaration, not a choice with visible cost. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff), causal involvement in one beat, but decisions lack trade-off or constraint that would elevate the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reed whistle appears in three distinct beats: setup ("carried at her throat...sang of winds long forgotten"), first use ("blew the reed whistle...stirred the turtles"), second use ("let it wail long enough...watchers answered"), and closure ("tucked the reed whistle into her satchel"). Its sound drives two turns: alerting watchers and eliciting the light-pattern response. Early signal, beat involvement (three touches), causal pressure (summons watchers), closure presence. However, the whistle's mechanics remain abstract—no cost or constraint tied to its use—and it feels partially swappable with any signaling device. All three gates met; score in the upper-6s for solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lost expedition is mentioned in setup ("Legends whispered...vanished beyond the horizon"), returns in the mosaic discovery ("map of the lost expedition's route"), and is reframed at closure ("the expedition had never been lost; it had become part of the pattern"). It shapes Mira's initial curiosity but does not constrain her choices on the page—she would decode the mosaic and contact the watchers regardless. The expedition functions as backstory motivation rather than a live stake. Two gates (setup, payoff via reframe), but development is summary-only; score in the low-4s for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is asserted in the opening paragraph ("She was quietly driven, a calm current beneath the city's bright glare") but remains label-only. Mira's actions (tracing ink, blowing whistle, following corridors) proceed without visible internal friction or a trade-off between drive and caution. The trait does not constrain or enable any beat with cost; it could be removed without altering tactics. Present in setup, absent in development and payoff; ornamental mention trends low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Crack" appears as the cracked mosaic at the story's heart: "a cracked mosaic...a deliberate fissure, a language of fracture that encoded coordinates." The crack is causally essential—it reveals the hidden passage and encodes the map. Present in setup (bronze gate "rusted shut"), middle (mosaic discovery drives the turn), and closure ("closed the cracked mosaic with reverence"). The action is irreplaceable: removing the crack would break the decoding mechanism and the passage reveal. Three gates, two distinct beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity; score in the low-7s for essential integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through pattern languages" is named in setup ("Her method was through pattern languages, studying the repetitions, the spirals, the fractal echoes") and demonstrated in the mosaic beat ("traced the lines with her ink, aligning them with the spirals she already knew"). The method enables the map-reading and passage discovery, shaping tactics. However, its mechanics remain abstract—no cost or constraint differentiates pattern-reading from generic puzzle-solving. Present in all three gates, causal involvement in one beat; score in the upper-5s for functional integration without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is introduced immediately and pressures every beat: terraces and observatories establish scale, the rusted gate traps the city, shell ridges encode language, spiral corridors guide Mira's path, and the hidden passage on the turtle's flank provides the exit. The setting's pattern (spirals, shell geometry) is causally essential to the mosaic decoding. Closure image ("redraw its spirals with new meaning," "shells humming with the pattern languages") recharges the opening. Early setup, multiple beats constrained, closure linkage, high irreplaceability; score in the upper-7s for indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the gate rusts shut" anchors the timeframe in setup and explains the city's isolation ("sealing the turtles from any new tide"). However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—Mira explores at her own pace without urgency or a live clock. The gate's closure is backstory that frames context but does not escalate pressure. Present in setup, implied continuity, but absent from middle development and closure beats; functional context trends mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To question the silent watchers" is stated in setup ("Her motivation to question those silent watchers grew each sunrise") and drives Mira's two whistle-blowing actions. The watchers appear in three beats: distant observation, second whistle response, and closure ("kept vigil over a horizon that no longer seemed unknowable"). The motivation shapes attempts but remains told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between desire and cost. All three gates met, causal involvement in two beats, but lack of visible conflict or trade-off caps the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is introduced early ("sun washed the city in amber dread") and recurs in the final paragraph ("bathing the turtles in a gold that felt both hopeful and foreboding," "sunwashed dread dissolve into a quiet resolve"). The tone blends beauty and unease consistently: "molten ribbon," "ancient scarps," "shadowy silhouettes," "warning feather." Modulation occurs at closure when dread shifts to resolve, charging the final image. Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise, closure linkage; score in the mid-6s for solid tonal control without a decisive reweighting that would reach the 7s.</comment>
