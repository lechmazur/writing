<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mort exists solely as a perceptual vehicle; no interiority creates tension or micro-choices under pressure. His "mission" is stated but never tested by competing wants or costs. The piece uses therapy-speak ("physics of letting go," "transformation of energy") as epiphany without dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion is absent—he "smiled," "sensed," "realized" without contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive by ~120 words (waived). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but delivers no meaningful tightening or cadence shift—only a static glide through description. Closure unit: Mort rises with the snow globe and "lets the sea carry his quiet gratitude"; no decisive change, no foreclosed path, no visible cost. The ending asserts transformation ("physics of letting go revealed itself") without dramatizing it. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Mort sacrificed or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sunken ship library supplies vivid, POV-filtered detail (algae, brass microphone, tangled copper). The snow globe appears in multiple beats and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice; Mort floats freely without friction. Micro-setting (console, globe) functions as charged object but not as setting pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("note the last transmission") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, no tightening: Mort retrieves, untangles, listens, records, departs without obstacle or trade-off. The "final strand snapped" is presented as a natural event, not a choice. Agency (renunciation, endurance, decision) is absent; Mort observes and floats. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift—neither appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme ("physics of letting go") is declared repeatedly rather than earned through action: "letting go was not surrender but a transformation of energy," "tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release." These are stated morals, not resonant answers arising from particulars. The snow globe and transmission recur but do not reweight prior material; they illustrate the thesis without friction. Final paragraph moralizing ("sophisticated melancholy … can illuminate") replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (algae, corroded brass) but voice lacks character-specific diction—register drifts into academic abstraction ("physics of letting go," "luminous path of release") during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean. Diction stays within educated observer range but becomes generic philosophical rather than Mort-particular under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "letting go was not surrender but a transformation" / "the act of untangling … revealed" / "physics of letting go revealed itself" restates the same thesis five times. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun]" runs across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors: "ocean itself were sighing," "tiny stars drifting upward, a silent chorus." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final third without pattern-teaching. Filter verbs cluster: "he thought," "he realized," "he sensed" in adjacent lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph). Deductions: paraphrase −0.6, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphors −0.4, filter stack −0.5; spread touching closure totals −1.7 and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (diver retrieves last transmission from sunken ship) is functional but derivative; no transformation beyond adding a snow globe motif. The "physics of letting go" frame reads as imposed thesis rather than organic synthesis. Emotional arc (gratitude, release) follows a median template without risk. No fresh inflection: the ending delivers the declared theme without surprise. Proximity check: "ocean itself were sighing" echoes countless elegiac closures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mort is present throughout but makes no key turn. His choices (retrieve, untangle, listen, record, depart) are uncontested observations. "First name basis with death" is asserted in narrative voice but not dramatized through Mort's agency or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Snow globe appears in beats 1 (retrieved), 2 (turned, "ticking … matched"), and 5 (shattered into stars). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is thin (merely "clutched to his chest"). Closure linkage: the globe shatters in the final paragraph, reweighting "memory … dissolving." However, the shattering resolves a symbolic problem (frozen whirl → release) it did not help create during the untangling action. Cap 4.6 for late resolution of unearned problem, but lyric reprise lifts to 5.5–6.3 range. Swappability: another keepsake could serve the same function with minor edits. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Last transmission (wax cylinder) is the stated mission, drives Mort's retrieval and untangling, and is sealed at closure. Setup by paragraph 1, development through untangling beats, payoff when Mort records his own note beside the cylinder. Causal pressure: narrows task (must untangle to hear), though without opposition. Closure linkage: "last transmission faded into the abyss" in final third. Specificity: the cylinder's content (captain's love, descent) is unique. Two beats (hearing, sealing) + closure presence + causal work = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is label-only; no on-page action shows this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Mort's method (untangling) could be performed by any careful character. No visible tradeoff between analysis and another approach.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Note-taking appears twice: Mort's mission ("to note the last transmission") and his final act ("recorded his own note"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent. The act of noting does not create a turn—Mort records observations without friction. Swappability: "document" or "log" would function identically. Closure linkage: the sealed note is mentioned but does not reweight prior stakes. Two touches + closure presence + no causal pressure = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Untangling threads is signaled early ("began his careful work by untangling threads"), mechanics detailed ("each loop … how sound can be knotted"), and causal: "When the final strand snapped, the console emitted a crackling whisper." Setup, development (two beats: noting pattern, strand snapping triggers transmission), and payoff (transmission heard, Mort's note describes "how the act of untangling had revealed"). Method shapes attempt and outcome. Specificity: the physics of tangled copper is unique to this task. Three beats + causal pressure + closure mention = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sunken ship library is established early, supplies vivid setting detail (algae, brass, coil of copper), and appears in closure ("library … held its breath," "wreckage"). Setup and payoff met; middle development: the console and shelf are used but do not pressure Mort's choices. The setting enables retrieval but does not constrain or complicate. Specificity: "forgotten sunken ship library" is distinct. Two functional beats (retrieval, sealing) + closure atmosphere + no causal constraint = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after finding Amelia Earhart's plane") is mentioned in paragraph 1 as context, returns in penultimate paragraph ("He thought of Amelia"), but never tightens a decision or tactic. Setup gate met; no development or payoff. The discovery does not create urgency or alter Mort's mission. Ornamental reprise without pressure = 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to understand the physics of letting go") is stated and restated but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Mort's actions (untangle, listen, record) align with the goal without friction. Setup gate met; no on-page moment shows tension between this desire and another need. Told-only, no visible trade-off = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone (sophisticated melancholy) is coherent: diction ("mournful and hopeful," "profound connection between loss and creation"), imagery (snow globe, fading transmission), and rhythm (long sentences, recursive phrasing) sustain the mood. The tone modulates minimally—remains elegiac throughout without cadence shift under pressure. Final image ("silent chorus of farewells") charges melancholy. Coherent across beats + charges closure + no dynamic modulation = 6.4.</comment>
