<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is stated rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Her actions follow a methodical routine (setting up projector, noting shadows, tracing glyphs) but lack internal conflict or competing impulses that would reveal character-particular struggle. The final "shielded openness" is asserted as interiority rather than shown through embodied contradiction. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; the chapel simply "sighs open," presenting discovery without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering images (rain, stones, map tear, video reels) toward a final resonance. However, the closure relies on atmospheric assertion—"the whispered chapel now alive with a muted chorus"—rather than a legible Decisive Change or cost. The Orientation Test applies: who/where/when are vague past 120 words (the vault, the henge, the chapel bleed together without spatial anchors), triggering −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (empathy rewrites borders) but the cost remains abstract, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and ancient henge are vividly described but remain postcard backdrops; neither constrains a choice. Spatial choreography is murky: the protagonist enters a vault "beneath" the henge, yet the henge is described as "beyond the chapel," creating impossible geography. The projector and overlapping videos function as props without altering tactics. The cap from Q2 orientation debt (7.0) is superseded by execution quality here, but the setting does not charge the final image or pressure a turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the chapel by interpreting its silence—is signaled early but never tested with a live obstacle or trade-off. The protagonist's actions are methodical yet frictionless: she sets up, pauses, traces, repositions, and succeeds without a reversal or narrowing of options. No visible cost or forfeited path accompanies the resolution; the chapel's reopening is granted by atmospheric consensus rather than earned through agency. One tightening or deepening is required at this length; none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—empathy bridging myth and geography—emerges through recurring images (map tear, rain, silent footage) rather than overt statement. The final image (generations of map framers continuing the dialogue) gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but lacks the particularity to make the cost undeniable. "Shielded openness" and "methodically curious" function as thematic labels rather than lived contradictions. The ending offers resonance without a non-literal answer rooted in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but narratively certain beyond the protagonist's plausible knowledge: "the ancient henge's energy to seep into the chapel's stone, restoring a forgotten rhythm" claims metaphysical fact. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("rain-scoured," "bruised purple") and vague abstraction ("intangible grief," "shielded openness"). Perceptual signature is generic; the protagonist notices in catalog fashion (shadows, glyphs, raindrops) without bias or blind spots. No dialogue; interior voice feels assembled rather than singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "methodically curious" appears twice in identical phrasing; "whispered chapel" recurs as incantation without causal work. Figurative language is dense but often mixed: the map's tear is a "wound," "portal," and "scar" within three paragraphs, muddling the vehicle. Template cadence ("She paused… She whispered… She lifted… She realized…") stacks in the middle third, triggering −0.6. Sentences are rhythmically uniform; propulsion stalls in the reflective middle. The final paragraph's "soft glow" and "muted chorus" rely on stock mystical phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The map-framing + ancient-site premise evokes familiar mystical-archaeology templates without a transformative angle. The video-comparison method is mildly specific but arrives late and resolves cleanly without friction. "Empathy rewrites borders" is thematically earnest yet abstract; the story avoids bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The lyric accumulation of images (rain, stones, map tear) reads as intentional but does not synthesize into an inevitable or irreplaceable vision. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template closeness, mitigated slightly by the video-reels method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The perceptive map framer is present throughout but her choices do not create turns; she observes, notes, and traces without encountering opposition or making a trade-off. Setup: present early (+0.6). Development: her "methodically curious" observation drives beats but not causal pressure (+0.4). Payoff: she records the moment for future framers, a passive witness rather than active agent (+0.2). Swappability: a historian or archaeologist could perform the same actions with minimal edits (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ancient henge appears in opening description, recurs as spatial anchor, and pulses "in response" near the end. Setup: present early (+0.6). Development: described but not handled or used (+0.2). Payoff: mentioned in the final paragraph as proof but not causally active in the closure image (+0.3). Specificity: "standing stones aligning with the fractured map" is vivid (+0.4). Swappability: another sacred site (dolmen, barrow) could substitute (−0.6). Ornamental across most beats (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The whispered chapel is the central concept: sealed, it must be reopened. Setup: introduced early as "whispered chapel hidden beneath the ancient henge" (+0.7). Development: the protagonist's entire task centers on reopening it (+1.0). Payoff: "the whispered chapel now alive" in the final lines (+1.2). Specificity: "whispered" and the sealing/opening arc are unique (+0.6). Causal pressure: the chapel's state constrains and enables the closure action (+0.9). Minor friction: the mechanism of reopening (overlaying projections) feels metaphorical rather than concrete (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Methodically curious is named twice and guides her approach but does not constrain or cost. Setup: labeled in paragraph one (+0.4). Development: her note-taking and comparison are methodical but unopposed (+0.3). Payoff: mentioned again in the middle third; absent from closure (−0.5). Label-only: the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a visible trade-off (−0.7). Swappability: "perceptive" or "patient" would function identically (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Reopening the chapel is the stated goal and frames the entire arc. Setup: "her task was to reopen a whispered chapel" by paragraph one (+0.8). Development: every action (projector setup, map overlay, aligning footage) advances the reopening (+1.1). Payoff: "the whispered chapel now alive… the reopened chapel stood as proof" in the final lines (+1.3). Irreplaceability: the story's logic hinges on this action (+0.7). Friction: the reopening occurs without obstacle or cost, making it feel granted rather than earned (−1.2). Summary-only resolution: the chapel's "sigh open in the mind's eye" is metaphorical, not dramatized (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is introduced in paragraph two and occupies the middle third. Setup: projector and two reels signaled early (+0.7). Development: she pauses, compares shadows, aligns raindrops across decades (+0.9). Payoff: "final frame faded" triggers the glow; future framers will "compare this silent footage with theirs" (+0.8). Specificity: the decade-spanning video method is distinct (+0.6). Friction: the mechanics remain vague—how does alignment "restore" the chapel?—and the method does not impose cost or error (−0.8). Late first use: projector mechanics appear after ~25% (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is the immediate setting. Setup: opening line establishes "rain-scoured fresco vault" (+0.7). Development: described as canvas and breathing, but does not pressure choices (+0.2). Payoff: "fresco vault seemed to breathe" near the end, but the vault is passive backdrop (+0.3). Specificity: "rain-scoured" and "frescoed ceiling" are vivid (+0.4). Swappability: any ancient interior (crypt, alcove) could substitute with minor edits (−0.6). Ornamental: the vault does not alter tactics or constrain action (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The map-tear spot is named as the place "where cartographers marked the line dividing known from unknown." Setup: mentioned early as location anchor (+0.5). Development: the protagonist places the torn map over the projection, letting images "bleed into each other's silence" (+0.6). Payoff: "the map's tear was not a flaw but a portal" reconfigures meaning (+0.7). Specificity: the tear as threshold is thematic (+0.4). Friction: timeframe is spatial metaphor, not a temporal constraint; no clock or deadline tightens decisions (−1.2). The "spot" is concept, not actionable pressure (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To interpret silence with empathy is stated twice as motivation. Setup: "conviction that guided every line she drew" in paragraph one (+0.6). Development: "her motivation… guided her hand as she traced" in the middle (+0.5). Payoff: "empathy could rewrite the borders" in the final line (+0.7). Friction: the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs (−0.9). Label-only: "empathy" is claimed without embodied struggle or trade-off (−0.7). Swappability: "patience" or "intuition" could replace it with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Shielded openness is named twice as tone/feeling. Setup: "shielded openness that acknowledged both… stoic presence and… intangible grief" mid-story (+0.3; late signal −0.3). Development: "felt a shielded openness in her heart" near the end (+0.4). Payoff: the tone shapes the final introspective mood (+0.5). Coherence: the phrase gestures at paradox but remains abstract; the narrative does not modulate tonally under pressure (−0.7). Label-only: asserted rather than embodied in prose rhythm or POV filtering (−0.7). Swappability: "guarded wonder" or "cautious reverence" would function identically (−0.5).</comment>
