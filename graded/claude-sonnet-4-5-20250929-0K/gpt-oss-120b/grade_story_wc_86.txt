<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The negotiator remains abstract throughout; we receive label-only interiority ("uncommonly thoughtful," "furrowed hush") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The scarred veteran functions only as a mirror; no relationship pressure emerges. Past error is summarized in one sentence without shaping present tactics or revealing character-specific limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture competes with causal negotiation beats, neither dominant by midpoint. Orientation remains vague: we lack clear spatial anchors for the parapet's layout, the identity of the "opposing negotiator," or the concrete mechanism of the exchange until late. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("freedom often begins with letting go"), but no visible cost appears on the page—the prisoners are released, the storm wanes, conscience at peace, all frictionless. The rope "untethered" functions as metaphor without altering tactics or forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and mist provide atmospheric texture, but spatial choreography remains unclear: where is the opposing negotiator standing, how does the box move between them, what prevents or enables their actions? The antique drawer pull recurs as a symbolic token without constraining a choice. Sensory hierarchy is generic—"slick stones," "salt," "mist"—without POV filtering or occupational detail that would ground a negotiator's professional focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prisoner release—is declared but never tested; no complication forces a trade-off or narrows options. The negotiator whispers apology, offers the box, the other man nods, they agree to release at dawn, all without friction. Moon-phase synchronization is mentioned but never constrains an attempt. No reversal or tightening occurs; the waning crescent "marks the schedule" passively. Coincidence of mutual agreement resolves the exchange without protagonist agency driving escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as bridge is stated outright in the penultimate beat: "forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty." The antique drawer pull recurs as a symbolic hinge without prior particulars earning the resonance—it appears, glints, is clutched, then stands as "a simple hinge between past error and future mercy." The final paragraph moralizes rather than letting image carry weight. Epiphany ("mistakes remembered, lessons kept") is inscribed on parchment rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable single-third, but perceptual signature is absent—diction lacks character-particular texture, reading instead as elevated literary register ("phantom from the sea mist," "furrowed hush") uniform across all beats. Psychic distance is consistent but generic. The negotiator's professional lens (what does a prisoner-exchange negotiator notice first?) never filters description. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("saying that the pull inside represented a shared turning point") without subtext or character-specific idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears four times, a recycled phrase that becomes template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "untether" recurs across three beats with near-identical framing (rope untethered, untethering weight, untethered rope reminder). Filter-verb stack in reflection block: "felt the weight lift," "recalled a past error," "felt the furrowed hush soften," "felt the cycle close." Metaphor muddle: the drawer pull is a "reminder," "compass," "hinge," "token" without coherent vehicle. Stock phrase "weather-worn resolve" and "collective sigh of relief" dull specificity. High artifact density across closure beats triggers Q7 penalty and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise—neutral-ground negotiation on windblown parapet—is functional but familiar. The antique drawer pull as symbolic hinge, moon phases as ritual timing, and apology-to-forgiveness arc follow template emotional beats without fresh synthesis. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or specific lived detail distinguishes this negotiation from generic reconciliation plots. Derivative template adjustment applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and makes decisions (whispers apology, offers box, agrees to dawn release), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, choices do not create key turns—each decision flows frictionlessly without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Swappable with "mediator" or "diplomat" with minor edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("small wooden box... antique drawer pull tarnished by salt"). Development: handled in multiple beats (lifted, glinted, placed, opened, clutched). Payoff: present in final image ("still clutched in his hand, a token of lessons learned"). However, the pull never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure—it is described and carried but does not alter decision-making. Functional across beats but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "meeting was set on neutral territory, a crumbling balcony." Development: the neutrality shapes the framing (both sides "lingered," no advantage declared), but does not constrain a tactic or force a visible trade-off. Payoff: implicit in the successful exchange, though not revisited in the final image. Shapes one thematic beat (the site as no-man's-land) but could be swapped for "border crossing" or "abandoned building" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful, weighing each phrase" is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The attribute does not generate a visible trade-off or mistake. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "untethered the rope that had bound his own fears" mid-story. Development: the act is a pivot ("the weight lift") that precedes the box offer. Payoff: revisited in final reflection ("memory of the untethered rope reminded him that freedom often begins with letting go"). The action drives one key turn (emotional release before agreement) and returns to charge the ending. Earns mid-band via setup, development, and closure linkage, though the turn is metaphorical rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Setup: "synchronize their actions through moon phases to avoid surprise" appears early. Development: "timing was set by synchronizing through moon phases, a ritual they had learned from ancient mariners." Payoff: "agreed to release the first group at dawn, when the moon would rise again in its full glory." The method is described but never tested—no complication arises from moon timing, no choice depends on its mechanics. Functional mention across beats but swappable with any scheduling device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: opening lines anchor "storm-worn, windblown parapet, its stones slick with the night's relentless drizzle." Development: stones, mist, and ledge recur but do not constrain movement or supply resources that alter tactics. Payoff: "stones bare but no longer hostile" in final beat. The setting provides atmospheric texture without pressure on choices. Meets setup and payoff gates but lacks middle causal work; functional but replaceable with any elevated meeting ground.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is thematic framing, not a tracked interval with ticking pressure. No on-page clock tightens decisions—dawn is agreed upon without urgency testing the delay. The timeframe labels the arc but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off. Present as theme claim, absent as escalation tool.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "His motivation now was to recycle mistakes into wisdom" appears mid-story. Development: the parchment lists "Mistakes remembered, lessons kept," a summary rather than dramatized friction. Payoff: "departed... a token of lessons learned." The motivation is declared and echoed but never conflicts with another want or generates a visible cost—no competing impulse (fear of repeating failure, pressure to compromise principle) acts in scene. Told rather than dramatized; functional mention without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup: "furrowed hush" appears in opening and recurs four times. Development: phrase is recycled without modulation—same diction under varied pressure (wind, heart, silence, future meeting). Payoff: final beat uses "furrowed hush, wiser." The tone is consistent but static; no cadence shift charges the final image, and repetition becomes template artifact rather than purposeful intensification. Meets setup and payoff via recurrence but lacks escalation or pressure-driven modulation.</comment>
