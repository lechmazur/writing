<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore faith is signaled early, but her interior remains gestural—"warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The work spans days yet no fatigue, doubt, or competing impulse interrupts the reverent flow; she kneels, turns, gathers, and smiles without visible cost or friction. The final gratitude from the bones and her promise feel awarded rather than earned by prior struggle. Interiority leans on atmospheric labels instead of character-particular perception degrading under the weight of excavation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (diaspora returnee, catacomb orchard, excavation mission). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fragments gathered, altar assembled, roots respond, voice rises. The closure unit—altar complete, voice thanks, dawn breaks—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (faith restored, interrupted journeys merged). Cost is conceptual (patience, reverent pause) but not viscerally felt on the page; no tactical choice narrowed by a prior failure or price paid in stamina, doubt, or loss. The sequence coheres but the tightening remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly realized: roots snake between bones, bioluminescence pulses, skeletal arches tower, moonlight filters through canopy. Sensory detail is selective and consistent, filtered through Mara's reverent attention. The sundial base settling onto the altar and roots recoiling like reverent hands demonstrates environment shaping micro-action. The setting charges the final image (dawn rays, bright bands) and constrains Mara's path through the labyrinth. Spatial choreography remains clear across the excavation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early and pursued through gathering fragments and placing the sundial base. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last stone clicks and the voice rises, but no mid-sequence reversal tests commitment; Mara encounters no obstacle, misalignment, or tactical cost that forces a trade-off. The roots recoil and bones rattle in response to her action, yet she never risks error, exhaustion, or a competing need. Escalation reads as atmospheric accumulation rather than narrowing options with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of faith restored through patient wandering emerges from particulars: sundial base, root-veins, bone hymns, dawn light. The final image (altar catching golden rays, travelers guided by stories) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the roots' reverent hands and the quiet voice's gratitude. However, "interrupted journeys," "purposeful wandering," and "cautious enchantment" recur as near-synonyms without fresh inflection or complication; the thematic resolution feels predetermined rather than tested by counter-pressure or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited; Mara's perceptual filter is consistent (reverent, curious, steadied). Diction leans elevated and atmospheric throughout—"marrow of the dead whisper faint hymns," "cautious enchantment," "shared sunrise"—which reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("bone-laced corridors," "glowing tapestry"). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, the prose sometimes prioritizes texture over interior specificity, and the voice does not modulate sharply under pressure; the cadence remains hushed and ceremonial even at the climactic placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs across the text: "interrupted journeys" appears six times, "purposeful wandering" / "warmly curious" / "cautious enchantment" recur as fixed phrases without variation. Sentence stems repeat ("She carried… She walked… She felt… She promised…" clustering in the final third). Stock metaphors—"pale rivers of memory," "glowing tapestry," "stitching together fragmented faiths"—stack without fresh vehicle. Information density is moderate; several lines restate atmosphere without advancing action. Clarity remains intact, but momentum drags under the weight of synonym churn and scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is constrained by a template premise: lone restorer completes ritual, mystical site responds, scattered people reunite. The catacomb orchard setting offers a fresh synthesis (tree roots among bones, bioluminescent guidance), and the sundial-as-timekeeping-altar detail is specific. However, emotional arc and conflict follow a predictable path (gather fragments → place altar → site awakens → faith restored) without fresh turns or moral calculus. The prose commits fully to its reverent tone, yet the core design reads as a familiar diaspora-return / sacred-restoration archetype executed competently but not transformed by on-page risk or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is named and focalized throughout; her choices (kneeling, turning the base, gathering shards, setting the final stone) drive all beats. However, these are execution steps of a predetermined plan rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under pressure. She encounters no obstacle, doubt, or competing impulse that forces a visible trade-off. Setup by opening line; involved in placement and final stone beats; present in ending image. Causal pressure is low; swappable with "faithful restorer" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sundial base is introduced in paragraph 6, handled physically (carried, placed, turned, settled), and its shadows align with root-veins at closure, marking "the moment the world seemed to hold its breath." Three distinct beats: placement on cracked foundation (para 9), turning that prompts roots to recoil (para 11), final settling that triggers the voice (para 21–22). Drives altar assembly and closure linkage. However, late first appearance and no cost tied uniquely to this object (any sacred fragment could function similarly) limit irreplaceability. Causal role present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is named in paragraphs 3, 13, 23, and 27 as thematic claim and motivator (scholars vanished, Mara completes their work). The concept frames her mission but does not constrain tactics or generate on-page friction; no prior journey's partial map misleads her, no competing interpretation of "interrupted" forces a choice. Present as backstory and label; recurs in closure paragraph as merged pilgrimages. Functional but largely ornamental—removing the phrase would not break plot logic, only thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice as a label (opening and final third) without dramatized cost or enablement. Mara's actions (kneeling, gathering, walking deeper) align generically with curiosity, but no moment shows curiosity overriding caution or drawing her into risk. The attribute is asserted, not enacted with visible trade-off. Setup late (first paragraph interior); absent in middle beats; mentioned again at closure without causal weight. Swappable with "reverent" or "determined."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rebuild/restore is the spine action: excavating, gathering fragments (para 14), setting stones (para 19), placing the final piece (para 20). Every beat traces to assembly work; the altar's completion triggers the voice and dawn light. Major turns (roots respond, voice rises, travelers gather) all depend on the rebuild being enacted. Introduced early (para 4 mission statement); drives middle gathering; payoff at closure when "restored altar" catches first rays. Essential; removing rebuild collapses the plot. Cost is conceptual (patient labor) but not viscerally felt as exhaustion or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named in paragraphs 7, 13, 24, 27, framing Mara's method as deliberate exploration. The concept appears in exposition and summary ("mapping the labyrinthine roots," "wandering between towering roots") but the mechanics are not dramatized—no fork in the path where wandering vs. direct route alters outcome. Setup (para 7); recurs in middle and ending as thematic echo; closure paragraph calls pilgrimages "purposeful wandering toward a shared sunrise." Functional as framing but replaceable; the story could proceed with "careful search" or "patient work" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced in the opening line, detailed across beats (twisted roots, bones, skeletal arches, bioluminescence), and supplies resources (shards, foundation, root-veins that align with sundial). The setting pressures Mara's path ("labyrinthine roots," "bone-laced corridors") and charges the closure image (canopy filtering dawn, threshold bands of light). Setup immediate; middle beats depend on spatial layout; payoff when altar and orchard interact at dawn. The environment is irreplaceable to the story's logic and sensory identity. Minor: no moment where the setting blocks a choice or forces a detour with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" and "days" (para 5) establish duration, and night deepens (para 19) before dawn arrives (para 21). Time is present but vague; no scene clock tightens decisions, no fatigue accrues visibly, no deadline forces a trade-off. The progression (night → dawn) marks closure but does not constrain tactics. Setup (para 5); implied across middle; closure at sunrise. Functional as atmospheric marker but replaceable with "over time" or "through the work" without loss. No visible cost tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to restore lost faith among the scattered descendants" (para 4) is stated early and pursued in every beat (excavating, gathering, placing altar). The desire shapes her mission and the final image (travelers gather, songs rise). However, it is told and reiterated rather than dramatized with internal friction—no moment where doubt, exhaustion, or a competing need tests her commitment. Setup clear; drives all beats; payoff at closure when faith is visibly stitched together. Swappability moderate; the story could function with "honor ancestors" or "reclaim heritage" without major rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named in paragraphs 13, 24, 29 and the orchard is described as "alive," roots "humming," bones "rattling," bioluminescence guiding—consistent atmospheric layering of wonder and reverence. Tone is coherent but static; no modulation when Mara completes the altar or hears the voice—pressure remains hushed and ceremonial throughout. Setup via description (para 8 onward); sustained in middle; charges final image moderately (dawn light, "world pulse anew"). Purposeful but one-note; the tone does not sharpen or pivot at the climactic beat, limiting its integration with escalation.</comment>
