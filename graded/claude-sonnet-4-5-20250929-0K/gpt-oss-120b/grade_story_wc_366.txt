<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marek's interiority leans heavily on ambient observation ("warmly observant," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His ritual is described at length but no competing impulse disrupts it; the stacking proceeds unopposed, flattening tension. The final return—"He returned, his heart alight"—asserts change without dramatizing the cost that earned it. Motivations remain abstract ("protect this fragile chain") and are never tested by a credible threat or internal dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (Marek, lighthouse, night). However, no meaningful causal turn occurs: Marek stacks stones, the room "exhales," he leaves, then inexplicably returns with his "heart alight." The supposed closure—stones glowing, lantern room "glowing once more"—is asserted by narrative fiat rather than earned through protagonist decision or reversal. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the final image lacks visible cost or a legible before/after change in options or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is vividly sketched with sensory detail (iron ribs, cold stone, broken panes). The sea glass and river stones supply tactile anchors, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Marek's ritual proceeds uninterrupted by environmental pressure. The "haunted" label and the lamp flickering out promise stakes that never materialize in scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the anonymous letter chain—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition emerges, no reversal tightens options, and no choice forecloses a path with cost. The wind moans, the lamp dies, yet Marek's ritual completes without friction. The fishing boat and his raised hand gesture toward connection but do not deepen or resolve the stated conflict. Pressure remains static; escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared safety and memory networks is announced repeatedly ("lighthouse for hearts," "bottled feeling of safety") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The sea glass and stone spiral are positioned as symbols but their thematic work is told, not shown through choice or cost. The final glow—"not from oil but from the collective memory"—states the theme overtly, replacing scene pressure with assertion. No complexity or counter-reading is invited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV is maintained cleanly, and psychic distance is stable. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture ("luminescent ache," "chorus of unseen letters"), but diction drifts into over-elevated register at peak moments ("collective memory of those who dared to care"). Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("he imagined," "he knew that") dull immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but lacks perceptual specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: multiple sentences restate Marek's protective intent ("protect this fragile chain," "a promise that...would endure," "his vow to protect") without adding pressure. Stock metaphors cluster ("trapped sunrise," "tide pulling him toward home"). Template cadence appears in runs of similar stems ("He placed...He pressed...He added"). The final third stacks these patterns heavily, flattening momentum and disallowing high-band entry. Figurative language often obscures rather than sharpens ("luminescent ache of memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper performs ritual to preserve shared safety—echoes familiar redemptive-memory templates without a fresh angle. The anonymous letter chain, stone spiral, and sea glass are positioned as original but function ornamentally; their mechanics never constrain choice or generate surprise. The ending's "collective memory" glow resolves without cost or risk, retreating to a safe median. No bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes; the piece reads as a lyric sketch rather than a transformed synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Marek is present throughout and performs the ritual, but his reticence never constrains a choice or creates friction. "Warmly observant" describes perception style without enabling or preventing an action. No decision alters tactics; he completes his plan unopposed. His final return is unexplained and does not grow from prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sea glass is introduced early, placed on the slab, sealed in the hollow stone, and carried away warm. It appears in three beats and returns with reweighted meaning (now "a tiny lighthouse"). However, it does not constrain a choice or shape the ending's outcome; Marek's actions would proceed identically without it. Solid setup and reprise, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "anonymous letter chain" is described as a concept—whispered messages passed sailor to sailor—but never appears on the page as action or object. No letter is read, written, or discovered. It remains thematic backdrop rather than a stake-shaping mechanism. Introduced early but ornamental throughout; removing it would require only paragraph-level edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is applied as a label in the opening line and illustrated by Marek noting wind and tremor, but it never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. Observation does not drive a choice or create a tradeoff. The trait remains descriptive without causal involvement in beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Protect" is declared as motive and restated across multiple beats ("protect this fragile chain," "vow to protect"), but no on-page threat tests it. Marek's ritual proceeds unopposed; no antagonist, obstacle, or internal doubt forces a protective choice with visible cost. The action is thematic rather than causal; it could be swapped for "preserve" or "honor" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stone-stacking method is introduced early, detailed across multiple beats (wave carving, word etching, hollow insertion), and the spiral emits a pulse at the ending. The mechanics are shown on the page and shape the ritual's structure. However, the method does not narrow options or create a problem Marek must solve; it executes smoothly without friction. Solid setup and closure participation, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is established early with vivid detail (cold stone, broken panes, iron ribs) and present across beats. The lamp flickers out, framing the timeframe, and the room "glows once more" at the end. However, it supplies no obstacle, resource constraint, or tactical choice. "Haunted" is mentioned but never dramatized. Present and coherent, but postcard-level rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lamp flickers out early, anchoring the timeframe "after" that event. The ritual unfolds in its aftermath and the room glows again at closure, creating a before/after bracket. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Marek's actions proceed at a leisurely pace with no clock pressure. Functional framing, but no tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated explicitly ("hoping the glass would bottle...safety," "safety could be bottled and shared") and drives the ritual's symbolic logic. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no cost or obstacle complicates it. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice with visible friction. Present across beats but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears twice and is echoed in related phrases ("ghostly light," "collective memory glow"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly from cold unease to warm affirmation. However, it does not deepen under pressure or charge a specific closure image with new cost; instead it remains a consistent atmospheric wash. Purposeful and stable, but static rather than transformative.</comment>
