<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The stargazer remains an archetype rather than a character; interior contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are absent. Her "awkward confidence" is declared but never embodied in conflicting impulses or on-page hesitations. The transformation—from solitary observer to communal leader—occurs without visible internal cost or foreclosed paths. Workers emerge as props, not pressures; no relationship forces a choice that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who she is, where exactly she stands, and what immediate danger the rebellion poses remain vague past 120 words; the piece opens with atmospheric catalog rather than anchoring stakes. Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural but wanders into quasi-causal language ("asked it to help," "whispered a vow") without teaching a clear pattern early. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bay transforms, workers return), yet cost is asserted ("awkward confidence bloom") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or renunciation on the page. The hum and glyph linkage loops without a meaningful tightening; the engines restart but no live option narrows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The repair bay supplies vivid catalog ("rusted cathedral," "cracked concrete," "shattered consoles") but most details remain postcard description; spatial choreography is unclear (where are the workers? how far is the control panel?). The opera glasses constrain one beat (tracing the glyph) and charge the final image, lifting the score into functional range. Timeframe "margin of daylight" drifts without evolving pressure; the sunrise at the end contradicts the earlier sunset slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. The engines restart through the stone's agency, not the protagonist's choice; she listens and whispers but faces no trade-off or renunciation. "Awkward confidence" is declared to bloom without visible hesitation or cost. The "lull in rebellion" setup promises tension but delivers only a mechanical reactivation loop; no reversal or deepening narrows her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme—cycles, rebirth, patient decoding—emerges through image ("dust into spirals," "hum of an ancient stone circle") but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "meaning was not a fixed destination but a rhythm she could trace." The opera glasses and stone hum recur but carry thematic weight through repetition rather than charging a choice. Subtext is thin; the stargazer's internal arc (solitude to leadership) is told rather than earned through struggle. The ending offers resonance but leans on prompt-language abstractions ("thunderous serenity," "relentless hum") that soften specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Diction veers into elevated register ("thunderous serenity," "paradox," "resonant frequencies") that clashes with barefoot physicality and lacks perceptual signature—what she notices reads generic rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression ("whispered a question," "lifted the opera glasses once more") creates rhythm but also flattens immediacy. No dialogue; voice remains consistent but abstract, without the grit or idiom that would anchor the focalizer's lived experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "hum" and synonyms ("vibrated," "resonant," "pulsed," "chorus") recur across most sentences without pattern-teaching or escalation. Template cadence dominates ("She lifted," "She realized," "She pressed," "She walked") in the final third. Stock metaphors—"secret lens to the cosmos," "key forged from starlight and steel"—muddle figurative logic. Figurative density clogs high-pressure beats (the climax stacks "thunderous serenity," "silent symphony," "rain on a quiet lake"). Loops and register drift disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical tech reboot via ancient stones—is template sci-fantasy without fresh angle; swap "spaceport" for "factory" and the arc holds unchanged. The stargazer's arc (doubt to vow) and the workers' return echo familiar beats. "Awkward confidence" and "thunderous serenity" read as prompt tokens rather than lived particulars. One mildly specific detail—opera glasses as conduit—does not offset the derivative frame. No bold risk or synthesis that grows from prior specifics; the ending moralizes rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; she observes, lifts opera glasses, whispers, traces the glyph, and makes a vow—but none of these beats involve a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The stone and engines act; she witnesses. Late mention of "deliberate, awkward confidence" is asserted, not demonstrated through conflicted action. Ornamental protagonist presence without causal agency or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear early (first paragraph), recur in three beats (focusing on glyph, tracing pattern, catching sunrise), and charge the final image. They become a conduit in the climax, shifting function. However, swappable with any focusing tool (binoculars, lens); no unique property drives a turn. Mid-band score: functional across beats, present at closure, but replaceable and introduced without early signal of stakes-shaping power.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lull in rebellion" frames the setup (engines "mute," "fury paused") and the ending claims a shift ("lull turned into a steady pulse"). Yet the lull never constrains a tactic or forces a choice on the page; it describes backdrop rather than shaping options. The concept is told rather than pressuring the protagonist's actions. Functional mention, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is declared twice (paragraphs 2 and 12) but never embodied in a conflicting on-page action or hesitation with cost. The trait remains a label without visible tradeoff—no fumbled choice, no tension between boldness and doubt. Ornamental attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reignite" anchors the myth (stone circle "could reignite dormant fires"), the protagonist's question ("help her discover meaning"), and the climax (engines "coughing back to life," "rejuvenated engines roared"). The action drives two beats and shapes the ending. However, it is initiated by the stone's hum rather than the protagonist's agency; she asks, the stone answers. Present across setup, middle, and closure; causal role in two beats. Eligible above 6.0 due to all three gates met, but protagonist passivity and replaceability (could be "awaken" or "restart") limit upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stone circle hum is seeded early (myth, paragraph 8; "ancient stone circle buried beneath," paragraph 7) and returns in climax ("stone's hum intersected") and ending ("hum of an ancient stone circle"). It enables the reignition and charges the final vow. However, mechanics remain vague ("low vibration," "traveled through concrete") without specificity that constrains choice. Present in three beats, shapes ending; functional but soft on irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Spaceport repair bay is named early and supplies vivid details (rusted hulls, cracked concrete, control panels, broken doors). It provides the stage but does not pressure choices—characters could execute the same actions in any large ruin. Spatial choreography is unclear (where are consoles relative to crate?). The bay transforms ("sanctuary") in the ending, but the shift is told rather than shown altering tactics. Present, functional backdrop; minimal causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" opens the story ("sun's edge barely kissed") and bookends it ("daylight finally slipped," "first true sunrise"). Yet time does not tighten decisions; the sequence feels untimed, and the sunrise contradicts the earlier sunset. The timeframe decorates rather than constrains; no clock forces a trade-off. Present at setup and closure, but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Discover meaning in the mess" is stated explicitly (paragraph 9) and echoed in the final realization (paragraph 21). The motivation frames her question to the stone and her vow at the end. However, it remains abstract—no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. The desire is told and fulfilled without visible sacrifice. Setup and closure gates met; minimal conflicted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is declared (paragraph 4), repeated (paragraphs 14, 20), and asserted in the final beat. The oxymoron is told rather than modulated through syntax or scene rhythm; the prose maintains a steady lyric pitch without contrast. Tone does not shift with pressure or charge the final image through cadence change. Present across the arc but static and label-reliant.</comment>
