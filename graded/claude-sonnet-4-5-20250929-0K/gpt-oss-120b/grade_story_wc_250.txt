<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The guardian lacks interiority, contradictory impulses, or embodied emotion—it "felt," "understood," and moved with "spiralingly calm precision," but these are labels without psychological texture. No on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the mission completes without struggle or trade-off. The fisherman observes but does not pressure the guardian, leaving the protagonist untested. Motivation remains abstract ("teach darkness the value of stars") and is never dramatized as a conflicted want.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by line two (guardian, cobalt dock, after rain). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (weaving patterns, shutters of water, spiraling outward). However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the guardian begins weaving and completes its task without reversal, complication, or cost. The closure image (dock glowing faintly, guardian turning away) asserts mission success but lacks on-page evidence of a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The final paragraph's "quiet triumph" is told, not earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is vividly established with slick wood, reflective surfaces, and canal geometry. Sensory detail (water shutters, mirrored light, waning moon alignment) is purposeful and atmosphere-driven. The dental mirror functions as a recurring object across beats (raised higher, aligned with moon, lowered at mission's end), constraining the guardian's method. However, no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome—setting enhances mood but does not pressure the guardian's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("teach darkness the value of stars") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the guardian begins weaving and succeeds without opposition, complication, or visible cost. Coincidence does not intrude, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation—the darkness "seemed to pause" and "sensed the weight of stars" without dramatized resistance or friction. The fisherman's gratitude and the night's "quiet triumph" are asserted outcomes, not earned through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (silent empathy, teaching through patience, darkness learning starlight) is legible but arrives through direct statement rather than earned particulars: "Its core concept was silent empathy," "teaching darkness required patience," "darkness had finally tasted starlight." The final image (dock shimmering, night's quiet triumph) offers a lyric answer but lacks the dramatic cost or conflicted choice that would ground abstraction in scene. Epiphanies are declared ("It understood...") rather than discovered through struggle. The fisherman's whispered gratitude feels like thematic echo rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the guardian, with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and abstract ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret") without character-specific rhythm or bias. The fisherman's whispered gratitude introduces a second perspective briefly without head-hopping. Figurative language ("lenses of polished steel," "tapestry of hope," "stitched stars") is poetic but generic, not tied to the guardian's particular way of noticing. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Significant overwriting and scaffold throughout. Paraphrase loops: "silent empathy, a language of listening without words, teaching shadows to listen" restates the same idea; "stillwater tension" appears three times without added meaning. Template cadence runs: "Its eyes were lenses... Its core concept was... Its purpose was..." Stack of abstract metaphors ("tapestry of hope," "shutters of water," "stitched stars," "unseen choir") in close succession without grounding in concrete action. Register drift into lyric elevation clashes with the mechanical "method was simple yet magical" framing. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the guardian's physical task.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (personified guardian teaching darkness through light patterns) leans on familiar allegory—light vs. dark, hope vs. despair—without transformation through specific detail or moral calculus. The dental mirror is a fresh object choice but functions generically as a reflector; any mirror would serve the same plot role. Voice and imagery feel derivative of lyric fable traditions (cathedral shutters, secret fireflies, woven tapestries) without a non-obvious synthesis. The story commits to its premise but does not surprise or complicate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; the guardian weaves, raises the mirror, lowers it, and departs. However, no key choice or turn traces to the guardian's agency—it executes a plan without complication, adaptation, or cost. Observation and ritual dominate; decision-making is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in three beats: "held gently," "raised higher, aligning with the moon," and "lowered" at mission's end. Its reflective property enables the pattern-making method. However, the mirror is functionally interchangeable with any small reflector—its dental specificity does not constrain or shape the guardian's choices. Closure participation is present (lowered at mission complete) but the mirror does not reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is stated as the guardian's "core concept" and echoed thematically ("language of listening without words," "ripple of gratitude"). However, it does not shape on-page tactics or create friction—the guardian never encounters resistance or adjusts its approach based on empathy. The concept remains a thematic label rather than a dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears three times as a descriptor ("moved with spiralingly calm precision," "held its spiralingly calm composure," "spiralingly calm once more"). The trait is told but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost—calm precision would seem to ease the task rather than complicate it. No on-page trade-off emerges from this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weave" frames the guardian's task early ("began to weave a tapestry of hope") and recurs ("continued to weave"). The action organizes the middle beats (creating patterns, shutters opening and closing). However, the weaving is abstract—no failed attempt, mid-course correction, or alternate method tests its necessity. Swappable with "create," "build," or "form" without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with shutters" is stated as the method early ("creating patterns with shutters of water, each ripple a shutter opening"). The mechanics (shutters close, light bounces, constellations form) structure the guardian's work across multiple beats. However, the method is described rather than dramatized—no moment shows the guardian adjusting shutter timing or recovering from a failed pattern. The method could be replaced with "light reflections" or "ripple choreography" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is established early (slick wood, reflective surfaces) and supplies the mirrored medium the guardian uses. Setting recurs in the final image ("cobalt dock glowed faintly," "shimmered one last time"). Water's reflective quality enables the pattern-making method, creating a functional constraint. However, the dock does not alter the guardian's tactics or force a mid-course adjustment—it supports the task without complicating it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears once as ambient phrasing ("Within the edge of a half-spoken secret, it felt the pulse of unseen stars"). The phrase is lyric but does not establish a ticking clock, deadline, or time constraint that shapes the guardian's choices. Time passes (night deepens, dawn approaches) but does not pressure tactics or force urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated as the guardian's purpose early and echoed at closure ("darkness had finally tasted starlight"). The motivation organizes the plot (weaving, pattern-making) but is never dramatized as a conflicted want—no competing desire, doubt, or cost tests the guardian's commitment. The goal is achieved without friction, making it feel declared rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named three times and supported by imagery (silent guardian, pauses between ripples, reverent silence). Tone is consistent and modulates slightly (tension "lingered," then "dissolved into gentle reverie") at closure. The phrase charges the final image of the shimmering dock. However, the tension remains atmospheric rather than psychological—no character's internal pressure matches the environmental mood, limiting integration.</comment>
