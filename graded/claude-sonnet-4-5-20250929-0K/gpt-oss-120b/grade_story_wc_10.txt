<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her survivor identity is established early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract emotional labels ("silence that settled in her chest like a heavy tide") rather than embodied contradiction. The device-building demonstrates competence, yet the final "smile" and seamless emotional resolution feel too smooth—no genuine blind spot or mistake complicates her arc. The closing weeks-later summary tells rather than dramatizes the pilgrimage effect, losing the micro-choices that would prove endurance with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the heat-mapping device and tuning fork build through layered sensory and thematic recurrence toward the final chord. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the conservatory exhales, silence becomes song), and the cost is conceptual—her survival redefined as ongoing witness rather than mere escape. However, orientation is delayed (winterglass conservatory, Mara's survivor status, and the device prototype all land within the first third but without crisp spatial anchors until mid-piece), and the weeks-later coda summarizes pilgrimage rather than dramatizing a final on-page stake shift, softening the cost's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vivid and its humming panes, frost breath, and glass walls supply sensory texture throughout. The tuning fork case and the copper-filament device function as micro-setting objects that constrain Mara's ritual and charge the final image when the fork's tone resonates through glass. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, case, device hovering, glass walls), though the "rose veins" on glass and the visitors at the threshold remain postcard details rather than resources that alter Mara's choices in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and remains coherent. The act of opening the case, activating the device, and releasing the tone constitutes one meaningful deepening that reweights her survivor identity. Yet the escalation is largely internal and atmospheric; no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options with visible cost. The weeks-later summary of pilgrims adds thematic resonance but occurs off-page, and the visitors' pull is told rather than tested, reducing the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—survival as preserving "unshaken marvels" and giving voice to silence—emerges from the heat-mapping device, the fork's tone, and Mara's scars. The final image (conservatory exhaling, silence turned to song) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "a living bridge between loss and wonder" and "the heart can still compose unshaken marvels" edge toward abstract thesis statements in the closing paragraphs, and the prompt label "unshaken marvels" is repeated rather than transformed into fresh idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the opening anchors Mara's survivor body and silk-scarf detail. Perceptual signature is present (calloused hands, pulse of residual heat), yet diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("manifestation of silence made audible," "tapestry of sound") that sits slightly above the embodied survivor voice established early. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The weeks-later summary shifts psychic distance without clear motivation, softening the ending's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but repeated template stems appear: "She had promised herself," "She set," "She placed," "She activated," "She closed," "She realized," "She lifted," "She felt," "She stepped" across the piece. Figurative language is dense in peak beats ("frozen cathedral," "ghostly harp," "lighthouse beam," "tapestry of sound") without clear pattern-teaching or cost, and phrases like "invisible music" and "silently expressive" verge on oxymoron without grounding. The paraphrase loop in the final two paragraphs (pilgrimage restated, conservatory lingering) adds −0.2. Template cadence and figurative density in high-pressure beats trigger −0.6, and the loops add −0.2, totaling roughly −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The heat-mapping device and synesthetic translation (temperature shifts → audible tones) offer a fresh angle, and the winterglass conservatory is a specific setting. However, the core arc—trauma survivor finds healing through artistic/technological ritual—follows a familiar template, and the weeks-later pilgrimage coda is a stock closure gesture. The tuning fork and case are vivid particulars, yet the emotional progression (isolation → device activation → cathartic release → communal hope) does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that resists abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's survivor identity is present throughout and frames her motivation, but her choices (opening the case, activating the device, stepping out) are largely expressive rather than turns that narrow options. The weeks-later summary shows her carrying the song forward, yet that decision is told rather than dramatized with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in the opening (retrieved from the wreck, lined with velvet), is opened to reveal the fork mid-piece, and is gently closed near the end with the metaphor "like a heart that had found its rhythm." Three beats with evolving symbolic charge, though the case itself does not constrain a choice—it is the fork and device that drive the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" appears as a phrase three times (glass ceiling, Mara's endurance, final paragraph), but functions as thematic echo rather than a stake that alters tactics. The concept is told rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" describes the case's velvet interior early and returns in the final case-closing image. The attribute is evocative but does not constrain an action or create a visible trade-off—it remains a descriptive label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rectify" is named in Mara's promise early and implicitly enacted when she activates the device and releases the tone. The action shapes the middle and ending beats, though it could be swapped for "heal" or "restore" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The heat-mapping device is introduced as a prototype Mara built, is described (copper filaments, translates temperature shifts to tones), and is activated in the central beat. It appears in two distinct beats (activation, weeks-later use by pilgrims), but its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized as a constraint that shapes her attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is present from the opening, supplies the glass walls that echo the fork's tone, and is named in the weeks-later pilgrimage. Three beats, and the glass functions as a resonating chamber that charges the final image, though it does not pressure Mara's choices—she would perform the ritual regardless of location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" is introduced mid-paragraph one (the grand clock ceased months ago) and is echoed in the final line. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live constraint; no decision is tightened by the passage of time on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to translate silence into music is Mara's stated promise early, is enacted through the device ritual, and is fulfilled in the final chord and pilgrimage. Three beats with causal linkage, though the motivation is told more than tested—no on-page friction between competing wants complicates the arc.</comment>
