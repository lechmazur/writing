<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Caitlyn's "vigilant" and "precisely humane" traits remain label-only; no on-page contradiction or internal conflict dramatizes cost. Her walk, scan, and reading aloud lack micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The grandfather's teaching and mother's symbol are told backstory without anchoring in present action that changes stance. Townspeople gather as a static audience rather than applying secondary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored within bounds, no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous—photographs accumulate yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with visible cost. Closure unit is unclear: Caitlyn places the label beside the chime and reads a story, but no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost occurs on the page. The townspeople's "weight of truth lift" is asserted, not dramatized. Cost proof test fails: cannot point to an exact sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat. Apply −0.6 in Q2 for missing cost and lens drift, plus Non-closure Accumulation Cap −0.8 for causality thinness across beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting anchors early (ridgeway, reservoir, embankment) with sensory detail (silver ribbon, pine, sapphire hue, lantern glow). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the ridgeway does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard backdrop. The label and chime are handled but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting allowance not met; the 9+ gate (environment/tool/object constrains choice or charges final image) is unfulfilled, capping at 8.8. Sensory selection lacks urgency filter—crisis perception would narrow, but detail density stays uniform.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expunge the myth) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or cost. Caitlyn follows photographs in a linear walk without reversal, tightening, or a choice that forecloses an option. Coincidence supplies all three photos conveniently; her agency is observation, not decision under pressure. No meaningful escalation under any lens—photos arrive, she interprets, townspeople gather, myth dissolves without visible cost. Band guardrails: entering 8.0+ requires a tightening that forecloses a live option; this piece offers none. Apply Non-closure Accumulation Cap −0.8 for static conflict across beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. myth, collective memory) emerges from images (reservoir, label, chime, photographs) but relies on abstract summary: "quiet construction of truth through stories," "shared narrative," "myth into a shared sunrise." The final paragraph states the theme ("true power of expunging falsehoods") rather than letting the image resonate. No earned insight from concrete struggle—Caitlyn's conclusion is told, not dramatized. The sapphire label recurs but does not reweight prior material with cost. Thematic Echo penalty: −0.5 for prompt-like thesis language in closing lines ("her quiet vigilance had turned a myth into a shared sunrise").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Caitlyn with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic (eyes scanning, heart beating with calm certainty) without character-specific bias. Register drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush," "collective memory now reclaimed") that exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Purposeful compression not evident; opacity comes from vague metaphor rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean, but voice lacks distinct texture—could describe any warden in any town.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The midnight ridgeway…stretched…" / "edges a whisper…"; "She carried…a reminder…" / "The label glimmered…its deep blue swirl echoing…"; "Their silence was a mirrored hush…" / "each breath a ripple…". Filter-verb stacks cluster ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") without immediacy. Stock metaphors: "silver ribbon," "mirrored glass," "corridor of light and shadow," "ancient eye." Mixed metaphor: hush settling "like mirrored glass" conflates auditory and visual without coherence. Patterned-artifact penalty: −1.4 for loops, template stems, and stock strings across beats; final third contamination disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8. Synonym churn: "memory" / "remembrance" / "narrative" cycle without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Premise (warden follows photographs to expunge reservoir-town myth) reads as template detective-vindication arc without fresh synthesis. Emotional truth is abstract—townspeople's relief asserted, not embodied. Photographs as clue-trail and sapphire label as motif are genre-standard; no transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation test: swap names/places and arc works unchanged. Proximity check: "ancient eye watching" echoes stock imagery. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 for template plot without personalization or risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Caitlyn (vigilant levee warden) is setup early, present across beats (walks, scans, places label, reads story), and anchors the ending. However, her choices do not create key turns—she observes, interprets, and reports without opposition or cost. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development weak (no constrained choice). Observation without decision trends low per guidance. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + payoff presence +0.4 = ~4.8. Ornamental use (−0.8): key involvement recounted, not dramatized. Late swappability (−0.5): any investigator could follow photos. Limiter: swappability caps upper neighborhood ~3.8; round down to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sapphire-hued liqueur label setup early (first paragraph), reappears at climax (placed beside chime), and ending (pressed into palm). Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. However, static description dominates—label is carried, glimmers, placed, pressed, but never handled under pressure or used to alter tactics. No causal pressure: its properties do not narrow options. Closure linkage weak: cameo in final image does not reweight meaning. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + payoff +0.4 = ~5.4. Ornamental use (−0.8): description without action pressure. Swappability (−0.6): any keepsake could serve. Limiter: ornamental caps ~4.6; round down to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Reservoir town resurfacing is theme/backstory; setup early but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. Caitlyn's goal is to "expunge a lingering myth," not to prevent or manage resurfacing. The concept is echoed in closing metaphor ("water seemed to rise not to flood, but to reveal") but does not change options. Setup gate met; middle and payoff gates missed (no choice constrained, not causally active at ending). Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.4 = ~3.4. Theme-only use (−0.6): concept present as backdrop, not driver. Limiter: missing middle development caps 3.4; round down to 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" appears once in paragraph one ("gait that was precisely humane") as label-only trait. No on-page action constrained or enabled by the attribute; no visible tradeoff. Setup gate met; middle and payoff gates missed. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.3 = ~3.3. Label-only (−0.6): mentioned without dramatization. Summary-only (−0.3): told, not shown in choice. Limiter: missing middle and payoff caps 2.8; apply label deduction; round down to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Expunge (verb: to erase or remove) is Caitlyn's stated goal early. Present across beats (following photos, reading story aloud, lifting "weight of truth"). Payoff: "true power of expunging falsehoods" stated in closing. Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. However, swappability high: "clarify," "vindicate," "reveal" could replace with minor edits. No distinct cost tied to expunging versus other verbs. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + payoff +0.5 = ~4.9. Swappability (−0.7): action not unique. Summary-only (−0.4): resolution recounted, not dramatized. Limiter: swappability caps ~3.8; pressures lift slightly above; round down to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Trail of photographs setup early (paragraph one: "followed a trail of photographs"), used across three beats (first picture lantern, second bottle, third chime), shapes middle attempts, and frames ending (townspeople hold photographs). Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. Mechanics matter: photos supply clues that guide Caitlyn's walk. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +0.8 + payoff +0.5 = ~6.4. Swappability (−0.6): diary entries, interviews, or artifacts could replace photos with minor edits. Resolves problem it did not create (−0.7): photos conveniently appear without prior struggle to obtain them. Limiter: late convenience caps ~5.5; round down to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway at twilight setup in opening line, present across beats (Caitlyn walks embankment, townspeople gather there), and anchors ending. Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. However, postcard description dominates—ridgeway does not pressure choices, supply resources, or alter outcome. Micro-setting not met (no tool or body constraint). Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + payoff +0.4 = ~5.4. Ornamental use (−0.8): description without tactical pressure. Swappability (−0.5): any embankment/path could serve. Limiter: ornamental caps ~4.6; slight lift for spatial coherence; round down to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after a wind chime falls silent" setup early (paragraph one), bookends story (chime tinkles again at end). Two gates (setup, payoff); middle gate weak (no tightened decision by clock). Time does not track or tighten tactics—Caitlyn's walk is leisurely, no urgency. Lyric reprise reweights slightly (silence → sound suggests resolution) but does not impose cost. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + payoff reprise +0.7 = ~4.2. Vague tracking (−0.4): no live clock alters moves. Summary-only (−0.3): timeframe asserted, not dramatized. Limiter: missing middle caps 3.4; lyric reprise lifts slightly above; round down to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning" introduced early (paragraph one: mother "used [lantern symbol] for years to spin stories into shared meaning"). Present across beats (Caitlyn interprets photos, reads story aloud, town feels meaning restored). Payoff: "quiet construction of truth through stories." Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. However, desire is told, not dramatized—no friction between wants and costs, no conflicted choice. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + payoff +0.5 = ~4.9. Told-only (−0.8): motivation asserted without on-page struggle. Summary-only (−0.4): resolution recounted, not enacted. Limiter: told-only caps ~4.2; slight closure linkage lifts; round down to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone "mirrored hush" setup early (paragraph one: "hush that fell after a wind chime…fell silent"), recurs mid-story ("hush settle like mirrored glass"), and charges ending ("Their silence was a mirrored hush"). Three gates met; eligible ≥6.1. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (hush → silence → tinkle suggests resolution). Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three touches +1.4 + closure charge +0.8 = ~5.8. Stock phrasing (−0.4): "mirrored hush" reads as imposed lyric rather than organic voice. Template artifact (−0.3): repeated stems ("hush," "mirror") without added pressure. Limiter: artifact lowers from ~5.8; round down to 5.3.</comment>
