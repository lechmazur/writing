<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract and label-driven throughout: "aesthetically driven," "cloud-shadow poet," "watercolor of doubts and dreams." No contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; the character moves through a sequence of declared states without friction. Motivation is asserted ("to stride through boundaries once thought sacred") but never tests commitment with visible cost or trade-off. The final threshold crossing feels ornamental rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the "ban" and "ancient chant" are never anchored to concrete cause or consequence, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure reads as atmospheric assertion: the poet crosses a threshold and the lake glows, but no before/after change in options or knowledge is legible on the page. Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost—only repetition of the same motifs (hush, hum, tremor) without escalation. Cost proof test fails: no sentence demonstrates a visible, felt, or conceptual price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vivid but remain postcard description without constraining choice. The humming quartz colonnade is mentioned repeatedly yet never supplies a resource or obstacle that alters tactics. The final amber glow contradicts the frozen premise without dramatized cause, breaking internal consistency. Micro-setting gate not met: body, tool, or recurring object does not charge the final image with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the poet recites, pauses, walks, and crosses without encountering resistance or trade-off. The "tremor of certainty" is asserted to settle into rhythm, but this is told escalation without causal trigger. No visible price paid; coincidence (the lake glowing amber, the ban lifting) replaces protagonist agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of boundary-dissolution is stated overtly ("boundaries are meant to be explored," "dissolve the walls between thought and feeling") rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "aesthetically driven testament to freedom" and "rewrote the boundaries of sky" replace scene pressure with thematic summary, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6 for final-paragraph articulation). No resonant, non-literal answer; the ending asserts its own significance without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Diction is elevated and consistent but drifts into poetic abstraction ("breath held in moonlight," "soft fire," "lantern-moth hush") without grounding in the focalizer's lived perception. Free indirect access is stable, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific bias. Register occasionally overreaches: "aesthetically driven," "resonance that is both personal and universal" read like external commentary. No head-hopping, and the voice maintains coherence, keeping the score mid-range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "tremor of certainty" appears five times without evolving meaning; "lantern-moth hush" recurs as static atmosphere. Template cadence runs across multiple sentences: "He [verb], [result]" structures repeat without variation. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "breath held in moonlight," "watercolor of doubts," "ribbons of soft fire," "sugar in tea," "frost on glass"—mixed vehicles without coherent logic. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings (−1.4 in Q7). Artifacts touch closure beats (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—a poet dissolving boundaries after a mystical ban lifts—fits a familiar template of prophetic artist as world-transformer without grounding in specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Turns arise from atmospheric declaration rather than character-specific causality. The frozen-lake-as-soul-mirror and artist-as-liberator tropes are executed without fresh inflection. Derivative Premise adjustment (−0.8) applies: the story does not transform the template through irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet is present throughout but makes no key choices that alter tactics. He recites, pauses, paraphrases, walks—actions without friction or cost. The tremor and boundary-dissolution happen to him rather than through his decisions. Setup gate met (first paragraph), but Development and Payoff gates fail: no middle choice constrained by this identity, and the ending does not hinge on a poet-specific action. Ornamental use (−0.7), no causal pressure, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears in four distinct beats (pauses, responds with color shift, leans forward, sings final chord) and frames the atrium spatially. Setup and Development gates met, but Payoff gate weak: the final "crossing the threshold of the colonnade" is mentioned, yet the poet thanks it in retrospect rather than the colonnade shaping the crossing itself. Functional across beats (+0.9) but swappable with any resonant architectural feature (−0.5). No visible cost tied to the colonnade's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The tremor of certainty is named five times ("feels a tremor," "settle into a rhythm," "steadies into a pulse") but remains label-only. It does not constrain or enable an action; the poet's steps are unchanged whether the tremor is present or not. Setup gate met (first third), but Development and Payoff gates fail: no middle choice hinges on certainty versus doubt, and the ending does not show the cost of certainty. Ornamental recurrence without causal work (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Aesthetically driven is asserted in the opening ("He is aesthetically driven, carving verses") and echoed at closure ("aesthetically driven testament to freedom"), but no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this trait. No visible trade-off between aesthetic priority and another need. Label-only mentions without dramatized cost (−0.6). Setup and weak Payoff gates met (lyric reprise), but Development gate fails.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase appears twice as distinct actions: reshaping the ancient chant (middle) and rewriting a line about clouds into a promise (later middle). Both beats describe the act but do not show the before/after of the verses or their material effect. The lake's boundary begins to dissolve after the second paraphrase, providing weak causal linkage (+0.5). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates met, but swappable with "rewrite" or "reinterpret" (−0.5). Summary-only use (−0.4): the paraphrasing is recounted, not dramatized with the text of the chant.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Through dissolving boundaries is named repeatedly as method ("Through dissolving boundaries, the sound becomes a visible thread"; "boundaries dissolve entirely") but the mechanics are never signaled. The reader does not learn what action or cost enables dissolution. Present in the ending ("boundaries dissolve entirely"), but late arrival as method (first clear mention mid-story) and no Development gate: no middle attempt or failure (−0.6). Ornamental labeling (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by a frozen lake is anchored in the opening and returns at closure ("In the cobalt atrium, the poet's verse hangs…"). Setup and Payoff gates met. The atrium provides spatial frame but does not constrain or supply resources that alter tactics; the poet moves freely without friction from the environment. Functional location but replaceable with any mystical chamber (−0.6). The lake's amber glow at the end is cosmetic rather than a consequence the poet must navigate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>After the ban lifts is mentioned in the opening ("After the ban lifts, the air trembles") but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics. The ban's lifting is complete at story start; no clock or deadline pressures the poet's moves. Setup gate met, but Development and Payoff gates fail: the ending does not reference the ban or its temporal consequence. Vague/untracked time (−0.8). Ornamental framing (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>To stride through boundaries once thought sacred is declared in the opening and echoed at closure ("the poet's motivation… becomes a dance"). Setup and weak Payoff gates met (reprise). Development gate fails: the middle beats do not show friction between this want and a competing need or cost. Told-only (−0.7): the motivation is asserted but never dramatized through a choice that forecloses another path. No visible price tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush appears five times across the story, anchoring tone consistently: opening, middle ("lantern-moth hush deepens"), and closure ("When the lantern-moth hush finally lifts"). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates met. The tone modulates slightly (deepens, lifts) in rhythm with the poet's progression, charging the final image (+0.7). However, "hush" itself is static atmosphere without specificity to moth-lantern imagery—swappable with "twilight hush" or "velvet quiet" (−0.4). Lyric reprise with weak causal linkage keeps score mid-band.</comment>
