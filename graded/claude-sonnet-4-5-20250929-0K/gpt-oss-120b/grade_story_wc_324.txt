<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is labeled "contact tracer for hearts" and "persistently curious," but these traits function as ornament rather than constraint. No genuine interior contradiction appears; the narrator glides through the atrium without facing competing impulses or paying a visible price for curiosity. The final "promise to guard this echo" arrives unearned by prior struggle, reading as declarative rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("weight of incidental heroism") and the entire arc feels like observation rather than embodied decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the reader learns "atrium" and "contact tracer for hearts" but lacks concrete anchoring of who this person is, where exactly they stand, or what immediate stake drives them until deep into the piece. The closure unit—a promise whispered through the hearing aid—lands without visible cost; the protagonist suffers no loss, makes no renunciation, and the final image restores the photograph's colors in a feel-good flourish that undercuts pressure. Causality is weak: the hearing aid "hums," the narrator follows pulses through vaulted corridors, discovers a photograph, hears a voice, finds an alcove, and the light "spills over" to restore colors—each step is convenient escalation without friction or tradeoff. Under any inferred lens (most likely Accumulative/Textural given the lyric diction), the piece needed one meaningful tightening that narrows options or imposes felt cost; instead it offers atmospheric drift and a sentimental resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, marble bench, statues, and ivy-draped alcove are vividly described and tonally coherent. However, the setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental detail pressures a choice or alters the protagonist's tactics. The hearing aid and photograph are handled, but spatial choreography remains vague—"vaulted corridors," "cracked balustrade," and "sealed alcove" are mentioned without clear navigation or cost of access. The micro-setting (body, tool) does not constrain the final moment; the protagonist simply raises the hearing aid and the chord resolves, making the environment ornamental rather than integral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to protect vulnerable voices"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the protagonist follows a signal, finds a photograph, hears a voice, locates an alcove, raises the hearing aid, and the problem resolves itself with cascading light. Agency is absent: the hearing aid "grew steadier," the voice "rose," the light "spilled," and the statues "bowed"—all passive receipt rather than decision or renunciation. Escalation is cosmetic repetition (pulse, whisper, hymn, chord) without a moment where the protagonist faces competing goods or unavoidable harms. No visible price is paid; the final "promise to guard" costs nothing and changes nothing on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "incidental heroism," "protect vulnerable voices," and "curious heart can answer" are announced in prompt-like language rather than distilled from particulars. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic claim ("even when the dead call, a curious heart can answer and protect") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. The photograph's color restoration and the statues bowing their heads are gestural symbolism that shouts rather than resonates. No concrete irony or counter-reading is available; the piece resolves into a simplistic binary of rescue versus oblivion without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("reeling hush," "cartographer of sighs," "filament of memory") that reads as purposeful compression. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fragile beats that survive," "bridge that linked the living and the dead") that blurs rather than sharpens the moment. No dialogue appears; the single-POV interiority is stable, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains mid-range throughout without purposeful modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("I sensed," "I felt") appear but are not intrusive enough to penalize heavily at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "faint pulse" recurs four times, "whisper" and "echo" cycle without variation, and "statues bowed their heads in reverent silence" echoes the earlier "statues of forgotten poets wept marble tears." Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "the [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("beacon for the vulnerable voices," "bridge that linked the living and the dead") reduce specificity. The final third is cluttered with figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, dulling the closure beat. Information density is low; many lines restate the same atmospheric claim without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts who tracks pulses in a hearing aid to rescue a dead singer's voice—is a template blend of urban fantasy and metaphor without transformation. The emotional arc (observation → discovery → promise) is unchanged from countless guardian-of-memory stories. The photograph restoration and bowing statues are stock closure images. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis appears; the piece executes familiar beats (artifact → signal → alcove → light → restoration) without a turn that grows from prior particulars. The "curious heart can answer" resolution is a platitude rather than earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character present and named early; occupational role frames expectation. Appears in all beats but makes no causal decision that alters tactics or outcome; the role is ornamental observation rather than active choice-driver. Swappable with "archivist" or "medium" with minor edits. No specific cost tied to being a contact tracer; label-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Photograph discovered mid-story, handled once, and returns at the end with color restoration. Two beats: discovery and restoration. The restoration is cosmetic reward rather than causal pressure; removing the photograph would not break story logic—any artifact could serve. Setup and payoff present, but development is ornamental description ("smile seemed to hold a secret promise") without altering a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Concept named twice ("incidental heroism") as thematic claim, not dramatized pressure. Does not constrain options or shape tactics; the protagonist's actions would be identical if motivated by duty or empathy. Theme-only, no on-page cost or decision hinging on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Attribute declared ("persistently curious") but not tested. Curiosity leads to following the pulse, but no scene requires the protagonist to risk something or choose curiosity over safety. The trait could be "dedicated" or "attentive" without structural change. Label-only; no visible tradeoff or cost tied to curiosity on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Action appears in the opening premise and final promise. The protagonist "assures" by following a signal and whispering a vow, but the assurance itself is passive receipt of information rather than active protection. Mid-story, the action is subsumed by tracking and discovering; no beat where "assure" shapes a tactic or forecloses an option. Functional but swappable with "rescue" or "preserve."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("tuned a handheld scanner to the hearing aid's faint electromagnetic beats"). Mechanics matter in two beats: initial tracking and final synchronization with the choir's hymn. However, the method is interchangeable with any tracking device; the hearing aid's specific properties (decades-old, circuitry, transmitter) do not constrain or enable a unique tactic. Setup and payoff present, but causal specificity is low; late penalties apply (introduced after first paragraph but not mid-point).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting present throughout with vivid sensory detail (mist, violet twilight, marble statues, ivy). However, the atrium does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. Postcard description rather than tactical constraint. Two gates: setup and ongoing presence, but no development or closure participation where the setting alters the final image or decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Timeframe declared in opening ("when the dead call") and implicit throughout (twilight → deepening twilight). However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the piece could occur over minutes or hours without changing the arc. No live clock or urgency that narrows options. Present as atmospheric frame, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly ("to protect vulnerable voices," "duty—to protect vulnerable voices—compelled me"). Appears in three beats: opening premise, mid-story alcove discovery, and final promise. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or costs. No friction between this want and another need or fear; the protagonist pursues the goal without obstacle or renunciation. Functional presence but no on-page tradeoff or visible price tied to this exact motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tone phrase "reeling hush" appears in opening and closing; lyric diction (mist, whisper, faint, violet) is consistent and modulates slightly as the light "spills" and statues "bow." Coherent through turns but does not intensify under pressure or charge the final image with undeniable cost. The tone remains static mid-range poeticism rather than escalating or breaking pattern. Setup and payoff present via reprise, but the return does not reweight the stake; it restates the mood.</comment>
