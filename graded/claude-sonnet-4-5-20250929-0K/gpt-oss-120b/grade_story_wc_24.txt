<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shepherd's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout ("he realized that clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths"). Motivation is told rather than tested by contradictory impulses; the character observes and philosophizes but makes no costly micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse—"felt it as a heartbeat," "cool air brush his cheek"—and the final walk away lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece gestures at internal complexity without dramatizing it through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly across the opening third, though the pattern eventually coheres (−0.3 applied). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive closure unit with on-page cost; the shepherd "understood" and "placed the mantle clock key back" without altering options or foreclosing a path. The ending dissolves into summary walk-away rather than a final image that reweights prior material. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows stakes; the count-to-zero moment is atmospheric but consequence-free.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fjord, station machinery, and horizon measurement frame are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (metallic scent, water pulse, amber glare). However, these elements remain scenic rather than constraining choice; the hydraulic gears and mantle clock key are described but never alter tactics or charge the final image in a way that makes them indispensable. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting supports tone, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"understand what clocks really measure"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete trade-off or reversal. The counting ritual and hydraulic release occur without opposition, cost, or tightening of options. No visible price is paid; the shepherd simply concludes his inquiry and walks away. The piece describes atmospheric procedure but generates no escalation or agency-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly (clocks measure intervals between breaths, not seconds) but through direct statement rather than embodied particulars: "he realized that clocks measured not time but…" in the penultimate paragraph is overt thematic summary. The mantle clock key and razor-edge gears are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final image—walking toward cliffs—offers no resonant reconfiguration; it restates the theme without dramatizing cost or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric-philosophical register ("a paradox, a point that existed only while the observer kept count"). Perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward elevated diction that occasionally drifts from embodied immediacy ("eminently peculiar," "sediment in the still water"). No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent but does not modulate under pressure; the shepherd's internal texture remains uniform from opening to close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic redundancy: "clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths" is restated multiple times across the final third, and the mantle clock key sequence ("lifted… turning it slowly… placed… back") recycles gestures without propulsion (−0.6 for loops and template cadence). Information density is moderate; many lines elaborate atmosphere without advancing causality. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed ("quiet agreement between machine and nature" follows "razor edges").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hydraulic-clock-shepherd premise and fjord measurement station offer specificity, but the emotional arc—solitary contemplation → realization → departure—follows a familiar lyric-essay template without a non-obvious turn. The "razor edges" and "counting backwards" motifs are present but not transformed through character pressure. The piece commits to its atmospheric concept but resolves into thesis statement rather than synthesis with cost, landing in mid-band for derivative execution of a potentially fresh frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and named early. The shepherd performs the counting ritual and handles the mantle clock key, but makes no decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. He observes, feels, and realizes, then walks away; no turn or cost is tied to his agency. Functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: sewn into pocket (setup), lifted and turned during ritual (middle), placed back with "reminder" reflection (end). The key hums and twitches, adding texture, but never constrains a choice or shifts meaning between appearances. Lyric reprise is present but the cost connection is absent; swapping it for another talisman would leave structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appears twice: gears click on them, and later they seem "less cruel" as metaphor. The concept is described but does not shape stakes, narrow options, or create visible cost. It functions as atmospheric detail and thematic echo, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is a label in the opening paragraph describing the shepherd's purpose to outsiders. It is never dramatized through an on-page action or trade-off; no choice hinges on this trait. Ornamental characterization only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Squinting occurs twice: against the setting sun early, and again when seeking the tide's pause near the end. The action signals the shepherd's focus but does not drive a turn or redefine options. Swappable with "peer," "gaze," or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Counting backwards is signaled early ("through counting backwards from twelve") and enacted in the ritual sequence; the count reaching zero triggers the hydraulic release. However, the mechanics do not create friction or cost; the method succeeds without complication. Present across setup and payoff, functional in two beats, but causally smooth.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is named and described with hydraulic gears, floor tremors, and fjord context. It provides vivid setting but does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome; the shepherd's actions would proceed identically in a generic workshop. Functional backdrop, not pressure instrument.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the opening moment and the echo returns near the end when the station's heart syncs with it. The timeframe establishes sequence but does not tighten decisions; no countdown or urgency shapes tactics. Present in setup and closure reprise but causally inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand what clocks really measure" is stated early and the shepherd pursues it through ritual and reflection. However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost; he completes his inquiry without friction and concludes with an epiphany. Told and pursued, but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" is named and sustained through "silver glass of water," "still water," "gentle sigh," and "water lapping gently." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at the hydraulic release, then returns to quiet at closure, charging the final image with stillness. Present across all three gates and shapes atmospheric pressure, earning mid-upper band.</comment>
