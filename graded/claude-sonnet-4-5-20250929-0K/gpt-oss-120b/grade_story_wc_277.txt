<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is declared ("to discover hidden truths") but never tested by internal contradiction or genuine friction. Her actions follow a smooth, unopposed track—insert pen, decipher code, hand it off—without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The journalist appears as a receiving device rather than a relationship under stress, and the final exchange ("any writer who wishes to intervene…") reads as thematic summary rather than character-specific speech. No visible cost forecloses a path; the "orbits of regret" unwind off-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (sky/stair/observatory/journalist call arrive piecemeal without grounding who/where/when until deep into the opening); apply −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The closure unit—console solves cipher, siren announces accountability, Mira descends—reads as Decisive Change, but the change arrives via deus ex machina (the console accepts the nib and auto-decrypts) rather than protagonist agency. The drive lens appears Causal on its face but linkage is weak: the nib's "lineage of ink" is asserted, not earned through prior dramatization, and the ledger's discovery does not narrow options or foreclose a path with on-page cost. Capping at mid-5s for orientation debt and weak causal cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory's dome, marble stair, and holographic console are vivid and purposeful. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting (handled twice, inserted into console slot), constraining the cipher-solving turn and charging the final handoff. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q3 at 7.0 per the rubric, and the observatory's physical constraints do not materially shape Mira's choices—she moves freely without access, proximity, or environmental friction altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled (expose the ledger/scandal), but escalation is absent: Mira encounters no reversal, trade-off, or tightening choice. The console solves the problem for her; the siren announces success without cost. The journalist's arrival completes the handoff but adds no pressure. Agency is passive observation plus a single insertion action; coincidence (the console recognizing the nib's "lineage") resolves the conflict. No on-page price forecloses a path. Closure form is judged in Q2; here the escalation and cost are missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" and "proof by contradiction" are repeated as labels and thematic echoes but never dramatized as conflicting values or costs. The final image (descending stair, orbits "unwind, one proof at a time") offers conceptual closure but no non-literal answer earned by particulars—it restates the premise rather than reweighting it. The ledger revelation is declared to "lift the orbits" without showing what was sacrificed or what competing good was lost. No Q4 escalation caps thematic resonance at mid-5s per the cross-cap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira. However, perceptual signature is generic: "soft pewter," "floating thought," "solemn playfulness" are literary ornaments not filtered through character-specific priorities. The journalist's dialogue ("He laughed… promised to publish with reverence and wit") converges with the narrator's elevated register. Mira's interior voice uses academic diction ("proof by contradiction," "hypothesis," "false premise") that reads as prompt echo rather than embodied thought under pressure. Orientation debt (Q2) caps Q6 at 7.8, and line-level register drift lowers the score within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoing observatory" / "observatory's dome"; "rosewood pen nib" appears six times with decorative variation but no tightening function; "solemn playfulness" / "solemn yet playful" / "mischievous jest" repeat the same tonal claim. Template cadence runs: "She carried… She recalled… She set… She typed… She felt… She pressed… She descended." Metaphor muddle: "orbits of regret" are simultaneously "looping echoes of decisions," "newspaper front page that never turned," and "lattice of possibilities"—the vehicle shifts without coherent physical logic. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt a grin tug," "felt that the orbits had begun") dull immediacy. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and cap all categories at 8.8 per artifact rules; artifacts appear in the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (heiress uses grandfather's pen to decrypt ledger in sky observatory) reads as template synthesis: mysterious artifact + inherited quest + cipher puzzle. "Proof by contradiction" and "orbits of regret" are prompt labels inserted without transformation. The journalist call, console puzzle, and handoff follow a stock reveal-the-conspiracy arc. No risk-taking or specific lived detail transforms the familiar material. The story could run unchanged with different names/places (transformation test failure).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns: she carries the nib, recalls a classroom, inserts the nib, types a hypothesis—all passive or procedural. The console solves the cipher; the siren announces success. She hands the nib to the journalist in the final beat, but this is transfer, not decision under pressure. Present in setup/middle/ending but swappable; no causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in setup (carried), middle (inserted into console slot to decipher), and ending (handed to journalist with thematic instruction). It enables the cipher-solving turn and returns with reweighted meaning ("any writer who wishes to intervene must first prove…"). However, the mechanics are asserted ("the machine accepted it as if it recognized the lineage of ink") rather than earned, and the nib's unique properties are told, not shown through on-page constraint. Two-gate participation (middle action, closure reprise) plus lyric return reaches mid-5s; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is mentioned three times as thematic label and visual metaphor (holographic chart, "looping echo of a decision left unexamined") but never constrains a choice or alters Mira's tactics. At closure it "unwinds" off-page with no on-page cost. Ornamental theme claim without dramatized pressure; late first appearance (middle third).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is declared in one sentence ("She was devotedly observant, noting how each telescope pipe hummed…") but observation does not enable or constrain an action with cost. Mira's noticing remains passive description. Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Intervene" appears twice: Mira "whispered a promise to intervene in the narrative" (setup), and she tells the journalist "any writer who wishes to intervene in truth must first prove…" (closure). The action is thematic rather than physical; the console intervention is cipher-solving, which could be reframed as "discover" or "reveal" with minor edits. Present in setup and ending but swappable and not causally essential to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is recalled (Mira "recalled the mathematician's classroom"), stated as hypothesis logic ("if the ledger truly existed, then… which contradicted the official story"), and handed off as instruction ("prove that the false premise cannot hold"). The method is explained but not dramatized: the console performs the proof off-page. Functional presence in middle and ending but mechanics do not shape Mira's attempts or constrain her choices. Swappable with "logic puzzle" or "cipher key."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is established in setup (marble stair, glassy dome, central console), used in the middle beat (console as site of cipher-solving), and present at closure (steel dome echoes laughter, Mira descends stair). It provides the stage but does not pressure choices or supply contested resources. The console's acceptance of the nib is the only environmental constraint, but it aids rather than resists. Two-gate setup/ending reprise with middle use reaches low-5s; no tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the journalist calls" anchors the timeframe in setup but the call's content and urgency are vague ("a terse voice… pleading"). No on-page clock tightens decisions; elapsed time is untracked. The siren at closure announces dawn but this is symbolic rather than a deadline that altered Mira's tactics. Setup only, no development or payoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is declared as motivation ("Mira's motivation was simple yet stubborn") and restated at closure ("the truth to be read"). The desire is told but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—no moment where Mira must choose between discovery and another value. Functional setup and thematic closure mention but no friction or trade-off in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is declared twice ("solemn yet playful," "solemn playfulness that made the weight of responsibility feel like a mischievous jest") and demonstrated in one gesture ("Mira felt a grin tug at her lips"). The journalist's laugh at closure ("a sound that echoed… with solemn playfulness") attempts reprise but reads as echo rather than tonal charge. Static label-plus-gesture rather than modulation under pressure; no tonal shift at the turn.</comment>
