<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is characterized entirely through exposition and summary rather than embodied action under pressure. Her "balancedly curious" temperament is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page. The piece offers no moment where she struggles, makes a mistake rooted in her limits, or pays a personal cost—only passive observation and abstract plotting. Internal experience remains at the level of assertion ("she felt," "she imagined") without bodily specificity or self-contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure event occurs on the page; the test vessel's success is narrated in summary, the celebration happens off-stage, and Mira's final gesture (placing the chain link back) is purely symbolic ritual without stakes or cost. The piece reads as a world-building summary spanning many nights and curriculum changes rather than a single scene with a meaningful tightening. Causality is loose—edge geometry and the alien lattice enable navigation but through explanation rather than dramatized problem-solving. Orientation is provided but the narrative remains in expository mode throughout, never coalescing into a present-tense dramatic unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The benthic setting is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, pressure-hardened basalt, glass corridors, and coral arches—specific, coherent details that establish atmosphere. However, setting remains decorative; no environmental constraint forces a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (Mira stands, walks, traces constellations) and the test vessel's movement is told rather than shown with tactile proximity. The anchor chain link appears as a symbolic object but is never handled in a way that constrains action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is declared but never tested through on-page opposition or reversal. The test vessel "slipped silently" to success without complication, cost, or agency from Mira; she records data after the fact. No pressure escalates, no choice narrows options, and no meaningful trade-off appears. The entire arc is summarized as a smooth trajectory from problem to solution, with Mira as passive observer rather than active decider.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Thematic material about depth/sky tension, tradition/progress, and curiosity is stated directly rather than emerging from scene particulars. The chain link is positioned as a symbol through explicit narratorial assertion ("more than a relic; it represented…") rather than charged use. The ending whispers a "somber promise" and offers an on-the-nose thematic explanation to students in place of earned resonance. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece lectures rather than dramatizes its concepts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice maintains stable distance and uses some specific vocabulary (benthic, lattice, edge geometry), but diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated register ("mournful blue," "somber marvel," "collective sigh of somber marvel") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Sentence structure is rhythmically uniform with many long, clause-stacked lines. The single line of quoted dialogue ("how a simple chain link could hold the key…") and the "whispered" promise both read as thematic summary rather than natural speech or interior thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "balancedly curious" appears twice as a label, "somber" and "marvel" recur in fixed pairings without variation, and "expand/expanding/unfolded horizons" cycles through multiple paragraphs without added specificity. Template cadence runs appear ("She felt… She imagined… She whispered…"). Filter verbs ("felt," "imagined," "noting how") stack in reflective passages. Metaphoric density ("the pull of the anchor link echoing in her chest," "alien light braided with distant suns") clusters without clear vehicle logic, and "mournful" is applied to both lanterns and precision in contradictory ways. The cumulative effect dulls momentum and obscures the stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The benthic-city setting and alien-lattice navigation offer surface novelty, but the emotional and plot arc follows a template: instructor observes problem, applies new method, witnesses successful test, renews commitment. No twist, complication, or character-specific inflection transforms the premise. Mira's "balancedly curious" temperament and the chain-link symbolism feel like prompt-driven ornament rather than organic discovery. The piece reads as a competent response to a detailed brief without fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. She observes, records data, and explains—roles that could belong to any instructor. The test vessel's success happens independent of her agency; she does not choose to launch it, troubleshoot failure, or confront opposition. Her final act (placing the chain link back) is ritual gesture without cost or consequence. Setup is clear, middle development absent, closure participation ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The boat anchor chain link appears in three locations (statue in central square, mentioned in data recording as affecting center of mass, returned to statue at end) but is never handled or used to constrain a choice. Its "weight shifted the center of mass" is told in summary rather than dramatized during a navigation attempt. The reprise at the end reiterates symbolic meaning ("connection between surface and abyss") without reweighting prior material or charging the closure. Setup present, middle development summary-only, closure participation ornamental; cap at 4.6 for lack of causal middle work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" recurs as metaphor and aspiration but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. The phrase is declared, imagined, and restated ("no longer a distant promise but a reachable map") without altering Mira's options or forcing a trade-off. It functions as thematic label rather than active stake. Setup present as conceptual frame, middle and closure participation thematic echo only; swappable with "new frontiers" or similar abstractions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is asserted twice as a label ("She was balancedly curious," "scholars, balancedly curious like Mira") but never dramatized through a choice where caution and wonder conflict with visible cost. No scene shows Mira weighing risk against discovery or paying a price for her temperament. The trait exists as exposition without action. Setup label-only, no middle or closure participation; cap at 2.8 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Expand" appears repeatedly in gerund and verb forms (expanding horizons, expand curricula, keep expanding) but the action itself is abstract and diffuse—curriculum changes, plotting lattices, vessel reach—all summarized rather than dramatized. No single moment of expansion drives a key turn or alters Mira's stance. The concept is thematic gloss on background events. Setup present as repeated motif, middle and closure participation ornamental; swappable with "grow" or "advance."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Edge geometry is named as the navigation method Mira adopts, mentioned in one paragraph as treating photons as nodes, but never shown in use during a choice or problem-solving beat. Its mechanics remain opaque; we learn it "rewritten the mathematics" but not how it constrains or enables tactics. The test vessel's success is attributed to it in summary. Setup present as assertion, middle development absent, closure participation summary credit only; cap at 3.4 for missing middle gate and apply −0.2 for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The benthic city is established early with vivid detail (glass corridors, basalt, bioluminescent algae, coral arches, observation deck) and recurs across beats. However, setting remains backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature forces a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The "corridors of light" and sonar arrays are mentioned as enabling navigation but not dramatized as obstacles or tools under pressure. Setup strong, middle beats descriptive, closure participation ornamental (the city's lights "shone a little brighter").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is established as backstory context but does not function as a clock or tighten decisions. The narrative spans "night after night" and "each night" in iterative summary rather than focusing on a single urgent window. Discovery has already occurred; the piece chronicles gradual implementation without time pressure. Setup present as context, middle development absent, closure participation thematic only (alien glyphs on the chain link); cap at 4.6 for missing middle, apply −0.5 for vague tracking, and apply −0.5 for late summary-only closure touch.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to learn to navigate by starlight" is stated early and recurs as aspiration, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She does not struggle, sacrifice, or choose between starlight navigation and another value. The test vessel achieves the goal in her presence without her making a pivotal decision. Setup present as declaration, middle development told rather than shown (she "plotted" and "recorded"), closure participation ritual gesture. Functional but no friction; cap at 4.6 for missing middle drama and apply +0.1 for setup clarity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is invoked explicitly ("mournful blue," "somber marvel," "somber promise") and the tone remains consistently elegiac and quietly celebratory throughout. Diction supports the register (flickering, dim glow, whispered, exhaled), and the final image sustains the mood. However, tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—every beat carries the same affective temperature—and the explicit labeling ("somber marvel") risks announcing rather than embodying the effect. Setup and closure participation clear, middle coherent but static; one purposeful tonal layer without dynamic range.</comment>
