<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Selene remains abstract throughout—her "elusive eel herder" label never translates into embodied action or occupational detail that shapes a choice. The precognitive curse is declared but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; it functions as exposition rather than lived constraint. The final "smile" and trust in the future she "could now help shape" reads as convenience resolution without visible cost or trade-off. Interiority consists largely of thematic summary ("she believed the dust held the key") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives piecemeal—"elusive eel herder" and "after the world's last friction disappears" are abstract labels rather than concrete anchors for who, where, and when by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—placing the final red stone and igniting the violet flame—occurs on the page, but the before/after change in options or stance is unclear: Selene "knew" the patterns would unfold, yet no path is visibly foreclosed or transformed with felt cost. The narrative asserts transformation ("curse turned into a compass") without dramatizing the reversal through a concrete decision or renunciation that narrows live options. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (pattern-building with painted rocks) and Causal (the dust ignition), then dissolves into thematic summary in the final third, failing the lens-clarity check at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, basalt, aurora, and tide pools are named repeatedly but remain postcard elements—none constrains a tactical choice or alters the rock-placement sequence. The painted rocks function as props rather than tools whose properties matter; their "Fibonacci spiral" and "perfect ratios" are asserted but never shown to affect Selene's method or outcome. Spatial choreography is vague: we never learn how far apart the rocks are placed, whether the tide threatens the sequence, or how Selene navigates the ledge under aurora light. The aurora appears in nearly every paragraph as atmospheric decoration without pressing a decision or charging the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand sacred patterns"—is declared early but never tested by a live obstacle or cost. Selene places rocks in sequence, the dust ignites, the tide pauses, and the patterns "unfold in countless tides" without any reversal, complication, or trade-off. The precognitive curse is framed as potential trap ("feared the visions would trap her") but immediately dissolves: "her motivation to understand sacred patterns outweighed the terror," a tell-only assertion that skips the conflict. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options; the flame spreads "downstream" without resistance, and the story closes on assurance ("knowing she had turned a lingering promise into a living map") rather than a visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "lingering promise" recurs as a thematic label in nearly every paragraph without accruing specific meaning from events—it names the theme rather than emerging from concrete turns. The final paragraph states the moral explicitly: "the eel herder's lingering promise became a beacon, a borrowed dawn for all who seek the sacred patterns of the sea," a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with summary (−0.6). The painted rocks and Fibonacci spiral gesture toward "order from chaos," but the insight is asserted ("the universe's patterns were not fixed, but could be coaxed by intentional design") rather than earned through struggle or ambiguity. No counter-reading or genuine cost complicates the tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—Selene's way of noticing (aurora, salt, ancient fire, mist) could belong to any lyrical observer and carries no character-particular bias or occupational filter from an "eel herder." Diction drifts into elevated register ("precognitively cursed," "sacred patterns," "harmonic of the sea") that sits uneasily with the ostensible folk role and is never grounded in her idiom or profession. The prose shows purposeful compression and lyric patterning, but the pattern does not tighten or shift cadence under pressure; instead, it sustains a single meditative tone from opening to close without modulation for escalation or cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "lingering promise" appears nine times with minimal variation, often in adjacent sentences ("the lingering promise became clear" / "She felt a new promise stir" / "turned a lingering promise into a living map"). Template cadence runs for three+ sentences: "She knew… / She turned… / She felt…" without syntactic variety. Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "violet ribbons," "silence settled like frost," "mist that caught the waning aurora." Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("She feared," "she believed," "She knew," "She felt") dull immediacy (−0.5 for stack, plus loop penalties totaling −1.2 in Q7; final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8). Informational density is low—many sentences restate mood or theme without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—precognitive character arranges symbolic objects under aurora to reshape fate—combines familiar template elements (cursed seer, mystical alignment ritual, cosmic dust) without a fresh synthesis. The "elusive eel herder" label promises occupational specificity but never delivers unique detail or lived idiom; it reads as quirky ornament rather than integrated role. The Fibonacci/mathematical-rock method is gestured at but not dramatized with specific mechanics or constraint, making it swappable with any ritual sequence. The story opts for safe lyricism over bold risk: no reversal, no cost, no unexpected turn that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Selene is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She places rocks in sequence as planned; no obstacle forces adaptation. Her label "elusive eel herder" never informs action—no herding, no eels, no occupational detail. Setup gate met (intro), middle gate weak (no constraining choice), closure gate weak (she "rose" and "turned toward the sea" without a decisive act tied to her role). Swappable with any mystic figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust appears in paragraph two, is described in three beats (settling, drifting between rocks, igniting), and participates in the closure flame. Setup, middle, and closure gates all met. However, its use is passive—Selene does not handle or manipulate it; it simply "drifts" and "ignites" on cue. No visible cost or constraint tied to the dust's properties; the dust could be replaced with "mystic powder" with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental middle use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A lingering promise" is named in the opening paragraph and recurs in nearly every subsequent paragraph, but it functions as thematic label rather than stake or constraint. It does not shape Selene's choices (she places rocks as planned) or tactics (no trade-off between promise-keeping and another goal). The concept appears in the closure image ("turned a lingering promise into a living map") but as summary rather than causal pivot. Setup gate met, middle gate weak (no choice pressure), closure gate weak (label-only). Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental throughout −0.8, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The precognitive curse is introduced in paragraph five, described as "feared the visions would trap her," but immediately resolved by assertion: "her motivation to understand sacred patterns outweighed the terror." It does not constrain or enable any on-page action—no scene shows her seeing a future, no choice hinges on the foresight. The final paragraph claims the curse "turned into a compass," but this is told summary, not dramatized tradeoff. Setup gate weak (late, paragraph five), middle gate missing (no constraining choice), closure gate missing (summary-only). Late intro −0.4, ornamental −0.6, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Harness" is named as Selene's purpose in paragraph three, demonstrated through the rock-placement sequence (middle), and completed in the ignition/flame-seeding closure. Setup, middle, closure gates all met. However, the harnessing unfolds without obstacle or adaptation—she places rocks, they work as intended, the flame spreads. No visible cost or failed attempt shapes the method. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.5, but low specificity (no unique mechanics shown) −0.4, no cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The painted-rocks method is signaled in paragraph seven, demonstrated on-page in three beats (placing, settling, igniting), and central to the closure flame-trace. Setup, middle, closure gates met. The "mathematical sequences" and "Fibonacci spiral" are named but not shown—we never see Selene count, measure, or adapt spacing. The method succeeds on first attempt without friction. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but mechanics vague (swappable with "ritual arrangement") −0.6, no cost −0.5, summary-only math −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora are named in the opening line and recur in every major beat, providing visual atmosphere. Setup gate met. However, the setting does not constrain Selene's choices—the tide "pauses" on cue, the aurora provides light without complication, the basalt ledge poses no spatial challenge. Middle gate weak (no pressure from environment), closure gate weak (aurora and tide are backdrop, not active elements). Early signal +0.6, closure presence +0.3, but ornamental throughout −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the world's last friction disappears" is named in the opening but functions as abstract premise rather than time constraint. No clock tightens Selene's sequence; the tide "rose" and later "resumed" without urgency. The timeframe does not alter tactics or force trade-offs. Setup gate weak (premise-only, no live clock), middle gate missing (no time pressure), closure gate missing (no deadline met or missed). Ornamental premise −0.8, no time constraint −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To understand sacred patterns" is stated as motivation in paragraph five and recurs in final-paragraph summary, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Selene's desire does not collide with another need (safety, rest, doubt); the motivation is asserted and fulfilled without friction. Setup gate met, middle gate weak (no conflicted choice), closure gate weak (told fulfillment, no trade-off). Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3, but told-only throughout −0.7, no friction −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" appears in the opening paragraph, recurs in four later paragraphs, and anchors the final image ("a borrowed dawn for all who seek the sacred patterns"). Setup and closure gates met. However, tone remains uniformly meditative and elevated from first line to last—no modulation under pressure, no cadence shift at escalation or closure. The borrowed-dawn image reappears but does not reweight meaning; it functions as consistent mood label. Early signal +0.6, closure reprise +0.7, but static mood throughout −0.8, no tonal shift −0.4.</comment>
