<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arin remains abstract throughout—"logical dreamer" and "lucidly watchful" are asserted labels never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The council and artisans function as chorus rather than individuated presences; no relationship friction exists. Interiority consists of declarative summaries ("knowing that revitalize the community's faith required…") rather than embodied perception, and the final "breakthrough" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but causality remains decorative—balloons rise, the gauge flickers, equations "align," all without because/therefore linkage or motivated choice. The closure declares success ("the gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror") via exposition rather than on-page change; no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. Drive lens reads as intended-Causal but executes as vague Accumulative without a clear deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered (sea-foam, stone columns, reflected light kaleidoscope) and furnishes the investigation frame, but the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters Arin's approach. Spatial choreography remains clear; sensory detail is present but inert. The grotto charges the final festival image thematically yet does not shape the closure moment with material pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring communal hope via the altitude gauge mystery—is signaled early but never tightened through reversal or forced trade-off. Trials proceed smoothly: balloons rise, the needle traces arcs, equations "finally align" at zero without prior failure or visible cost. Agency is notional; Arin observes and records rather than deciding under pressure. No on-page escalation or deepening forecloses a path, leaving conflict abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (hope as collective measurement, equations woven into community) emerges through image and motif—balloons, decorative patterns, the gauge-as-mirror metaphor—rather than overt statement, which elevates the score. However, the final declarations ("the gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror," "the mathematics of hope were etched into the world itself") lean toward thesis summary. Recurrence (balloons, spirals, decorations) is purposeful but does not constrain choice; the ending offers conceptual resonance without the non-literal inflection or ambiguity that would push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance floats into summarizing overview ("he proposed a festival…," "the community's spirit…began to revitalize"). Diction is lyric-elevated throughout, with phrases like "serene upheaval" and "luminous sphere woven from pearl-white kelp" dominating even practical beats, creating register monotony rather than modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Arin's mathematician lens never filters perception distinctively. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative layering in nearly every sentence ("sea-foam draped stone columns," "kaleidoscope of potential," "living ledger") blurs momentum and creates texture-for-texture's-sake rather than propulsion (deduction ~−0.6 for density without pattern payoff). Paraphrase loops appear: "required more than a single ascent; it required a chorus" and "demanded trial balloons…a chorus of daring experiments" restate the same idea. Template cadence runs: multiple sentences open with participial phrases across the first third. Pronoun reference for "they" (council vs. artisans) briefly wobbles mid-passage. Line-level clarity suffers under ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—altitude gauge reflects communal hope, trial balloons encode equations—offers mild conceptual novelty, yet the execution leans on stock fantasy-symbolism tropes (ancient instrument, mystical resonance, festival climax). Emotional and plot beats are predictable: mystery → experiments → alignment → declaration → festival. No turn or cost surprises; the gauge mystery resolves exactly as the opening implies. Specificity (tide-polished grotto, kelp balloons, decorative patterns) adds texture but does not transform the template into a singular stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arin appears in every beat and frames the investigation, but his "logical dreamer" trait manifests only as label; no on-page choice turns the plot. He gathers artisans, records movements, declares insights—all observation and summary. The closure festival is proposed rather than decided under pressure. Setup and closure presence are met, but middle development shows no choice that narrows options or imposes cost, capping score near functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The altitude gauge anchors the mystery (setup), is tested with trial balloons mid-story (development), and reaches "perfect zero" at the climax, then is reinterpreted as mirror (closure participation). Three-gate presence and causal involvement across beats elevate the score. However, the gauge's mechanics remain vague—"responds to ebb of hope," "needle tracing arc"—without specific constraint that shapes Arin's tactics; swapping for another mystical instrument would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" shapes stakes (testing unseen currents of belief), drives middle experimentation (miniature balloons with equations released into chambers), and anchors the closure festival proposal. The concept is present across all three gates and integral to plot progression. Cost linkage is weak—no balloon fails or forces a tactical shift—and the metaphorical layer (testing hypotheses of hope) blends with literal action, reducing specificity slightly. Still, removing the element would collapse the narrative spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears as label ("Arin, ever lucidly watchful," "Arin, lucidly watchful, noted the subtle shift") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait does not differentiate his perception or force a trade-off under pressure. Setup is present; development and payoff are absent. Ornamental use and swappability (replace with "keenly observant" or similar) cap the score in the low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is Arin's explicit goal from the outset ("revitalize the community's faith"), drives the trial-balloon method, and culminates in the festival plan to "revitalize the city beyond the grotto" and the villagers' decorating "forgotten pathways." Present across all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage. Specificity is moderate—swapping for "restore" or "renew" would not break logic—and visible cost is absent (revitalization proceeds smoothly), preventing entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Decorative patterns appear early (artisans "specialized in creating patterns with decorations") and shape the trial method ("each filament…designed to echo the mathematical spirals"). The gauge's needle responds to "the rhythmic pattern of the artisans' decorations," and the final festival features "new decorative patterns that would encode fresh equations." Three-gate presence and causal role in mid-story escalation and closure participate. Mechanics remain abstract—how patterns encode equations is never shown—and no cost or constraint tied to decoration quality affects outcome, capping near essential-across-beats threshold.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The grotto frames the investigation, supplies "cavernous chambers" for balloon tests (middle use), and becomes "a portal through which parallel timelines converged" at closure. Setup, development, and payoff are present. However, the setting never constrains Arin's choices—chambers are simply available—and spatial properties (columns, water echo) add atmosphere without altering tactics. Removing the grotto in favor of another atmospheric space would require only cosmetic edits, placing the score in the shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Parallel timelines" are invoked thematically ("across parallel timelines…different equations yielded distinct altitudes," "portal through which parallel timelines converged") but never dramatized as a constraint or choice mechanism. Setup is vague (mentioned mid-story), no middle development, and closure participation is metaphorical rather than causal. The element reads as conceptual ornament; the plot would function unchanged without it. Swappability is high, and late introduction (~midpoint) further limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Arin's goal "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early ("Guided by his purpose…") and motivates the trial-balloon experiments. Setup and development are present. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices, and no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost appears. The final paragraph summary restates the goal without showing it tested under pressure. Closure participation is present but passive (he "noted the subtle shift"), limiting the score to functional-but-not-essential range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is asserted twice ("The serene upheaval of colors…," "Arin felt the serene upheaval settle") and the tonal pairing (tranquility + disruption) colors the entire narrative via elevated lyricism and lack of genuine conflict. However, tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure, and the oxymoron functions as label rather than embodied tension. Setup and thematic presence are clear; middle development and cost-driven closure charge are absent. The tone does not shift to intensify stakes, capping the score below the causal-role threshold.</comment>
