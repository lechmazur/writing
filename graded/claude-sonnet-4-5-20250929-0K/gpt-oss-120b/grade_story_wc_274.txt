<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is declared but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "bravely conflicted" label appears repeatedly without dramatized internal friction that would force micro-choices with visible cost. The final stance—watching the conversation unfold—feels passive; the action (inserting the letter) happens early, and afterward she becomes an observer rather than an agent facing new trade-offs. Embodied emotion is sparse; phrases like "the brave conflict within her burned brighter" summarize rather than show contradictory pulls in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece attempts a Situational/Accumulative hybrid: Maren's letter ignites dormant networks, the council convenes, archivists awaken. Orientation (who, where, when) is established within the first ~100 words. The closure image—green shoots through marble, testament to brave scandal—reads as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (the council is scandalized, peace threatened). However, the cost remains abstract and off-page; we see no tactical sacrifice or foreclosed path for Maren herself after the letter is sent. One meaningful tightening occurs (letter ignites → networks wake → council convenes), but the escalation is narrated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "echoing library under snow" is vivid and recurs across beats: frozen vellum, marble conduit, ice-bound masks, snowflakes on open pages, green shoots through marble. The setting supplies the conduit (a tool) that Maren uses to send the letter, and the final image charges with the thawing metaphor. However, the environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; it functions more as atmospheric container than spatial crucible. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, but the library's physicality rarely pressures Maren's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—provoking dissent versus preserving fragile peace—is signaled early. One tightening: inserting the letter → networks ripple → council convenes. Yet Maren's agency ends after the insertion; the story narrates consequences rather than forcing her into new trade-offs. No reversals or deepening choices follow; the escalation is told ("scandal would echo," "archivists awakened") without on-page resistance or a second decision under greater pressure. The cost (her own "frozen preservation") is mentioned but never materializes as a felt price; she smiles at the end without visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—the power of brave dissent to crack frozen silence—emerges through recurring images (ice, frost, echoing quiet, green shoots). The final paragraph synthesizes these motifs into a testament without stating a moral. However, the resolution feels too tidy: dissent succeeds without on-page cost, the council convenes without counteraction, and hope arrives as green shoots in a symbolic flourish. The piece resists overt sermonizing but delivers a thematic echo in the final line ("scandalize the silent world into speaking") that borders on thesis statement. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is directly narrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vellum rose like skeletal trees," "contraband truths spread like frost on glass"), creating a lyric texture. However, the prose leans on repeated constructions: "dangerous liaison letter" appears five times, "dormant networks" six times, "bravely conflicted" twice, "echoing library under snow" four times, creating a template cadence that flattens momentum. Perceptual signature is generic; Maren's way of noticing does not feel character-specific. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt the tremor," "knew the letter had arrived") appear but do not muddle immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "contraband truth"/"contraband truths," "dormant networks" (six mentions), "dangerous liaison letter" (five mentions), "bravely conflicted" (twice), "echoing library under snow" (four times). These loops create synonym churn and template cadence that dull propulsion. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "breath forming a brief mist that vanished as quickly as the past she guarded" strains logic (breath doesn't vanish "as" the past; the metaphor conflates immediacy with permanence). Sentence openings vary, but information density is low in the second half, where consequences are summarized rather than dramatized. The final third recycles "echoing library under snow" and "dormant networks" without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—cryogenic archive, forbidden letter igniting dissent—offers a fresh blend of sci-fi and political thriller. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: lone rebel risks all to spark revolution, symbolic letter spreads truth, hope emerges as literal green shoots. The "bravely conflicted" label and the tidy success (no real counteraction, Maren smiles at the end) flatten risk. Phrase-level echoes of epic-resistance templates ("provoke an unspoken conversation," "scandalize the silent world into speaking") reduce originality. The transformation test fails: swap "cryogenic archivist" for "underground printer" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Maren (cryogenic archivist) is present throughout and makes one key decision: inserting the letter. This choice drives the central turn (networks ignite). After that, she observes consequences without further agency. She appears in the closure image (watching snowflakes, feeling weight lessen) but does not make a second decision that alters tactics. Two beats: insertion and final observation. Causal pressure is moderate; her role is essential but not irreplaceable (any archivist with access could insert the letter). Early signal, middle involvement, closure presence, but limited decision-making after the inciting act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "dangerous liaison letter" is handled in the insertion beat, recurs when it lies on the council podium, and is embedded in new treatises at the end. Three distinct beats, early signal, closure linkage. However, its specific properties (the encrypted sigil, the warm ink) do not constrain tactics or evolve in meaning; it functions as a generic contraband object. The letter enables the central turn but could be swapped for any forbidden document without altering the arc. Cost connection is implied (Maren risks preservation) but not dramatized. Swappability and ornamental ink-description lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" is the core concept, shaping the dominant stake (spread forbidden knowledge versus preserve peace). It drives the insertion, network ripple, and council convene sequence. Present in the final paragraph ("whispered the contraband truths aloud"). Early signal, middle involvement, closure mention. However, the concept is abstract; specific truths are never dramatized, so it reads as theme-claim rather than on-page pressure. Causal pressure is moderate: the concept frames the conflict but does not narrow options in a second beat. Closure linkage is present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears as a label in two sentences ("bravely conflicted," "brave conflict within her") but is not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No on-page moment shows Maren torn between competing goods with visible cost. The trait is told, not shown. Late first explicit use (second paragraph) and no middle development where the conflict constrains a choice. Closure: she "watched...bravely conflicted yet resolute," again a label. Ornamental use without action pressure. Missing middle development caps at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Scandalize" is the action: the letter's encrypted sigil "ignites," sending a ripple that scandalizes the council. The word appears three times, anchoring the central turn (networks wake, council convenes, archivists whisper). Early signal (first paragraph mentions "scandalize the entire polity"), middle involvement (the tremor and council convene), closure presence (final paragraph: "scandalize the silent world"). The action drives escalation but is abstract; no specific council member resists or acts. Causal pressure is solid. Cost connection is implied (Maren risks preservation) but not dramatized. Swappability is low; the action is integral.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through dormant networks" is the method, signaled early ("dormant networks that had lain silent for centuries"). The letter travels via the marble conduit into the networks, reaching "archivists in distant citadels." The method appears in six beats (setup, insertion, ripple, spread, renewed purpose, final paragraph). However, the mechanics are vague; we never see how the networks function or constrain tactics. The method is told rather than shown in action. Early signal, middle involvement (the ripple), closure mention ("dormant networks now humming"). Causal pressure is low; the method is a convenient conduit without friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "echoing library under snow" is named in the opening line and recurs in four beats (opening, mid-scene "quiet grew louder," final testament, last paragraph). The marble conduit (part of the library) is used to send the letter, and the snow outside melts to reveal green shoots in the closure image. Early signal, middle involvement (the conduit enables the insertion), closure charge (green shoots, "library under snow became a testament"). The setting supplies a tool and charges the final image, but does not constrain a mid-scene choice. Spatial choreography is generic. Causal pressure is moderate; the setting shapes atmosphere more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" appears once, in the paragraph where the letter ignites. The timeframe is metaphorical and does not constrain decisions or tactics; the story spans multiple beats (insertion → ripple → council convenes → archivists send letters) that cannot occur within a blink. The phrase is ornamental, not a live clock. No middle development where time pressure alters a choice. No closure presence. Missing setup, middle, and closure gates. Late first appearance (second paragraph), ornamental use, swappable with "instantly" or "in a moment." Cap: missing closure participation → 2.8; ornamental use → −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To provoke an unspoken conversation" is Maren's stated motivation, signaled in the first paragraph. The insertion dramatizes this desire. The unspoken conversation materializes (archivists whisper, council convenes, open dialogue emerges). Early signal, middle involvement (the letter ignites the conversation), closure presence (final paragraph: "unspoken conversation unfolded into the world"). However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted; no friction between the want and a competing cost is dramatized. Maren does not face a mid-scene trade-off testing her commitment. Told-only friction lowers the score. Causal pressure is moderate; the motivation frames the action but does not drive a second choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" is signaled early ("quiet in the library became dizzying") and recurs in "the quiet grew louder," "dizzying quiet," and "stillness that followed." The tone is coherent across beats: oxymoronic quiet that intensifies pressure. It modulates with the ripple (quiet becomes "louder," then "thunderous echo of potential rebellion") and resolves in "stillness that followed" after the council convenes. Early signal, middle development (tone shift as networks wake), closure presence (stillness, green shoots). The tone charges the final image by framing the paradox (quiet as revolt). However, the tone is occasionally overstated ("dizzying quiet" feels label-like). Causal pressure is solid; the tone reflects and shapes the accumulative design.</comment>
