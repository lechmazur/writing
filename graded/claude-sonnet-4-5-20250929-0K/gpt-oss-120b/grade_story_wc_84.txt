<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is nearly absent—she registers "thrill" and "perpetually surprised joy" in label-only fashion without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The pilgrim remains a cipher, present only to murmur verses and smile. Internal conflict is non-existent; every action flows smoothly toward the predetermined harmonious outcome without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "vow to guard the chip" arrives unearned, a declaration rather than a choice forced by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—"brilliant dimness," "frequency of belonging," and "star trails" accumulate as atmospheric tokens without narrowing options or reweighting stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; Lira follows the trails, presses the lever, and the chip hums to life in a frictionless sequence devoid of reversal or cost. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "after the pilgrim arrives" creates temporal fog—no clear present action frame emerges until well past that mark (−0.4). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "decoded song of belonging" but the cost is conceptual assertion only, never felt or demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory supplies vivid atmospheric detail—"stone arches," "marble floor," "vaulted chamber"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The star trails etched in marble guide Lira's path, yet their mechanics remain decorative; she could follow any map with identical ease. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the drone's role (hovering "over the chip" when she presses a lever "beside" the pedestal) creates minor positional confusion. The setting never pressures a choice or alters tactics, capping the micro-setting test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—"decode the frequency of belonging"—remains abstract throughout; no live on-page cost or tradeoff shapes Lira's actions. She follows trails, presses a lever, and achieves total success without complication, refusal, or price. The pilgrim's prior work has already "unlocked the observatory's dormant memory," leaving Lira with an execution task rather than a conflict-driven choice. No tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs; pressure is declared ("thicker with brilliant dimness") but never dramatized as constraint or loss. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing needed resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Belonging" is named repeatedly but never made concrete through a character trade-off or image that reweights prior material. The final assertion—"belonging is a frequency that can be tuned by anyone willing to listen"—delivers the theme as direct statement rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The pilgrim's token and the collaborative pulse offer gestural subtext, yet the "missing pieces" are "found…within the collaborative pulse of human curiosity," an abstraction that sidesteps dramatic irony or earned insight. Thematic Echo penalty: the climax articulates the thesis in prompt-like language without embodied cost (−0.5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira, though her perceptual signature is generic—"sharp-eyed" is told, not shown through biased noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("articulate the word belonging without uttering a syllable," "veil of brilliant dimness") that clashes with the pilot's presumed practical idiom. Sentence stems repeat: "The [noun] [verb]" opener appears in six consecutive paragraphs mid-text, creating template cadence (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice convergence). The pilgrim's dialogue-free murmurs and smiles flatten potential voice distinction. Psychic distance wavers when narration claims the chip "was rumored to be the key" without anchoring who rumored it or when Lira learned this.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence is pervasive: "The [noun]" opens multiple sequential sentences, and "brilliant dimness" recurs seven times without pattern-payoff, reading as synonym churn for atmospheric effect. Paraphrase loops appear—paragraphs restate "missing pieces" and "frequency" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a," "seemed to smile") dull immediacy in peak beats. Mixed metaphors muddle sense: "luminous ribbons that seemed to ripple with forgotten frequencies" conflates visual, tactile, and auditory vehicles. Stock phrasing proliferates: "sharp-eyed," "perpetually surprised," "thrill," "profound unity." Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph reprises "brilliant dimness" and "perpetually surprised joy"), triggering stacked penalties (−1.7 baseline, global 9+ disallowed).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical tech unlocks cosmic harmony via collaborative ritual—maps closely to uplift/enlightenment templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Brilliant dimness" and "frequency of belonging" are coined terms that gesture toward originality but function as atmospheric labels rather than story-specific constraints. The pilgrim-scholar/pilot pairing and "missing pieces" arc follow familiar genre beats. The ending grants symmetric satisfaction—harmony achieved, token left, future seekers invited—with no tradeoff or dissenting voice. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: template not sufficiently transformed (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or stakes. She observes, follows instructions embedded in the floor, and presses a lever—actions that could be performed by any character with a drone. "Sharp-eyed" is label-only; no scene demonstrates superior vision enabling or constraining a decision. Late first appearance past the opening paragraph; ornamental use without causal pressure (−0.6); no cost tied to her agency; introduced after 10% mark but functional in one beat (+0.4 for one beat involvement). Caps: missing middle development cap 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The chip appears in three distinct beats: pedestal description, Lira's hover/lever-press, and the closing vow to guard it. It emits the hum that "resonates" at the climax, giving it functional presence. However, its mechanics remain vague—"copper veins pulsing" is decorative, and any signal-device could substitute with minor edits. No visible cost tied to the chip's use; it succeeds on first attempt without complication. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (participates in hum/harmony, +0.9), but high swappability (−0.7), no causal pressure beyond on/off function (−0.5). Caps: swappability cap 3.8 would apply, but beat involvement and closure push past it to ~4.8 given rubric's smooth-band flexibility.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" frames the inciting exposition (pilgrim's speech), recurs as thematic claim mid-text, and is declared "found" in the penultimate paragraph's assertion. The concept shapes the stated motivation but does not narrow options on the page—Lira never struggles to locate, choose among, or sacrifice pieces. It reweights meaning at closure when the text asserts pieces were "within the collaborative pulse," yet this is told rather than dramatized through a choice or image with cost. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (reweighted in final assertion, +0.8), but ornamental middle use (−0.6) and summary-only resolution (−0.7). Two gates (setup, payoff) allow ~6.0 ceiling; lyric reprise lifts slightly to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears as a label in three separate paragraphs but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Lira's surprise is declared ("felt a thrill," "felt perpetually surprised joy") rather than shown through hesitation, error, or adaptation under pressure. The trait could be removed without altering any beat. Label-only across all mentions (−0.8), no causal work (−0.7), ornamental (−0.6). Missing all gates; cap 2.8 for missing closure participation, but stacked frictions lower practical score to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lever-pull appears in one key beat (Lira pressing it to activate the chip's hum) and is referenced in the reflection that "a simple pull of a lever could unlock such profound unity." It triggers the hum/frequency climax, giving it causal presence. However, the action itself is uncontested—no failed attempt, no alternate lever, no cost to pulling versus not pulling. Any activation gesture (button, command, alignment) could replace it with minor edits. Early signal (lever mentioned ~60% through, −0.3 for late setup), one major beat (+0.4), closure linkage (the hum it triggers is the climax, +1.0), but swappability (−0.6) and no demonstrated cost (−0.4). Two gates (development, payoff) allow ~6.0; causal trigger in climax beat lifts to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By following star trails" is signaled early (marble floor etchings) and Lira's drone follows the trails in one extended beat, pulling the chip "closer to the center." The method is used once with unclear mechanics—how do trails "pull" the chip?—and no alternate method is tested. Swappable with "by tracing glyphs" or "by aligning mirrors" with minimal rewrite. Early signal (+0.5), one beat involvement (+0.4), enables the approach to the chip (+0.6), but vague mechanics (−0.5), high swappability (−0.7), and missing closure participation (trails vanish after use, cap 2.8). Stacked frictions and caps yield 4.3, elevated slightly by early signal and one functional beat despite closure absence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (title, opening line) and supplies atmospheric detail (arches, dome, marble floor, pedestal). The star trails etched in the floor provide the map Lira follows, giving the setting one functional role. However, any puzzle-hall or tech-shrine could serve identically; the "dusk" timing and "ancient" quality are decorative. The setting never pressures a choice—Lira encounters no locked doors, environmental hazards, or resource limits. Early signal (+0.7), one beat involvement (floor-trails guide the approach, +0.4), closure participation (chamber "glows" and walls "pulse" in final image, +0.8), but swappability (−0.6) and postcard description that does not alter tactics (−0.5). Three gates allow ≥6.1 eligibility; lack of causal pressure holds score at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" sets a vague temporal anchor but never tracks elapsed time or creates urgency. The pilgrim's prior unlocking is complete before Lira's scene begins, so his arrival does not tighten her decisions. No countdown, fatigue, or window-closing pressure appears. The timeframe is told in exposition and ignored thereafter. Setup present (opening clause, +0.3), but no middle development (missing gate cap 3.4), no closure participation (missing gate further caps 2.8), and vague tracking (−0.4). Practical floor: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To decode the frequency of belonging" is stated as Lira's mission in the opening paragraphs and recurs as thematic claim throughout. However, it is never tested—Lira does not choose between decoding methods, sacrifice another goal, or face friction between wanting to decode and the cost of doing so. The motivation is summary-only; we never see Lira's desire embodied in a micro-choice under pressure. Early signal (+0.6), three thematic mentions across beats (+1.4 for beat involvement), closure linkage (the decoded frequency is the climax image, +0.9), but told-only without friction (−0.9) and no visible cost tied to pursuing it (−0.6). Three gates met; causal and closure involvement allow ~5.5 ceiling, but lack of on-page friction/cost lowers to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears seven times, framing the opening and recurring through the climax and close. It establishes a paradoxical tone (light/shadow) that persists but never modulates with pressure—scenes of supposed intensity ("thicker with brilliant dimness") carry the same register as calm reflection. The tone is static and ornamental, reading as a repeated phrase rather than a pressure-responsive element. Early signal (+0.7), present across beats (+0.9 for three mentions), closure linkage (final image invokes it, +0.8), but static mood without modulation (−0.8), stock paradox without fresh charge (−0.5), and synonym churn obscuring rather than sharpening (−0.4). Three gates met; stacked frictions and static execution yield 3.7.</comment>
