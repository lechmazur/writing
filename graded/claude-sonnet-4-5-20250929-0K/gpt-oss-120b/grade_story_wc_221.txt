<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains a passive observer throughout; the "blessed pariah" label is ornamental and never constrains a choice. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("confusion melt into a quiet resolve") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "promise" to navigate by invisible true north is asserted, not earned through a dramatized internal struggle with visible cost. No micro-choices alter present options; the character drifts through visions without agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague: "the city's hollow towers" and "the river of light" are metaphoric placeholders, not anchors (−0.4 in Q2). The drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation is suggested but no pattern is taught by midpoint, and the "glimpse" arrival is coincidental rather than causally earned or pressure-driven. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final sketch and alignment, but cost is absent: the protagonist simply records and whispers a promise with no path foreclosed or stance crystallized with felt price. The vision fades and the deck returns to status quo; no decisive change or conceptual repricing occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observation deck is described lyrically ("glass cradle," "minutes stretched like taffy") but remains a static backdrop; it does not constrain any choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The gilded compass applique recurs and "vibrates" at the closure, providing minimal constraint on the final alignment gesture. Sensory detail leans visual and metaphoric without grounding the body or tools in lived action. Spatial choreography is coherent but does not matter to outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find direction after shutdown—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the vision arrives as a gift, the sketch aligns, and the protagonist records it without friction. The second anniversary paragraph adds another sketch with no obstacle, and the walls "glow" in confirmation. Agency is observation and transcription, not decision under pressure. Escalation is absent; coincidence delivers both the vision and the map "of possibilities."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than dramatized: "turn confusion into exploration," "honored both loss and hope," and "every stretched moment held a compass awaiting its own revelation" are direct thesis sentences. The gilded compass rose and sketching ritual recur but function as symbols checked off rather than images that reweight prior material with cost. The final paragraph moralizes: "charting the unknown not because I sought to escape the past, but because I had learned…" The piece tells its theme without letting concrete action charge it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Voice is uniform elevated lyric ("blessed pariah," "river of light," "pliable canvas") without modulation under pressure or perceptual signature tied to character state. Diction remains abstract and metaphoric throughout; no concrete idiom or bias filters observation. Single-POV with no dialogue; internal stance is declarative rather than contradictory. Psychic distance is stable but flat, and the prose reads as a thematic essay rather than embodied perception. No POV leakage, but no distinct perceptual filter either.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoed silence" appears three times, "stretched" and "dilated" recur without new pressure, and "true north" is restated in five separate constructions. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "I [verb]," and the final third stacks filter verbs and abstract nouns ("pulse," "shimmer," "glow") without concrete propulsion. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "glass cradle," "river of light," "vacuum," and "blank map" compete without coherent vehicle. The closure beat is dulled by scaffold: "whispered a promise that I would continue to navigate…" Baseline −1.2 for loops and cadence artifacts; −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" premise, time dilation deck, and true north compass are genre furniture; the lyric frame does not transform them through specific, irreplaceable detail. The family sketching ritual is introduced generically and used twice without fresh inflection or cost. Emotional arc—confusion to resolve—follows a template path with no surprising synthesis or earned ambiguity. The final "map of possibilities" and "universe waited with patient arms" are abstract placeholders. No bold risk; the story hedges toward safe lyricism without lived particulars or genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" appears in the opening line and recurs in the final third, but the label does not constrain any on-page choice. The protagonist observes, sketches, and records; no decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. The status is ornamental. Setup present, no development, no closure participation beyond mention. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; swappability and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique is introduced early (setup), handled in two beats (initial description, vibration during the sketch alignment), and returns at closure when the protagonist aligns its needle with the new constellation. However, the object does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it confirms rather than complicates. Swappable with any talisman. Present in closure but not causally decisive. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.8, ornamental use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "true north" concept is named six times and frames the thematic premise, but it does not change on-page options or impose a visible cost. The protagonist seeks it, the compass points to it, and the vision confirms "true north still existed." The concept is declared rather than tested under pressure. Setup present, thematic claim only (−0.3), no causal pressure, minimal closure linkage as a metaphor. Cap at 4.6 for no middle development; label-only use lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is asserted in the opening ("minutes stretched like taffy," "stretched time itself") and recurs in the journal entry, but the attribute does not enable or constrain any action with cost. The deck's temporal field is described, not used; no choice depends on dilated time. Label-only trait. Setup present, ornamental mention (−0.3), no middle use, cameo in ending. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; ornamental penalty applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "glimpse" arrives once in the middle when the air ripples and delivers a view of the city before shutdown. The vision provides no new resource or constraint; it comforts and confirms the ritual. The protagonist sees ancestors' hands and feels resolve, but the glimpse is passive receipt, not decision-driver. Functional use in one beat, no closure participation (the second anniversary adds a new sketch without referencing the glimpse). Mid-story arrival, one beat +0.4, no closure linkage, swappable with any vision or memory. Ceiling ~5.5 for single-beat lyric use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced early as backstory, performed on-page at the first anniversary (protagonist lifts pen, traces constellation), and repeated at the second anniversary (family gathers, overlays drawing). The ritual frames both key beats and the closure image. However, the sketching mechanics do not matter—any contemplative act would serve—and no cost or friction attends the custom. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6, no causal pressure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is the sole location and is described lyrically, but it functions as backdrop. The temporal field "allowed a momentary bridge" (asserted, not shown through constraint), and the walls "glow" at the end in confirmation. The deck does not pressure a choice or supply a resource the protagonist must navigate. Postcard description with label claims. Setup present, no development constraint, cameo at closure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; late confirmation mention does not count as active use. Adjust slightly for pervasive presence, though passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the premise and recurs ("the anniversary of the shutdown," "before the shutdown," "after the shutdown"). The timeframe establishes loss but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; time passes from first to second anniversary without urgency or cost. The frame is static context rather than pressure. Setup present, no middle constraint, no closure urgency. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; swappability and summary-only use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is stated explicitly in two places ("I felt my confusion melt into a quiet resolve to turn confusion into exploration," "charting the unknown...because I had learned..."). Desire is told, not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The protagonist proceeds from confusion to resolve without obstacle. Setup in first third as theme claim, no middle friction, thematic restatement at closure. Label-only (−0.3), told motivation (−0.5), no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in three locations (opening, midpoint, final third) as a repeated phrase. Tone remains static—contemplative, abstract, lyric—without modulation under pressure or cadence shift. The mood does not charge the final image; it persists as ambient label. Single static mood trends mid-low per the rubric. Setup present as phrase, no development modulation, ornamental reprise at closure. Swappable with "quiet" or "stillness." Decorative mention (−0.3), static tone.</comment>
