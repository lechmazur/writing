<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tutor's journey toward self-forgiveness is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that function as labels rather than embodied perception. The climactic moment of letting go ("he let go of the pawn that haunted him, watching it dissolve") reads as visualization exercise rather than a choice with visible cost. "Fidgets productively" appears twice but never constrains or complicates a decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: recurring motifs (threads, labyrinth, chess metaphors) build toward a symbolic release. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but the "time-frozen village" conceit creates spatial vagueness—corridors and square remain abstract. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tutor releases guilt, the labyrinth dissolves), but cost is asserted ("dissolve into the tapestry's edge") rather than shown through a foreclosed path or trade-off. The piece teaches its pattern early yet the final "forgiveness" feels granted by setting rather than earned through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid anchors, and the "time-frozen" frame creates eerie atmosphere. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical (gleaming corridors, crystal altar) without tactile grounding—stone, metal, and fabric are named but not handled in ways that constrain movement. The labyrinth's gate opening and walls "breathing" charge key beats, lifting the score, but spatial choreography inside the maze remains generic (corridors twist, he paces) without specific turns or dead ends that shape his route.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early, but escalation is contemplative rather than forced by narrowing options. The tutor enters, reflects, arranges stones, visualizes, then releases—each beat deepens mood without introducing a tangible obstacle or trade-off. The labyrinth is described as a test ("winnow the soul") yet no wrong turn, puzzle failure, or sacrifice appears on the page. Cost at closure ("let go of the pawn") is metaphorical and uncontested; no live alternative is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as iterative opening moves) emerges from chess and thread motifs. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings" and "fierce repose… seemed to sing his redemption." Subtext is thin; the labyrinth's symbolic function is stated rather than discovered. The woven-hush motif recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static emblem of calm throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (chess metaphors, fidgeting, tactical framing) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that feels imposed rather than the tutor's natural idiom under stress. Psychic distance holds steady; no dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Compression at peak beats (altar, release) maintains rhythm without obscuring focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from heavy metaphorical density without pattern payoff: nearly every sentence in the labyrinth sequence layers figurative language (corridors "like a knight's L-shape," walls "breathe," threads "whisper"), creating cumulative opacity. Paraphrase loops appear: "woven hush" recurs six times with minimal variation; "frayed threads" echoes four times in close proximity. Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems dominate the middle third. Stock phrases ("the world held its breath," "time slipped forward like a pawn advancing one square") dull specificity. Information density is moderate—sentences advance atmosphere but rarely do double duty for character and plot simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise (guilt-ridden chess tutor enters symbolic labyrinth to forgive himself) follows a familiar redemption template without a non-obvious angle. The time-frozen village and platinum maze are vivid set-dressing but do not transform the emotional arc—remove them and replace with a mountain monastery or desert vigil, and the internal journey remains unchanged. Chess and tapestry motifs are woven together competently yet predictably; the final dissolution feels like a given rather than an earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is named early, drives the journey, and makes the final release choice. However, most beats are observational or reflective rather than decision points that alter tactics—he traces threads, paces, arranges stones, visualizes, then releases. The release itself is uncontested; no alternative path is weighed on the page. Present across setup, middle reflection, and closure, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears at the village entrance, the tutor decodes its gate, paces its corridors (arranging stones, feeling walls breathe), and stands at the crystal altar for the release. It constrains entry (requires decoding) and provides the setting for the winnowing process. The labyrinth dissolves at the end, a charged reprise that signals transformation. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the corridors' internal logic (twists, knight's L-shape) is described rather than navigated as a tactical puzzle, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears as metaphor and descriptor (tapestry's border, the atmosphere, banner at the end) but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. It functions as mood-setting label throughout, never shifting in meaning or forcing a trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is mentioned twice (opening: "fidgets productively when anxiety bites"; inside: "fidgets productively by arranging tiny stones") but arranging stones is reflective ritual, not a choice constrained by the fidgeting trait. The fidgeting could be removed without altering any beat. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears four times: labyrinth "could winnow the soul," walls urge him "to winnow his lingering guilt," voice urges "winnow the final knot," and the final paragraph states he "winnowed his soul to its purest form." The action frames the central process and recurs at closure, but it remains metaphorical throughout—no on-page sifting, discarding, or loss of a concrete element occurs. Lyric seed-to-reprise lifts the score above ornamental, yet swappability is high (purge, cleanse, distill would function identically).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border" is named as the entry method and the tutor performs it on the page: "He lifted a corner of the woven hush, feeling the tension… Each thread whispered a memory, and as he untangled them he wove a mental board." The gate opens immediately afterward, showing causal linkage. However, the mechanics are vague (what pattern did he decode? which threads?), and the method never recurs—once inside, the labyrinth challenge shifts to reflection and visualization. Present in setup and enables entry, but missing middle development and closure participation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village frames the opening and closing, provides the square with tapestry and labyrinth, and releases its breath at the end ("the village's frozen breath released, and time slipped forward"). Setup and closure participation are clear. However, the frozen-time conceit does not constrain the tutor's choices or supply tactical resources inside the labyrinth; the village functions as backdrop. Lyric reprise (frozen → released) adds resonance, but swappability is moderate—an enchanted forest or sacred ruin would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in the opening and recurs twice inside ("corridors glimmered with reflected thunderclouds, though the storm stayed suspended outside"; "A gentle thunder rolled distant yet again… a perfect time-frozen cradle") and once at closure ("As the distant thunder faded, the village's frozen breath released"). The lull creates atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline—the tutor's pacing is contemplative, unrushed. Present across beats, but the timeframe never alters tactics; it remains static mood-setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to forgive himself is named early ("resolve to forgive himself"), dramatized through memory of the pawn mistake and its cost ("lives lost in the cascade"), and drives the labyrinth journey. The release beat at the altar ("he let go of the pawn that had haunted him") and final line ("the exile finally forgave himself") directly enact the motivation. However, the forgiveness is uncontested—no friction between wanting absolution and fearing unworthiness appears as conflicting impulses in the same moment. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure; causal but under-pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is introduced early ("The exile's heart throbbed with a fierce repose, a paradox of calm rage"), recurs at closure ("his heart finally quiet in fierce repose"), and bookends the arc. The tone aims for controlled intensity throughout—storm suspended, reflective pacing, crystalline images—but emotional modulation is limited; the tutor's interior remains in one register (contemplative resolve) from entry to release. The phrase charges the final image via reprise, lifting the score above ornamental, yet the lived texture of fierce repose (simultaneous fury and stillness acting in conflict within a beat) is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices.</comment>
