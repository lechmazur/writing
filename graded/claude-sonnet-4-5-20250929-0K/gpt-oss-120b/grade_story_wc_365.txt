<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's sensory-mapper profession is label-only; her interior voice is identical to the narrator's elevated register without distinct perceptual bias. The motivation to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" never generates on-page conflict between competing impulses—she moves from setup to revelation without hesitation or cost. The climactic choice (raising the shard to awaken the crew) reads as a smooth epiphany rather than a decision forced by contradictory wants, and the ending grants her "lightness of shared knowledge" without dramatizing what she forfeits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" is named at line two, but "where" (the repair bay's spatial logic) and "when" (present? memory? dream state?) remain vague past 120 words, undercutting the Orientation Test. The closure—awakening the crew and scattering the shard—occurs on the page, but cost is abstract: "weight…lift[ed], replaced by lightness" tells emotional change without showing a forfeited option or felt price. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (sensory maps, green shard, cyclical rhythm layered across beats), yet the final move feels like a list-check resolution rather than a tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bay's cracked floor, rusted hulls, and flickering fluorescents anchor place, but spatial choreography is unclear—Lira spreads maps "across the concrete," steps "through" a slit, yet her physical position relative to conduit, fuel line, and crew remains vague. The green shard recurs and charges the ending when it fractures, lifting the score toward mid-band. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract ("lattice of possibilities," "ribbons of light") without embodied texture that would constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Lira spreads her maps, whispers a command, steps through, traces the thread, and retrieves the log without obstacle or cost. The revelation (commander evacuated only the elite) arrives as exposition; no on-page reversal forces Lira to weigh competing goods or pay a price. The crew's awakening is her unilateral act, not a choice that forecloses another path, so escalation flatlines under both Causal and Accumulative lenses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truth and cyclical breath emerges from the bay's atmosphere and the parallel-universe mechanics, but the ending's "promise, cyclically spontaneous yet eternally purposeful" borders on abstract philosophizing rather than earned image. The green shard's fracture into "specks…like stars" offers a non-literal answer, yet the crew's awakening resolves all threads symmetrically without ambiguity or cost, undercutting resonance. The piece resists overt moralizing but also resists dramatized consequence, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable first-person, but diction is uniformly elevated and abstract ("cartographic ribbons," "knot where the withheld truth was knotted") without modulation under pressure. Lira's professional lexicon (sensory mapper) never infiltrates syntax or perception—she narrates like a lyric poet regardless of urgency. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's "cyclically spontaneous yet eternally purposeful" reads as authorial summary rather than character-specific thought, and the piece does not teach a pattern that would license such uniformity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "sensory maps" appear in six sentences with near-identical phrasing; "green shard" and "cyclically spontaneous" recur as labels without syntactic variation. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "I [verb]…, and I [verb]…, and the [noun] [verb]" span the middle third without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("rivers of light," "pearls in a glass bottle," "stars across…tapestry") cluster in peak beats, lowering density. Filter-verb stacks ("I felt," "I sensed," "I whispered") dull immediacy. Combined artifact load: paraphrase −0.3, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor run −0.4, filter stack −0.3 = baseline −1.5 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), adding −0.2 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—sensory mapper navigates parallel universes via green glass shard to uncover a secret—is a close match for "magic object + hidden truth" templates without a non-obvious twist. The commander's choice (evacuate elites, freeze the rest) is told rather than discovered through dramatized clues, and Lira's solution (raise shard, awaken crew) arrives without friction or tradeoff. The "cartographic ribbons" and "cyclically spontaneous pulse" are ornamental rather than world-logic constraints. No bold structural risk or specific lived detail transforms the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is named and her profession (sensory mapper) is described in paragraph one, but her cartographic skill never constrains a choice—she spreads maps, they glow, and the bay shifts without obstacle. She does not make a turn-creating decision until the final act (raising the shard), which is unforced. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is absent. Ornamental use and swappability lower the score: "investigator" or "archivist" could replace "sensory mapper" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in paragraph four (setup), is handled in the middle beat (Lira whispers to it, it redirects flow), and fractures in the ending (payoff), meeting all three gates. It enables two beats (opening the slit, revealing the log) and charges the final image when it scatters "like stars." Causal pressure is moderate: the shard is a tool but not irreplaceable—another device could serve. Cost connection is weak: no visible price is tied to using it. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.8, minus swappability −0.5 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named in paragraph five and enacted when Lira steps through the slit into an alternate timeline, meeting setup and middle development. It shapes one key choice (entering the parallel bay) but is not irreplaceable—"portal" or "dimensional door" would serve. Closure linkage is weak: the final stitching of realities is told, not shown as a constrained tactic. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, moderate causal +0.6, payoff participation +0.5, swappability −0.4 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is introduced in paragraph three and recurs as a label for the bay's pulse and the alternate timeline's rhythm, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action. Lira does not adapt her tactics to the cycle, and no visible cost is tied to it. Label-only mentions across three sentences do not count as distinct beats. Score: setup +0.3, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3 = ~2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears in paragraph nine (Lira redirects the sensory tide to open the slit), paragraph fourteen (redirects flow to reveal the log), and paragraph sixteen (redirects energy to awaken the crew), meeting all three gates. It drives two beats and shapes the ending, but the action is abstract—no on-page detail shows how redirection differs from "command" or "focus." Swappability lowers the score. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, moderate causal +0.8, swappability −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is named in paragraph five (setup) and enacted when Lira steps into the alternate bay (middle), meeting two gates. The method enables one key beat (discovering the frozen crew) and is signaled early, but its mechanics are vague—how does the shard "redirect…through parallel universes"?—and the ending's "stitching" bypasses prior logic. Score: setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, moderate causal +0.6, payoff participation +0.5, mechanics vagueness −0.5 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "abandoned spaceport repair bay" is named in the opening line (setup) and provides atmosphere (rusted hulls, cracked floor, conduit), but it never pressures a choice—Lira moves freely, and the bay's layout does not constrain her tactics. The bay "warms" at the end (payoff), a thematic touch without causal force. Score: setup +0.6, ornamental −0.8, payoff participation (weak) +0.3 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as tone-setting language, but it does not function as a timeframe—no clock or deadline tightens Lira's decisions. The phrase is ornamental. Score: setup +0.3, ornamental −0.8, late reprise +0.2 = ~1.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated in paragraph six (setup) and drives Lira's two middle beats (tracing the thread, retrieving the log). The revelation occurs on the page (payoff), but no on-page friction between Lira's want and a competing cost dramatizes the motivation—she pursues it smoothly. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, told-only friction −0.5 = ~5.6.</comment>
