<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The prophet remains entirely abstract—no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of declarative exposition ("His gift was to interpret cloud movements") without embodied emotion or conflict. The "motivation was simple yet profound" sentence is pure telling; the character performs actions but never wrestles with competing wants or fears. No earned change or renunciation with visible cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "Leeward tide prophet" is a label without grounding context, and the orchard's literal physics (why it floats, how it moves) are never anchored. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure unit—the ending loops back to the opening state ("ready to sketch another resonance") without visible cost or foreclosed path. Summarized legend ("The wind carried his name") replaces on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid figurative language ("seaweed around the driftwood circles," "ribbon of amber") creates atmosphere, but the orchard-on-driftwood remains physically impossible without taught logic, undermining spatial grounding. The xylophone mallet constrains one choice (striking driftwood to generate rhythm), lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is repetitive (clouds described in every paragraph) and does not narrow perception under urgency. The setting never shapes a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized with an on-page test. The prophet's goal ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is declared but never meets resistance or choice that narrows options. The entire sequence is a single iteration without escalation—clouds arrive, he strikes, orchard responds, clouds depart—then the cycle is promised again. No reversal, no tightening, no visible price paid. Coincidence (cloud movements) drives every beat; protagonist agency is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme ("obstacles into instruments") is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from concrete choices. The final paragraph moralizes ("a testament to his belief") instead of letting image carry meaning. Subtext is absent—every gesture and object is decoded on the page. The "restless euphony" motif recurs as a label without accumulating pressure or shifting meaning. No earned wisdom arises from on-page struggle; the prophet's worldview is identical at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person distant narration maintains stable stance and avoids head-hopping. Register drifts into ornate diction ("sketched resonance," "syncopated applause") that exceeds the scene's immediate texture without clear voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—any observer could notice the same details in the same order. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression is attempted but the elliptical style (no explanation of how clouds become melodies) obscures causality rather than charging it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence runs pervade: "He [verb]… he [verb]…" across multiple beats, and "Each [noun]" opens three sentences in close succession (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "turning the shifting vapor into melodies" / "theory that every obstacle could be rendered into sound" restate the same idea (−0.2). Mixed metaphor: rhythm "twisting like seaweed" then "sending ripples of sound that curled around the driftwood like tides" contradicts vehicle logic (−0.4). Stock phrases: "simple yet profound," "blue hour," "restless euphony" (repeated six times). Information density is low—beats recycle description without advancing knowledge or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (cloud-reader on floating orchard) is imaginative in setting but follows a quest-fulfillment template with no friction. The prophet succeeds in every beat without adaptation or cost, fitting the "journey continues" archetype. Emotional arc is absent—no internal transformation distinguishes this iteration from the next. The fractals-and-dubstep aesthetic is surface-level and does not generate fresh stakes. Transformation test: swap "clouds" for "stars" and "driftwood" for "ice," and the plot is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Leeward tide prophet appears in every beat but makes no choice that narrows options. He observes clouds and strikes the mallet in a single causal chain with no reversal. No cost, no trade-off, no decision under pressure. Late mention of "distant isles" broadens scope without altering present action. Missing middle development and closure participation as an agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Xylophone mallet is handled in multiple beats (strikes driftwood, generates rhythm, warms with memory). Early signal ("battered… worn smooth") frames expectation. It enables the dubbing action but never imposes a constraint or cost—its condition never worsens, it never breaks, no alternative tool is considered. Present in the final image but not causally active there. Mid-band for repeated functional use without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is mentioned twice as theory/label without shaping an on-page stake. The concept (invisible vibration → sound) is enacted but never tested—no obstacle resists being rendered into sound, so the theory faces no friction. Missing development and closure participation; does not constrain choice or change options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation appears in every beat and drives the mallet's rhythm. Setup is early and the trait is specific. However, it imposes no cost or trade-off—the prophet reads clouds perfectly without error or ambiguity, so the attribute enables action but never constrains it. Swappable with "reads wind currents" or "interprets wave patterns" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dub" is named repeatedly and central to the action (strikes that generate rhythm). Early signal. However, it is functionally identical to "play" or "perform"; removing the term "dub" and substituting "strike a rhythm" leaves plot unchanged. The action succeeds in every beat without complication, so it does not drive a turn. Present across beats but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Fractal generating patterns" is mentioned three times as description but its mechanics never matter. How do fractals structure the rhythm? What happens if the pattern breaks? The method is label-only and does not constrain or enable a choice. Missing development and closure participation; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Orchard on driftwood is signaled early and recurs in every beat. It supplies the instrument (driftwood to strike) and the bobbing motion adds atmosphere. However, the open-seas location never imposes a constraint—no storm, no drift toward danger, no resource scarcity. The setting does not alter tactics or pressure a choice. Functional but replaceable with "hilltop grove" or "desert oasis" with minor atmospheric edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Blue hour" frames the opening and closing paragraphs with lyric reprise. Time of day is mentioned but never advances or tightens—no sense of duration, no pressure from approaching darkness or dawn. The clock does not constrain action. Missing middle development; present at closure only as atmospheric label.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is declared in paragraph twelve and restated in the penultimate paragraph. It is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the prophet wrestling with doubt, temptation to quit, or cost of continuing. The desire is label-only and does not create friction. Late first mention; missing development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" recurs six times as a label and colors every beat's description. Tone is coherent (elevated, lyric) and modulates slightly with the cloud shifts. However, the mood remains static—no contrast, no tonal rupture that would deepen pressure. The phrase charges the final image by repetition but does not reweight prior stakes. Mid-band for pervasive presence without cost or turn.</comment>
