<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority remains abstract and declarative throughout. Her stated haunting question ("where do deleted memories go") never generates a micro-choice under pressure; she simply performs ritualistic actions (brewing coffee, pressing flowers) without internal contradiction or embodied hesitation. The final "understanding" arrives as unearned epiphany—label-only realization without struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; she gathers fragments, smiles, and walks away satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where are anchored by ~120 words, but the "when" remains vague beyond "weeks ago." The story offers a long string of and-then moves—Mara brews coffee, enters the chamber, kneels, presses a flower, flame grows—without motivated causality or meaningful reversal. The closure image (whale's silence "now rest in the crystal chamber") is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; no decisive change or felt consequence lands. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and pockets of gravity are vividly described, and the lantern, wildflowers, and coffee grounds recur across beats. However, spatial choreography drifts—Mara moves from dock to grotto to chamber without clear transitions or physical grounding. The setting elements (gravity pockets, fissure, slab) do not constrain a choice; they serve as ornamental backdrops. The micro-setting (lantern, tin box) is handled but never alters tactics or charges the final image decisively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early, but no on-page tightening or meaningful reversal occurs. Mara's progression—brew, read grounds, enter chamber, exhume sand, press flower, gather fragments—unfolds without opposition, trade-off, or visible price. The "pockets of gravity shift" and "walls humming" are atmospheric descriptions, not escalations that narrow options. Coincidence (perfect spiral in grounds, correct symbol on slab) resolves the quest without protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme (deleted memories can be reclaimed) is stated directly in the penultimate paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The recurring motifs—wildflowers, lantern, gravity pockets—are mentioned frequently but never shift meaning or accumulate pressure. The final assertion ("even what is deleted can be found again") reads as a prompt-label moral rather than an earned, non-literal answer. No conceptual repricing or resonant image reweights prior material; the story explains its own thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, the diction drifts into abstract elevated phrasing ("gleaming silence," "translucent walls," "filament of light") without embodied anchoring in Mara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt the tug," "believed," "understood") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. No purposeful psychic distance shifts; the voice reads as atmospheric narration rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "deleted memories were not lost, merely compressed" restates the premise three times across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("minnows in a moonlit tide," "sifted dreams," "gentle hands") appear in most lines without fresh specificity. Mixed metaphor: gravity pockets "pulse like a heartbeat" yet also "sing in steady, measured notes." Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (memories stored in gravity pockets revealed by coffee grounds) is high-concept but underexplored; the mechanics are asserted rather than discovered through struggle. The story assembles fantasy elements—beached whale, salt chamber, gravity fluctuations, divination ritual—without transforming them through specific character logic or world rules. No fresh inflection or non-obvious turn; the plot follows a straight line from quest statement to convenient solution. Proximity check: "gleaming silence" and "gentle light" echo prompt phrasing without reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mara (dock-side lantern lighter) is present throughout and performs all major actions. However, her occupation (lantern lighter) is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics; she could be any seeker. She makes no decision under pressure that alters the story's direction; all moves (brew, enter, exhume, press, gather) proceed without friction or reversal. The element is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in the opening tin box, are pressed against the slab to trigger the crack, and mingle with fragments at closure. Three distinct beats, but the flowers' scent or meaning does not visibly reweight the stake. The action of pressing a flower against stone is pivotal, yet any token object could serve; no unique property of the wildflowers (memory, fragility, preservation) is exploited. Lyric reprise is present but lacks causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity appear early ("fluctuates mysteriously") and recur across beats: Mara feels the tug, they pulse against stone, shift when memories emerge, and steady at closure. The concept shapes the story's central premise (deleted memories compressed into gravity pockets) and is present in the ending image. However, gravity never constrains a choice or forces a trade-off; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The mechanics (how pockets compress memories, why they fluctuate, what steadying them costs) are asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" is attached to the gravity pockets and mentioned twice ("pockets of gravity fluctuated mysteriously" early; "no longer fluctuating mysteriously but aligning with purpose" at closure). The trait is label-only; no on-page moment shows how fluctuation constrains action or creates cost. The shift from fluctuating to steady is told as outcome, not dramatized as choice. Replaceable adjective.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Exhume occurs in a single beat: "she began to exhume the sand that hid the past." The action reveals the symbol-etched slab, which leads to pressing the flower and releasing the memories—a functional turn. However, exhumation is one brief verb in a chain of ritualistic steps; the act itself (how she exhumes, what resists, what cost the effort imposes) is summarized. Mid-beat role; not the story's fulcrum.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear early: Mara brews daily, reads the swirls as maps, and when a perfect spiral forms, the chamber trembles—signaling entry. Later, a symbol on the slab matches the coffee-ground pattern, unlocking the memories. Two beats, setup and middle use. However, the method's mechanics (why coffee grounds map to deleted memories, how the match works) are asserted without in-world logic. Functional but not irreplaceable; any divination token could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is the story's primary setting: Mara enters it, the gravity pockets fluctuate within it, the slab and fissure are found there, and the walls hum at closure. Present across setup, middle, and ending. The chamber supplies the gravity-pocket phenomenon and the etched slab, both crucial to the quest. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; Mara moves through it without physical cost or spatial challenge. The setting enables but does not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the whale beaches" sets the opening context ("weeks ago") and the whale's song echoes in the climax. The timeframe provides thematic backdrop (loss, aftermath) but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. Mara's search unfolds at her own pace; no urgency or deadline is dramatized. The whale's beaching is past event, not live pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where deleted memories go" is stated explicitly as Mara's haunting question and drives the plot structure: she brews coffee, reads grounds, enters the chamber, and gathers the memories. Present in setup and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Mara never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices to pursue the answer. No friction between the motivation and competing needs. Functional spine without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" appears in the title phrase and recurs: "turning the darkness into a gleaming silence," "In that quiet blaze," "In that gleaming silence," "shining quiet." The tone is consistent—hushed, luminous, reverential—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. The repeated phrasing reads as ornamental label rather than evolving atmosphere. Static mood; no cadence shift at closure.</comment>
