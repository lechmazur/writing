<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Selene remains a lyrical gesture throughout rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her actions—twirling, singing, dancing—are described but never reveal interior conflict or cost that would make them choices under pressure. The story tells us she feels "calm defiance" and that "encrypting vulnerability as strength was a pact with herself," but these are asserted labels rather than embodied decisions that foreclose options. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values; she moves through the lab unopposed by doubt or competing desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed beyond 120 words—Selene's goal, the lab's physical state, and the immediate situation emerge only through accumulation of atmospheric fragments. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending ("the lab rose like a phoenix") offers no legible cost or decisive change; it declares liberation and legend without showing what Selene renounced or what path closed. The "compartment that housed a glowing crystal" arrives as coincidence, not earned causality. No on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab, copper braid, hangman's dice, and kelp-bound journal are vivid and specific. However, spatial choreography is vague—where Selene stands relative to the altar, the door, the compartment—and the lab's pressure-sealed door becomes a "melody" without clear mechanical constraint. The crystal and dice constrain no on-page choice; they are handled but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—encrypting vulnerability—is declared but never tested by an opposing force or competing desire. Selene encounters no reversal, friction, or tightening; the dice clatter once and reveal the crystal without resistance. The tide rises and seals the door, but she sings it open immediately with no visible cost or foreclosed option. No escalation under any lens; the lab "learns to breathe" and "rose like a phoenix" as declared outcomes, not earned turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of encoding vulnerability as strength is stated repeatedly—"a pact with herself," "teach future seekers to encode their own frailties"—rather than arising from dramatized particulars. The hangman's dice and crystal function as symbolic placeholders without constraining Selene's choices or deepening the thematic question. The final image (the lab rising, the legend whispered) gestures toward resonance but offers no non-literal answer; it restates the premise as triumph without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyrical register. Perceptual signature is present—"the ink a luminous algae," "each pirouette encrypted a fragment"—but diction remains elevated and uniform across all beats, including moments of supposed pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose maintains a single cadence throughout; no modulation under stress, no interior contradiction, just continuous ornamental assertion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template phrasing proliferate: "Each pirouette encrypted… each note a key… each entry sang… each movement a line of code… each breath a cipher." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff—"sea-foam," "spider spins its web," "phoenix," "shared cipher"—creating density without information advance. Repeated scaffold phrases ("calm defiance" appears three times, "hangman's dice" five times, "quiet rebellion" twice) and synonym churn ("whispered," "hummed," "echoing") dull momentum. The closure beat is cluttered with metaphor stacks that obscure rather than sharpen the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—code breaker in a sunken lab using dance and journal to liberate secrets—is a legible synthesis, but the execution leans on stock metaphors (phoenix rising, spider's web, treasure in the dark) without transformation. "Calm defiance," "quiet rebellion," and the notion of encrypting weakness as strength are thematic labels rather than specific lived detail. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges into lyrical abstraction to avoid concrete causality or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Selene is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. She twirls, sings, dances, and lifts the crystal without opposition or cost. Her presence is ornamental; any "lyrical code breaker" could perform the same gestures with identical outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dice appear in the opening third, are explained through dance, and clatter once to reveal the compartment. They return as "silent witnesses" in the final paragraph. Setup and closure participation are present, but they constrain no middle choice and resolve a problem (the locked compartment) they did not help create. Swappable with any symbolic puzzle object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is stated three times but never dramatized as a choice under competing pressure. It functions as a thematic label rather than a tactic that shapes stakes or alters options. No on-page moment shows Selene choosing defiance over submission or flight with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Dance appears in multiple beats—Selene twirls to explain the dice, dances to encode, and her dance "still echoes" at the end. However, it is described rather than shown constraining a choice or imposing a cost. No trade-off (e.g., exhaustion, misunderstanding, vulnerability) emerges from this method. Easily replaceable with any other expressive act.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Liberate" is named repeatedly but occurs off-stage: "the act of liberate was not a loud explosion but a whispered shift," "a liberation that resonated far beyond the rusted walls." No on-page action shows Selene freeing something with causal consequence. The dice clatter, the compartment opens, the lab rises—all outcomes declared, not turns earned by her agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The coded journal entries are introduced early, described as shimmering and fading when read, and Selene leaves pages behind for future seekers. Setup and closure participation are present, but the mechanics never constrain a middle attempt or shape tactics. The journal functions as backdrop rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory frames the story and provides the altar, door, and compartment. The tide rises and seals the door, creating a momentary obstacle, but Selene sings it open immediately without tactical shift. The lab's metal walls "expand like lungs" as metaphor, not as a resource or constraint that alters her approach. Present across beats but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" is a simile in the opening third—"The notion of time unfolded as a spider spins its web"—and returns in the final third as "The ocean, like a patient spider, wove those ripples." No clock tightens decisions; Selene's actions occur without time pressure or pacing consequence. Ornamental metaphor, not a functional timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The desire to encrypt vulnerability as strength is stated multiple times but never dramatized as a conflicted choice. No friction between this want and a competing cost (exposure, exhaustion, misunderstanding) appears on the page. Told-only motivation without embodied struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is evoked through recurring images (dice, journal, tides) and phrases like "the sea whispered back, a familiar hum." Tone remains stable and lyrical throughout without modulation under pressure. The final image gestures toward the mysterious (legend, silent dice) and the familiar (her steps, the ocean's memory), but the tone does not shift to charge the closure; it sustains a single register from start to finish.</comment>
