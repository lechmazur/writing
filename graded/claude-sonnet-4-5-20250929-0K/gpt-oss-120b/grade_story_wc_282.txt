<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The map maker lacks concrete wants in tension; her "motivation" is stated as abstract purpose ("to become the voice of the unknown") but never dramatized through a live choice with visible cost. Interiority reads as lyric assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist observes and enacts ritual gestures, but no decision forecloses a path or reveals competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear by ~120 words, so no penalty there. However, no on-page closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—lands with visible cost. The final image ("the elk leaf fossil drifted...") offers atmospheric satisfaction but does not reweight prior material or crystallize a before/after with felt price. Linkage is associative rather than causal or accumulative with legible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with mineral filaments, vapor droplets, and amber glow, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No choice is narrowed by access, proximity, or resource; the cavern breathes and shimmers on cue to support atmosphere without altering tactics. Micro-setting (the basin, the leaf) is handled but does not charge the closure image with a felt cost tied to spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (completing the sensory map), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under pressure. The map maker's actions proceed without reversal, resistance, or live trade-off; the leaf glows, droplets float, the map completes. Coincidence (the human's emergence, the calmer water) decorates the ending rather than testing protagonist agency. No visible price is paid that narrows later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence, voice, translation of the unknown—is declared rather than dramatized through specific conflict. The final insight ("to amplify the silence that already lived within them") arrives as assertion, not earned through on-page friction. Recurrence of the leaf and glow reads as motif-by-checklist without constraining choice or reweighting prior material with undeniable cost at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture ("factually mystical," "lantern-like droplets"), and psychic distance remains stable throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("oracle," "chorus of forgotten tides") that reads more writerly than character-particular. No dialogue is present to test for voice distinction. Purposeful compression is legible, but the final paragraph's tonal convergence feels more atmospheric than internally driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Loop and scaffold issues: "voice of the unknown" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "factually mystical" is used twice as decorative label; "float" and "glow" recur without functional differentiation. Template cadence in final third: "She understood... She smiled." Figurative density (vapor "like lanterns," leaf "bright as sunrise") clusters without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure. Clarity remains intact, but momentum sags under repetitive phrasing. Apply −0.8 cumulative for paraphrase loops and template stems; −0.4 for filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to adjust").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Core premise—sensory cartography in a post-human cave—offers surface novelty but follows a familiar contemplative-ritual arc without transformation. The protagonist enacts mystical procedure without friction, and the ending grants atmospheric satisfaction without a non-obvious turn earned in hindsight. Emotional truth is abstracted into theme statements rather than grounded in specific human complexity. The "elk" typo in the penultimate paragraph suggests copy drift rather than deliberate subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout and performs the central ritual, but makes no key decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation and enactment without on-page conflict or cost. Setup clear, middle presence sustained, but closure participation is passive—she waits and smiles rather than choosing under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elm leaf fossil introduced early (~20%), handled in two distinct beats (basin placement, final drift), and present in the closure image. It glows and pulses, but the glow is asserted rather than earned through a choice that the leaf constrains. Lyric reprise reweights atmosphere but not stakes. Swappable with another relic without structural break. Three gates met, but causal pressure and cost linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Transitional objects" is named once in exposition and echoed thematically ("object to oracle"), but does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page. The concept decorates the premise rather than driving a beat or forcing a trade-off. Late explicit mention; no middle development; closure cameo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears twice as descriptive label without constraining action or enabling a choice with visible cost. The leaf's glow is asserted as mystical, but no tradeoff or consequence hinges on this trait. Ornamental use; no demonstrated causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Float" action recurs across three beats (droplets rise, leaf hovers, leaf drifts) and anchors the closure image. However, the action is atmospheric rather than decisive; swapping "rise" or "drift" would not break logic. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but the action does not narrow options or create cost—it accompanies the ritual rather than testing it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Heat-mapping emotions" is named in exposition and mentioned once more mid-scene, but its mechanics never constrain a choice or alter an attempt. The method is asserted as pioneered but not demonstrated through friction or failure. Setup present, no middle development beat, cameo at closure. Functional mention but replaceable with "recording" without impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is established early and sustained as the sole location. The cavern "breathes," walls shimmer, and the setting supplies the basin and mineral filaments, but no choice is pressured by spatial constraint or resource scarcity. Micro-setting (basin, walls) is handled but does not alter tactics. Setup and closure presence without middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After humans hibernate" frames the opening and the human's emergence bookends the close, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The year-long sleep is backdrop; no clock or seasonal pressure alters the map maker's work. Mentioned but not operationalized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is stated explicitly in exposition and restated in the penultimate paragraph. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between this motivation and another impulse; the protagonist enacts it without obstacle. Setup and closure echo, but no middle choice tests or complicates the drive.</comment>
