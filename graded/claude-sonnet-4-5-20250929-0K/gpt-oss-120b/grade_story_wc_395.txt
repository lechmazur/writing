<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lia's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks deleted files as archival memory—but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The piece tells us she "felt a surge of purpose" and "smiled" rather than embodying contradictory impulses or showing micro-choices under pressure. The final discovery lands without visible cost; she simply logs the data and vows to guard the archive, a tidy resolution that avoids genuine renunciation or trade-off. "Brightly attentive" appears as a descriptor without constraining a single choice or mistake on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Lia follows breadcrumbs through metadata, fabricates a post, enters a hidden server, unlocks a vault, and publishes the discovery. The pattern coheres, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—each step simply adds information without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the crew's message: "We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract and the final image does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words, so no penalty applies there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and specific: amber-lit server rooms, forgotten emojis, static-thick air, dusty terminals. The archive functions as a micro-setting that constrains Lia's path through metadata and sublayers, and the "wall of obsolete emojis" gates the concealed server farm. The patch insignia returns at closure, charging the final image with a thread of connection. Spatial choreography is clear and the archive's layers reward the piece's accumulative design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go—is signaled early and sustained. Lia's fabricated post is a clear choice that tests her theory, and the algorithm's response accelerates the search. However, the escalation is additive rather than a genuine tightening; each discovery simply leads to the next clue without forecloses options or imposing a visible price. The vault opens without friction, the crew's message appears without cost, and Lia's final act (re-posting the patch image) spreads the numbers again but does not trade away a live alternative or face an obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as a living presence in the digital archive, absence transformed into echo—emerges from the crew's embedded coordinates and the network's algorithmic afterlife. The final message ("We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence") attempts a resonant answer to the central question, but it arrives as a thesis statement rather than a non-literal image earned by prior particulars. The piece gestures toward complexity (deleted data as digital ghosts, social fabric as memory carrier) but the ending moralizes the concept instead of letting the specifics resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lia throughout. Diction leans toward elevated register ("vaulted archives," "distant choir," "sublayer," "checksum") that reads more as atmospheric description than character-particular perception. The narrative voice is consistent but generic; Lia's way of noticing does not carry a distinct perceptual signature or bias. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored. Psychic distance holds without leakage, but the prose reads like averaged exposition rather than Lia's interior texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; information advances each beat without major loops. However, template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" constructions and stock metaphors ("forgotten corners," "fading chorus," "digital afterlife") that read as placeholder texture. The phrase "brightly attentive" is asserted without embodiment, and several lines paraphrase the same content: "she found a dusty terminal displaying a cascade of the numbers" is immediately followed by "each line ending with a file path that vanished." Figurative language ("phantom breadcrumb," "looping video," "singing the echo") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, pushing toward ornamental density. No major causality breaks, so deductions remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—a memory keeper discovers a cold case encoded in social media metadata—offers a fresh synthesis of archival work and digital archaeology. However, execution leans on familiar beats: breadcrumb clues, hidden sublayer, vault unlock, final message. The crew's strategy (embedding coordinates in metadata via recurring numbers) is clever but arrives pre-solved; Lia never confronts a trade-off or wrong turn. The piece feels premise-driven rather than character-driven, and the ending's moral ("We are still here") replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. The transformation test suggests the plot could transfer to different names and settings without altering its emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lia appears in every beat but her role is primarily observational and procedural. She notes, traces, hypothesizes, tests, enters, realizes, compiles, and logs—each action advances discovery without facing a meaningful constraint or cost. The fabricated post is a choice, but it succeeds immediately without complication. Her final vow to "guard the archive" is told rather than dramatized, and no prior turn hinges on a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patch appears early (resurfaced in an archived photo), returns in the vault file labeled 'Patch Origin,' and is stitched into Lia's final public post to redistribute the numbers. Its insignia functions as a visual anchor and a clue to the crew's method. The patch constrains Lia's search (she must trace its metadata) and charges the closure image as "a small thread of metal connecting humanity's past to its unending curiosity." Three beats, purposeful early-to-final arc, and closure linkage place it solidly in the 7.0–8.4 band, though its use remains somewhat passive—Lia observes and references it rather than handling or manipulating it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The missing persons dossier of the 2074 Starlink Expedition frames the dominant stake and drives every beat: metadata search, fabricated tribute, vault discovery, final message. The cold case is not merely thematic; it defines Lia's goal, her method (tracing the crew's embedded coordinates), and the closure revelation. Removing it would collapse the story's logic. However, the case never complicates—it unfolds linearly without forcing Lia to choose between competing leads or pay a price for progress. Strong setup, development, and closure participation, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is mentioned once in the opening sentence and recurs only as a summary phrase in the penultimate paragraph ("her brightly attentive watch"). It never constrains or enables a specific on-page action, and no cost or trade-off is tied to heightened attention versus, say, obsessive focus or fatigue. The trait functions as a label rather than a dramatized property that shapes choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lia's fabricated tribute post is a clear lie that tests her hypothesis and triggers the algorithm to redistribute the numbers. The action is signaled early, shapes the middle search (the algorithm flags and scatters the post, illuminating older threads), and is reprised at closure when she "deliberately let the lie of a fabricated tribute spread" again. Two distinct beats, causal pressure (the lie unlocks hidden files), and closure linkage. However, the lie succeeds without complication or cost—there is no friction, no second consequence, no moment where the fabrication threatens to backfire.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The 17‑42‑108 sequence appears in metadata, spikes in comments/likes/tags, is inserted into Lia's fabricated meme, cascades on the dusty terminal, serves as a checksum key to unlock the vault, and is redistributed in the final post to resurrect logs. The numbers drive at least four beats, constrain Lia's method (she must trace and replicate the pattern), and charge the closure by re-illuminating hidden threads. Removing the recurring-number mechanic would break the plot's logic. Strong setup, development, and closure participation push this into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The social network archive is not mere backdrop; it structures every beat. The vaulted rooms, server farms, metadata layers, hidden sublayer, and terminal all supply resources and constraints that shape Lia's search. The "wall of obsolete emojis" gates the concealed server, the terminal's file paths vanish when copied (forcing Lia to recognize the checksum pattern), and the archive's redistribution algorithm is the mechanism by which the crew's message spreads. The setting pressures choices, alters tactics, and charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" frames the cold case file's emergence but functions more as atmospheric phrasing than a temporal constraint. Time is vague throughout: Lia's search unfolds in an indeterminate span with no urgency or countdown. The "echo" returns as a motif (songs in the ship's halls, looping videos, "singing the echo of forgotten songs") but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The timeframe is present as theme and tone but does not pressure the plot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lia's desire to find where deleted files go is stated early ("her motivation to find where deleted files go was no longer an abstract curiosity but a lifeline to those lost voices") and drives every action. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction or competing wants. No moment forces Lia to choose between curiosity and caution, speed and thoroughness, or public revelation and archival secrecy. The desire shapes the plot but is never conflicted or tested with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" is coherent and sustained: "forgotten data like distant choir," "deleted files lingered in limbo," "the silence you felt as absence." The mood modulates subtly as Lia moves from curiosity to discovery to purpose, and the final image transforms absence into "quiet presence." The tone supports the accumulative design and charges the closure revelation. However, the effect is primarily atmospheric rather than a constraint that forces choice, and the single static mood (elegiac, archival) does not shift under pressure.</comment>
