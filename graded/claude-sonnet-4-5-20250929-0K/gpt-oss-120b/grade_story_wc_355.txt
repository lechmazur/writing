<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is labeled "eclectic pacifist" and "conductor of compassion" but performs no character-particular choices under pressure; he simply executes a predetermined ritual. Interiority is generic and inflated ("his intuition intuitively descriptive, painting the vibrations in his mind as ripples of copper, lavender, and old parchment"), relying on stock theatrical gestures rather than contradictory impulses. The final vow to "share these cataloged silences" arrives without internal conflict or visible cost, reading as declarative summary rather than earned change. Embodied emotion is absent; all reactions are performed for an implied audience rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: the workshop's purpose, the diary's ownership, and the protagonist's relationship to both remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The "quest" structure is told rather than dramatized; beats advance by theatrical description rather than causal linkage. The closure—diary pages revealing invisible ink when named silences are whispered—lacks on-page cost: nothing is foreclosed, no prior tactic fails, and the protagonist simply succeeds at his stated mission without friction. The piece reads Accumulative in aspiration (catalog of silences, crystal plates, naming ritual) but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the final rooftop scene adds fireworks and crowds without altering the protagonist's stance or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The workshop is vividly described ("iron ribs humming with unseen currents," "windows black as midnight parchment") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; tools hang passively, and the crystal plates appear without spatial grounding. The diary clasp and its mechanics are told rather than handled on the page. The rooftop appearance in the final third shifts location without transition or spatial choreography, and the fireworks crowd remains entirely abstract. Micro-setting elements (clasp, plates) are introduced but do not constrain the protagonist's choices or alter his tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"catalog the varieties of silence…the first step toward the path to empathy"—is abstract and never tested; the protagonist faces no opposition, failed attempt, or trade-off. The ritual with crystal plates succeeds immediately, the clasp opens without complication, and the whispered names cause ink to bloom on cue. No reversal or tightening occurs; the piece moves in a smooth escalation of success without price. The final vow and workshop invitation are declarative goals, not choices under pressure, and the crowds' gasping response is asserted rather than earned through on-page agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme—empathy via tuning frequencies and naming silence—is stated overtly throughout ("the path to empathy was not a road paved with grand gestures but a lattice of quiet recognitions") rather than emerging from events. The diary, clasp, and silences function as allegorical counters without concrete grounding; the "hush of sunrise over a battlefield, the quiet gasp of a child's first breath" are generic examples rather than story-specific particulars. The final paragraph delivers explicit moral instruction ("every silence would someday find its voice") that replaces scene pressure. No counter-reading or ambiguity is offered; the piece sermonizes its thesis without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is ornate and uniform, deploying elevated diction ("theatrical sincerity," "symphony of unheard moments") that never modulates under pressure or reflects a distinct perceptual signature. Filter verbs and abstract constructions dominate interiority ("He understood then," "He knew that to recover"). POV remains stable (single third-person) but psychic distance is consistently remote, narrating the protagonist's actions as performance rather than lived experience. The prose texture reads like allegorical summation rather than a character-particular way of noticing, and the register remains static across all beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("ripples of copper, lavender, and old parchment," "midnight roses," "lanterns guiding lost travelers") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops abound: "the path to empathy" is restated three times in variant phrasing, and "theatrical sincerity" bookends without added meaning. Template cadence dominates the middle section ("He whispered…and the ink blossomed," "He understood then," "He stepped…He bowed…He whispered"), applying an additional −0.5. Scaffold phrases ("the first step toward," "a collective breath released") and synonym churn ("hush," "quiet," "silence," "stillness") dull momentum. Information density is low; most sentences ornament rather than advance stakes or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise—pacifist catalogs silences to unlock empathy—closely follows allegorical quest templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious calculus (−1.0 derivative penalty). The crystal-plate tuning ritual, invisible ink, and rooftop epiphany are genre-standard devices executed without fresh synthesis. The protagonist's "eclectic" label and "theatrical sincerity" are asserted traits that do not generate particular speech, choice, or worldview. No bold structural or perspectival risk is taken; the piece progresses as a linear catalog of symbolic gestures. The ending's declaration that "every silence would someday find its voice" is a stock epiphany without earned specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "eclectic pacifist" is introduced in the opening line and labeled throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. He executes a predetermined ritual without friction, and his final vow is declarative rather than decision-driven. Present in setup and ending but ornamental in function; swappable with "empathetic inventor" or similar archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "locked diary clasp" appears early (paragraph 5) and returns at the climax (paragraph 10) when it glows and opens, then again in the ending (paragraph 19) when the diary's pages glow. However, its mechanics are told rather than handled; the protagonist does not physically manipulate the clasp across beats, and its "tarnished silver" and "hinges trembling" are decorative rather than causal. The clasp enables the central action but could be replaced with any locked container without altering the story's logic. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) without middle development caps eligibility at ~6.0, and the swappability and summary-only handling lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The path to empathy" is named explicitly in paragraph 4 and repeated in paragraphs 15 and 22, functioning as thematic label rather than on-page stake. The concept does not constrain the protagonist's choices or generate friction; he simply pursues cataloging silences as declared, and the path is summarized rather than tested. Present in setup and ending but ornamental; no felt cost or trade-off tied to this concept on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" appears once (paragraph 9: "his intuition intuitively descriptive, painting the vibrations") as a reflexive phrase that describes perception but does not constrain or enable action. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through a choice or tradeoff, and removing it would not alter any beat. Label-only mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Recover" drives the central action: the protagonist must "recover the contents" (paragraph 6) by tuning frequencies, and paragraphs 10–13 dramatize the recovery when the clasp opens and ink appears. Present in setup, middle, and ending, and the action is irreplaceable within the story's logic. However, the recovery succeeds without complication or failed attempt; no prior tactic is discarded, and the action does not narrow options or impose visible cost. One key turn shaped by this action, but the lack of friction or trade-off limits elevation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Tuning frequencies" is introduced in paragraph 6 ("he must tune frequencies, not of sound but of resonance") and dramatized in paragraphs 7–10 when the protagonist sets up crystal plates calibrated to vibrate. The method is specific and irreplaceable within the story's premise. However, it is introduced late (near the 30% mark), the mechanics are told rather than handled across beats, and the tuning succeeds immediately without adjustment or cost. Two-gate presence (middle development, ending participation) with late introduction and summary-only execution; the method matters but is not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is described richly in the opening paragraphs and recurs when "the workshop seemed to inhale" (paragraph 8) and "its doors creaked open" (paragraph 23). Setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the rooftop shift in the final third is unanchored spatially. Present in setup and ending, but postcard description dominates over tactical pressure. The workshop's "iron ribs" and hanging tools are decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"In the final stillness before fireworks ignite" appears in paragraph 18 and the fireworks burst in paragraph 20, but no clock is tracked and the timeframe does not tighten decisions. The fireworks function as backdrop for the climax rather than a deadline that alters tactics. The phrase is vivid but replaceable with "at dusk" or "during the festival" without structural impact. Present in ending only; late introduction and ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To catalog the varieties of silence" is stated as the protagonist's mission in paragraph 4 and repeated when he whispers the cataloged names in paragraph 13. The motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; the protagonist pursues it without friction, and success is immediate. Present in setup and ending but told-only; no on-page moment where the desire collides with another want or price. The motivation could be swapped for "to unlock hidden knowledge" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is named in paragraph 3 ("He moved with theatrical sincerity") and paragraph 16 ("With a theatrical sincerity that filled the room"), and the narrative voice sustains an elevated, performance-oriented register throughout. The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image distinctly. Present across beats but functions as atmospheric label rather than shaping perception or choice. The tone could be replaced with "solemn reverence" without altering the story's logic.</comment>
