<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is a probability professor's daughter and compulsive gambler, but these traits remain labels without embodied contradiction in scene. Her choices (placing a coin, lifting the lantern, writing a theorem) follow a treasure-hunt logic with no internal conflict or visible cost. The mother's heart attack is mentioned once and never pressures a single decision. Interiority consists of expository summary ("She knew the library's labyrinthine stacks hid...") rather than present-tense struggle, and the final "theorem that embraced both certainty and chance" is asserted without dramatization or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive by ~120 words, so no penalty there. The dominant lens appears Causal (puzzle-solving), but the climax—writing a theorem—is told rather than shown, with no visible cost or options reweighted on the page. The subway discovery and traversal occur without resistance, reversal, or missed opportunities; each cryptic scrawl simply opens the next door. Closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; Mara emerges "understanding" that knowledge exists in two halves, but this realization is narrated rather than enacted and costs nothing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and midsummer anchor time and place early. Sensory details (old paper, distant thunder, phosphorescent symbols) are present but decorative; none constrain a choice or alter tactics. The candle lantern's mica pane recurs but functions as a passive key rather than a spatial or material pressure. The underground tunnels and subway signage are described in summary ("old subway signage, each plaque scrawled in a different hand") without specific obstacles or spatial choreography that would affect Mara's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake is "to widen perspectives responsibly" and prove that probability can embrace chance, but this remains abstract and never tested on the page. Each beat—coin placement, lantern lift, tunnel traversal—succeeds without complication or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the path clears automatically when Mara performs the correct symbolic gesture. The final theorem is asserted without showing what Mara sacrificed, risked, or lost to achieve it, so escalation and cost are absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" and the interplay of certainty and chance are stated thematically in the opening and closing paragraphs, but the narrative never enacts a paradox or forces Mara into a choice where both options are equally clear and confounding. The clover melancholy tone and recurring symbols (candle, mica, ledger) are mentioned but do not shift meaning or reweight the premise. The final image—lighting the lantern "one last time" to guide the next wanderer—offers a tidy moral rather than earned ambiguity, and the theorem is a stated answer rather than a resonant question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic academic-quest rather than character-specific; Mara's way of noticing does not reflect her gambling compulsion or her father's ledger obsession in her diction or syntax. Register drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("lucid contradictions," "theoretically rebellious") that feels authorial rather than Mara's lived lexicon under pressure. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. Sentence rhythm is workmanlike but lacks modulation; stress does not compress or accelerate the prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence is pervasive: "She knew," "She felt," "She smiled," "She began," "She emerged," "She placed," "She knew" again. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences (e.g., "the knowledge inside was only half the story; the hidden subway held the other half"). Stock metaphors cluster without payoff: "rows of books seem like veins of possibility," "symbols formed a map," "equations in the language of rain." Filter verbs ("She felt," "She knew," "She understood") dull immediacy in every beat, including the closure. Prompt elements are name-checked rather than integrated, yielding a checklist texture. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, filter-verb stack −0.5, stock metaphors −0.4 = cumulative penalty ~1.9, capping in the 4s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—hidden subway map as key to probability puzzles—feels mechanically assembled from quest-fantasy and academic-mystery templates. Each beat (coin on seat, flame to mica, cryptic scrawl decipherment) follows a video-game logic of keys and doors without fresh synthesis. Mara's gambling compulsion and her mother's heart attack are mentioned but never complicate the treasure hunt. The "lucid contradictions" concept is stated rather than demonstrated, and the final theorem is a generic resolution that could fit any scholar-seeks-wisdom story with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present as a label (probability professor's daughter, compulsive gambler by inheritance) but these traits do not drive on-page choices or create turns. Mara's decisions follow puzzle logic unrelated to gambling or probability training. The character is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane appears in the opening, mid-story (flame to mica triggers tunnel symbols), and closing (lit "one last time"). Setup and closure gates met, but middle use is a passive key rather than a tactical constraint. The object is functional but replaceable with any symbolic light source.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Mentioned in the opening paragraph and closing paragraph as a thematic label, but never enacted on the page. No scene demonstrates a paradox that is "both clear and confounding." Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is a phrase whispered by colleagues (told, not shown) and never manifests in a visible tradeoff or constrained choice. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara traverses the underground tunnels in the middle section, guided by scrawls. This action is present and consumes several beats, but it is a linear walk without complication or tactical change; each step succeeds. The traversal does not create a turn or redefine options, so it is functional but replaceable with any quest-movement verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls appears in setup (coin on equation seat), middle (ratio 7:11, mica-flame instruction), and closure mention (ledger writing as continuation). The method is signaled and recurs, but each scrawl is solved instantly without cost or failed attempts. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer anchors the opening and closing; the underground subway is the middle setting. Both are described but neither pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The library's stacks and subway tunnels are backdrops. Setup and closure gates met, but no causal work beyond framing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The mother's heart attack is mentioned in the opening ("just arrived after the heart attack") and once mid-story ("the weight of her mother's recent collapse") but never tightens a decision or clock. Timeframe is present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is stated as motivation in the opening and echoed in the closing ("kept her grounded"), but never dramatized through a choice with competing costs. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" appears in the opening (caretaker humming), middle (equations "in the language of rain, each footfall echoing the clover melancholy"), and closing ("the clover melancholy of the rain lingered"). The tone recurs but remains a static mood label rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image. Functional reprise without causal work.</comment>
