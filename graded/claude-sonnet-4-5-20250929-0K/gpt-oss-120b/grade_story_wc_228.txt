<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The nostalgic painter's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("intimate aloofness," "temporary eternity") rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation to "find a place where time could hold a temporary eternity" reads as imposed poetic diction, not a grounded want with visible stakes. The final gathering of glowing shells feels unearned—no prior struggle or cost makes this reward legible. Micro-choices exist (lifting the shell, unlocking the chest) but they unfold without friction or competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (painter, quay, twilight) appear early. The cave discovery and hidden oasis function as spatial progression, but causality is weak: the painted seashell in the oasis matches the painter's palette by coincidence, and the key fits a chest the painter conveniently sealed years ago without prior setup. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the promise solidifies via the new canvas), but the cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift appears on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, held consistently, preventing a lower score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coastal cave tunnels and the hidden oasis are rendered with vivid sensory detail ("cool and scented with brine and ancient stone," "shafts of golden light"). The cavern pool and painted seashell constrain the discovery sequence and charge the final easel image. Spatial choreography through the labyrinth is clear on retracing. However, the quay and lighthouse setting do not pressure any mid-scene choice, and the studio false-wall detail arrives only in retrospective summary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring a secret promise to capture "temporary eternity"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The cave journey unfolds as exploration without obstacle; finding the key and chest is a gift, not a reversal earned by the painter's agency. No meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows options. The final act (painting the new canvas) recapitulates the opening routine with glowing shells added, but no visible price is paid and no live option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of temporary eternity emerges through the recurring seashell motif and the painter's vow. The final canvas image attempts resonance, but the journey lacks contradiction—every discovery affirms the painter's intent without complication. "Intimate aloofness" and "promise solidify, not as a burden but as a quiet oath" verge on label-driven abstraction rather than dramatized insight. The oasis-as-test claim ("a way for the sea to gauge whether I would remain detached enough") tells rather than enacts thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a consistent lyric register ("colors that seemed to linger longer than the tides themselves"). Perceptual signature is art-oriented (seascapes, brushstrokes, pigment). However, elevated diction ("intimate aloofness settle over my shoulders," "mouth of a coastal cave network") crowds nearly every sentence, flattening the rhythm and creating a uniform ornamental texture that does not modulate under pressure. No dialogue appears; psychic distance stays constant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "salty wind brushed," "cobblestones seemed to pulse," "tunnels twisted like the brushstrokes of a tempest," "canvas seemed to pulse." In peak discovery beats, metaphor stacks without variation (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "promised myself… to find a place" echoed by "promise guided my steps" and "promise solidified" create synonym churn (−0.4). Sentence openings vary, but information density is diluted by ornamental phrasing. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.9 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The nostalgic-painter-finds-magic-object premise follows a familiar quest-and-reward template without transformation. The painted seashell matching the painter's palette is convenient rather than causally grounded. The hidden chest behind a false wall and the key that fits it read as authorial arrangement, not organic discovery. Specificity in sensory detail (brine, stalactites, wax seal) does not overcome the derivative arc or the lack of a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; initiates the journey and paints the final canvas. However, most beats are observational—the painter reacts to discoveries rather than making decisions that narrow options. The retracing of steps is described as "a conscious choice rather than a mistake," but no on-page cost or competing impulse tests that claim. Functional but replaceable with any seeker-artist archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in the oasis discovery, is lifted with trembling fingers, carried back to the quay, and placed on the easel to guide the new painting. It returns with reweighted meaning (from found object to closure talisman). However, its matching colors are convenient rather than causally prepared, and its role in the final beat is descriptive ("glimmered in the lantern light") rather than decisively shaping the painter's choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named in the opening vow, echoed in the scroll's phrase ("eternity will linger within a breath"), and restated at closure ("temporary eternity I sought could be held"). The concept frames theme but does not constrain tactics or alter on-page options—the painter's methods (mixing paint, following tunnels, unlocking chest) proceed identically whether or not this phrase exists. It functions as a thematic label rather than a live stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Intimate aloofness" is declared once ("settle over my shoulders") and later claimed as a test criterion ("gauge whether I would remain detached enough"). No on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining a choice or enabling a tactic. The painter's behavior—reaching out, gathering shells, painting—reads as engaged rather than aloof. Label-only; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The reveal of the hidden compartment, the scroll, the key, and the painted chest's contents drives the oasis and studio beats. The cascade of glowing shells provides the material for the final painting. However, the reveal is triggered by lifting a seashell rather than a prior choice the painter made, and the chest's existence was not set up earlier—it appears in retrospective summary. Shapes two beats (oasis, studio) and contributes to closure, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The wrong turn into the cave network is signaled ("a wrong turn led me") and its mechanics matter: the labyrinthine tunnels create the discovery path and the retracing walk. The method appears early and shapes the middle journey. However, it does not constrain the painter's choices under pressure—the caves are traversed without obstacle—and any route to the oasis would serve the plot equally. Functional in one key sequence but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave network provides the spatial journey and the hidden oasis supplies the discovery site. The cavern's pool and stalactites create the micro-setting for the key find, and the tunnels' twists require retracing at closure. The setting pressures navigation (turning, emerging, retracing) and charges the final quay return image. Essential across setup, middle journey, and ending anchor; not fully indispensable because the discovery could occur in an alternate hidden location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mirror cracks" is mentioned in the opening and recalled once ("that night, after the mirror cracked, I had sealed the canvas"). It marks a before/after but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no countdown or constraint shapes the painter's pace through the caves or back to the studio. Present in setup and linked to backstory, but does not alter tactics. Replaceable with "after twilight" or any temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hidden promise is declared in the opening ("promised myself… to find a place"), echoed in the scroll, and restated at closure ("promised anew to keep the hidden oath"). It frames the painter's desire and is named as the driver. However, the promise is never dramatized in friction—no scene tests whether the painter might abandon it, and no cost is paid to honor it. The journey confirms rather than challenges the vow. Told rather than conflicted in choices.</comment>
