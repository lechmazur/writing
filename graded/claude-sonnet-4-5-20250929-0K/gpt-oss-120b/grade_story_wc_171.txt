<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's role as negotiator is established, but her interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("quiet ache," "fragile hope") and label-only emotions rather than embodied contradiction. The chieftains' transformation from armor-clanging warriors to sword-laying peacemakers happens too smoothly without on-page resistance or credible internal conflict. Micro-choices are present (placing the clipboard, writing terms) but lack the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would elevate characterization into the high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear situational lens: ritual negotiation under celestial witness. Orientation is delayed—who Lira is and what specific conflict she's resolving remain vague past the opening third. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (swords laid down, hymn sung), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible; the chieftains' capitulation feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality. One meaningful deepening occurs (weapons becoming symbols), sufficient for length, but the stakes never narrow options in a way that makes the resolution feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The terrace, firelight, marble, and celestial choreography are vivid but operate primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint. The ebony clipboard returns at closure and contrasts visually with the altar, achieving minimal charge. Sensory detail is selective (jasmine, cricket chorus, amber glow) but doesn't alter Lira's tactics or choices—she could negotiate anywhere with similar effect. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting supports tone but doesn't reach the 9+ gate of constraining a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving peace between warring clans—is signaled early but remains abstract; no specific clan grievance or tactical obstacle is dramatized. One tightening occurs when the first chieftain steps forward, yet his capitulation arrives without visible internal cost or prior resistance that the text must overcome. Pressure is coherent under a situational lens but lacks a meaningful reversal or trade-off that forecloses a live option. The resolution (swords laid down) reads as convenient convergence rather than agency-driven escalation with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from images (ebony clipboard, celestial dance, swords on altar) rather than statement, which is sound. However, the final paragraph lapses into summary and near-moralizing: "the price of redemption had been taken," "the first true step toward anchoring ideals in practice." The terrace-as-testament and the hymn's "flawed beauty" gesture toward resonance but lack the concrete particular that would reweight prior material without stating a lesson. Thematic echo penalties apply for the explain-everything closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Lira is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she notices the clipboard's grain, the scent of jasmine) and diction is controlled, if occasionally elevated ("operatively gentle" recurs as a constructed phrase). The prose modulates with ritual solemnity, appropriate to tone, but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under pressure. Dialogue is minimal (the hymn is described, not rendered); the piece relies on narration that occasionally slips into abstract register ("fragile magnificence of humanity's attempt") at the closure beat, weakening voice-driven immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "sky that spun lazily," "flawed beauty," "operatively gentle," "silver hush of distant moons," "dew falling." Mixed metaphors and register drift cluster in peak beats ("the price of redemption had been taken"; "the operatively gentle rhythm of her heartbeat echo the celestial choreography"). Paraphrase loops are evident: paragraph openings recycle "Lira [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was a flawed beauty," "seemed to listen," "feeling its cool grain") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; many sentences serve atmosphere over advancement, triggering momentum drag and artifact deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The negotiator-at-ritual premise is functional but recognizable; the clipboard-as-burden and swords-on-altar images are competent symbolic moves without fresh inflection. The celestial-dance framing and "flawed beauty" tone aim for lyric resonance but lean on familiar abstractions. Emotional specificity is limited by stock phrasing; the chieftains and Lira feel generic rather than individuated. No bold structural risk or transformation of trope elevates the material beyond template execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes decisions (places clipboard, writes terms, addresses assembly), satisfying setup and middle development. Her choices enable the ritual but the negotiation's substance remains offstage—no on-page persuasion or tactical adjustment in response to resistance. She observes and facilitates more than she drives key turns; the chieftains' capitulation happens around her rather than because of a specific choice she makes under pressure. Closure participation is present (she gathers the clipboard at dawn) but her agency there is minimal. Swappable with another mediator archetype; mid-band functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard is introduced early (setup), used at the altar to write terms (middle beat), and retrieved at dawn (closure participation). Its dark surface contrasts the marble altar, carrying symbolic weight, and it reappears in the final image. However, its specific properties (ebony grain, polished surface) don't constrain Lira's actions or alter tactics; a parchment or tablet would serve identically. The object is handled across three beats but remains symbolically functional rather than indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is named explicitly multiple times and frames the negotiation as a moral calculus (not coin, but willingness to lay down swords). It shapes the stated stakes but doesn't constrain on-page tactics—Lira's methods and the chieftains' choices could proceed under a different thematic label (e.g., "cost of peace"). The concept echoes at closure ("redemption's price was paid") but as theme summary rather than a mechanism that alters options. Present and thematically consistent but replaceable; functional mid-low integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is introduced early as Lira's defining attribute ("her presence was operatively gentle," "a voice that was both firm and operatively gentle," "the operatively gentle rhythm of her heartbeat"). It's repeated three times but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with visible cost. The term remains a label without dramatization—no scene shows her gentleness creating friction or requiring compromise. Label-only mention without causal pressure; ornamental use triggers low-band score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: Lira must "muster the courage to turn ritual into resolution" and later "muster compassion." The term frames internal effort but the story doesn't turn on this mustering—her courage isn't tested by a moment of doubt she must overcome on the page, and the chieftains' transformation isn't tied to her act of mustering. The action is present in setup and thematic reprise but swappable with "summon" or "gather"; causal role is weak. One-gate closure participation (final paragraph) elevates slightly but not enough for mid-high bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early (stone circle, altar, offerings, elders' whispers) and structures the entire scene: Lira performs the ritual of laying the clipboard, reading terms, and witnessing the sword-laying. The method shapes all major beats and defines the story's form. However, the mechanics of ritual—why this sequence compels the chieftains, what cost or taboo the ritual imposes—remain opaque. The ritual is setting-as-method rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present across setup, middle, and closure; essential to the frame but not irreplaceable in its specifics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is named in the opening and closing lines and provides the spatial anchor for the ritual. Midsummer is mentioned but doesn't tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The terrace supplies atmosphere (firelight, marble, sea breeze) but doesn't constrain Lira's choices—she could negotiate in a hall or grove with equivalent effect. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is absent (the terrace is stage, not pressure). Swappable setting trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The slow dance of celestial bodies" appears in the opening and is reprised metaphorically ("the celestial choreography," "the slow rhythm of the stars"). The timeframe is poetic but vague—no clock or urgency derives from the celestial motion. The passage of night to dawn marks elapsed time but doesn't alter tactics or narrow options. Ornamental framing without causal pressure; closure participation is metaphorical only. Late-reprise lyric use without middle constraint caps score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to anchor ideals in practice" is stated explicitly in the final third and summarized at closure ("the first true step toward anchoring ideals in practice"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices—no scene shows her torn between pragmatic compromise and principled stance. The motivation frames the negotiation's goal but doesn't create friction or visible cost on the page. Late introduction (past 40%) and summary-only treatment trigger cap at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is introduced early ("The night was a flawed beauty") and reprised in the chieftains' hymn ("a flawed beauty that rose with the sun"). Tone is coherent—lyric solemnity with imperfection—and modulates with ritual gravity. The phrase charges the final image by recasting imperfection as strength. However, the tone is stated twice rather than embodied through contradiction in diction or rhythm under pressure. Purposeful early–final reprise with thematic reweighting lifts score to mid-band; lack of mid-scene modulation and mechanical recurrence prevent higher reach.</comment>
