<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is declared early but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her interior reads as lyric abstraction—"vibration thrumming through the marrow of her bones"—rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure. The final placement of the stone feels like acceptance without visible cost or foreclosed path; we see no micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Emotional progression is summarized in metaphor rather than dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after extended description, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but causality is absent—Lira drifts, the stone "whispers," a corridor "unfurls," the book "offers" scent; no because/therefore linkage. The closure unit lacks visible cost: she "places the stone back" and steps out "ready to seed new stories," but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. Cost proof test fails; no sentence shows what she loses or gives up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is vivid in initial description—"labyrinthine," "winding corridors," "stone ribs"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The feather and stone are handled, but neither object limits choice or alters tactics; the stone simply reveals and the feather translates without friction. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image or force a trade-off, capping the 9-band. Sensory detail is present but decorative; the environment does not guide Lira's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the shape of home"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; each beat (feather on stone, corridor unfurls, book opens, scent of home) adds texture without narrowing options or raising cost. The resolution is handed to Lira by the stone and book rather than earned by her agency. Coincidence (stone's song, book's revelation) resolves the quest without protagonist decision, renunciation, or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—home as resonance rather than place—is asserted in the penultimate paragraph: "home was not a fixed point but a resonance." This is direct statement rather than emergent from scene particulars. The stone and feather recur but do not shift meaning; they perform the same function (reveal, translate) in each beat. The final image ("the shape of home became a melody") restates the thesis rather than offering a non-literal answer with cost. Thematic echo in the closing lines (−0.5 in Q5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent elevated diction ("mercury-glass seer," "pools of liquid metal," "night flowers"). However, psychic distance is unstable: the opening reads distant third, but later beats slide into free indirect ("She realized that the stone did not merely substitute reality nightly") without clear cue. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is maintained through metaphor-heavy filtering, though it flattens under pressure rather than sharpening. Single-POV baseline is met; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence layers metaphor ("silent cathedral," "pools of liquid metal," "seed forgotten memories," "coaxed into flame," "storm clouds," "shape of home," "night flowers," "stone ribs," "lungs of an ancient beast"). Mixed metaphors appear: the mountain's "stone ribs" both "expand like lungs" and emit a "hum." Register drift into abstract poetic diction throughout ("vibration thrumming through the marrow," "the texture of feather-light insight"). Paraphrase loops: "shape of home" recurs six times with synonym churn. Deductions for density overwriting (−0.6), mixed metaphor (−0.4), and loops (−0.4) = −1.4 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—lost language stone in a labyrinthine bookstore—combines familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. The emotional arc (lost → found, fragmented memory → coherent home) follows a template path. The feather-as-reading-tool and stone-as-map-of-feeling are decorative rather than conceptually integrated; swapping them for similar mystical objects would not alter the core movement. No bold structural risk; the piece proceeds in linear accumulation without surprise or hindsight inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and performs actions (brushes feather, presses deeper, opens book, places stone back), but none of these choices create key turns. She follows the stone's guidance without internal conflict or tactical shift. Her final action—placing the stone back—feels ceremonial rather than decisive, and no cost is visible. Functional but replaceable protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears early, is handled in multiple beats (feather brush, hum emission, placement on pedestal), and is present at closure. It drives revelation but does not constrain choice or impose cost; Lira never risks anything to use it. The stone's meaning does not reweight—it performs the same function (translate/reveal) in each beat. Setup + development + closure participation met, but causal pressure and cost connection absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Buried talents" are mentioned as "childish sketches" that "could be coaxed into flame," but this concept never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. Lira does not sketch, practice, or struggle with a talent; the phrase functions as metaphor for self-discovery. Ornamental use; easily removable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is declared in one sentence: "Each night, the seer allowed the stone to substitute reality, weaving dream-scapes." This trait does not constrain or enable on-page action with cost; the dreamscapes are summarized backstory, not present-tense scenes. Label-only mention without tactical consequence or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Seed" appears in three beats: the stone "seed[s] forgotten memories," breath "seeded the air with memories," and Lira steps out "ready to seed new stories." The action is metaphorical and passive (memories seed *into* her rather than her actively seeding). No major turn traces to this action; it could be replaced with "awaken" or "unlock" with minor edits. Swappable verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The feather is introduced early ("The texture of a feather, light as a sigh, became her method") and used in one beat: "She brushed the tip against its surface, and the symbols sang back." Its mechanics matter once—translation via texture—but it does not shape multiple attempts or constrain tactics. Present in closure reflection ("feather's texture as her guide") but not causally active there. Setup + one beat use; missing sustained development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is vividly described and frames the quest, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The "corridor she had never seen" unfurls via the stone's magic, not Lira's navigation. Spatial layout does not constrain; she drifts rather than wrestles with the labyrinth. Postcard description without tactical engagement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is mentioned once: "after remembering becomes painful, the image shattered like glass into shards of doubt." This phrase does not establish a timeframe or tighten decisions; it describes a psychological threshold without temporal pressure. No clock; no urgency. Abstract condition, not a tracked temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated early and recurs, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice. Lira follows the stone's path without friction between want and cost; no trade-off appears on the page. The motivation drives her forward but remains abstract—told rather than tested. One causal role (frames quest) but no visible stakes or price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears in four beats: "hidden thunder of stories," "distant thunder," "hidden thunder in the tone of the pages," "hidden thunder of the bookstore." The phrase recurs but does not modulate with pressure; it remains a static descriptor. Tone is consistent (lyric, elevated, mystical) but does not shift or charge the final image. Decorative motif without tonal escalation or reprise that reweights.</comment>
