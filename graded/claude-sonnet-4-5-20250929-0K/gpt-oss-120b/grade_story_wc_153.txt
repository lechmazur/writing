<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cryptic medium remains an abstraction throughout—motivations are declared ("fierce tenderness," "unsent letters") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on stock metaphors ("heavy as any physical weight") and therapeutic phrasing ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") that flatten rather than particularize her stance. The final "understanding" arrives as assertion without visible cost: she smiles and tucks away the shard, feeling dissolution rather than wrestling with the paradox her title promises. Agency reads passive; spirits and moonlight do the work while she observes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—beats loop through similar gestures (place shard, moonlight strikes, condensation forms, spirits sing) without meaningful tightening or cost. The Orientation Test anchors who/where by ~120 words, waiving that penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("the apology had never needed words") but the realization lands as narrated epiphany rather than an on-page shift that forecloses a path; the medium emerges unchanged, carrying the shard forward with no visible price paid. The "moment before deciding" is never crystallized into a legible choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with concrete imagery (roots as verses, humidity-slick glass, moonlit lagoon) and sensory detail distributed across the journey. However, setting remains decorative—the labyrinth shifts conveniently but never constrains a choice; the glass pane and water's edge serve as staging rather than resources that alter tactics. The shard's warmth and glow are mentioned repeatedly but do not pressure the protagonist's options at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing unsent letters—is signaled early but never tested. The protagonist moves through the labyrinth unopposed; spirits assist, moonlight heals, and condensation forms on cue. No reversal or tightening narrows options; each beat restates the same ritual without escalation. The breeze that scatters the letters might function as a complication, but spirits immediately catch and preserve them, erasing any cost. Resolution is convenience, not earned choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of apology and release emerges through recurring images (unsent letters, condensation script, fireflies) and the final claim that "the apology had never needed words, only the act of evoking truth." Yet this insight is stated rather than dramatized—no on-page friction tests whether silence or speech carries greater cost. The metaphor of letters-as-fireflies offers lyric resonance, but the piece never interrogates the paradox of "fierce tenderness" or the ethical weight of withholding versus revealing. Thematic ambiguity dissolves into tidy affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV maintains stable distance and registers a perceptual signature through metaphors (roots as verses, water as liquid glass). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("fierce tenderness," "eternal grace") that clash with embodied moments. No dialogue present. The narrator's certainty about the medium's internal states ("she realized," "she understood") reads assured but abstracts emotional progression rather than tracking sensory degradation or ambivalence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose carries vivid imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple beats recycle the structure: "She placed the shard... the moonlight struck... condensation formed." Metaphors stack without propulsion ("thin veil," "liquid glass," "soft hands") and some contradict (spirits "catch syllables" and "weave" them into soil—how?). Stock phrases recur: "fierce tenderness" appears six times, "unsent letters" eight, flattening rhythm. Figurative density in the final third slows momentum rather than accelerating closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—cryptic medium, healing shard, condensation messages—reads as an assembly of prompt-element tropes without transformation. The protagonist's journey retraces familiar beats: spiritual guide enters labyrinth, performs ritual, achieves cathartic release. No turn surprises in hindsight; the apology's resolution via moonlight and singing spirits follows template logic. Emotional specificity is sacrificed for ornamental atmosphere, and the "moment before deciding" never materializes into a non-obvious choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Cryptic medium is present throughout but makes no key choices—she observes, places objects, and receives epiphanies delivered by moonlight and spirits. The title "cryptic" is never dramatized; her decisions (walking forward, placing the shard) are ritual gestures without stakes or alternatives. Late first appearance in narrative agency context (−0.5), ornamental use without pressure (−0.8), swappable with any spiritual-guide archetype (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gargoyle's rainspout shard is handled across multiple beats (pressed to chest, placed on glass pane, placed at water's edge, tucked into cloak) and its healing property is activated by moonlight twice. However, its function is static—it always heals when moonlight strikes, offering no constraint or trade-off. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), but no causal pressure or cost tied to its use (−0.7), and its unique properties (gargoyle origin, rainspout shape) are never leveraged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unsent letters are thematically present and shape the stated mission, appearing as condensation script and transforming into fireflies at the end. Yet they remain abstract—no specific letter content, no named recipient, no on-page moment when the choice to send or withhold is tested. Early signal (+0.6), closure participation as fireflies (+0.7), but summary-only use without dramatized stakes (−0.8), swappable with any regret or confession (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heals in moonlight is demonstrated twice: shard glows and warms when moonlight strikes, "confirming the promise." The trait enables the ritual but imposes no cost or constraint—moonlight is abundant and cooperative. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), but no visible trade-off or choice altered by the healing mechanism (−0.8). The healing itself is metaphorical weight-lifting rather than a physical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evoke is the stated action ("began to evoke the buried voices") and produces the condensation script. The action occurs once at the glass pane and is implied again at the lagoon ("evoking truth"). It drives the ritual but is not a decision point—she always intended to evoke, and the act succeeds without friction. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), but easily swappable with "summon" or "manifest" (−0.7), and no escalation or cost tied to the evocation itself (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows is signaled early ("ready to receive messages in condensation on windows") and executed twice: once on the glass pane, once on the water-veil. The method is ornamental—condensation forms obligingly without mechanics or constraint. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), but the method imposes no difficulty or trade-off (−0.9), and the script is immediately scattered by wind then preserved by spirits, erasing any consequence (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits provides vivid setting and the spirits actively assist (singing syllables back into roots, gathering around water, guiding with light). Yet the labyrinth never obstructs—paths part "like soft hands," and spirits are unanimously supportive. Early signal (+0.8), closure participation as the labyrinth "sang a final hymn" (+0.7), but no causal pressure or resource constraint (−0.9), swappable with any mystical forest (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>In the space where an apology waits unspoken is invoked as thematic framing ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") but never functions as a temporal constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the medium moves at will through the labyrinth with no urgency or deadline. Mentioned once in exposition (−0.6), no middle development (cap 3.4), ornamental use without pressure (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>To find the moment before deciding is stated as the mission and restated at the midpoint ("she must first allow the unsent letters to speak"). Yet the "moment" is never dramatized—she observes the shard glow and concludes she has found it without on-page friction between wanting to decide and needing to wait. Early signal (+0.6), restated at midpoint (+0.4), but told-only with no conflicted choice (−0.8), and the ending declares success without showing the decision point (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fierce tenderness is repeated six times as a tonal label ("fierce tenderness guiding her," "fierce tenderness rise within," "fierce tenderness softening her gaze") and modulates from guidance to roar to smile. The tone is asserted rather than embodied through diction or rhythm—sentences remain consistently ornate and abstract regardless of pressure. Early signal (+0.6), closure participation as it "softens her gaze" (+0.7), but label-only without syntactic or perceptual shift under stress (−0.8), and repetition flattens rather than charges the effect (−0.5).</comment>
