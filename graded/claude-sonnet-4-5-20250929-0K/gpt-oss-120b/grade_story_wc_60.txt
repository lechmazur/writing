<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is introduced with evocative labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but these never constrain choices or generate internal conflict on the page. Her actions follow a linear quest without hesitation, doubt, or competing impulses—she simply performs each step the story requires. The final "smile" and pledge feel declared rather than earned through struggle, and her skepticism dissolves without dramatized cost. No embodied emotion or contradictory impulse acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when adequately early and tracks Mara through a quest structure, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the box opens, memories float away, fountains hum, and Mara smiles—nothing is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The "defiant hush" and "sidereal patience" remain atmospheric claims rather than constraints that narrow options. Under a causal lens (the piece teaches because/therefore in the breadcrumb sequence), the final act should cost something; under an accumulative lens, the ending should reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—neither occurs. The Orientation Test is satisfied, but closure validity is compromised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The city setting is evocative (cracked cobblestones, moss-draped alleyways, marble arch) and sensory details are vivid, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters Mara's tactics—she moves freely from fountain to plaza to alcove without friction. The stained glass box is described repeatedly but its physical properties (weight, facets, hinges) do not force trade-offs. Spatial choreography is clean and the world feels consistent, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, cost, or competing desire. Mara follows the breadcrumbs in a straight line; no reversal narrows her options, no tightening forces a trade-off. The box's "ancient reluctance" dissolves under "patient hands" without dramatized struggle, and the ending grants full success with no visible price. Pressure remains static throughout; the "defiant hush" is asserted in narration but not dramatized through on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges around memory, patience, and the transformation of skepticism, but the final image resolves into tidy affirmation: "belief could be forged from patient defiance" is near-platitude, and Mara's pledge to "guard the liberated memories" reads as an imposed moral rather than a resonant answer. The geese and fountains recur but do not reweight meaning—they simply bookend the quest. No counter-reading or genuine ambiguity lingers; the story tells its theme rather than earning it through contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, and the prose carries a distinct lyric-archaic texture ("sidereal patience," "petrichor," "defiant hush"). However, diction occasionally overreaches ("realistically imaginative spirit," "litany of lives yearning") without anchoring in Mara's concrete perception, and perceptual signature is weak—her way of noticing feels interchangeable with narrative decoration. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The register is consistent but lacks the specificities that would make this Mara's lens rather than the author's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten throughout: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (box opening, memory release) stacks metaphor without functional gain ("cascade of tiny lights...rose like fireflies...merged into a constellation...mirrored the migrating geese"). Figurative density in the climax obscures rather than sharpens the action. Paraphrase loops appear ("symbols...glowing," "glowing blue"; "forgotten fountains," "no longer forgotten but remembered"), and template cadence runs in multiple paragraphs ("She crouched...traced," "She placed...whispered," "She then followed...coaxed"). Sentence openings repeat ("The box," "The symbols," "The geese," "She...") without variation. These artifacts touch the closure beat and flatten momentum. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive pattern debt touching closure, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (liberating trapped memories via celestial-timed breadcrumbs) echoes common fantasy quest templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "luminous skeptic" who becomes a "keeper of light" follows a predictable arc from doubt to affirmation. Tropes (ancient artifacts, migrating omens, city awakening) are used without fresh inflection—swapping "stained glass box" for "crystal orb" or "geese" for "comet" would not alter the emotional or thematic work. No bold risk-taking heightens stakes; the story chooses median safety at each turn. Apply derivative premise friction −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her movements (crouching, tracing, placing, whispering, coaxing) drive each beat, but these are execution steps in a linear quest rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. Her "luminous skepticism" is mentioned but never constrains a choice—she acts with certainty from the first symbol to the final twist. Setup and development gates are met (she appears early and acts in middle beats), but closure participation is ornamental: she "stood amid the soft glow" and "smiled" without a causal decision. No visible cost is tied to her specific traits. Score in functional-but-replaceable band: 3.0 base, +0.4 beat involvement (two distinct beats: tracing symbols, opening box), −0.2 for ornamental closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early (setup gate met), is handled in two distinct beats (placing on pedestal, coaxing open; development gate met), and is present in the closure beat when it "cracked open, spilling...lights" (payoff gate met). All three gates satisfied, eligible for ≥6.1. However, its specific properties (facets, hinges, "ancient reluctance") do not constrain Mara's tactics—any container could serve the same plot function with minor edits. The box does not return with reweighted meaning; it simply succeeds at its declared purpose. Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 for swappability, +0.3 specificity (stained glass facets noted).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The concept "sidereal patience" is mentioned three times but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics—Mara does not struggle with impatience, does not face a timed choice that tests her patience, and the "rhythm of distant stars" remains metaphor without mechanical force. Setup gate is met (introduced early), but development and payoff gates fail: no middle choice is constrained by this concept, and closure succeeds without reference to patience as a cost or trade-off. The concept is ornamental theme-speak. Score: 3.0 base, +0.3 early mention, −0.5 ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" appears once as a label for Mara's "spirit" and once as a descriptor of the symbols' glow, but the trait never enables or constrains an action—no on-page moment shows Mara balancing realism with imagination, no cost or trade-off tied to this attribute. Setup gate fails (label only, no anchor in choice), development and payoff gates fail. Score: 3.0 base, −0.9 label-only, no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unstick" appears in two beats (the box "began to stick," then Mara "coaxed...and the sticking force uncoil"), framing the climactic action. Setup gate met (foreshadowed as the box's challenge), development and payoff gates met (the action occurs at closure). However, the mechanics are vague ("deft twist," "patient hands") and the action could be swapped for "unlock" or "open" with no loss of causal structure—no unique property of "unsticking" (versus opening, breaking, or releasing) alters the outcome. Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one distinct beat (the opening itself), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 swappability, +0.5 causal pressure (it gates success).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method "by following breadcrumbs" is signaled early ("learned that the box could be unstick only by following breadcrumbs left by the migrating geese"), shapes Mara's path through middle beats (tracing symbols, following the trail), and is referenced at closure ("the final breadcrumb"). All three gates met. However, the breadcrumbs are passive markers Mara simply notices and follows without friction—no wrong turn, no cost of choosing one crumb over another, no mechanical puzzle. The method is linear and easily swappable with "following clues" or "reading signs." Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure reference, −0.4 swappability, +0.5 causal pressure (it structures the quest), −0.3 summary-only (key involvement in middle beats is recounted in transit rather than dramatized with stakes).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "city of forgotten fountains" is established early (setup gate met) and present throughout (oldest fountain, central plaza, fountain basin, fountains humming at closure; payoff gate met), but the setting never pressures Mara's choices or supplies resources that alter outcome—she moves freely through alleyways and plazas without obstacle, and the fountains' "forgotten" state is purely descriptive until the ending declares them "remembered." Development gate weak: the setting stages action but does not constrain it. Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (the final fountain hum reweights mood), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 postcard description (evocative but inert), +0.4 specificity (cracked cobblestones, moss, marble arch noted).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "from the pause of migrating geese" is signaled early ("marked the moment when time itself slipped a gear") and anchors the quest's initiation, but the "pause" exerts no pressure on Mara's decisions—she does not race against the geese resuming flight, no timed choice narrows her options. The geese hover in stasis until closure, then "resumed their migration" as a thematic flourish. Setup gate met, development gate fails (no middle tactic shaped by time), payoff gate ornamental (the ending notes the pause's end but no cost ties to it). Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (geese resume at closure), −0.6 vague/untracked pressure (the pause is declared but not felt), +0.7 closure linkage (geese's departure marks renewal).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to liberate trapped memories" is stated early ("Mara's mission") and drives all her actions (tracing symbols, placing the box, whispering names, opening it). Setup and development gates met, payoff gate met (memories are liberated at closure). However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Mara never hesitates, weighs personal risk, or confronts a trade-off between liberating memories and another desire. The quest succeeds without friction. Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 told-only (the mission is declared, not tested by on-page conflict), +0.3 specificity (she whispers names, a concrete action).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The tone phrase "defiant hush" recurs four times (opening, mid-quest, climax, pledge) and attempts to frame the atmosphere, but the tone is asserted in narration ("defiant hush," "the city itself held its breath") rather than modulated through syntactic rhythm, choice under pressure, or sensory tension. The prose maintains a consistent lyric-archaic register but does not shift cadence to reflect escalating stakes—Mara's final "smile" and "pledge" carry the same tone as her initial "crouched beside the oldest fountain." Setup gate met, development and payoff gates weak (tone is static, not charged by closure). Score: 3.0 base, +0.8 setup (phrase seeded early), +0.4 one beat (phrase recurs at closure), −0.5 static mood (no modulation), +0.7 closure linkage (phrase appears in final third), −0.8 label-only (the tone is named, not embodied in rhythm or image choice).</comment>
