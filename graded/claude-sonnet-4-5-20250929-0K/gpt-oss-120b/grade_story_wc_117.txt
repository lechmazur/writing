<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora remains observant rather than conflicted; her purpose "to nurture lifelong wonder" is stated but never tested by competing goods or visible cost. The piece tells us she feels "cautious exuberance" but offers no embodied contradiction—no moment where her professional responsibility collides with personal doubt or forces a trade-off. The eclipse session proceeds frictionlessly, and her final whispered promise reads as affirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Liora, Sage Ridge, eclipse approach) land cleanly by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and lyric recurrence build toward the eclipse moment, then the final image of Liora watching from the ridge years later attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, no on-page cost is legible—Liora's legend status and the village's ritual adoption of curls feel like rewards, not foreclosures, and the "cautious exuberance" refrain does not reweight prior stakes with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge, the ancient oaks, and the eclipse twilight are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (dimming light, silver ring, humming roots). The locket and harp function as micro-setting objects, but neither constrains a choice; the locket rests near her pulse, the harp adapts to breathing, both ornamental rather than tactical. The final image of Liora on the ridge reuses the locale but does not charge it with new pressure or consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—nurturing wonder through music during the eclipse—is signaled early but never narrows options or imposes cost. Liora's adaptive melody proceeds without friction; no reversal tests her commitment, and the villagers' awe arrives as a gift rather than an earned outcome. The long-term coda (generations adopting the curl tradition) summarizes success without showing a trade-off or path foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through particulars (baby curl, adaptive melody, eclipse), and the piece resists overt moralizing in the main beats. However, the final two paragraphs tilt into direct thematic statement: "magic does not need grand gestures, only attentive hearts" and "ordinary magic is always within reach" summarize rather than let the image speak. The locket's return at closure reweights meaning only weakly, since it carried no prior conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction is purposefully lyric—"breath of the earth," "dreaming roots"—and the voice remains consistent across emotional beats. Perceptual signature is present (Liora notices music, breath, light), though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") stack in high-density passages without purpose, slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice-distinction bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but figurative density is high without taught pattern: "breath of the earth," "hands cradling the sky," "shadow pulsing like a living heart" cluster in adjacent beats, creating mild register drift into elevated diction. Paraphrase loops appear ("the notion of ordinary magic fascinated Liora, for she believed that the most profound wonders…" restates the keepsake's "ordinary magic" without adding pressure). Template cadence in the final third ("she taught children to hum…elders to tap…") and the repeated "cautious exuberance" refrain without escalation cost −0.6 cumulatively in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The music-therapist-during-eclipse frame is recognizable from workshop prompts; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational friction. Emotional beats (awe, fulfillment, legend) follow median safe choices without risk. The baby-curl-as-heirloom and the village adopting the ritual feel like template resolutions. One fresh inflection—the "gently adaptive melody" responding to listeners' breathing—offers specificity but is not developed under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora sets up, performs, and watches; her observations do not drive reversals. Present across all three gates (setup, eclipse beat, coda), but her choices are passive or affirming—no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in three beats (setup, eclipse moment, closing promise) and returns in the coda when newborns receive curls. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes cost; Liora places it "against her heart" but this act is ornamental. Swappable with any keepsake: −0.6. Lyric reprise reweights meaning weakly, lifting from low-5s to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named in paragraph one, echoed thematically throughout, and restated in the coda ("magic does not need grand gestures"). It frames expectation +0.6, but never alters on-page options or tactics—listeners simply receive wonder without friction. Swappable with "everyday wonder" or similar: −0.5. Present in closure as theme claim, not causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" appears as a label for the melody (paragraph five) and reprised for the oak roots' response (paragraph seventeen). Setup signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure echo +0.5. The melody "adjusted to each listener's breathing," but this enabling does not create a visible trade-off or cost. Label-only trait: −0.3. No middle constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Link" recurs six times: linking listeners' hearts to earth's pulse, linking curiosity to wonder, linking wonder to rhythm, linking generations. Early signal +0.7, pervasive across beats +1.4, closure participation ("linking its wonder") +1.0. However, it functions as thematic refrain rather than a discrete action that redefines options—swappable with "connect" or "weave": −0.6. The repetition charges the final image moderately, reaching low-6s via lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in paragraph one, structures the middle (twilight veil, silver ring, shadow pulse), and provides the temporal frame for the key music session. Setup +0.8, middle constraint (eclipse darkness enables the shared moment) +1.0, closure linkage (villagers remember "the eclipse" as the turning event) +1.2. The mechanics (shadow timing, dimming light) shape Liora's choice to begin and the listeners' inward turn. Specificity and irreplaceability (no substitute celestial event would carry the same communal charge) +0.6. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is named early and anchors the setting throughout; the ancient oaks frame the eclipse circle and reappear in the coda. Setup +0.6, spatial presence across beats +0.9, closure echo (Liora watches "from the ridge") +0.5. However, the ridge does not constrain tactics or supply a resource that alters outcome—postcard description without pressure: −0.5. Micro-setting (the body, harp, locket) also present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears as a poetic phrase anchoring one paragraph but does not track elapsed time or create a decision clock. The eclipse provides implicit temporal pressure (brief totality), yet the narrative does not dramatize urgency or a ticking constraint that alters Liora's moves. Vague and untracked: −0.8. Introduced early +0.4, but missing middle development (no beat where time shortage forces a trade-off): cap 3.4 per missing-middle rule, slight lift for closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To nurture lifelong wonder" is stated in paragraph fourteen and reprised in the coda. Setup arrives late (past midpoint): −0.4, capping at 4.6. However, it is present across two beats (fulfillment moment, teaching sessions) +0.9 and closure participation (the cycle continues) +0.7. Told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants: −0.5. Lyric treatment and thematic charge lift slightly within the late-arrival cap, landing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice (paragraphs seven and nineteen) but does not modulate—Liora feels it before and after the eclipse without tonal shift under pressure. Setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure reprise +0.5. Static mood rather than charged progression: −0.6. The tone does not deepen or complicate the final image; it is asserted rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm.</comment>
