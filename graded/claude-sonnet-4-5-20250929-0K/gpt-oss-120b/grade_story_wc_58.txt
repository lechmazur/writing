<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The traveler remains an abstraction throughout—his obituary-writing occupation is declared but never dramatizes a choice or contradiction. Interiority consists of elevated observations ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing") that read as thematic labels rather than embodied emotion under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; the ending simply repeats the opening stance without visible cost. The work gestures toward internal experience but delivers only poetic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: by ~120 words we know only "shadowed garden in autumn" with no clear spatial grounding or immediate stake. The piece unfolds as a single descriptive tableau rather than causally linked beats; the traveler arrives, observes, writes, and departs without any reversal or tightening that narrows options. Closure is a conceptual echo—"the world whispered back"—but no visible, felt, or conceptual cost is legible on the page; the final image reiterates the opening premise without reweighting it. Under an Accumulative lens the density never shifts decisively, and under Causal the because/therefore linkage is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The garden setting is evocatively described ("crumbling stone," "veined marble," "bruised violet" sky) and sensory detail is present across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop for lyric observation. The golden thread is handled twice but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a physical constraint that shapes action. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—is declared but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, complication, or cost narrows options; the traveler writes, the rose revives in his projection, and he continues unchanged. Agency is observation and notation, not decision with visible tradeoff. The ending ("ready to follow the map his own words had drawn") restates intent without dramatizing a price or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—healing through documentation, absence made present—is stated repeatedly in abstract diction ("latitude of grief," "longitude of hope," "geography of healing") rather than emerging from concrete events. The rose's revival in the traveler's projection offers a symbolic moment, but it resolves without friction or cost; the work explains its own metaphor instead of trusting image. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the consoling premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and employs a measured, elevated register throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into abstract poeticism ("intimate method that coaxed the shadows to whisper their stories") and summary phrasing that distances the reader from immediate perception. No dialogue is present to judge. Focalization is stable, but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; the prose reads as authorial lyricism rather than a traveler's embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows care—no typos, grammar is clean, sensory language is vivid—but pervasive overwriting and paraphrase loops dull momentum. Examples: "Each whisper was a vignette of a life paused" is immediately restated as "a vivid description of love left hanging"; "intimate projection" recurs three times; "geography of healing" appears five times without evolving meaning. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating decorative drag rather than propulsion. Template cadence in the final third ("He lifted… He wrote… He placed… He knew…") flattens rhythm. Apply −1.0 for loops and overwriting that obscure the closure image's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—a traveler writing obituaries for the living—offers a poetic hook, but the execution remains abstract and the emotional terrain generic (grief, hope, healing). The golden thread, shadowed garden, and reviving rose read as symbolic conveniences rather than irreplaceable particulars. Proximity to elegiac genre conventions (wanderer, autumn, ruins, consolation) is high; no fresh turn transforms the familiar material. The story could be recast with different proper nouns and metaphors without altering its emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The traveler is present throughout and performs actions (kneeling, holding the thread, writing), but these are observational gestures, not choices that create turns or alter stakes. His occupation is declared but never dramatized in a decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The thread appears in three beats: withdrawn from the diary, held aloft to project, and placed beside the rose at the end. It enables the projection method and returns in the closing image, satisfying setup and payoff. However, it could be swapped for any glowing object without structural loss; its palace-carpet origin is ornamental. Caps at 4.6 for swappability; beat involvement lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Explained absences is the story's theme, invoked repeatedly in abstract language ("obituaries for the living," "absences explained in the delicate embroidery of his prose"). It frames the traveler's stated purpose but does not constrain tactics or create a dilemma. Functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" operates as the narrative mode throughout—every paragraph is lush with imagery—but it does not function as a character trait that constrains or enables action with cost. Label-only application of the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears three times as a modifier for the traveler's method ("intimate method," "intimate projection") but the action itself—projecting presence—is never distinguished from ordinary observation or writing. Ornamental modifier without dramatized mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Projecting presence is mentioned twice as the means by which the thread "coaxed the shadows to whisper" and "spelled out names," but the mechanics are vague and the method does not shape attempts or generate complications. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shadowed garden anchors every beat, provides consistent sensory detail (leaves, statues, roses), and the wilted rose becomes the focus of the traveler's final act. The setting supplies the rose that revives and frames the closure image. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a lyric backdrop. Early setup, closure reprise, one beat involvement (the rose), but no causal pressure: mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is mentioned twice but functions as atmospheric background rather than a tightening clock. No decisions are shaped by temporal pressure; the phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The geography of healing is the traveler's stated goal, invoked in nearly every paragraph, and the final line reaffirms his readiness to continue. The motivation is present and consistent but never conflicted or tested; no friction between want and cost appears on the page. Functional label without dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor is signaled early ("his lonesome splendor grew") and the tone is consistently elegiac, measured, and solitary throughout. The final smile and solitary curve match the established mood. Coherence is high, but the tone remains static; no modulation under pressure or charge in the final image beyond restatement. Two-gate (setup, closure echo) without causal middle work.</comment>
