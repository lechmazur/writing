<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The courtesan remains abstract—a "paradox of purity and allure" whose choices never emerge from internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Motivation is declared ("resolved to defy") but not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; the untangling proceeds without visible cost or friction. Interiority consists of labeled states ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic cadence") rather than character-particular perception or contradictory impulses. The final vanishing forecloses no legible path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words; waived. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural inferred; the piece teaches a lyric, image-dense pattern. Closure unit: the sanctuary unlocks and the "lullaby shattered" moment attempts Conceptual Repricing (the city's conformity replaced by individual voices), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt consequence. The courtesan's vanishing reads as convenient exit rather than earned renunciation with visible price. Escalation occurs (threads untangled → echoes freed → city hears), yet the protagonist's agency in this tightening is mechanical rather than motivated by prior causality or constrained by persistent limits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism under starlight are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("air tasted of ice and ink," "snow muffling her footfalls"). The prism constrains the courtesan's action—she must untangle threads to unlock it—and charges the closure image with the cascade of light. However, the courtyard itself functions more as backdrop than as micro-setting that alters tactics; the snow and marble do not pressure choices beyond atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: defy the lullaby of conformity by unlocking the sanctuary. One meaningful tightening: the final golden thread releases, sanctuary erupts, city's lullaby shatters. Yet the escalation unfolds without visible trade-offs or persistent constraints shaping tactics; the courtesan untangles threads with patient grace but no on-page friction or cost that narrows options. Agency at closure is present (she releases the strand) but the consequence—city awakening—is told rather than shown through a protagonist choice that forecloses a path with felt price. Coincidence does not resolve, but the resolution feels abstract rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of conformity versus individual voice emerges through image (lullaby, echoes, sanctuary) rather than statement. The final image—"rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn"—attempts to reweigh prior material but slides into abstract moralizing rather than a non-literal, resonant answer grounded in particulars. The courtesan's internal arc (chaste paradox → defiant singer) is asserted more than dramatized through specific struggle. Subtext operates in the prism's mechanics and the "alarming serenity" tone, yet the ending's promise ("world forever changed") feels like summary rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (close third on the courtesan) with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated, lyric register ("between sigh and smile," "bodily poetic cadence") that suits the accumulative mode. However, diction often drifts into stock poeticism ("quiet hymn," "tapestry," "alchemy of sound") without character-particular perception. Filter verbs and abstract constructions ("she realized," "she felt") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure, and the narrator's perceptual signature is not selective or biased in a character-specific way.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence layers figurative language ("silver thread," "crystal chorus," "tapestry," "alchemy of sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels. Template cadence runs through repeated "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("a song that dulled ambition and smoothed dissent" / "lullaby of conformity humming through the city"). Stock metaphors ("threads of magic," "harvest of echoes") are not transformed through specific action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn"), triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—chaste courtesan unlocking a prism sanctuary to break conformity—combines familiar tropes (magical object, defiant artist, awakening the masses) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "harvest of echoes" and "untangling threads" images are poetic but generic; the story could swap the sanctuary for any symbol and the courtesan for any artist without structural change. The resolution (city awakens to individual voices) echoes common templates of rebellion without fresh inflection or earned hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Chaste courtesan: Setup (~para 1), Development (approaches prism, untangles threads ~mid), Payoff (sings, vanishes ~end). Two gates met, but decisions are abstract (resolved to defy, traced threads, began to sing) without on-page friction or cost. The trait "chaste" is decorative; "courtesan" does not constrain tactics. Causal pressure is weak—actions follow from role rather than from choices that narrow options. Closure participation is present but passive (she vanishes after the work is done). Swappable with "defiant artist" or "lone singer" with minor edits. Late penalty minimal (present early), but ornamental use and lack of visible cost lower the score. Two of three gates → eligible to ~6.0; ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6, no visible cost −0.4, one beat involvement +0.4. Final: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary: Setup (~para 2, legends mention it), Development (she touches it, untangles threads ~mid), Payoff (erupts in cascade of light ~end). All three gates met. Two distinct beats: (1) placing hand on prism, feeling pulse; (2) final golden thread release, eruption. Causal pressure moderate—prism's threads must be untangled to unlock harvest. Closure linkage strong—eruption shapes the ending image. Specificity high—facets, starlight, crystal chorus are irreplaceable. Cost connection weak—unlocking is patient work without visible trade-off. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, no visible cost −0.3. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Harvest of echoes: Setup (~para 2, legends mention), Development (echoes slip out as threads loosen ~mid), Payoff (harvest spills into sky ~end). All three gates met. The concept shapes tactics (must untangle to harvest) and appears in the ending. Two beats: (1) first echo slips out, (2) cascade spills. Causal pressure moderate—harvest is the goal. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate—"harvest of echoes" is vivid but slightly generic. Cost absent—no trade-off for harvesting. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, no cost −0.4, label-only at times −0.3. Final: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Bodily poetic: mentioned ~para 1 ("bodily poetic rhythm"), ~para 10 ("bodily poetic cadence"), ~end (implicit in singing). Setup gate met. Development gate weak—label appears but does not constrain action. Payoff weak—singing is the manifestation, but the trait's mechanics are never shown. One beat (singing) +0.4. No causal pressure or cost. Ornamental −0.7, label-only −0.3, swappable with "lyrical grace" −0.6. Final: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unlock: Setup (para 5, "unlock the harvest"), Development (untangling throughout mid), Payoff ("unlocking," "unlocked," "erupted" ~end). All three gates met. Action drives three beats: (1) tracing threads, (2) loosening silver thread, (3) releasing golden thread. Causal pressure strong—unlock is the necessary act. Closure linkage strong—final unlock triggers cascade. Specificity high—untangling and releasing are irreplaceable mechanics. Cost weak—no visible price for unlocking. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, no cost −0.3. Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Untangling threads: Setup (~para 5, "untangle the threads"), Development (tracing, coaxing, loosening ~mid), Payoff (final thread loosens ~end). All three gates met. Method shapes two beats: (1) tracing overlapping threads, (2) loosening strands. Causal pressure moderate—method is necessary to unlock. Closure linkage strong—final untangling triggers resolution. Specificity moderate—threads as mechanics are vivid but somewhat generic. Cost absent. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, no cost −0.4. Final: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Silver courtyard under snow: Setup (~para 1, opening image), Development (courtyard stones tremble ~mid), Payoff (courtyard bathed in light, snow shimmers ~end). All three gates met. Setting anchors two beats: (1) snow muffles footfalls, (2) stones vibrate with chorus. Causal pressure weak—courtyard is location but does not constrain tactics. Closure linkage moderate—courtyard is reprise in final image. Specificity moderate—silver and snow are vivid but not unique. No cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, no causal pressure −0.6, postcard tendency −0.4. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Between sigh and smile: mentioned ~para 2 ("between sigh and smile"), ~para 7 (repeated), ~final para (repeated). Setup gate met (early mention). Development gate missing—phrase does not constrain a choice or tighten the clock. Payoff weak—phrase recurs but does not reweigh meaning or charge the image. No beats driven by this timeframe. Lyric reprise present (early → final) +0.6. No causal pressure, no cost, ornamental −0.7, vague −0.5, missing development cap 3.4 applied → cap 3.4; adjustments within cap: ornamental −0.7, vague −0.5, reprise +0.6 = 1.8 before final round down. Final: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Defy the lullaby of conformity: Setup (~para 4, "resolved to defy"), Development (untangling to break monotony ~mid), Payoff (lullaby shattered ~end). All three gates met. Motivation shapes two beats: (1) resolution to act, (2) singing freed verses. Causal pressure moderate—desire drives plot. Closure linkage strong—lullaby's shattering is the climax. Specificity moderate—"lullaby of conformity" is vivid but slightly abstract. Cost absent—no on-page friction between want and price. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, told-only −0.6, no cost −0.4. Final: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Alarming serenity: Setup (~para 2, "alarming serenity"), Development (calm yet urgent ~mid), Payoff ("serene alarm echoing" ~end). All three gates met. Tone recurs in three mentions but does not modulate with pressure—remains static oxymoron. One beat charged (final image "serene alarm") +0.4. Closure linkage moderate—tone reprised at end +0.8. Specificity moderate—oxymoron is distinct +0.5. Static mood −0.5, label-only −0.3. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, one beat +0.4, static −0.5, label −0.3. Final: 4.7.</comment>
