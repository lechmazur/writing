<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "bridge generational wisdom" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The mending action itself embodies persistence, but interior conflict is absent—she moves smoothly from idea to execution without visible struggle or tradeoff. Mira remains a prop whose single question ("why the mender was so patient") invites exposition rather than pressure. The final choice lacks visible cost; the quartz clicks into place without friction, and the "feisty resolve" is label-only.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: who Lira is and where exactly she stands remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative—layered images of orchard, ribbon, quartz—but the closure lacks felt cost: the lenses simply "click into place" and the world "sharpens" without forfeiture or reconfiguration. Under Accumulative expectations, the ending needed a density break or cadence shift that reweighted prior material; instead it delivers declarative satisfaction ("triumph," "hope," "renewed pact") that tells rather than charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and purposeful, filtering light and supplying the "deciduous vows" motif that frames renewal. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, pine bench, canopy), and sensory detail is selective (gold light, cracked stained glass, fallen leaves). The setting does not constrain a choice or pressure the mending; it remains postcard backdrop rather than tactical element, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing fractured quartz lenses—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when the ribbon snag sparks the mending idea, but the escalation is cognitive rather than pressure-driven; no live option is foreclosed. The final assembly ("each tiny incision glowed") proceeds without reversal or visible price. Under Accumulative lens expectations, the lack of a deepening that changes options or a cost legible in the closure beat caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the orchard's cycle and the mending metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing until the final lines ("every fracture holds a seed of renewal"), which verge on platitude. The "accidental wisdom" motif recurs but remains abstract; no concrete image reweights prior material at closure. The ending declares triumph and pact rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, preventing entry to the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent past tense. Perceptual signature is present (guild teachings, orchard pulse, quartz light) but not character-particular; diction reads generic-literary rather than guild-mender specific. Mira's single line of dialogue is functional but does not carry subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") and passive constructions ("was summoned," "had been") dull immediacy in several beats without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "ancient quartz lenses" / "fractured quartz" / "cracked quartz lenses" / "quartz's inner light"; "deciduous vows" appears four times with minimal variation; "accidental wisdom" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs in the final third ("She placed… laid… whispered," "gathered… began," "lifted… felt"). Stock metaphors ("spark that refused to dim," "bruised with storm clouds," "quiet hymn of hope") cluster in closure beats. Cumulative line-level debt: paraphrase −0.2, template −0.5, stock metaphor in closure −0.4, total deduction ~−1.1, plus artifacts touch the final paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral premise offers a fresh visual, but the emotional arc (fractured tools → patient mending → wholeness) follows a template healing-journey structure without transformation. The "deciduous vows" and "accidental wisdom" remain thematic labels rather than specific lived detail that creates narrative surprise. The resolution is entirely positive with no enduring ambiguity or cost, trending toward the safety middle. Proximity to generic recovery narratives and the absence of a non-obvious moral calculus limit originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's choices are cognitive rather than pressure-driven: she decides to mend after the ribbon snags, gathers tools, and completes the repair without reversal. Setup is clear (first paragraph), middle development is present (kneeling to free the thorn, gathering bag contents), but closure participation is passive—she "lifted the lenses" and "felt the world sharpen" without a visible tradeoff. Two beats involved, but no causal narrowing of options or felt cost at closure. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, 4.0–4.9 range; two beats and early signal lift toward mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in three beats: tangled in vines (triggers the thorn incident), laid beside the lenses during mending, and clutched as "token of triumph" at closure. Setup early, development at midpoint (the snag sparks the mending idea), and closure reprise present. The ribbon's red color recurs with slight reweighting ("symbol of feisty resolve"), but its role is primarily symbolic rather than causal—removing it would not break story logic, only thematic resonance. Three beats and closure linkage support 7.0+ eligibility, but lack of irreplaceability and the ornamental final mention cap the score at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" appear four times as thematic echo (spring promises, whispered at dawn, Lira whispers them to lenses, orchard leaves whisper again at close) but do not constrain or enable a choice. Setup present (first paragraph), closure echo present (final paragraph), but no middle development—the vows are invoked, not enacted. The concept reads as metaphorical garnish rather than stake-shaping force. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise), lifting the score into 3.5–4.0 range, but swappability (could be "seasonal oaths" or "living covenant") and lack of causal pressure cap at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is stated once ("She felt endearingly feisty, a spark that refused to dim") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No visible tradeoff, no cost, no beat involvement beyond a single label. Ornamental use, no closure linkage, high swappability. Band 0.1–2.9: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Persist" is signaled early (grandmother's teaching: "to persist with patience"), dramatized in the middle (Lira gathers tools, "one careful stroke at a time"), and shapes the closure assembly ("each tiny incision glowed"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Two distinct beats (gathering and mending), causal pressure (persistence enables the repair), and closure linkage present. The action is specific enough that swapping it ("endure," "wait") would require rewriting beats. Lack of visible cost at closure and the ease of completion (no reversal, everything works) prevent entry to 8.5+ band. Score 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Forgotten bag contents—charcoal ink, a brass needle, powdered amber" are introduced at midpoint (thorn incident), gathered again for mending, and used in the final assembly. Setup at ~40% mark (late but not final third, −0.3), development present (gathering scene), payoff present (mending beat). Two beats, closure linkage, and specificity (the exact tools matter to the method) support 6+ eligibility. The tools are swappable (any mending kit would serve) and resolve a problem they did not help create (the breach happened off-page), capping at 6.4. Late introduction and swappability lower to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral setting is vivid and present throughout: aisles, rafters, canopy, cracked stained glass, pine bench. Setup immediate (first sentence), development continuous (light filters, leaves whisper), closure participation clear (the cathedral "sighed," they walk beneath branches). Three or more beats, early signal, and closure linkage present. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—it frames atmosphere rather than altering options. Postcard description without pressure caps the score below 7.0 per the rubric; exceptional atmospheric consistency and closure participation lift to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" anchors the story in a post-crisis timeframe but does not tighten decisions. The breach is mentioned twice (opening, near-end reflection) without shaping tactics or creating urgency. Setup present (first sentence), but no middle development (the breach is past) and no closure participation (the ending declares "deeper purpose" without temporal pressure). Time is vague rather than tracked; no live clock alters moves. Functional but replaceable: the story would work unchanged with "after years of searching" or similar. Band 3.0–4.9; lack of middle and closure gates caps at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To bridge generational wisdom" is stated early (Lira's motivation after the breach) and echoed at closure ("newfound pact between generations"), but it is told rather than dramatized. Setup present, closure echo present, but middle development is absent—no on-page choice tests the desire against a competing want or cost. The motivation does not create friction; Lira teaches Mira smoothly, and the resolution grants both wisdom and repair. Lyric reprise without conflict or tradeoff. Band 3.0–4.9; early signal and thematic closure lift to 4.9, but lack of friction and swappability prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" appears three times (opening paragraph, mid-story "accidental wisdom dripping," closing line "accidental wisdom settled like dust") and frames the story's tonal arc. Setup early, closure reprise present with slight reweighting ("settled like dust" adds finality). The tone reads coherent—gentle, reflective, hinting at unplanned insight—but does not modulate with pressure; the mood remains static across turns. One causal role (the ribbon snag sparks the idea), closure linkage strong, but the lack of tonal escalation or break caps the score in mid-band. Band 5.0–6.9; closure participation and thematic charge support 5.1.</comment>
