<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The caretaker remains abstract—a function rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Her "foxglove regret" is named but never dramatized as conflicting impulses forcing a choice; she simply repeats ritual without visible internal friction. The traveler appears as narrative furniture to receive a glass orchid, not to complicate or test her stance. No micro-choices alter tactics under pressure; the ending gesture (refilling the candle, whispering a name) loops the opening without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and atmospheric—who, where, when coalesce slowly through metaphor rather than concrete anchors by ~120 words, creating mild drift (−0.3). The piece accumulates texture but delivers no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost; the traveler's arrival and departure leave the caretaker's situation and options unchanged. The final paragraph restates the opening ritual ("refilled the candle, whispered a new name") without tightening, deepening, or reweighting stakes. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure unit fails to land a cadence shift or density break that charges the final image with felt or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo chime are vividly rendered and recur throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the caretaker moves freely, lighting candles and arranging chimes without spatial friction. The traveler's arrival does not test access, proximity, or resource scarcity. Sensory detail is rich but remains decorative rather than pressure-bearing, preventing entry into the 7+ band despite strong atmospheric specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to preserve the sound of forgotten names"—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, complication, or tightening narrows options; the caretaker performs her ritual nightly without interruption until a traveler conveniently arrives. The traveler's departure does not alter her resources, tactics, or emotional stance. Agency is observation and repetition without renunciation or visible cost, leaving escalation absent and closure inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through metaphor—extinct feelings, forgotten names, resurrected echoes—but remains abstract rather than grounded in concrete choice-cost friction. The final image (refilling the candle, whispering a name) restates the premise without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. "Foxglove regret" dissolves into "gratitude" via summary assertion rather than earned transformation, and the traveler's moment offers surface beauty without thematic tension or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush and consistent, but POV distance drifts into omniscient assertion ("the museum itself seemed to sigh," "deserted marvels no longer felt abandoned") without anchoring perception in the caretaker's embodied experience. The traveler's interiority appears suddenly ("felt the weight of each name settle like dew upon his tongue") despite no focalization cue. Diction is elevated and uniform—"gently systematic," "foxglove regret," "opal panes"—creating a homogenous register that flattens urgency under pressure and obscures individual perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" / "recorded the resonance" / "reclaimed names" / "echo of the long-forgotten song" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She moved… She was… She arranged… She listened… She recorded… She knew"). Stock metaphors—"shy star," "violet sorrow," "translucent organ"—accumulate without coherent vehicle logic. The final third restates the opening ritual across three sentences, dulling the closure beat. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings) and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—curator preserving extinct emotions in a sky-library—follows template "keeper of lost things" fantasy structures without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ritual (light candle, align chime, record sound) repeats without complication or risk. The traveler's arrival and gift exchange feel procedural rather than inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (glass flowers, wind chimes, cloud realms) appear as ornamental genre markers rather than particulars grounded in character stakes, and the ending offers no synthesis that reframes the opening question.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but passive. The caretaker observes, arranges, lights, and records without decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. The traveler interaction is reception rather than choice. No key turn traces to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo wind chime appears in the opening (lifted from ledge, placed by window), midpoint (aligned in a grid, sings in fractured harmony), and final beat (rings once as traveler departs). It returns with mild reweighting (solitary note vs. broken notes) but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. Lyric reprise without causal work caps ~6.3; swappability with another musical object and lack of cost linkage lower to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" (ancient statues, empty frames, nameless kings) are described in one paragraph as atmospheric backdrop. They do not shape stakes, alter tactics, or return at closure. Ornamental mention without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is named twice ("gently systematic shuffle," "gently systematic care") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The caretaker's movements are orderly, yet no scene shows her methodical approach foreclosing an impulse or forcing a tradeoff. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Light" appears in setup (candle beneath cracked tube, flame trembling), middle (candle glow refracting through glass orchids, casting halo), and ending (light dims, caretaker refills candle). It participates in ritual beats but does not drive a turn or redefine options; the traveler's arrival and departure proceed independently. Present across beats but functionally replaceable with another ritual element.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Echo of a long-forgotten song" is seeded early (melody sung by storm-namers, brushes against marvels) and recurs in middle and final sections (joining choir of resurrected echoes). The method is atmospheric signal rather than tactical mechanic—no scene shows how the echo constrains preservation attempts or alters the caretaker's choices. Lyric presence without causal pressure or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is established early and sustained throughout. However, it provides no spatial constraint, resource scarcity, or access friction that alters the caretaker's tactics. The traveler arrives and departs without the setting testing or complicating movement. Vivid postcard description without pressure-bearing function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" suggests duration but offers no live clock. "Each day she repeated the ritual" and "every night she would light a candle" are summary habits without scene-specific temporal anchors or tightening deadlines. Time is vague backdrop, not a force that narrows decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the sound of forgotten names" is stated in the opening and restated at closure ("whispered a new name into the bamboo"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—no scene shows what the caretaker sacrifices to continue, what tempts her to abandon the work, or friction between preservation and another desire. Present as thematic label without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named three times and described as "bittersweet ache," "violet sorrow," dissolving into "gratitude," then returning "in a softer shade." The tone is declared rather than modulated through syntax, rhythm, or image shift under pressure. Static mood label without embodied charge at the final beat.</comment>
