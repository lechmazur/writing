<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's blindness is mentioned but rarely constrains choices with visible cost; the repair proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses. Her whispered "Feel the lift" and thanking the mist read as performative rather than embodied under pressure. The colleague's entrance at the end is inert, adding headcount without pressure. Interior life remains surface-level; no contradictory wants act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory detail and motif (mist, light refraction, hummingbird) toward a final image of restored function and future promise. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the patch adheres "with a quiet sigh" without friction, and the ending recycles earlier mood rather than reconfiguring it with cost. Closure reads as affirmation, not transformation or renunciation with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The depot's mist, oil lamps, and steel girders are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara's auditory and tactile focus. The water basin and refracted light serve the repair method concretely. Spatial choreography (workbench, basin, rail tracks outside) remains clear. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond providing atmosphere; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the patch so the drone can navigate—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. The repair succeeds smoothly; no reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows options. The anchor's rising and the ship's departure run parallel to Mara's task without intersecting causally. Agency is limited to execution without renunciation or visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending/bridging and blind sight crafting futures emerges from particulars (water-refraction as measuring tool, vapor as partner). The final paragraph's "bridge between broken things and new horizons" and "luminous futures" edge toward stated moral rather than resonant image. Subtext operates in the whispered address to the drone and the mist's "quiet partnership," but the ending summarizes theme rather than letting the repaired wing's behavior answer the question non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (sound, vibration, imagined geometry) is consistent and purposeful. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("magnetic calm," "luminous futures") that feels imposed rather than rooted in her artisan idiom. The single line of direct address ("Feel the lift") carries subtext but stands alone. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied rhythm, but several lines loop conceptually: "magnetic calm" appears three times without reweighting; "the depot's mist" and "the hummingbird" recur as stems without added pressure. The phrase "turned ordinary illumination into a precise measuring tool" summarizes what has been shown. Some metaphoric reach ("promise of journeys," "bridge between broken things") elevates register without grounding in action. No major artifacts touch closure, but density and propulsion remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The blind artisan repairing a drone in a mist-coated depot offers surface freshness, but the execution follows a template: competent protagonist completes a task smoothly, reflects on larger meaning, prepares for the next iteration. Water-refraction as a measuring tool is specific, yet the repair faces no friction or constraint that would test ingenuity. The ending's "sanctuary where blind sight could craft luminous futures" abstracts the premise into platitude rather than transforming it through character cost or a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and performs the repair, but her choices do not create turns; the patch adheres without complication. Her blindness is labeled early and used to filter perception (sound, vibration), yet it does not force a visible trade-off or constrain a key decision. She appears in setup, middle, and ending but remains in execution mode rather than decision under pressure. Swappable with a sighted artisan using similar sensory cues with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (damage noted, patch applied, motor tested, hover observed), and appears in the final image. Its torn wing membrane drives the repair task, and the successful patch signals completion. However, the drone does not return with reweighted meaning or impose cost; it functions as the object-to-be-fixed rather than an agent that narrows options or charges closure. Present in all three gates but role is functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The repair shop frames the setting and Mara's occupation, anchoring the scene early. The workbench, basin, and tools are used on the page. Yet "repair shop" as a concept does not shape stakes or tactics with cost; the repair proceeds smoothly without resource limits, time pressure, or competing demands. It provides locale and job context but remains replaceable with any workspace requiring precision. Mentioned in setup and present throughout but does not alter options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Blindness is mentioned early ("blind from an accident years prior") and filters perception (sound, vibration, memory). Mara uses water-refraction and tactile feedback, techniques plausibly adapted to her condition. However, the attribute does not constrain a choice with visible cost; she completes the repair as smoothly as a sighted artisan might. The trait enriches characterization but does not drive a turn or impose a trade-off on the page. Present in setup and sensory beats but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The patch action is signaled early, occupies the middle (applying the polymer strip), and lands at closure (the wing holds under stress, drone hovers). The repair drives the scene's task-based structure. Yet the patch could be replaced with any precision repair (seal, weld, splice) without altering the emotional or thematic arc; the method is specific but the stakes and closure are not uniquely tied to "patch" as a concept. Present in all three gates with moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method—placing a basin of water, passing light through it, examining refraction to reveal curvature—is introduced early and used concretely in the middle ("shimmering beams traced delicate patterns," "mental map of where the patch must flex"). The technique is specific and plausible for Mara's blindness. However, it does not constrain or complicate a choice; the examination succeeds smoothly and the patch is applied without friction. Present in setup and development but does not shape the ending or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The depot is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (mist, steel beams, oil lamps, rail tracks) and filters perception throughout. The ambient fog, anchor vibrations, and lantern light provide texture. Yet the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Mara's task could proceed identically in any quiet workshop. The mist's "quiet partnership" is thematic but does not constrain tactics. Present in setup and ending but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The anchor lifting is mentioned three times (opening, midpoint, and ending with a cheer), marking the ship's maiden voyage as concurrent with Mara's repair. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the repair proceeds at Mara's own pace without a live clock. The anchor's rise functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present but passive; easily removed without changing the scene's logic or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to decode the drone's subtle feedback into direction for future autonomous navigation"—is stated explicitly midway and echoed at the end ("recorded the drone's response," "a data point for future designers"). Yet this desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Mara completes the repair smoothly; no friction between her want and a competing cost appears on the page. The motivation frames the task but does not drive a turn or face opposition. Present in setup and ending but swappable with simpler repair-completion motives.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "magnetic calm" appears three times (Mara's voice, her feeling at completion, and as closure framing) and is supported by the mist, soft hum, and quiet assurance throughout. Tone remains consistent and coherent. However, it does not modulate with pressure; no scene demands heightened urgency or doubt that the calm must overcome. The tone charges the final image thematically but does not reflect escalation or cost. Present in setup and ending; steady rather than dynamic under pressure.</comment>
