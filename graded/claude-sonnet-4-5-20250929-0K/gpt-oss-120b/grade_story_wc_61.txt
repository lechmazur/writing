<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks interiority and embodied emotion; she floats through the piece performing symbolic actions without internal contradiction or struggle. Motivation is declared ("vowed… to share light without using fire") but never tested by competing wants or costs. The "final choice" to let the gear fall reads as ceremonial rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible price. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The piece offers no causal linkage (because/therefore); events accumulate in a lyric register, but the lens remains ambiguous—neither fully Accumulative (no decisive pattern break or cadence shift) nor Situational (no crystallized stance). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the gear seeds "future dawns"), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page forfeit or reweighted option is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly described with sensory detail (violet hush, crystalline walls, luminous mist), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental feature narrows a choice or alters tactics. The gear's placement "at the heart of a luminous chrysalis" charges the final image modestly, earning minimal credit for micro-setting, but the setting never pressures the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to share light without using fire"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist executes her plan without friction. The sonar pinging grows louder and the garden responds cooperatively; no live choice forecloses a path. Agency is ceremonial performance, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (light without fire, generational memory) emerges through image and pattern, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line. The gear's "infinite approximation" functions as a bridge metaphor that recurs with modest shift. However, the ending whispers the theme aloud ("light could travel without fire, carried instead by memory, mathematics, and love"), flattening earned resonance with summary. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable (third limited), and diction is elevated and consistent. However, the prose lacks a character-specific perceptual signature; the narrator's way of noticing reads generic-lyric rather than filtered through the sentimentalist's priorities. Purposeful compression and patterned elision (lyric mode) are present, but the piece does not teach its pattern early enough to earn full waiver. Filter verbs ("feeling," "realized") appear without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Runs of parallel structure dominate: "The gear pulsed… The garden itself breathed… The pulse traveled… Each echo returned… The glow was not flame… The sonar pinging grew louder…" Template cadence (subject-verb-object declaratives) pervades without taught purpose, triggering −0.6. Figurative density is high but coherence wobbles: "equations that approximates infinity" (number agreement error), "troubling serenity" repeated without reweighting. Paraphrase loops appear: "allow her to transit love" / "her transit had bridged the unseen." Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, adding −0.3 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise (mystical garden, generational ritual, symbolic gear) relies on stock SFF-lyric templates without fresh inflection. The protagonist's vow and action follow a predictable arc with no surprising turn or complication. Emotional specificity is absent; "troubling serenity" and "mournful tides" are generic mood markers. The ending's promise ("seed future dawns") echoes familiar closure rhetoric without earned particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The sentimentalist is named and performs actions (carries the gear, places it, releases a pulse, hovers, whispers a final ping), but she makes no choices that alter tactics or narrow options. Observation and ceremonial movement dominate; no decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gear appears in the opening, is carried, placed at the chrysalis heart (middle beat), and falls into soil at closure. Its "infinite calculations" enable the sonar and "seed future dawns," giving it causal presence across three beats. However, its use is static ritual rather than evolving under pressure, and cost is not tied to the gear specifically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Generational patterns are mentioned repeatedly ("guided her lineage through epochs," "every generation… learned to ride," "the next generation") but function as thematic backdrop. They do not constrain or enable a present choice; the protagonist's actions would proceed identically without this element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" is etched on the gear and mentioned three times, but it remains a label. No on-page action demonstrates how approximation (vs. perfect calculation) constrains or enables tactics, and no cost is tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Transit" appears throughout: she vows to "transit love across epochs," rides "transit currents," and her final "transit had bridged the unseen." The term is present at closure, but the action is abstract and could be replaced with "bridge," "carry," or "send" with minor edits. No turn traces uniquely to transit; it functions as synonym churn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced early ("translate… into a choir of sonar pinging"), executed mid-story ("pulse traveled outward, its sonar pinging resonating"), and returns at closure ("whispered a final sonar ping"). It shapes the method of sharing light and participates in three beats, but its mechanics (why sonar vs. any broadcast) are not dramatized, and no cost or constraint is tied to this specific method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly described and anchors the piece spatially. The mist, petals, and chrysalis appear in multiple beats and the garden "responded" to the sonar. However, the setting does not pressure choices or alter tactics; it is backdrop. Minimal credit for the chrysalis as micro-setting that structures the gear's placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is poetic but vague. The story implies a single ritual sequence, but elapsed time is never tracked or used to tighten decisions. Petals fall slowly throughout; no live clock alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("to share light without using fire") is stated early and drives the protagonist's plan. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or friction. The vow is enacted without obstacle; no on-page cost tests the desire. Told and executed, not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" is named twice and evoked through imagery (mournful petals, sorrowful cadence, shadows of forgotten wars). The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly. The ending remains serene without the "troubling" dimension reshaping stakes.</comment>
