<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael remains a cipher throughout—his "calmly inventive" trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. The supposed revolution unfolds without on-page resistance, doubt, or visible cost to his person or relationships; guards simply "begin to question orders" in summary after the device activates. Interior life consists of stock phrases ("curiosity turned into quiet intrigue") rather than embodied contradiction. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early, but causality is decorative: Kael "traces" and "slips" and "places," yet no because/therefore chain tightens options—the cradle activates off-page and the revolution succeeds via summary ("the garrison began to question"). The closure unit lacks on-page cost; soldiers smile and share a winking hush, but no visible price, renunciation, or stance crystallization appears. Drive lens remains ambiguous (neither causal linkage nor accumulative density shift is legible), and the ending offers thematic assertion rather than a felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vivid architectural detail (translucent marble, phosphorescent pulse, glass roses) creates atmosphere but remains postcard description—none of it constrains Kael's choices or alters tactics. The blackout is declared but never pressures movement or resource; the sundial's "coded angles" are mentioned yet their mechanics don't shape on-page problem-solving. Sensory selection is generic (walls "humming," lamps "flickering") rather than POV-filtered or action-integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is declared but never tested by genuine opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows Kael's options; he moves freely through corridors, decodes at will, and the device succeeds without complication. The garrison's transformation is summarized in a single sentence with no dramatized resistance, doubt, or trade-off. Agency is absent: coincidence (the cradle's automatic effect) resolves the declared goal, and no on-page price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolution emerges through repeated motifs (bronze quill, winking hush, phosphorescent light), but the final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it—"revolution of light without flame" is the opening conceit echoed without transformation. The story favors abstract claims ("darkness could be sculpted into beauty") over scene-earned insight. No ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the tidy moral; epiphany is asserted ("the fort found its own pulse") rather than dramatized through Kael's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping, and diction remains elevated throughout ("luminous," "phosphorescent," "subtle key"). However, the prose converges on a single ornate register regardless of pressure—Kael's perceptual signature is indistinguishable from narratorial commentary, and his interior voice lacks character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("he had heard," "his curiosity turned") dull immediacy in several beats. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Pervasive ornamental phrasing and paraphrase loops flatten momentum: "calmly inventive precision" is restated as "calmly inventive yet urgent," then "ever calmly inventive"; "winking hush" recurs four times without evolving function. Template cadence runs dominate (multiple "the fort…" and "Kael…" sentence stems); stock metaphors ("shy fireflies," "sleeping giant") lack specificity. High figurative density in nearly every sentence (phosphorescent pulse, constellations, moss, canvas, lattice) obscures rather than sharpens action. Information density is low—beats summarize rather than advance ("he spent the blackout hours slipping…leaving coded marks" tells an entire sequence without dramatization).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—coded revolution via ancient device—draws from familiar templates (secret guardian, mysterious artifact, bloodless uprising) without transforming them through lived detail or moral calculus. The "winking hush" tone and bronze quill recur as ornament rather than constraint. Turns feel unmotivated rather than inevitable in hindsight; the sundial's mechanics and the cradle's "invisible currents" remain vague conveniences. Specific risk-taking is absent; the story hedges toward safe metaphorical resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Kael is named and his role (vigilant lock sentinel) frames the setup, but his observation never forces a consequential decision—he decodes, slips, and places without cost or complication. Present across beats but replaceable; any guardian figure could perform identical actions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in three beats (neck ornament, tracing tool, cradle key) and returns in the ending as "simple ornament," but its function is mechanical rather than causally necessary—any stylus or key could substitute. Late payoff (placed into cradle near end) does not transform prior material or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cradle of sparks is signaled early as rumor, sought via the sundial, and activated in the penultimate beat to resolve the stake. It drives one key turn (activation) and shapes the ending image, but its mechanics remain vague ("cascade of invisible currents") and the revolution it sparks is summarized rather than dramatized. Functional but lacks specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted three times as a label but never constrains or enables action with visible cost—Kael's decoding and movement proceed without friction or tradeoff. No on-page moment demonstrates invention under pressure or calm enabling a risky choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Intrigue is declared as Kael's method and the garrison's response, appearing in setup, middle beats (coded marks), and closure (soldiers "sharing secret smiles"). It shapes the tone but remains abstract—no specific act of intrigue forces a turn or cost. Swappable with "persuasion" or "inspiration" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial is introduced early, traced by Kael, and glows with an amber line to guide him to the cradle. Present across three beats, but its "coded angles" are asserted rather than demonstrated—the reader never sees how the angles encode the path, making it a convenient prop rather than a constraint on problem-solving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The luminous fort is detailed across all sections (phosphorescent walls, translucent marble, glass roses, vaulted basement) and frames the action spatially. The blackout setting complicates visibility but does not pressure Kael's tactics—he moves freely. The fort's architecture (sundial, cradle location) shapes one key turn, pushing it into functional territory, but removal of specific features (glass roses, balconies) would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The blackout is declared in the opening and mentioned as Kael's window ("spent the blackout hours"), ending with sunrise. It provides a time boundary but does not tighten decisions—no urgency or countdown alters Kael's moves, and the dawn arrival feels arbitrary rather than causally urgent. Functional frame but replaceable with "night" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to spark a silent revolution is stated early and resolved in summary at the end ("the garrison began to question orders"). It frames the stake but is never tested by conflicting wants or costs—no scene dramatizes Kael risking discovery or weighing the revolution's price. Told rather than shown through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Winking hush" recurs four times as descriptor (lamps, soldiers' eyes, Kael's final stance) but functions as thematic label rather than modulating pressure. Tone remains uniformly ornate and detached regardless of stakes; no cadence shift or intensification charges the final image. Present but ornamental.</comment>
