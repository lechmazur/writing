<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest remains a conceptual figure rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior life is replaced by abstract descriptions ("believed," "sensed," "knew") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final bow and walk into light read as symbolic gestures rather than choices earned by prior causality with visible cost. Agency is asserted through rhetorical framing rather than dramatized through conflicted action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but remain vague: "waning cathedral that floated between worlds" and "dimensional anchor" establish setting without concrete spatial grounding by ~120 words. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric compression, but the closure unit—the anchor steadying and the priest walking into light—lacks felt cost; the "possession waned" and "stillness shattered" are declared outcomes rather than on-page decisive changes with visible price. The loop pedal ritual generates atmosphere but does not narrow options or foreclose a path with dramatized consequence. Drive lens is accumulative but the ending reconfiguration feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cathedral, dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo palette provide vivid sensory anchors (vaulted arches, muted reverence, indigo spill like ink). Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single location, and the loop pedal and palette function as micro-setting objects. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or materially alter tactics—the priest's ritual proceeds without environmental friction. The setting decorates the mood but does not pressure the protagonist's stance at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the dimensional anchor's pull from consuming the priest's soul or shattering the veil—is signaled but never tested by an on-page choice that narrows options. The "clock of possession ticking" is mentioned but does not force a trade-off or escalate through protagonist agency. The loop pedal ritual deepens in description ("spiral of tonal prayer," "echo struck the core") yet the stillness shattering and possession waning are declared results rather than reversals driven by the priest's alteration or renunciation with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the accumulative lens that would foreclose a path or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (illuminating hidden assumptions, the power of focused perception) is stated explicitly ("his ritual aimed to illuminate hidden assumptions") rather than emerging from concrete events. The indigo hue functions as a symbolic marker but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure that reweights prior material at closure. The ending's "one color to illuminate the unseen" and "stillness can be unraveled and rebuilt" read as abstract thematic summaries rather than resonant, non-literal answers earned through particulars. Subtext is thin; rhetorical devices are named but not demonstrated in speech or silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance but adopts an elevated, abstract register ("resonant currents," "plumb the deepest layers of perception") that rarely grounds in the priest's particular perceptual signature. Diction is ornate and uniform across beats, with runs of abstract nouns and participial openers ("believing," "sensing," "lifting"). No dialogue appears. Rhetorical devices are claimed ("spoke in riddles and similes," "crafted through rhetorical devices") but not enacted on the page, creating a gap between assertion and execution. The voice reads generic-lyric rather than character-specific, and psychic distance does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unraveling of stillness" recurs across multiple beats without added pressure; "decorated with silence" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is visible in stacked "The [noun] [verb]" openers and participial chains. Figurative language is dense ("dripped like honey over stone," "spill like ink onto the air," "plunge down like a spear") but often mixed or strained, lowering clarity at peak beats. Stock metaphors (mirrors reflecting doubts, single color as heartbeat) replace concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere rather than advance situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("walked into the light" as cliché resolution), triggering Q7 cap and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest, dimensional anchor, and single-color palette offer a fresh conceptual frame, but execution relies on genre-familiar mystic-ritual patterns without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "hidden assumptions" and "unraveling stillness" remain abstract; the story does not follow their implications into concrete, irreversible consequences. The ending—priest walks into light after ritual succeeds—echoes template resolution without earned surprise. The piece synthesizes existing ideas (artist-mystic, metaphysical anchor, timed ritual) but does not pursue a bold, singular angle that reweights them in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that create key turns. The priest performs a ritual (tuning, pressing footswitch, whispering paradox, directing echo) but these actions proceed without friction, hesitation, or trade-off. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character observes and enacts atmosphere rather than driving causality. Missing setup as a decision-maker, missing middle development of choice under pressure, missing closure participation as an agent. Late penalty does not apply (present early), but ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (a generic mystic could replace with minor edits, −0.6), and lack of causal pressure (−1.0) lower the score. No cost is tied to the priest's identity; the role is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Artist's palette with one color (indigo) appears in beats 4, 11, and 21. First mention establishes metaphor ("heartbeat in the darkness"). Middle beat: priest lifts palette, "letting the solitary color spill like ink onto the air." Final beat: "the indigo hue flared brighter than any sunrise." The palette is described and metaphorically employed but never handled in a way that constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure. It functions as symbolic décor rather than a tool with mechanical consequence. Present across three beats (+0.4 per beat guidance, capped by ornamental penalty). Ornamental use (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.0), swappability (abstract "focused perception" could replace it, −0.6). Setup present, middle descriptive-only (missing development gate), payoff is thematic mention (missing closure participation). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Unraveled stillness appears in beat 8 ("sensed the unraveling of stillness"), beat 13 ("stillness began to unravel"), beat 18 ("anchor's pull… trying to anchor the disintegrating stillness"), and beat 20 ("the stillness shattered"). The concept names the central stake but does not shape on-page tactics or choices; it is an atmospheric condition the priest observes rather than a puzzle he navigates with specific tools or trade-offs. The "stillness" shattering is declared rather than earned through a decision that alters options. Present by first third (setup gate met). Middle mentions do not constrain choice (missing development gate). Closure beat mentions it as outcome, not active constraint (weak payoff). Ornamental thematic echo (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.0), swappability (generic "equilibrium" or "veil," −0.6). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Decorates with silence appears twice: beat 7 ("The cathedral itself seemed to decorate with silence") and beat 26 ("thanking the silence that had decorated the cathedral"). The phrase is poetic but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It describes atmospheric effect rather than a trait the priest must navigate or leverage. No setup as actionable attribute, no middle development, no closure cost. Ornamental poetic flourish (−0.8), label-only (−0.3), no causal work (−1.0). Missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plumb appears in beat 4 ("plumb the deepest layers of perception") and beat 19 ("intent on plumb the deepest echo of the anchor"). The verb describes the priest's intent but the action itself does not create a major turn or redefine options—he directs the loop pedal's echo downward, and the result (stillness shattering) is declared rather than earned through a choice with visible cost. Present by first third (setup), mentioned at climax (weak payoff), but the mechanics are metaphorical rather than tactical. Swappable with "probe," "sound," or "penetrate" with minor edits (−0.6). No felt cost tied to the act of plumbing (−0.8). Summary-only climax (the echo "struck the core" but we do not see the priest navigate friction or price, −0.6). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development of the action as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Rhetorical devices mentioned in beat 5 ("crafting his sermon through rhetorical devices") and beat 15 ("His words, crafted through rhetorical devices"). The method is named but never demonstrated—no example riddle, simile, or rhetorical structure appears in dialogue or enacted thought. The priest's paradox ("what is louder than a scream heard in a vacuum?") is a lone gesture, arriving late and without mechanical consequence. Missing setup (not present by first third as actionable method), missing middle development (no choice shaped by rhetorical mechanics), missing closure participation. Told-only (−0.8), ornamental claim (−0.8), late first functional mention at beat 14-15 (−0.4). Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor appears in beats 2, 13, 18, 24. Established early as hidden beneath altar stones and the target of the priest's ritual. The anchor's pull "grew stronger" (beat 18) and "steadied" (beat 24) but these are declared states rather than on-page resources or constraints that alter the priest's tactics. The priest does not navigate spatial properties or use the anchor as a tool; it is a fixed goal. Setup present (beat 2). Middle beat mentions it as growing threat but does not change tactics (weak development). Closure beat: anchor steadies, framing outcome but not shaping the final choice (weak payoff). Functional but largely static (−0.8), some causal role as the ritual's target (+0.4 for one beat involvement, +0.3 for closure linkage). Causal pressure is weak (anchor reacts rather than forcing priest's choice). Swappable with "rift," "gate," "nexus" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Before the possession completes appears in beat 9 ("before the possession completes, a moment would arrive") and beat 20 ("As the possession waned"). The timeframe is declared as a ticking clock but never tracked in beats that alter tactics. We do not see the priest racing against symptoms, rationing effort, or making trade-offs as time narrows. Setup present (beat 9). Middle: no visible urgency or time-pressure choice (missing development). Closure: possession "waned" as result, not deadline (weak payoff). Declared rather than dramatized (−0.8), no tactical constraint from the clock (−1.0), swappable with generic "before the ritual fails" (−0.6). Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>To illuminate hidden assumptions stated in beat 10 ("his ritual aimed to illuminate hidden assumptions") and beat 16 ("exposing the hidden assumptions that had shackled the city's heart"). The motivation is told but not dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between the priest's desire to illuminate and a competing want or cost. The ritual proceeds without visible struggle or sacrifice tied to this specific aim. Setup present as stated goal (beat 10). Middle: ritual actions occur but no choice tests the motivation against a price (missing development). Closure: result is declared ("hidden assumptions… exposed") but the priest's internal friction or cost is absent (weak payoff). Told-only (−0.8), no friction or trade-off (−1.0), swappable with "reveal truth" or "awaken the city" (−0.6). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Muffled clarity appears explicitly in beat 8 ("In that muffled clarity, the priest sensed…") and beat 17 ("the muffled clarity of truth reverberate through their bones"). The tone is named and somewhat enacted through diction (absorbed shouts, whispered paradox, silent colors) but does not modulate with pressure—language remains uniformly abstract and elevated across calm and climax beats. Setup present (beat 8 names the tone). Middle: tone is consistent but static (weak development). Closure: tone is reiterated as result rather than charging the final image through rhythm or cadence shift (weak payoff). Label-only in places (−0.3), static mood without modulation under pressure (−0.8), some atmospheric coherence (+0.5). Closure linkage is descriptive rather than charged by syntax or image shift (−0.4).</comment>
