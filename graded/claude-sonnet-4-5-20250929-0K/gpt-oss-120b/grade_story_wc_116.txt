<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation ("to witness change without judgment") is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. "Grips reality loosely" remains a lyric label without visible cost or tactical consequence. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace") instead of embodied contradiction. The final descent lacks a forfeited path or felt internal conflict that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density builds toward the refuge immersion. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the keeper steps into the refuge and writes "silence births renewal"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally legible in a forfeited option or visible sacrifice. One tightening (the descent) occurs, meeting minimum escalation, but causality is loose: the origami guides via metaphor, not mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail throughout: "phosphorescent thread," "damp parchment and earth," "obsidian refuge…glinting like a moonlit eye." Setting elements (library, catacombs, river) constrain the keeper's path and the origami acts as micro-setting compass. The overgrown vines and narrowing fissure pressure the descent spatially. However, the obsidian refuge itself remains a static symbolic backdrop rather than an object that mechanically alters a choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reach the refuge for regenerative silence. One meaningful tightening occurs (the descent through the fissure), and the keeper's agency is present (he chooses to burrow and step into the refuge). Cost, however, is abstract—"thoughts dissolve like ink"—without a visible forfeited option or tactical tradeoff. The phrase "silence births renewal" asserts resolution rather than showing a price paid or path foreclosed, leaving escalation functional but not viscerally charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme ("silence births renewal") emerges from the descent and refuge immersion. The final line avoids overt moralizing yet still borders on thematic summary. Recurring images (vines, origami, obsidian, river) create atmospheric texture, but the keeper's role as passive witness prevents the ending from posing a non-obvious moral calculus. The regenerative silence motif constrains the atmosphere but does not force a choice that reweights prior material with ambiguity or conceptual friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent perceptual signature: "grips reality loosely," "memory to slip like water." Diction is purposefully lyric and elevated, fitting the chronicle-keeper voice. However, multiple phrases ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace," "untold seasons") recur without functional variation, creating a template cadence. No dialogue present. The prose reads as authored rather than inhabited under pressure, with uniform syntactic rhythm across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity and sensory specificity are strong. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "regenerative silence" recurs five times without reweighting; "untold seasons" and "crumbling peace" are echoed without new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The keeper…," "He…," "The…" sentence openers across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("thoughts dissolve like ink," "silence births renewal") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for distributed artifacts; −0.3 additional for loops touching the closure paragraph ("crumbling peace" recurs in the final third). Baseline deduction totals −1.1, landing the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The overgrown-library-in-catacombs frame and origami-as-map offer atmospheric specificity. However, the premise (contemplative keeper seeks spiritual renewal in hidden refuge) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation through lived detail. The keeper's passivity (witness without decision) and the abstract regenerative-silence concept prevent the synthesis from feeling inevitable or risky. Emotional truth is present but not particularized to challenge expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. His descent is motivated externally (by the refuge's promise) rather than by conflicting wants. He observes, moves, and writes, but does not choose between competing goods or face a visible cost tied to his role. Introduced early (setup gate met), absent from middle development (no mid-scene choice), present at closure (writes the line). Two gates met; causal pressure minimal. Cap at ~6.0 per gate model; swappability and ornamental role lower to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge is mentioned early ("half-buried in the silt"), reappears at the keeper's descent ("its dark surface pulsing"), and he steps into it at closure. Three beats. However, it functions as a static destination rather than a tool whose properties shape tactics or impose cost. The refuge does not constrain a choice; the keeper simply enters and experiences abstract renewal. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle use that alters options). Eligible up to ~6.0; limited causal work caps at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named five times and frames the keeper's goal. However, it remains thematic rather than mechanical: it does not alter tactics or impose a visible tradeoff on the page. The keeper "senses" and "feels" it without a cost or forfeited path. Setup gate met (promise appears early), weak development (no mid-scene constraint), payoff gate met (final immersion). Two gates met; eligible up to ~6.0. Ornamental use and swappability (could be "transcendent stillness" without rewriting structure) lower to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is told once in paragraph four and allows "memory to slip like water," but no on-page action demonstrates a tactical consequence or cost. The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a unique move. Label-only mention; setup gate missed (appears after first third); no development or closure participation. Cap at 2.8 per missing-closure cap; label-only use lowers to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Burrow appears in the keeper's resolution ("resolved to burrow toward the water") and structures the descent through the fissure. The action enables the closure (reaching the refuge) and is signaled early. However, it could be replaced with "descend" or "tunnel" without structural change. Setup gate met, development gate met (the fissure passage), payoff gate met (arrival at refuge). All three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Moderate swappability and lack of unique properties cap at 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Origami swan is unfolded early, its "cryptic folds" guide the descent, the "phosphorescent thread" pulses in rhythm, and the keeper returns "through the cryptic folds" at the end. Three beats; setup, development, payoff gates all met. Mechanics are atmospheric rather than concrete (folds "whisper a map" without legible rules), and the swan is swappable with any symbolic compass. Eligible for ≥6.1 per three gates; moderate causal pressure but high swappability places at 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overgrown library is anchored immediately, the "shelves that grew like vines" and "narrow fissure" constrain the keeper's movement, and the "overgrown aisles" receive a final callback when the vines retract. Three beats across setup, development (spatial pressure during descent), and closure (the library "sighed"). The setting shapes the path and resonates at closure, meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the library enables rather than forces a hard choice. Eligible for ≥6.1; solid integration across beats lifts to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears once in paragraph four as atmospheric flavor. No ticking clock constrains decisions; the keeper's descent occurs in narrative present without temporal pressure. Setup gate missed (late mention), no development, no closure participation. Cap at 4.6 per missing-setup cap; ornamental use and lack of causal work lower to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to witness change without judgment" is told in paragraph three and frames the keeper's passive role. It does not create friction or force a choice between competing desires; the keeper simply enacts the stated goal without cost. Setup gate met (early signal), no development (no conflicted choice mid-scene), weak payoff (the final journal line restates the motivation without dramatized friction). Two gates met; eligible up to ~6.0. Told-only delivery and lack of on-page conflict lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is named twice (paragraphs 17 and 20) and modulates from the river's song to the library's final state. Tone coheres across the piece—lyric, meditative, atmospheric—and charges the ending image ("fragile as glass"). Setup gate met (first mention at midpoint), weak development, payoff gate met (final line). Two gates met; lyric reprise eligible up to ~6.3 per the allowance. However, the phrase is abstract and swappable ("fragile stillness"), and it does not impose cost. Moderate resonance with limited irreplaceability places at 5.3.</comment>
