<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lio's motivation ("to merge parallel timelines") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or meaningful internal conflict. His "resiliently positive grin" functions as a label rather than an embodied trait that constrains choice under pressure. The hourglass and radio feel like symbolic props rather than objects that reveal character through use; no micro-choices expose a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending grants him success without foreclosing a path or showing what he sacrifices to achieve it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building via sound and image), but the closure lacks visible cost—sand rises, passengers materialize, the ferry never vanishes again, all without a felt price. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive immediately, waiving that penalty, but the causal chain is weak: Lio broadcasts a tone and the ferry reappears because the story declares it so, not because prior causality earns it. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options; the resolution feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and starlight imagery are vivid and consistent, and the radio functions as a tool in the climax. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics; Lio never struggles with access, proximity, or environmental limits. Spatial choreography is clean (boots on deck, hourglass above helm), but the grotto remains a postcard backdrop rather than a pressure on action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (merging timelines to stop the ferry's disappearance) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Lio turns on the radio, and reality complies without resistance or cost. Coincidence resolves the problem (the radio's "intention" alone does the work), and no agency—decision, renunciation, endurance—forecloses a live path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "permanent transient" paradox and the hourglass imagery recur, but theme emerges through assertion ("time could be bent, not broken") rather than from dramatized events. The ending ("both an ending and a beginning") is a tidy summary that tells rather than shows resonance. The hourglass floats and the ferry returns with no moral calculus, no ambiguity, and no specific cost that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ardent," "spectral," "phosphorescent threads") that feels ornamental rather than rooted in Lio's perceptual signature. The prose has texture, but interior access remains thin—Lio observes and acts without much concrete thought or contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated imagery ("ribbons," "lattice of sound," "phosphorescent threads," "compass of reclaimed time"), flattening rhythm and creating density without information gain. Paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing commuter ferry" / "ferry that had never truly left," "paradox of permanence and transience" / "permanent transient heartbeat"). Template cadence in the middle third ("He believed… He lifted… He smiled…") and synonym churn ("resiliently positive" appears twice with identical phrasing) trigger −0.8 in Q7. Filter verbs ("feeling," "knowing") stack in reflective beats without voice motivation. The final image is clean, preventing further penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (vanishing ferry + sound restoring it) follows a familiar magic-realism template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious causality. The hourglass, radio, and "interconnected patterns" feel like a checklist of quirky elements rather than an organic synthesis. Emotional specificity is thin; Lio's "resiliently positive spirit" is asserted rather than earned through contradiction or struggle. No bold risk or fresh inflection distinguishes this from median genre work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lio ("ardent ferry deckhand") appears throughout and performs the radio broadcast, but his choices do not create meaningful turns—he executes a plan without friction, adaptation, or cost. His occupation is mentioned but does not constrain tactics or alter stakes. He is present in setup, middle, and ending, meeting the gate model's minimum, but swappability is high (any earnest character with the same goal would function identically). Score in the functional-but-replaceable band: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in three beats (pocket, lifted at climax, resting on console at end) and returns with reweighted meaning (sand rises, marking reversal). It is handled on the page and tied to the closure image, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it floats as a symbolic compass without altering Lio's options. Specificity is moderate (emptiness matters to the concept), but causal pressure is minimal. Score mid-band: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry frames the central problem (setup), drives Lio's broadcast action (middle), and reappears at the end (closure). It shapes stakes (stopping the vanishing) and tactics (using the radio to restore it). Removal would break the story's logic. Causal pressure is present but modest (the ferry never resists or complicates Lio's plan). Cost connection is weak (no visible sacrifice tied to its restoration). Score solid mid-band: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is mentioned twice as a label ("resiliently positive grin," "resiliently positive resolve") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It does not shape a choice or create friction; Lio's optimism is asserted, not dramatized through contradiction or tradeoff. Present in setup and ending (reprise in passengers' faces), but ornamental. Score low: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio broadcast is the pivotal action: Lio turns it on, it sends resonance across the water, and the ferry reappears. Present in setup (antique radio on deck), executed in the middle climax, and acknowledged at the end ("kept the radio close"). It drives the major turn and is irreplaceable (no other tool could produce "interconnected patterns of sound"). Cost is implied (Lio must maintain the broadcast), but not dramatized. Score upper mid-band: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns of intention and sound" is named early and the radio's "lattice of sound" attempts to instantiate it at the climax, meeting setup and middle gates. However, the mechanics are vague—how patterns merge timelines is asserted, not shown through trial or adaptation. The method does not constrain attempts or impose cost; it succeeds on first try without friction. Swappable with "magic resonance" or similar. Score functional-but-replaceable: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under starlight anchors the setting from the opening and recurs in the final reflection ("night in the spectral grotto"). It provides vivid atmosphere (mist, starlight, water swirling) and houses the climax. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics—Lio could broadcast from any location with similar effect. Specificity is high, but causal work is low. Score mid-band: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is mentioned in the setup ("ferry only disappeared when clocks ran sideways") and implied at the climax ("reversal of the vanished hour"), but it does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Time remains abstract and untracked; no live clock creates urgency or alters moves. The phrase functions as flavor text rather than a mechanical constraint. Score low: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Lio's motivation "to merge parallel timelines" is stated early and drives his broadcast action. It appears in setup, middle (whispered wish), and ending reflection. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting desires or visible cost—Lio pursues it without friction, sacrifice, or tradeoff. The motivation is told rather than shown in choices that foreclose a path. Score functional-but-replaceable: 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" appears as a paradox in the middle ("paradox of permanence and transience") and the ending ("permanent transient heartbeat"). Tone is lyric and dreamlike throughout, modulating slightly at the climax (more urgent phrasing, shorter beats), then settling into reflection. It charges the final image but does not create friction or constrain choice. Coherence is high, but pressure application is moderate. Score mid-band: 4.6.</comment>
