<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The jewelry maker's interiority is highly abstract and label-driven throughout ("desolation," "quiet fire," "subdued ardor") without embodied contradictions or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy under pressure. Her transformation from grief to light-keeper is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; the shift feels thematic rather than psychological. The rose-revival moment reads as symbolic action without clear decision or trade-off, and visitors arrive as passive recipients rather than forces requiring choice. No genuine internal conflict constrains her final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The closure unit—she becomes a "keeper of light" who guides others—lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The escalation follows a template: discovery → tracing → revival → teaching, with each step resolved immediately. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality is loose: the stencil "promises" rebirth without constraint, the rose blooms via traced intention without resistance, and the origami method appears fully formed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image repeats rather than reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid in initial imagery ("brass lenses and ancient maps," "charts that plotted the stars...by intention"), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The balcony rose and telescope slots are postcard details; no spatial or environmental pressure shapes her choices. The body and tools (vellum, origami, copper-stained fingers) are mentioned but do not alter tactics or charge the final image in a way that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching withering to bloom—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Each step (find stencil, trace coordinates, revive rose, scatter cranes) succeeds without reversal or meaningful tightening. The rose's revival and the visitors' arrival are granted rather than earned through agency or sacrifice. No live trade-off or foreclosed option appears; the narrative accumulates images of renewal without escalation or a choice that narrows her path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of intention lifting veils to transform grief emerges clearly, but the final image states rather than reweights it: "every ending was merely a fold waiting to be opened" and the smile summarizing her mission read as thesis delivery. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and "curtains of intention" recur as motifs without evolving meaning or friction. The piece avoids moralizing in dialogue but the ending paragraph articulates the thematic claim directly, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("subdued ardor," "phosphorescent glow," "quiet oath") and stable third-limited POV without head-hopping. However, diction is uniform and leans decorative; the narrator's perceptual signature does not shift under pressure or reveal character-specific bias. Template cadence appears in runs like "She decided...she would...she would...Each crane was..." and figurative density (veils, curtains, filaments, constellations) pervades without modulation, flattening urgency across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("curtains of intention," "filament of intention," "thread of intention," "veil," "constellation," "glow"), creating metaphor fatigue and register drift away from embodied perception. Paraphrase loops appear: the stencil's promise is restated across three beats without added pressure, and the final two paragraphs recycle "coordinates," "crane," and "curtains" in near-synonym churn. Sentence stems repeat ("She decided...she would," "The coordinates led...she knelt...she traced") across multiple paragraphs. Information density is low; many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—grief-to-light transformation via symbolic crafting—is familiar, and the execution follows a template arc without fresh inflection. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and "curtains of intention" are intriguing phrases but remain abstract rather than grounded in specific world logic or moral calculus. The origami-coordinates method and observatory setting feel ornamental rather than integral; a near-synonym setting (library, garden) would support the same arc. No bold risk or unexpected synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The mourning jewelry maker is present throughout but her choices are declarative rather than causal: she "decided" to leave cranes, "traced" the stencil, "placed" a final crane. No on-page decision alters tactics or incurs visible cost; her transformation is narrated rather than dramatized through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in the opening third, is traced onto the rose's stem at midpoint, and "shimmers like distant constellations" in the final paragraph. However, it functions as a passive symbol rather than a tool that constrains or enables choice; it could be replaced by any map or pattern with minor edits. No cost or trade-off ties to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is introduced early, repeated as metaphor across multiple beats, and echoed in the final paragraph. Yet it remains thematic language rather than a constraint that shapes on-page action: no choice hinges on pulling back a curtain, and no cost is tied to the concept. Swappable with "veils of purpose" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is applied to the glow and the cranes' paper, recurring across three beats. It functions as atmospheric paradox without constraining action or enabling a specific tactic. The trait is descriptive rather than causal; no choice or trade-off depends on its genuinely-artificial quality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears repeatedly (lantern illuminates vellum, lines illuminate path, rose's glow, observatory lenses catch inner glow, jewelry maker as keeper of light). It structures the narrative arc but is broadly metaphorical; the revival, teaching, and final transformation could be reframed around "awaken" or "revive" with minor edits. Present in closure but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The origami-figures-with-coordinates method is signaled in the first third, executed at midpoint (crane in telescope slot, thread traces coordinates), and scattered across the floor by the ending, where visitors follow them to gardens. The method shapes two distinct beats and appears in the final image, though the mechanics (how coordinates lead to gardens, how others decode them) remain vague. Causal role is mid-level.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is established early with vivid detail (dome, brass lenses, furnace, balcony) and houses the entire arc. Yet it functions as atmospheric container rather than constraint: no spatial or resource pressure alters her choices. The telescope slot is used once; no other observatory feature shapes tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is mentioned in the opening line ("reached the bottom of every well") but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The narrative unfolds in a timeless, contemplative mode with no live clock or pressure from the post-crisis moment. The past state is context, not a force that shapes present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is stated explicitly and drives the surface goal (revive rose, guide others). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through friction: no conflicting desire or cost tests her commitment. She succeeds at each step without trade-off or renunciation, so the motivation shapes direction but not choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is named once ("whispered a quiet oath of subdued ardor") and the tone remains elevated and contemplative throughout, matching the phrase. However, tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly; the contemplative register is static. The match is coherent but not dynamic.</comment>
