<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is introduced with poetic description but no interiority or embodied emotion. Her actions follow a mechanical sequence—finds tickets, uses lens, projects images—without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a single micro-choice under pressure. The ending claims she "felt a rare peace" but this state is asserted, not dramatized through embodied perception or a renunciation that forecloses a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the protagonist passively facilitates revelation without personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who (Mara), where (forecourt), and when (after rain, dusk) anchor by ~60 words, waiving the penalty. However, causality is opaque: cryptic doodles "lead her" to the theater without shown decision-making; the lens "amplifies the trembling honesty of the walls" through undefined mechanics; projections cause townspeople to "understand" off-page. The closure unit—townspeople gather, see lingering light, understand honesty freed them—occurs off-page and is summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light/honesty images) but the final reweighting lacks an on-page moment where cost or pressure crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forecourt is vividly described with rain, puddles, and phosphorescent ink, and the lens device is handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (forecourt → fountain → theater backstage → forecourt). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a backdrop for Mara's mechanical progression. The final image—light on stones—charges atmosphere but does not shape the protagonist's decision or options, keeping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to thaw mistrust with transparency"—is declared early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Mara's sequence is linear (find tickets → use lens → project images → town understands). The resolution happens off-page when "the townsfolk gathered later" and "understood," with no protagonist agency, visible cost, or trade-off dramatized in scene. Coincidence (cryptic tickets left on a bench) initiates the action, and the lens solves the problem it did not help create, undercutting earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of honesty/transparency is repeated in abstract declarations: "freed by honesty," "transparency," "thaw mistrust," "pact of openness." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "true clarity need not be shouted, for it shines ambiguously clear even in the deepest night." No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; the registrar observes rather than wrestles with a question. The lens and light function as symbolic conveniences introduced late to harvest thematic resonance without prior particulars that constrain or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is ornate and uniform ("origami," "phosphorescence," "sentinel," "ambiguously clear" repeated) but consistent, signaling a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic; Mara's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific bias. Sentences often open with "She" or "The" in template cadence: "She lifted the lens... She placed the lens... She recorded the event... She noticed..." Heavy filter-verb reliance ("felt a rare peace," "saw the faces") dulls immediacy at emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "ambiguously clear" appears four times; "eavesdrop" recurs without new meaning; "resonant hush" bookends without evolution. Template cadence: "She lifted... She placed... She recorded... She noticed..." across consecutive beats. Purple prose stacks modifiers: "quiet night registrar," "crystal whispering forecourt," "trembling honesty of the walls." Mixed metaphors: "thoughts folded like origami" (solid/flat confusion), walls with "trembling honesty" (anthropomorphism without grounding). Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger −1.2 in Q7 (loops, template runs, metaphor muddle).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—magical lens reveals hidden truths—is a recognizable "truth-revealer" template without transformation. The registrar observes and facilitates rather than wrestling with moral calculus or personal cost. Cryptic doodles, phosphorescent ink, and projector lens are ornamental world-building tokens that do not synthesize into a fresh angle. The ending's explicit moral ("true clarity need not be shouted") reads as sermonic closure rather than earned specificity. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is named early and present across all beats. However, she makes no key choice; the tickets summon her, the lens reveals truth mechanically, and the townspeople's transformation occurs off-page. She observes and records but does not decide under pressure or alter tactics. Present in closure but passive, scoring low for causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lens appears early (~15% in "lifted the lens from projector"), is used in two distinct beats (theater backstage, final forecourt projection), and is mentioned in the ending ("polished by constant use"). However, its mechanics are vague (amplifies "trembling honesty of the walls"), and it resolves a problem it did not help create. Swappable with any "truth-revealer" device. Two-beat use and closure mention lift it to mid-band, but lack of cost or irreplaceability caps it below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is stated early in backstory ("to free a town shackled by rumors, and to be freed by honesty") and recurs in summary ("honesty had freed them"). However, it functions as theme claim rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. No dramatized scene where a character chooses honesty at cost. Present but ornamental, scoring low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" appears four times as a descriptor: doodles are "ambiguously clear," the lens develops an "ambiguously clear aura," and the final line claims clarity "shines ambiguously clear." It labels tone but never constrains or enables action with a tradeoff. No on-page moment where ambiguity forces a difficult choice. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Eavesdrop" is seeded early ("hoping someone would eavesdrop through ink rather than ear") and recurs in closure ("eavesdropping through the lens of honesty"). However, Mara's action is passive observation; she does not wrestle with the ethics or cost of eavesdropping, nor does it create a turn. The verb is present but swappable with "observe" or "reveal" without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Concert tickets with cryptic doodles appear in the opening paragraph and are revisited when the mayor hands her "a fresh ticket" near the end. The mechanics ("swirl of stars and a single eye") are described but not shown to matter; the lens reads them, and projection follows automatically. The method is present but ornamental, not shaping tactics or imposing cost. Mentioned twice but never essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The forecourt is named in the opening line and closing paragraph, anchoring location and providing the visual surface for projected confessions. Rain and puddles create atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it is a stage rather than a pressure. Early signal and closure reprise lift it to functional band, but lack of tactical impact caps it mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears once in the middle as a poetic phrase ("a chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary"). The timeframe is neither tracked nor does it tighten decisions. No on-page clock or temporal pressure alters tactics. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To thaw mistrust with transparency" is stated early in backstory and summarized at closure ("The city's mistrust thawed like ice under a sunrise"). However, the motive is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Mara never faces friction between her desire for transparency and a competing cost (e.g., privacy, risk). The motive frames the premise but does not drive on-page decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" appears in the opening paragraph and the final paragraph, framing the piece. Tone is consistent—contemplative, ornate, low-conflict—but static; it does not modulate with pressure (there is no escalation) or charge the final image with new meaning. The reprise is purposeful but the element does not evolve, keeping it in the functional-reprise band near 5.0, with slight downward nudge for lack of tonal shift under stakes.</comment>
