<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values. Her purpose is declared ("to collect the weights of different burdens") but never tested by a moment where collection costs her something or forces a trade-off. The final smile and departure read as serene completion rather than earned endurance or renunciation with visible cost. Interiority consists of poetic sensation ("feeling the boundary-lessly trapped currents of grief loosen") without the grit of decision-making that would ground agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors emerge slowly: who (fractal weaver) and where (bronze grotto) are present early, but when (after first snowmelt) and why lack immediacy; no penalty applied since the lyric mode is signaled. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ritual actions layer toward a final release—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the weaver performs her task without friction, and the closure (placing the feather, flare, departure) reconfigures atmosphere but lacks visible cost or a legible before/after in her stance or options. The method (orienting the lamp, inviting weights, transmuting into a feather) proceeds without resistance, so pressure never coheres into a turn or a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specifics (shingled hush, mineral veins, whalebone reverie), and the lamp's flame interacts with the walls to reveal calcified statues. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—spatial details remain postcard-level decoration. The body and the lamp (micro-setting candidates) appear in multiple beats but do not charge the final image with a cost tied to their properties, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unbinding the grotto's sorrow—is declared but never tested. The weaver's process (align lamp, invite weights, absorb into flame) unfolds as ritual without opposition, cost, or a moment where she must choose between methods or endure a price. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the resolution (weights transmuted, grotto breathing, weaver departing) is granted by procedure rather than earned by agency under pressure. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>A coherent theme—transformation of burdens into art or release—emerges from the grotto's calcifying weights and the final promise that "any soul who entered with a burden could, by orienting properly their own heart, let it calcify into art." Yet this insight is stated rather than earned through specific struggle; the weaver's actions exemplify the theme without complicating it. The final image (grotto under stars, burdens now constellations) offers lyric resonance but no non-literal turn that reweights prior material with fresh cost. Subtext operates in the recurring "shingled hush" and "whalebone reverie," but the piece leans on prompt labels ("boundary-lessly trapped," "fractal patterns") rather than discovered particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (weaver noticing fractal geometry, mineral veins, the lamp's glow) is consistent. However, the narrative certainty exceeds what the focalizer can dramatize—phrases like "the boundary-lessly trapped currents of grief" and "a whalebone reverie of stillness" read as authorial assertion rather than the weaver's embodied perception. Diction inflates into elevated register ("shingled hush folded into itself, compressing the air into a crystal") that obscures immediate clarity. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (lamp alignment, weight absorption, final flare) carries metaphor or elevated diction ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped," "midnight beads," "kelp in a tide"), obscuring propulsion and creating register drift. Paraphrase loops appear: "the shingled hush settled" recurs in varied forms without advancing situation. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" openers and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Information density is low—many lines do two jobs (describe and assert mood) but few advance causality or narrow options. The overwriting in the closure beat (final two paragraphs) lowers clarity and disallows 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a figure ritually unbinding a place's accumulated sorrow—echoes familiar mystical-healer templates without a fresh synthesis. Specific details (bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, fractal patterns, calcified statues) are vivid but do not cohere into an irreplaceable logic; the weaver's method could swap "lamp" for "crystal" or "bronze" for "silver" without structural change. The final insight (burdens become constellations) offers lyric closure but no turn that surprises in hindsight. Risk-taking in the dense, lyric register does not heighten stakes—it obscures them—so no bonus applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver is present throughout and performs the central ritual, satisfying setup and middle development. However, her choices do not create key turns—she executes a procedure (align lamp, invite weights, place feather) without friction or decision under pressure. She appears in the closure (departure with lamp), but her agency there is ceremonial rather than causal. Functional but swappable; a generic "ritual practitioner" could perform the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in setup (carried, described), middle (aligned to moon's edge, coaxes minerals, absorbs weights), and closure (feather placed on burner, flame flares). It is handled across three distinct beats and its flame is the mechanism for transmutation, so it drives development and participates in the ending. However, the lamp's unique properties (kerosene, pale amber, refusing to die) do not constrain a choice or impose cost—any light source with "alignment" could substitute with minor edits. Lyric reprise (lamp's glow at departure) reweights atmosphere but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" recurs as atmospheric description (grotto echoes, hush falls in layers, settles like snowflakes, folds into itself, turns into lullaby) but never shapes stakes or tactics. It is a mood label, not a constraint or resource that alters the weaver's method or the grotto's response. Present in setup and closure but ornamental; swapping "layered silence" would leave the plot unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" appears twice as a descriptor (trapped sorrow of the grotto, trapped currents of grief loosen) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It is a thematic claim rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff or shapes the weaver's choices. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Calcify" appears in setup (mineral veins begin to calcify, water turns into translucent statues) and thematically at closure (grotto's promise that burdens "calcify into art"). It is the mechanism by which weights become visible, satisfying development. However, the calcification process is observed rather than driven by the weaver's choices under pressure; no major turn traces to her deciding *whether* or *how* to calcify. Present across beats but functionally swappable with "crystallize" or "solidify."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled in setup (lamp aligned to moon's edge), demonstrated in middle (orientation coaxes minerals, absorbs weights), and echoed at closure (souls can "orient properly their own heart"). It shapes the weaver's method across two beats and is thematically reprised at the end. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what "properly" means is not tested by a moment where misalignment costs her or forces a choice. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-band despite low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto under starlight is established early (setup) and described throughout (walls, fissures, mineral veins, floor crystal). It is present in the closure (grotto glimmers under returning stars) but functions as backdrop—no choice hinges on grotto-specific properties (bronze, starlight, acoustics) that could not be replicated in another mystical cavern. Postcard description trends low; no micro-constraint alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" appears in the opening sentence and recurs once at closure ("as the first snowmelt water receded"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the weaver's ritual proceeds without a clock or seasonal pressure that would alter her moves. Present in setup and closure but ornamental—removing it would not change the plot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the weights of different burdens" is stated in setup and drives the weaver's ritual (invite weights, absorb into flame, transmute). It is dramatized across multiple beats (kneeling, whispering, placing feather) and shapes the closure (weights transmuted, grotto releases sorrow). However, the desire is never conflicted—no moment where the cost of collection (exhaustion, risk, moral ambiguity) forces a tradeoff or tests her commitment. Told more than shown in friction; functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" recurs as a tonal anchor (weaver moves with it, stillness described as it, grotto bathed in it at closure). The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, modulating subtly from ritual focus to final release. However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure or cost—it remains a static dreamlike register rather than sharpening under the weaver's choices. Present in setup, middle, and closure; consistent but does not escalate or reweight stakes, keeping it mid-low band.</comment>
