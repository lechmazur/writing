<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "tender shadow keeper" remains abstract throughout; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously, only alternating metaphors. Motivation ("to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe") is declared but never dramatized through concrete micro-choices or embodied emotion under pressure. The character's internal experience is opaque—no visceral stakes, no flaws that complicate decisions, no genuine struggle. The final "lesson settle" moment is asserted rather than earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation remains deliberately obscured past 120 words with no functional payoff at closure (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive deepening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with on-page cost; the keeper steps through the threshold and "the lesson settle[s]" via summary assertion. No reversal narrows options; the sanctuary "responds" and "pulses" without the protagonist's agency forcing a trade-off. Closure lacks a legible cost unit—RR, DC, or CR—visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid ("ashen charcoal," "starlight," "pale constellations") but remains postcard-static; the sanctuary never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is vague—"encroach upon the edges," "stepped through"—without tracking bodies or distances. The doorknocker ring and threshold are repeatedly described but do not force a tactical shift; they ornament rather than pressure the keeper's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("teach the suffocating darkness to breathe") is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. "Burning bridges carefully" is mentioned twice yet never dramatized as a choice with visible consequence; the keeper lays embers "as a token" without agency cost. The threshold "responds" without the protagonist's decision driving escalation. No reversal or deepening changes options or knowledge under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme ("isolation as paradoxical renewal") emerges through pattern and image rather than statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph supplies a tidy moral summary ("no longer as a barrier but as a bridge forged from his own scars") that replaces scene pressure with assertion (−0.6). The doorknocker ring recurs but is left as a "relic" without reweighting prior material through the keeper's on-page cost. Subtext operates in image ("luminescent veins," "loaded emptiness") yet the ending's conceptual repricing is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—lyric, elevated diction—but lacks modulation under pressure; the same register ("tender shadow keeper," "suffocating air now a gentle wind") persists at every beat regardless of stakes. Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe," "linking through scars") are taught early and held through closure, which qualifies under experimental tolerance. However, the narrator's way of noticing is generalized rather than character-specific; no concrete interior texture anchors the abstractions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-taught payoff at closure (−0.5 for density). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "burned bridges carefully" recurs twice with no added pressure; "fading threshold" is restated in adjacent lines as "doorway whose outline blurred" and "threshold's edges shimmering like a heartbeat" (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "He burned bridges…He approached…He burned bridges…He left…He turned" across four consecutive paragraphs (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: "teach the suffocating darkness to breathe" personifies darkness as a student, then shifts to "coax life from the very air that tried to choke it," conflating air and darkness illogically (−0.4). Stock phrasing: "promise of renewal," "lesson settle," "loaded quiet." Information density is low; many lines restate the same abstract concept without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (solitary figure in liminal space teaching darkness to breathe) reads as a familiar template—lyric isolation allegory—without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The keeper's method ("linking through scars," "tapping the threshold") is presented but not grounded in concrete world logic or embodied cost. Emotional arc (isolation → connection) follows a predictable path without earned friction. No turn or intensification grows inevitably from prior particulars; the sanctuary's transformation is asserted rather than discovered through causal pressure.</comment>
