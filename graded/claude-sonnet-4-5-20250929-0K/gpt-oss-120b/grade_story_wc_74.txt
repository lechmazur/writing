<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is heavily ornamental—"methodically hopeful" and "quiet promise" function as labels rather than contradictory impulses enacted in scene. No meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion under pressure; she paints, pauses, watches, repeats without friction. Jiro's brief appearance introduces a second character whose memory is told rather than dramatized, and his moment of remembering is abstract ("felt the brush's whisper") rather than grounded in specific embodied choice. The final stance (Mara turning to a new canvas) reads as static routine rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraph; by ~120 words the anchors are present but hazy (−0.3 applied). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual, layered painting, note-leaving, Jiro's encounter, return to canvas. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image ("the rooftop greenhouse became a sanctuary"), but the cost is conceptual only and not legibly felt on the page—Mara's heart is "steady," the smog "puls[es] less heavily," and she simply begins again. No visible foreclosure or price paid; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog, moonlight, and rain collector anchor setting consistently and charge the atmosphere with saffron-lit specificity. The moon-tipped brush and wet paper recur across beats, and the glass panes filter moonlight into "silver specks" that pulse through Mara's actions. Spatial choreography is clean; the final image ("walls themselves were listening") ties environment to the closure gesture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—it supplies mood and texture but does not alter tactics or narrow options at the closure beat, capping the score at 7.0 per Q3 guidelines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") is signaled early but never tested or tightened on the page. Mara paints, leaves notes, Jiro reads one and remembers—no reversal, no trade-off, no competing pressure. The "waxing moon" recurs but does not escalate options; Jiro's appearance is coincidental rather than a product of Mara's agency. One brief tightening when "the first sunrise threatened to flood" the rooftop, but the moment deflates immediately ("the hope she had sown stayed bright"). Cost is not legible; the ending loops back to "another night" without alteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (kindness remembered across anonymity, lost languages resurrected through color) emerges from concrete images—scroll, note, moonlight, script—and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines. However, "the rooftop greenhouse became a sanctuary where lost languages found voice, and strangers… remembered the quiet power of a single kind gesture" edges into thematic summary rather than allowing the image to resonate without statement. The recurring motif of the moon-tipped brush and ancient scripts accumulates texture but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; the ending restates rather than transforms. Subtext is thin; Mara's inner life and Jiro's encounter are told more than enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Mara; psychic distance is stable. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("saffron quiet," "moon-tipped," "hymn of reconciliation") that suits the contemplative premise. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing reads uniform across beats without character-specific bias. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but do not crowd. Brief convergence when Jiro's interiority is accessed ("felt the brush's whisper… found himself remembering") without clear section break, a minor POV leak that does not obscure the dominant lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings show variation, but phrasing loops across beats: "methodically hopeful" appears twice, "each [X] a [Y]" template recurs four times ("each brushstroke a quiet promise," "each line glowed," "each hue a patient hymn," "each stroke a promise," "each line traced," "each curl a syllable"), creating template-cadence drag (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("colors of lost languages," "quiet conduit," "saffron-lit bridge") and elevated register ("hymn of reconciliation," "visual lexicon of remembrance") dilute immediacy in high-density beats (−0.4). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the opening and closing paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, pushing density into overwriting (−0.3). Accumulated artifact penalty: −1.2 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise (insomniac painter bridging strangers via moon-lit calligraphy invoking lost languages) combines multiple elements, but the synthesis reads ornamental rather than inevitable—kindness, moonlight, ancient scripts, and smog-choked city coexist without pressing against one another in a causal or thematic crucible. The "lost languages" motif remains decorative; removing it would not break logic or stakes. Jiro's memory and Mara's nightly routine feel stock (the stranger moved by anonymous art, the solitary creator persisting in hope). No bold risk or transformation of the template; the ending loops back to the opening's premise without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is named and on the page throughout; her actions (setting up easel, painting, leaving note, cleaning brush, turning to new canvas) occupy most beats. However, she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path—she paints, pauses when sunrise threatens, then resumes. Observational and routine rather than decisive. Present in closure (watches Jiro, turns to new canvas) but without causal pressure or cost. Functional but replaceable with another contemplative artist archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The brush appears in setup ("calligrapher's moon-tipped brush, its bristles forged from silvered sap"), is used in multiple beats (painting, pausing, cleaning with rain collector water, "moonlight linger[ing] on the bristles"), and reprises at closure ("its crescent edge sharpening the brush's tip for another night"). However, its unique properties (moon-tipped, silvered sap) do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it functions as an atmospheric prop. The cleaning and moonlight-polishing moments are descriptive rather than causal. Present across beats and in the ending, but swappable with any symbolic brush; lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lost languages" is seeded early ("colors of lost languages whispered by forgotten walls"), recurs as visual motif (ancient scripts, syllables, letters dissolved into air, visual lexicon), and appears in the final paragraph ("lost languages found voice"). However, it remains thematic decoration—the scripts do not constrain Mara's choices, and their presence could be replaced with any abstract visual symbol (lost songs, forgotten faces) without altering the plot or stakes. No middle development where the concept enables or blocks a tactic. Swappable, though present in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named twice (opening and near closure), but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. Mara's methodical approach (layering, cleaning, mapping fragments) and hopefulness (leaving notes, continuing each night) are shown, but no on-page moment where the trait forces a trade-off or cost. She does not face a choice between methodical persistence and expedient abandonment. Swappable with "quietly persistent" or "patiently dedicated." Mentioned but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in two beats: moonlight "roused her imagination," and Mara paints "to rouse strangers who passed below." The word recurs once more ("the next rousing"). However, the action is largely metaphorical—Mara's paintings do not dramatize a stranger being roused in a way that alters their on-page choice; Jiro "felt an inexplicable pull" and "found himself remembering," but this is told retrospectively. The action shapes the premise but is not causally tested. Present in setup and thematically, but replaceable with "awaken" or "inspire" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Moonlight filtering through glass panes and sparking daydreams is established in the opening third: "When the moonlight filtered through the glass panes, it sparked daydreams that roused her imagination… In those reveries, ancient scripts floated." The method recurs when the moon rises again at closure. However, the mechanics are ornamental—daydreams are not shown shaping Mara's tactics or enabling a specific on-page turn. The brush glows "as if" whispering, but the moonlight does not constrain or enable a choice. Present in setup and reprised, but swappable with any inspirational catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city anchors every beat: glass lantern, vines, glass panes, rain collector, rooftops mapped in paint, smog pulsing. It supplies atmosphere and contrast (saffron quiet vs. smog-choked city below). The greenhouse's glass catches moonlight, and the walls "listen" at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice—Mara could paint anywhere elevated. The smog never blocks her work or forces a tactical shift. Present across all beats and charged in the final image, but the setting is symbolic rather than a live pressure on options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Under the waxing moon's glow" is named in the opening and reprised at closure ("as the moon rose again, its crescent edge sharpening"). The timeframe is tracked loosely (night → first sunrise → later → another night), but does not tighten decisions—Mara paints until sunrise threatens, then resumes the next night without a live clock altering her moves. Jiro's arrival is untimed. The waxing moon recurs but does not escalate pressure or narrow tactics. Present in setup and ending, but ornamental; swappable with any nocturnal cycle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to prove that strangers remember kindness" is stated early ("She painted not for fame but to rouse strangers… to prove that strangers remember kindness") and reprised at closure ("proving that strangers indeed remember kindness"). It drives her nightly routine (painting, leaving notes), and Jiro's memory offers thematic payoff. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no moment where the cost of proving this desire (isolation, repetition, uncertainty) forces a choice or trade-off. The motivation shapes the premise but is not tested under pressure. Told more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is anchored early ("saffron quiet") and sustained through "saffron-lit bridge," "soft, saffron hush," and the final "saffron-lit bridge" reprise. The quiet, contemplative register remains consistent across beats. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—sunrise "threatens" but the mood stays serene, Jiro's encounter is gentle, and the ending loops back to the opening's stillness without tonal deepening or shift. Coherent and present in the closure image, but static; does not charge the final moment with a cadence break or intensification that reweights the stake.</comment>
