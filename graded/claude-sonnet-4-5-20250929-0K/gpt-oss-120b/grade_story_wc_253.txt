<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara reads as a blank vessel rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her motivation—"cultivating lightness in grief"—is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice that reveals internal friction or cost. The "morally ambiguous" attribute exists only as a label; no on-page action tests competing values. Interiority consists of therapeutic abstractions ("emotional void," "hollow that could be filled") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: "after the happiness mandate" supplies a rule but no spatial or temporal anchor until the farmhouse is named. The story moves through a single static scene with no causal linkage—Mara whittles, narrates, places objects—but no because/therefore progression or meaningful tightening. The ending offers a thematic statement ("carving light from sorrow") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Under any lens, closure remains assertion without on-page pressure or transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wind turbines supply vivid imagery and are invoked throughout, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The farmhouse interior is sketched (kitchen, wooden table, cracked floor) yet spatial choreography remains generic. The baton and dried flowers are handled twice but do not alter tactics or options. One positive: the turbine shadows racing across walls create a micro-setting detail that charges the final paragraph, narrowly elevating the score above pure description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"cultivating lightness in grief"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice under pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara begins whittling and finishes without obstacle or cost. The "happiness mandate" should impose external pressure, but its enforcement is absent from the scene. Agency is missing: Mara performs a pre-decided action without friction, renunciation, or visible price. The resolution is asserted ("a new hush had been remade") rather than earned through protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief coexisting with enforced joy—emerges from the premise but is articulated through direct statement ("cultivate lightness in sorrow," "quiet redemption") rather than image or action. The baton and flowers are symbolic conveniences introduced to illustrate theme without prior causal weight. No counter-reading or moral friction appears; the text offers a tidy thesis. One strength: the turbines as indifferent witnesses supply a non-literal frame that partially anchors the thematic question without moralizing, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and abstract ("morally ambiguous purpose," "emotional void") in ways inconsistent with a performer in a farmhouse. Register drifts into therapy-speak ("cultivate lightness," "quiet transformation") without anchoring in Mara's idiom. Psychic distance is poorly calibrated: the narration claims knowledge of "unseen residents" and broader social impact beyond what Mara can observe. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "remade hush" / "silence stitched together," "emotional void" / "hollow," "carving lightness" / "cutting away grief." Template cadence dominates—repeated "she [verb]" constructions and parallel declarations. Stock metaphors ("shavings fell like snow," "breath[e] without breaking the law") layer without coherent tenor. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "imagined," "understood") dull immediacy in climactic beats. Sentence openings repeat structural patterns without variation. Cumulative artifacts obscure momentum and deny entry to mid-bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist resisting a "happiness mandate" through symbolic craft—follows a familiar dystopian template without transformation through specific detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The world rules (enforced cheer, turbines, farmhouse isolation) remain generic placeholders. Mara's whittle and narration could be replaced by any craft without altering emotional arc or stakes. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; all moves are interchangeable. Risk-aversion is evident: the story hedges moral ambiguity by labeling it rather than dramatizing competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but makes no key choices; she executes a pre-decided action (whittling, placing flowers) without friction. "Blank-faced" is label-only, never constraining her perception or relationships. Late first-person reflection ("she understood") offers summary rather than dramatized turn. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dried bouquet appears in three beats (lifted, whispered to, placed beside baton) but its function is static decoration. No evolving use or reweighted meaning; it illustrates decay without altering tactics or charging the closure image beyond token mention. Swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Remade hush" / "silence" is asserted six times but never dramatizes a choice or constraint. The concept frames theme but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The ending declares the hush transformed ("allowed sorrow to breathe") without demonstrating cost or change in options. Theme-echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Morally ambiguous" is a label applied once ("morally ambiguous purpose") with no on-page action that tests competing values or reveals visible tradeoff. The attribute claims complexity but never constrains or enables a choice. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Whittling occupies multiple beats and produces the baton, but the action is interchangeable—carving, painting, or weaving would serve identically. No turn traces to the specific properties of wood-shaving. The act is present but does not redefine options or carry unique cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating" appears once ("dramatically narrated the mundane task") and again as summary ("narrated, 'I am cutting away...'"). The method is asserted but its mechanics never shape an attempt or create friction. The narration could be silent internal monologue without structural change. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines anchor the opening and return in the final paragraph; shadows "race across the walls" to charge the ending image. Mid-story, the setting recedes to generic kitchen props. Turbines supply atmospheric pressure but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise with modest closure linkage elevates slightly above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the happiness mandate" frames backstory but imposes no live clock or tightening. The timeframe is vague (years? months?) and does not alter Mara's decisions. Present tense suggests immediacy, yet no urgency shapes tactics. Mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Cultivate lightness in grief" is stated as Mara's purpose and invoked throughout, but never tested by friction between want and cost. The motivation remains abstract and is achieved by declaration rather than struggle. No competing desire or visible price appears on the page. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Emotional void" is declared twice and the tone remains muted and reflective throughout. Modulation is limited—no rhythm shift under pressure—but the tone coheres and the final image ("less empty") recalibrates the void claim with modest thematic charge. Static mood with a small cadence shift at closure.</comment>
