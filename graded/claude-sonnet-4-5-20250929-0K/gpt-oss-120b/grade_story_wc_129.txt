<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "boldly sympathetic" trait appears as a label without forcing a visible tradeoff; no moment shows her feeling forced to choose between sympathy and self-protection. Villagers remain a collective with no individual pressure or status dynamics. The final choice to dedicate the arbor feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle, and no path is foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but closure arrives as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost. The search for the tag, the villagers weaving reeds, and Arlen's vow occur in quick succession without causal pressure tightening options. Orientation is delayed past ~120 words (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, crater rim established piecemeal), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The ending adds a child discovering a new fragment, but this micro-turn does not reweight prior material or make a before/after legible with cost; it reads as additive rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are described vividly but function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers move "through the orchard" without clear positions or distances. The glyph on the stone pillar materializes without prior setup, and the phosphorescent moss appears once without causal role. The arbor's glass bark catches light and casts shadows, but these details remain ornamental; no environmental feature alters tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting oneself onto community—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The shared search is declared as method but unfolds without obstacle, reversal, or visible cost. The villagers' participation is collective and frictionless; no individual resists, doubts, or forces Arlen to adjust. The final tapestry of reeds glows as announced, offering no surprise or trade-off. One tightening is promised but not delivered; escalation reads as accumulation without pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of kinship and belonging emerges through repeated imagery (webs, threads, lattice) but remains abstract rather than grounded in a specific choice with cost. The glyph's discovery by Lira reframes the tag as "a living symbol that grows as the community heals," but this realization is stated rather than dramatized. The final line attempts resonance—"rewrite the language of belonging"—but substitutes assertion for earned particularity. No moral complexity or counter-reading is offered; the vision is univocal and sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Diction is elevated and uniform throughout, with no modulation under pressure. Phrases like "luminescent ache," "ribbons of violet," and "trembling stars" recur in parallel constructions, creating template cadence. The POV remains stable third-person limited on Arlen, but interiority is thin and declarative ("her motivation was simple yet profound"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the orchard "seemed to sigh" and the arbor "watched silently" without embodied filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "webs of kinship" echoes four times, "luminescent ache" three times, "glimmering obsidian arbor" five times, often in identical syntactic slots. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("They moved… the reeds whispering… the arbor watched… Night fell… the rim glimmered"). Mixed metaphors appear: the arbor is a "midnight lighthouse" yet has "glass bark," and shadows "stitched the ground into webs." Figurative density saturates high-pressure beats without payoff. Stock phrases—"boldly sympathetic," "shared longing," "fragile, beautiful duty"—flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("rewrite the language of belonging"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—an artist uniting a community through collaborative search and dedication—is a familiar community-building template. The street artist's tag functions as a MacGuffin without transformation; its interlocking circles and halo of silver light are ornamental rather than causally necessary. The marsh-reed sculptor and crystalline orchard offer surface novelty but do not alter the emotional arc or stakes. No bold risk is taken; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost. Transformation test fails: the plot could unfold unchanged with a different medium, setting, and object.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arlen is present throughout and her decision to dedicate the arbor appears in the middle third, but this choice does not create a key turn or narrow options. She invites villagers, leads the trek, places her hand on the glyph, and whispers a vow—all without obstacle or visible cost. Her role is passive conduit rather than active agent forcing escalation. The final sculpture she and Lira add is mentioned but not dramatized. Setup and middle beats are present; closure participation is ornamental (she adds a reed but the moment belongs to Lira's discovery).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor is introduced early, reappears as the dedication target in the middle, and becomes the focal point of the tapestry-weaving at the end. It is described across multiple beats (glass bark, violet ribbons, silent watcher), and the final image shows it glowing with the woven reeds. However, its specific properties do not constrain choice or enable tactics; it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a tool or obstacle. Three-gate presence and closure linkage earn the score, but lack of causal pressure or irreplaceability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is stated as Arlen's aim in the opening, echoed in the shadow imagery, and referenced at closure ("bounded every heart to the other"). It shapes the dominant stake thematically but does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. The concept remains metaphorical rather than tactical; no decision turns on whether to accept or reject kinship, and no cost is paid to achieve it. Setup and thematic closure are present, but middle development as a choice-driver is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as a label in the opening third ("Arlen was boldly sympathetic, feeling each ripple of sorrow"). No subsequent action demonstrates a tradeoff between sympathy and another value, and no cost accrues from being sympathetic. The trait does not enable or constrain a beat. Setup is present but ornamental; middle and closure participation are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dedicate" appears early as Arlen's aim ("to dedicate her newest work") and is fulfilled in the middle third ("She vowed to dedicate the glimmering obsidian arbor as a sanctuary"). The dedication precipitates the villagers weaving reeds, which forms the closure tableau. However, the action is easily swappable—"consecrate," "establish," or "claim" would require only minor edits. The dedication does not face resistance or demand a sacrifice; it is announced and accepted. Setup, middle beat, and closure linkage are present, but low specificity and no visible cost cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The shared search for the street artist's tag is introduced as Arlen's chosen method in the first third and drives the villagers' trek to the stone pillar. The glyph is discovered as promised, though its mechanics—"visible only as a halo of silver light"—do not constrain the search or shape tactics. The search succeeds without complication. Setup and middle beat are present; closure shows Lira finding a new fragment, but this micro-turn does not hinge on the search method. Functional but replaceable; a shared ritual or collaborative carving would serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater rim are established early and remain the location throughout. The orchard's reeds whisper underfoot, the crater's rim glimmers with moss, and the stone pillar is located "near the orchard." These details anchor space but do not pressure choices or supply resources. The arbor is within the orchard, and the villagers' movement is cohesive. Setup and continuous presence earn mid-band, but the setting does not constrain tactics or charge the final image; it functions as atmosphere rather than actor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears as a poetic phrase in the opening but does not establish a temporal frame or tighten decisions. The search occurs over one night ("Night fell… One dawn"), but no clock or deadline alters tactics. The phrase recurs at closure ("binding all who listened to the same murmur") as thematic echo rather than temporal constraint. Timeframe remains vague and untensioned; setup is ornamental, middle and closure do not hinge on time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To graft oneself onto community" is stated as Arlen's motivation in the opening third and drives her decision to invite the villagers and dedicate the arbor. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; no friction arises between wanting connection and fearing rejection, exhaustion, or loss of autonomy. The final image shows the community bound together, fulfilling the motivation without visible cost. Setup and thematic closure are present, but lack of on-page conflict or tradeoff caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced early as the orchard's quality, echoed in the villagers' "luminous" faces and "shared longing," and returns at closure ("The orchard's luminescent ache never faded… softened into a steady glow"). The tone is consistent—melancholy yearning suffused with hope—and modulates slightly from ache to glow. However, the tone does not heighten under pressure; the register remains uniform across beats. Setup, recurrence, and closure reprise earn the score, but lack of modulation under escalation prevents higher bands.</comment>
