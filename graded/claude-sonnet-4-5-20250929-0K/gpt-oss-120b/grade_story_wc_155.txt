<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mural artist is presented through assertion rather than embodied choice under pressure. Her motivation "to rediscover lost joy" is declared but never tested by an on-page conflict that forces her to weigh competing goods or pay a visible cost. Interiority relies on label-only phrasing ("her heart alight," "pensive mirth") and therapy-speak ("rediscovered joy") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final walk away carries no foreclosed path or felt sacrifice; she simply moves to the next project without cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately in the opening lines. The piece lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost; the orchard transitions from fog-shrouded to luminous through the artist's unobstructed work, but no option is narrowed or forfeited on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending adds brightness without a pattern break, cadence shift, or reweighting that makes a before/after legible with cost. The knowledge network and fresco fragment appear as texture but do not constrain tactics or alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog are vivid and sustained, but they do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("trembling like chandeliers," "cool mist kiss her cheeks"), yet the environment remains a backdrop rather than an agent that shapes the protagonist's moves. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves from dark to luminous, but this change is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—illuminating the orchard—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition or cost. The artist works unimpeded; passersby gather and smile, the fog thins, and the mural succeeds without a reversal, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is absent: she executes a plan without renunciation, endurance under pressure, or a choice that forecloses a live option. The story offers outline progression ("she worked," "she added," "she stepped back") without escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly (art as catalyst for joy, light versus shadow) but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "May we always find joy where shadows once held sway" and "how a mural artist who paints with light can revive a world." Subtext operates in some images (the fresco fragment as "beating heart," chandeliers of trees), yet the ending resolves into platitudes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece gestures toward complexity but settles for tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct texture in diction ("photon-kissed pigment," "soft gratitude shared across distant scholars"). POV distance is stable, and the perceptual filter remains character-specific. However, elevated register drifts into abstraction ("pensive mirth," "unspooling daydream," "eternity") in peak beats, and the prose occasionally explains what has been shown ("the true power of her craft was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts"). No dialogue is present; the piece is evaluated for narrative voice alone, which maintains coherence but lacks the compression and rhythm control required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is functional but burdened by paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate the same idea: "The orchard district, once lost in centuries of thick fog, now hummed with a quiet, luminous optimism" immediately follows the fog thinning and trees trembling. Repeated stems ("She smiled," "She stepped back," "She turned away," "She walked toward") create drumbeat rhythm without variation. Figurative language ("pensive mirth," "fold of a daydream," "exposed film") appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Stock phrases ("her heart alight," "beat involvement") and abstract high-level descriptors reduce density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mural artist revives a fog-shrouded ruin—is familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The knowledge network and fresco fragment with "exposed film" are intriguing but remain ornamental; they do not constrain choices or introduce friction. Emotional arc and plot could transfer unchanged to a different setting with a different medium (sculptor, musician) without loss, failing the transformation test. Tropes (artist as healer, light versus shadow, fog lifting as metaphor) are executed competently but without fresh inflection or risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The mural artist is present throughout and her actions (placing the fragment, painting, sealing the mural) drive the narrative's surface progression. However, her choices do not create key turns; she executes a plan without opposition, trade-off, or cost. She observes and creates but does not decide under pressure in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable; the story could proceed with a generic "artist" placeholder.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears early (first paragraph) and is handled in two distinct beats: carried at dawn and placed "at the heart of the wall" midway. Its glow is amplified into the mural display, and it returns in the final paragraph when "its essence mingling with starlight." The fragment enables the display but does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it is a tool used without friction. Its "exposed film" property is mentioned but not leveraged causally. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key moment (the placement) and achieving a purposeful early–final reprise, but lacks the causal pressure or irreplaceability for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Exposed film" is mentioned twice as a descriptor of the fresco fragment's glow but never shapes stakes, constrains tactics, or changes options on the page. It remains metaphorical texture without causal function. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is established early ("art could paint with light") and appears in multiple beats ("photon-kissed pigment," "luminous arches," "a final brush of light"). It defines the artist's method and the mural's effect, shaping the display action. However, it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; the attribute is label-only without visible tradeoffs. Functional but could be replaced with "paints with color" or "creates vibrant murals" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The display is the story's central action: the artist creates the mural, passersby gather, the orchard transforms. It is present in setup (she works), development (walls "sang with color," visitors watch), and payoff (the orchard "hummed with...optimism," trees "trembling like chandeliers"). The display drives the narrative's progression and is essential to the ending's charge. However, it is executed without opposition or cost, and the action itself is swappable (a performance, a garden restoration) without breaking the story's logic. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping multiple beats and contributing to the ending, but lacks the causal pressure and irreplaceability for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The knowledge network is introduced early ("connected to a knowledge network of wandering scholars") and mentioned in three beats: learning to amplify the fragment's glow, feeling it "ripple like a friendly pulse," and a "soft gratitude shared" at the end. It enables the artist's success but does not constrain her choices or impose a cost. The mechanics are vague ("invisible lattice," "pulse beneath her skin"), and the network could be replaced with "her training" or "ancient texts" with minor edits. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard lost in fog is established in the opening sentence and sustained throughout. It provides the story's atmosphere and the problem the artist addresses (fog-shrouded souls, ruined walls). The setting evolves from "tomb" to "garden waiting for sunrise" and is present in the ending when "the orchard breathed, its fog thinning into a soft sunrise." However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it is transformed by the protagonist rather than constraining her. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping the central turn (ruin to luminous hope) and participating in the ending, but lacks the tactical constraint required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is mentioned once in the first third ("she worked within the fold of a daydream, half awake, half imagined") and echoed near the end ("the daydream unspooling," "the daydream lingered"). Time is vague and untracked ("The day stretched, though time felt folded"); no clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to rediscover lost joy" is stated explicitly in the first paragraph and echoed in the ending ("May we always find joy where shadows once held sway"). It frames the artist's goal and the story's thematic question. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; the artist pursues joy without friction, cost, or competing desires. She succeeds without sacrifice or renunciation. Functional but label-only; the motivation does not drive on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" appears as a label in three beats: "pensive mirth" of laughter in the middle, "pensive mirth had become a catalyst" near the end, and "the orchard itself laughed in pensive mirth" in the final third. The tone is asserted rather than embodied through syntax, rhythm, or image. The oxymoron (pensive + mirth) is intriguing but not modulated with pressure; the mood remains static and lyric throughout. Present but ornamental; the tone could be replaced with "quiet joy" or "gentle optimism" without structural impact.</comment>
