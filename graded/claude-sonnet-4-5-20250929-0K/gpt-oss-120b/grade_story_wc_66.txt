<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to teach dust to tell stories") remains abstractly stated rather than enacted through concrete choices under pressure. Her actions—transcribing, adjusting the dial—feel observational and procedural rather than driven by contradictory impulses or visible internal conflict. The closing pride is asserted, not earned through a dramatized forfeiture or stance crystallization. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we see gestures (wrapping the shawl) but no contradictory physical states that reveal character under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation anchors (Mara, ember alcove, shortwave radio) by the first paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure unit lacks a decisive change or visible cost: the broadcast succeeds, the crowd applauds, and Mara feels "quiet pride" without any path foreclosed or option reweighted on the page. The sequence reads as and-then plotting—she hears, transcribes, broadcasts, audience gathers—without because/therefore linkage or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The ending summarizes a thematic win ("dust...could become a storyteller") rather than landing a felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and shortwave radio dial glow are vividly described and return across beats, creating atmospheric coherence. The radio constrains one choice (aligning the dial to the exact frequency), which lifts the score into functional range. However, much of the setting detail—"thistled calm," "dust that hung like old parchment," "rooftops glimmered faintly"—remains ornamental, never altering Mara's tactics or supplying resources that affect the outcome. The "ember alcove" itself does not pressure a decision at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reviving the city's silent theaters via the pirate broadcast) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a meaningful tightening. The broadcast simply succeeds: Mara transcribes, the audience gathers, applause erupts. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible price paid. The "story famine" backstory sets context but does not create escalating pressure within the scene. Agency is procedural (copying, pressing play) rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of forgotten stories revived through music emerges clearly from images (dust swirling as music, luminous ink, pirate's voice) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. The final line attempts resonance ("even dust...could become a storyteller") but reads as a tidy moral summary rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. The piece avoids overt sermonizing until the very end, where the thematic echo ("teach dust to tell stories") is restated without reweighting prior material through a charged image or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV anchored in Mara's perception, with no head-hopping. However, the perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "thistled calm," "secretly luminous," and "dust swirled upward" could belong to any lyric narrator rather than a diligent copyist's specific way of noticing. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("slipped through the static via elusive song lyrics") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. Distance control is stable but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "shortwave radio dial glow" / "luminous dial" / "secretly luminous glow," "thistled calm" repeated without added pressure, "the cloak of the shawl" redundantly naming the same object. Template cadence runs appear: "She [verb]...she [verb]" structures stack without variation. Stock metaphors ("fireflies trapped in amber," "autumn leaves," "distant gulls over stormy seas") cluster in descriptive beats without fresh specificity. The phrase "secretly luminous" appears multiple times as a label without concrete action tied to its properties. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a copyist reviving a city's theaters via a pirate radio broadcast—offers a mildly fresh synthesis of familiar elements (cultural revival, underground media, dust as metaphor). However, the emotional arc and plot structure follow a predictable template: silence → discovery → transcription → broadcast → triumph, with no unexpected turns or non-obvious moral calculus. The "teach dust to tell stories" conceit is poetic but remains abstract rather than grounded in lived detail or transformed through character-specific choices. The piece reads as a competent execution of a lyric fable without the bold risk-taking or irreplaceable specificity that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in nearly every beat but her choices are procedural (copying, adjusting the dial, pressing play) rather than creating key turns that narrow options. The decision to broadcast is implied rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. Her role is more observer and conduit than agent who alters tactics through competing impulses. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow is introduced early, described across multiple beats (flickering, crackling, emitting rhythm, aligning to frequency, pulsing brighter), and shapes the final action (pressing play). It enables the broadcast and charges the ending image ("a beacon"). However, its "secretly luminous" property remains decorative rather than constraining a choice with visible cost. The glow's mechanics do not create a trade-off or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast frames the central stake (reviving the theatres) and shapes Mara's actions (transcribing, aligning the dial, playing the broadcast). It appears early and drives the middle and ending beats. However, the broadcast's success is assured rather than contested; it does not change options or create a visible cost. The concept is present and causal but does not generate the friction or trade-off that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is mentioned multiple times as a label (dial glow, ink, shawl) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with a cost. The luminosity is described as flickering, pulsing, glowing brighter, but these changes do not alter Mara's tactics or force a trade-off. The attribute is ornamental, not operative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "cloak" action appears in one beat (slipping the shawl over her shoulders) and is described as "hiding her form" and "amplifying the whispered chords," but no later choice or turn traces to this concealment or amplification. The action is mentioned but not causally linked to the broadcast's success or the crowd's gathering. Easily swappable with another preparatory gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Via elusive song lyrics" is introduced early ("the broadcast slipped through...elusive song lyrics") and shapes the middle action (transcribing the pirate's verses). The method is signaled and its mechanics (lyrics floating like phantom verses, hinting at forgotten melodies) matter to Mara's transcription work. However, the elusiveness does not create a legible constraint or cost; the transcription succeeds without friction. The method is present and purposeful but does not narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "ember alcove in mist" is introduced in the opening line and mentioned again ("ember alcove filled with a soft haze," "ember alcove remained"). It provides atmospheric coherence but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect the outcome. The mist curls and dances but never constrains access, timing, or tactics. The setting is vivid but functionally replaceable with any isolated workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is mentioned early ("after the story famine that had silenced the city's theatres for three years") and reprised in the final paragraph ("after the story famine, the city learned"). It frames context and stakes but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the scene. No clock or deadline narrows Mara's window; the timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure. Present but not operative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is stated early ("Her motivation was simple yet profound") and echoed in the final line. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Mara's actions (copying, transcribing, broadcasting) align with the stated desire but without friction between wants and obstacles. The motivation is present and thematically coherent but not enacted as a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is introduced early (Mara's "thistled calm demeanor") and returns twice ("The audience listened in thistled calm," "a sanctuary of thistled calm"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—from Mara's solitary focus to the audience's shared attention to the alcove's enduring stillness—creating a purposeful arc. However, the phrase itself is repeated without evolving meaning or charging the final image with new pressure. The tone supports the concept but does not intensify at closure.</comment>
