<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "forgive the unfinished" remains abstract throughout; no on-page contradiction or struggle tests this desire against a competing impulse. Her actions—tracing verses, placing the key—read as ceremonial gestures without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. Interior experience consists largely of label-only feelings ("quietly shining resolve," "wisely enduring calm") rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The final smile and bow offer no evidence that renunciation or stance crystallization altered her available options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows "marble sanctuary under aurora" and "calligraphy forger" but not who Liora is relationally, what immediate problem drives tonight's work, or what concrete outcome she seeks. The closure unit—tracing hidden verses onto the floor—lacks a legible before/after: no on-page evidence shows what changes for Liora or the world after the verses resonate. The key "melts into the stone, its purpose fulfilled" without demonstrable cost or foreclosed path, reading as a symbolic gesture rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price. Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece reads partly accumulative (pearl twilight, dripping water, recurring thorn) yet offers no cadence shift or density break that reweights the dominant stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary supplies vivid sensory anchors—vaulted ceilings, dripping stalactites, pearl twilight—but these details remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain Liora's choices. The dripping water functions as a metronome image yet never alters her tactics or timing. The heritage rose thorn returns in the final third with a "soft crimson light" and glow, charging the final image modestly, which lifts the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-level pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to forgive the unfinished"—is named early but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that forecloses an alternative. No reversal narrows Liora's options; she traces verses without impediment, and the sanctuary "holds her promise" without friction. The claimed "calibrated treason" and weaponization potential are told in summary ("she understood," "she chose") rather than dramatized through a decision with visible cost. Pressure remains static from opening to close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness of imperfection, art as balm—is stated directly multiple times ("to forgive the unfinished," "I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation") rather than emerging from concrete action. The heritage rose thorn and key recur but without accumulating new meaning that reweights prior material; their glow and hum read as decorative confirmation. The final image (thorn glowing, footsteps echoing "like verses on stone") gestures toward resonance but remains abstracted from the dramatic question, offering a mood rather than a non-literal answer with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is weak: diction ("quietly shining resolve," "wisely enduring calm," "crystal-clear vow") recycles elevated abstractions rather than character-specific noticing. Register occasionally drifts into ceremonial summary ("The script narrated a calibrated treason of ancient scribes") that feels imposed rather than filtered through Liora's urgent thought. No dialogue appears. Sentence openings show some variety, but "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems recur across paragraphs without rhythmic motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "to forgive the unfinished" / "offering forgiveness to the unfinished," "calibrated treason" (three times), "key with no apparent lock" (four times), and "wisely enduring" / "wisely / enduring" recur without added detail. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs: "She understood… She chose… She traced… She whispered… She stepped… She bowed… She tucked." Stock metaphors—"tapestry of forgiveness," "hymn of hope," "doors of memory"—flatten key beats. These artifacts cluster across the piece, including the closure paragraph, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Deduction: −1.7 for spread touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—calligraphy forger in mystical sanctuary reconciling unfinished work—maps closely to "artist finds peace through ritual" templates common in prompt-driven fiction. "Calibrated treason" and the bone key offer surface specificity but remain ornamental; both could be swapped (e.g., "hidden rebellion," "silver talisman") without altering the emotional arc. The sanctuary, aurora, and rose thorn read as atmospheric set-dressing rather than irreplaceable narrative engines. No bold risk or synthesis that transforms familiar material into something inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Liora is named in the opening line and present throughout, but her choices are ceremonial (tracing verses, placing the key) without on-page alternatives or costs that would break story logic if removed. She enacts the ritual rather than deciding between competing paths.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in paragraph one as a relic, returns when Liora places the key against it to reveal hidden script (middle beat), and glows at closure. This three-beat presence and lyric reprise that reweights meaning at the end meet two gates and earn mid-band eligibility. However, the thorn is not causally indispensable: a scroll fragment or amulet could serve the same reveal function with minor edits, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named three times but only as thematic label. The ancient scribes' treason is summarized in one sentence; Liora's own treason—if it involves forging versus authentic calligraphy—never shapes an on-page choice or cost. The concept does not change tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears as an adjective ("she bore like armor," "a wisely enduring calm") but never constrains or enables a dramatized action with visible cost. It remains a character label without on-page proof.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unlink" appears twice: "to unlink the past from the present with each flourish" and "I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation." Both instances are summary statements rather than physical acts that turn the plot. The verses she traces do not demonstrably unlink anything on the page; a synonym like "release" or "sever" would fit equally well.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The bone key is introduced early, used once in the middle beat (placed against the thorn to reveal script), and melts into stone at closure. This meets two gates and the lyric-reprise allowance. However, its mechanics—"opened only the doors of memory," then melts "its purpose fulfilled"—are metaphorical rather than causal; a touch-activated amulet could replace it with minor rewording, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary is anchored early (first sentence) and supplies recurring sensory detail (vaulted ceilings, dripping water, pearl twilight). The aurora frames the opening and closing images. Yet the setting does not constrain Liora's choices or alter her tactics; she works unimpeded. The final glow and echoing footsteps charge the ending image modestly, meeting two gates and earning low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" anchors the timeframe in paragraph seven; the dripping recurs as a metronome image. However, elapsed time remains vague—"each night" versus "that moment" versus "as the night deepened"—and the drip never tightens a deadline or alters Liora's pacing. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is stated in paragraph three as Liora's reason for working and echoed at closure ("offering forgiveness to the unfinished"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice with visible cost. She whispers her vow without friction, and no on-page action shows what forgiveness costs her or forecloses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" is named in paragraph two, returns in paragraph nineteen ("deepened, turning… into a silvery haze"), and closes the piece ("pearl twilight turned to star-kissed darkness"). This three-beat arc and final modulation meet all three gates. The tone remains elegiac and ceremonial throughout, supporting the piece's lyric design, though it does not intensify under pressure. The consistent aesthetic and charged reprise at closure earn mid-band.</comment>
