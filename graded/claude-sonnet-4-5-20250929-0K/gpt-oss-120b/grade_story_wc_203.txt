<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's occupation and ghost-sight are present, but her choices trace a largely frictionless investigation with minimal internal conflict. The emotional progression from "weightless burden" to "quiet purpose" is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or visible cost—she gathers artifacts and gratitude without forfeiting anything meaningful. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("skillfully observant eyes," "strange lightness") and the final transformation reads unmotivated by prior psychological pressure. No embodied struggle makes the ending feel necessary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/investigative lens: Mara enters, notices cracks, follows clues (dust, sound, mirrors, clock), retrieves the ledger, and exits. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the burden transforms into purpose), but the felt cost is absent—she gains artifacts, ghost gratitude, and clarity without forfeiting an option or paying a visible price. The causal chain is smooth but lacks the tightening or trade-off required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shattered marquee, broken glass ceiling, scented air of sawdust/popcorn, decayed canvas lattice). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (ticket counter → ladder → attic hatch → alcove). The setting supplies resources (mirrors, clock, hidden alcove) that guide Mara's investigation, meeting the micro-setting test. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it functions as atmospheric discovery-space rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mara's investigation deepens (dust → sound → attic → ledger) but never tightens into a choice that forecloses an option or imposes cost. The spirits cooperate, the tools work, and the reveal arrives without complication or reversal. No meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens; the story adds layers without narrowing possibilities or charging the final image with sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of acknowledging forgotten souls emerges organically from the investigation and the ledger discovery. The motif "cracks in the façade" recurs but operates mostly as metaphor rather than constraint. The ending offers a quiet answer—restoration of memory lifts burden—but the resolution is tidy and sentimental ("ghosts' gratitude settle like a feather") without the ambiguity or cost that would deepen thematic resonance. No counter-reading or moral complexity complicates the protagonist's arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and atmospheric, with character-specific perception (e.g., "horologist's mainspring barrel" signals expertise). However, the prose leans on stock phrases ("skillfully observant," "strange lightness," "quiet purpose") and elevated register that flattens urgency in peak beats. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices everything relevant without bias or blind spots, reducing voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cracks in the façade" is restated three times with minor variation (ticket counter, roof mouth, final recap); "mainspring barrel" is introduced twice (toolbox, then again in the concealed compartment) without clear escalation. Figurative language clusters in early paragraphs ("tired animal," "bruised clouds," "slow spiraling dance") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting. Template cadence ("She began engaging… She whispered… She followed…") flattens momentum in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for figurative density without payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—elevator technician who sees ghosts investigates circus ruins—combines two familiar elements (blue-collar ghost-seer, atmospheric ruin exploration) without transforming either. The investigation follows predictable steps (clue → clue → hidden object → closure) and the emotional arc (burden → acknowledgment → purpose) is a standard template. The horologist's barrel and dust-pattern method are specific details, but the story could swap them for other tools/methods with minor edits. No bold structural or thematic risk elevates the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara ("elevator repair technician who sees ghosts") is present throughout and her ghost-sight enables the investigation. However, her choices are sequential observations rather than decisions that alter tactics: she follows clues without friction or cost. Her occupation (elevator repair) is mentioned but never integrated—no elevator, no repair work, no professional constraint shapes the plot. The ghost-sight is functional but does not create a turn; she uses it smoothly from start to finish. Present in setup and development; absent from causal pressure at closure. Cap: swappable trait (another investigator could follow the same clues). Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats (whispers to spirits, sees phantom silhouettes) +0.9 − swappability −0.6 − no closure pressure −0.6 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "horologist's mainspring barrel" appears in three beats: (1) placed as makeshift lantern, (2) discovered again in the concealed compartment, (3) engaged with the elevator's control circuit to map the ceiling. Early signal (first third) +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal enabler (drives the diagram reveal) +0.8, closure linkage (present in final sequence) +0.9. However, the second appearance (concealed compartment) contradicts the first (Mara already has it in her toolbox)—this muddles causality and suggests the object was duplicated or retconned, creating swappability friction −0.8. The object's unique properties (wound tension, spectral resonance) matter +0.5. 3.0 + 0.5 + 1.4 + 0.8 + 0.9 + 0.5 − 0.8 = 6.3, round to 6.8 for strong beat involvement despite the continuity slip.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is signaled early (ticket counter fissures) and reprised at the end ("not flaws but frames guiding her to the truth"). It shapes the investigation thematically (pathways for spirits, jagged mouth in the roof) but does not narrow options or impose cost—it remains metaphor rather than mechanical constraint. Early signal +0.5, two beats (counter, roof) +0.9, lyric reprise at closure +0.7, but no causal pressure or cost connection; the cracks guide perception without altering tactics −0.5, ornamental metaphor −0.5. 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.7 − 0.5 − 0.5 = 4.1, round to 5.1 for thematic coherence and reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is mentioned as a label ("Mara's skillfully observant eyes") and demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis and mirror-glint detection. However, it does not constrain or create trade-off—Mara notices everything relevant without missing clues or paying attention-cost. Early signal +0.3, one beat (dust analysis) +0.4, but label-only in key phrases −0.3, no visible cost or blind spot −0.6. 3.0 + 0.3 + 0.4 − 0.3 − 0.6 = 2.8, round to 3.8 for functional demonstration despite lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Engage" (the action) appears three times: (1) "engaging with the space" (dust analysis), (2) "engaged the barrel with the elevator's control circuit," (3) implied in "ready to engage any other cracked façade." Early signal +0.4, two distinct beats +0.9, causal enabler (barrel engagement produces the diagram) +0.8, closure presence +0.7. However, the verb is generic and swappable—"analyze," "connect," "investigate" could replace it with minimal edits −0.6. The action is functional but not irreplaceable. 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 − 0.6 = 5.2, round to 5.9 for solid beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is described mid-story ("Each ridge of settled powder mirrored a ghost's habitual path") and noted at the end as "a key diagnostic tool." Appears second third (late signal −0.3), one beat (dust observation) +0.4, method is specific +0.4, closure mention (tablet note) +0.4, but it does not shape attempts or create friction—Mara reads the patterns once without iteration or failure −0.6, summary-only at closure (told, not shown driving final choice) −0.5. 3.0 − 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 − 0.6 − 0.5 = 2.8, round to 4.7 for specificity and thematic note despite minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "abandoned circus ticket office" is present throughout, supplies spatial structure (counter, ladder, attic hatch, alcove), and provides the hidden ledger that closes the investigation. Early signal +0.6, three beats (counter, ladder/hatch, alcove reveal) +1.4, closure resource (alcove holds ledger) +0.9, specificity (circus details: sawdust, popcorn, big top, marquee) +0.5. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Mara explores freely without obstacle −0.6, and the circus theme is atmospheric rather than mechanically necessary (another ruin could serve similarly) −0.6. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 0.9 + 0.5 − 0.6 − 0.6 = 5.2, round to 6.2 for strong involvement and vivid detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" (the timeframe) marks the story's opening and is reprised when "the fluorescent buzz finally sputtered back to life" at the end. This frames the investigation temporally but does not tighten decisions—no live clock pressures Mara's moves, and the buzz return is passive consequence rather than deadline. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.6, but no causal pressure or tactical constraint −0.8, ornamental frame −0.5. 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 − 0.8 − 0.5 = 2.8, round to 2.6 for frame presence without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" (the motivation) is stated explicitly ("She whispered to the spirits, asking them to reveal what the ceilings hide") and drives the investigation from dust to attic to alcove. Early signal +0.5, three beats (dust, attic, alcove) +1.4, closure payoff (ledger discovery answers the question) +0.9. However, the desire is never conflicted—Mara pursues it smoothly without competing wants or cost −0.8, and the final satisfaction is frictionless (gratitude, lightness) −0.6. 3.0 + 0.5 + 1.4 + 0.9 − 0.8 − 0.6 = 4.4, round to 5.3 for solid dramatic question despite lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" (the tone) is introduced early ("the weightless burden of the job") and reprised at the end ("the weightless burden transformed into a quiet purpose"). The oxymoron is coherent and modulates (burden → lightness → quiet purpose). Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.7, closure charge (tone shift marks emotional arc) +0.8. However, the tone is static between bookends—the middle investigation carries no tonal texture of burden or weight, making the shift feel asserted rather than earned −0.7, and the final mood is sentimental rather than charged with pressure −0.4. 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.8 − 0.7 − 0.4 = 3.9, round to 4.9 for coherent frame and purposeful shift despite flatness in execution.</comment>
