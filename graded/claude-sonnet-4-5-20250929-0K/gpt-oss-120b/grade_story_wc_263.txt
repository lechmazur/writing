<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains a cipher throughout—"moonstruck dreamer" is a label, not a character with distinct motives or contradictory impulses. Interior access is entirely abstract ("shadowed rapture," "unvoiced poems surge through his veins") with no embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final "rest had birthed a new constellation of ideas" declares transformation without earning it through on-page conflict or cost. Agency is absent; the dreamer observes and receives rather than deciding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece lacks clear causality: the dreamer enters, traces stars, and "creativity is freed" without meaningful tightening or reversal. No on-page cost is legible—the instrument is "left behind" but this forfeiture carries no felt weight or consequence. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery recurs, density of metaphor increases), yet the final image does not reweight prior material; it simply repeats the opening premise. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when remain vague until mid-passage), triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered with "violet and emerald shadows" and the cold stone recurs, but setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains postcard backdrop. The astronomical instrument is described ("brass limbs etched with constellations") but not handled in ways that affect outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent (archway, stone floor, walls) and sensory detail is selective, lifting the score above functional, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to free trapped creativity"—is declared but never tested on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The dreamer's actions (rest, trace, lift instrument) do not escalate pressure or narrow choices. The "final crescendo" and "freedom" are asserted without reversal or cost. Coincidence (stars fall conveniently) enables resolution rather than protagonist agency, violating the lens requirement that coincidence may complicate but not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "dreams linger like dust on the wind," "rest was not an end but a cycle," and the final "where creativity could once again flow unbound" are direct thematic summaries without emergence from particulars. The astronomical instrument and stardust remain ornamental motifs that do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending. The final paragraph moralizes ("Sometimes, in the hush before dawn…") instead of trusting image, triggering the explicit-moralizing penalty of −0.6 in this category.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (third-limited), but the narrative voice is generic elevated-fantasy register with no perceptual signature specific to this character. Diction throughout ("shadowed rapture," "aurora-lit," "moonstruck") is interchangeable poetic stock without syntactic or rhythmic variation tied to the dreamer's mind. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are attempted, but the effect flattens into synonym churn ("verses," "poems," "chorus," "symphony") rather than a taught pattern that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "unspoken words" / "unvoiced poems" / "unheard verses" / "final unspoken word"; "rest" appears eight times with minimal variation. Template cadence dominates (e.g., "He realized…," "He learned…," "He left behind…"). Stock metaphors cluster without grounding ("pulse like quiet hearts," "sigh from the heavens," "scented with hope"). Figurative density in every sentence of peak beats (final third) triggers −0.7 for overwriting. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise (artist visits mystical place, performs symbolic ritual, achieves creative breakthrough) is a writing-prompt template without transformation. The astronomical instrument, stardust, and aurora remain interchangeable fantasy ornaments—swap in "moonstone amulet," "forgotten melody," "crystalline grotto" and the arc is unchanged. No fresh inflection or risk-taking; the journey from creative blockage to release follows a median, hedged path. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 for unmodified template use.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The moonstruck dreamer is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or stakes. All actions (drifts, settles, traces, rises, walks away) are passive observations or rituals without cost or conflict. Missing development and closure participation gates; introduced early but never drives a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument appears in three beats (entry with it in palm, aligning sighting tube, left behind at end) but its mechanics never constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The "glimmered brighter" moment is decorative. Present in closure (left behind) but without reweighted meaning or causal force.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is mentioned twice as thematic backdrop ("clung to his skin," "swirled around the dreamer's aura") but never shapes on-page options or tactics. It remains abstract flavor text without stakes impact. Missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is label-only; the trait is asserted ("could hear unspoken words drifting") but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. The dreamer passively receives "unvoiced poems" without friction or trade-off. Present by second paragraph but ornamental throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rest" appears in eight lines and frames the arc (brief rest, pause before crescendo, heart finally rest, rest was not an end but a cycle), creating a lyric early–final reprise that reweights the stake mildly. Yet no major turn traces to rest as an action; it is contemplative backdrop rather than a decision that alters outcome. Two-gate (setup, payoff) lyric structure allows ~6.0 range; swappability and ornamental middle use prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is signaled early and enacted on-page ("drawing thin silver lines," "Each traced star became a key"). The method shapes one beat (the tracing act that "unlocked chambers") but does not constrain later choices or appear in closure. Functional in middle development but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is present from the opening and recurs in five beats, including the final "archway faded into the horizon" and later "return to the archway." It supplies vivid setting detail and frames the ritual space, but never pressures a choice or alters tactics—postcard function. Two-gate (setup, payoff) with moderate beat involvement lifts it to mid-band, but missing causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" is mentioned once in the method description and never tracked or dramatized. Time remains vague (repeated "each night," "that night onward," "before dawn") without tightening decisions. Missing all three gates; ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is stated in the opening third and recurs ("trapped creativity had been released," "creativity could once again flow unbound") but is never conflicted or tested by a choice with cost. The desire is told, not dramatized through friction. Present in closure thematically but without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" appears once as a phrase and the tone (reverent, mystical, elevated) is stable throughout without modulation under pressure. The mood does not shift with escalation or charge the final image distinctly. Coherent but static, trending mid-low per the rubric.</comment>
