<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The violinist remains a vessel for atmospheric display rather than a protagonist with contradictory impulses acting under pressure. Her motivation "to find beauty in the unfinished" is asserted through narration ("seeking beauty in the unfinished world") but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The interior life consists of poetic observation ("felt the chronic hush lift") without embodied emotion or micro-decisions that foreclose a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance emerges; she walks away serene, unchanged by any friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (violinist), where (greenhouse/bonfire), and when (tonight/dusk) anchor by the opening lines; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (bowl, fire, shipwrecks, vines) and the final image reweights the hush into "a space waiting to be filled." However, no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual cost appears on the page. The violinist plays, the bowl hums, the villagers feel curiosity, and she walks away with "infinite grace"—a mood shift without visible or felt price. Closure form fails the definition: no before/after legible with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks anchor the opening with vivid, purpose-driven detail (glass walls flickering, timbers resonating, waterlogged floorboards). Sensory selection is strong in early beats (ash, copper glow, damp earth vibrations). However, spatial choreography weakens in the bonfire sequence: the bowl moves from "fire's edge" to unspecified positions without tracking, and the violinist's physical relationship to the orchard vines at closure lacks clear staging. The micro-setting (bowl, strings, vines) appears but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unbinding silence to honor family storytelling tradition—is signaled early but never faces on-page friction. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful opposition appears; the violinist plays, the bowl sings, the hush lifts, and everyone understands. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing resists. The final act (playing a lingering refrain, walking away) carries no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight cost; here mood accumulates without escalation or agency-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the unfinished, silence as canvas) emerges through images—bowl collecting notes, charcoal roots, vines swaying—but the final paragraph states the thesis overtly: "the unfinished was a canvas of endless light" and "infinite grace." This thematic echo in closure deflates resonance (−0.6). The piece gestures toward ambiguity ("not erased but transformed") yet the villagers "understood" in unison, flattening complexity. No counter-reading persists; the story resolves into a tidy epiphany without cost or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("chronic hush," "mendicant's bowl," "perpetual act of seeking") that remains consistent but edges into ornamental diction during peak beats without clear character filter. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-particular; the violinist's interiority reads as thematic narration. Free indirect style blurs: "she felt that the act of unbinding silence with music was the truest tribute" reads as author thesis rather than character perception under pressure. No distinct rhythmic modulation with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "chronic hush" appears five times with near-synonym restatements ("silence was never absolute, only waiting to be unbound" / "unbinding the silence that had settled" / "the chronic hush was not a void but a space waiting to be filled"). Template cadence runs in paragraphs 10–12 with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors appear without fresh angles ("tide seeking a hidden shore," "seed sprouting in ash"). Figurative density in closure beats ("infinite grace," "canvas of endless light") elevates register without embodied anchoring. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, metaphor muddle −0.4 = baseline ~4.9; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—musician healing communal trauma through storytelling ritual—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0). The echo-harbor violinist and mendicant's bowl offer surface novelty but function as ornament rather than driving fresh stakes. Turns feel predictable: she plays, the hush lifts, everyone understands. No bold risk-taking; the piece retreats into serene consensus. One small inflection—the bowl as sound-collector—shows ingenuity but does not reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Echo-harbor violinist is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, plays, and walks away; all moves are illustrative rather than causal. The trait "echo-harbor" is never unpacked or used to constrain choice. Setup present; development absent (no choice under friction); closure participation ornamental (cameo in final walk). Missing development → cap 3.4. Swappable with "musician" or "performer" with minor edits → cap 3.8; use lower. Ornamental use −0.6 = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl appears in beats 4 (introduced), 7 (placed at fire's edge), 12 (vibrates/collects), 17 (sang chord of gratitude), 20 (set down, still humming), 24 (soft song fading). Setup early; development functional (collects sound in beat 12); closure participation present (beat 24 references fading song). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the bowl's mechanics are vague—how does copper "collect" sound and "unbind" silence?—and no specific cost ties to its use. It enables rather than constrains. Causal pressure weak +0.4, closure linkage modest +0.5, irreplaceability moderate +0.4, but swappability moderate (another resonant object could serve) −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Chronic hush appears by name in beats 2 (introduced), 10 (remembered), 16 (lift felt), 23 (not void but space). Setup early; development weak (remembered in beat 10 but does not narrow options); closure participation thematic only (beat 23 restates as metaphor without altering action). Two gates → eligible up to ~6.0. However, the concept is label-only; "hush" does not constrain the violinist's playing or change what she can attempt. It remains atmosphere rather than stake-shaping force. Ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.4, no causal pressure = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Acoustically perceptive mentioned once in beat 3 ("feeling vibrations through the damp earth that others would hear only as a faint sigh"). Setup present; development and closure absent—the trait never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. She plays violin like any musician would; no choice depends on acute hearing. Missing development and closure → caps 3.4 and 2.8; use 3.4. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5, swappable (remove the phrase and the story is unchanged) −0.8; floor at 3.0 per default = 3.2 after small rounding adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Unbind appears in beats 5 (bowl could "unbind" silence), 12 (notes "unbinding the silence"), 23 ("unbinding silence with music"), 25 (same). Setup early; development in beat 12 (playing unbinds silence); closure participation in beats 23/25 (thesis statement). All three gates → eligible ≥6.1. However, unbinding is conceptual metaphor rather than dramatized action with cost. The violinist plays and silence lifts without friction. No specific mechanics or trade-off. Causal pressure weak +0.4, closure linkage thematic +0.5, but swappable with "release" or "transform" −0.6, summary-only (told effect, not shown struggle) −0.4 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire introduced in beat 6, executed in beats 6–14 (oldest storyteller speaks, violinist plays, listeners feel curiosity, tradition taught them to weave lives into flame). Setup early; development in beats 6–14 (the method structures the scene's middle acts); closure participation weak (beat 25 references "family's stories had become the tide" but the bonfire itself does not appear in final image). Two gates → eligible up to ~6.0; lyric reprise allowance pushes to ~6.3. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one extended sequence) +0.4, but no specific cost tied to the tradition itself (anyone could tell stories) and mechanics generic. Swappability moderate −0.4 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks present in beats 1–2 (vivid opening), 10 (vines mentioned), 15 (vines sway), 19 (orchard breathes), 25 (vines brush shoulders). Setup strong; development weak (vines sway in beat 15 but do not alter tactics); closure participation descriptive (beat 25 brush). Two gates → eligible up to ~6.0. However, the setting is postcard backdrop; no choice depends on greenhouse walls, shipwreck proximity, or orchard layout. Spatial choreography unclear in bonfire beats. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage decorative +0.3, but ornamental use −0.8, swappable (another ruin would serve) −0.5 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the rainforest burns" mentioned in beat 1 (past-tense backstory) and beat 8 (story recounts the burn). Setup present but vague; no development (elapsed time since burn unstated, no clock pressure on tonight's ritual); closure absent (the burn does not shape final image). One gate → cap 4.6. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than live constraint. No tactics depend on how long after or how soon before another event. Ornamental −0.7, summary-only −0.5, no causal pressure −0.8 = floor 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation to find beauty in the unfinished stated in beat 11 ("seeking beauty in the unfinished world"), echoed in beats 18 ("beauty lay not in what was completed, but in the perpetual act of seeking"), 20 ("unfinished was a canvas of endless light"). Setup mid-story (~40% mark) → cap 4.6 per late-introduction rule. Development told rather than tested (no friction between wanting beauty and cost of seeking it); closure participation thematic summary. Told-only −0.6, no visible friction −0.5, swappable with generic "hope" or "healing" −0.4 = 4.6 cap binds.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone of magnificent simplicity sustained through lyric diction ("soft as a seed sprouting in ash," "gentle hum," "quiet promise," "serene sense," "infinite grace") and restrained syntax. Coherent across turns; modulates slightly in beat 8 (storyteller's voice "low and resonant") and beat 21 ("magnificent simplicity" named on-page). Setup implicit from opening; development consistent; closure participation strong (beats 21, 24, 25 reinforce serenity). All three gates → eligible ≥6.1. However, tone is static mood rather than dynamic pressure; no tonal shift charges the final image with cost. Single static mood guidance trends mid-low, but cross-beat consistency and explicit naming lift slightly. Causal pressure absent −0.5, closure linkage thematic +0.7, coherence +0.5 = 5.9.</comment>
