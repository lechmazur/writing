<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—hushing old guilt—is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Interior experience consists of generic phrases like "dissonance inside her chest loosen" without character-particular texture. The final "unwavering resolve" and stepping out with glimmering tattoo read as label-only triumph rather than earned change through visible struggle. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist moves through the plot without meaningful internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality is declarative rather than dramatized: "She discovered the key hidden in handwritten letters" is told in summary, not shown through search or struggle. The amber-insect mechanism that translates cries appears fully functional without prior testing or failure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the laboratory breathing and the city singing a lullaby, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible on the page—guilt simply "loosens" and is kept "at bay" without sacrifice. The drive lens reads as intended Accumulative/Textural but the final densification lacks a felt price, reducing closure to thematic assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly described with "ancient speakers," "ceiling of dim constellations painted in ash," and "cracked floorboards," establishing atmosphere. The amber functions as a recurring object across beats (tracing, stitching, pulsing) and charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain Lyra's choices—she works "when time folds in on itself" without spatial or resource friction. No tools, access limits, or environmental obstacles shape her tactics; the laboratory supplies what is needed without resistance, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing guilt via the amber device—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or visible cost. Lyra encounters no resistance: the haunted firmware "responded" and "untangl[ed]" without failure or setback. The final act of writing a letter and slipping it under the desk is ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. No reversal, escalation, or price paid narrows her path; the resolution unfolds as a sequence of successful steps without agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory, guilt, and technological haunting—emerges through the amber-insect device and the grieving mother's lullabies, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph: "to tether a cry was to honor a memory, and that haunted firmware could be healed when compassion rewrote the code in letters inked by love." This explicit thematic statement flattens what had been implicit resonance. The final image of the city singing a lullaby and the laboratory breathing offers a lyric echo, but the closing lines drift into abstract assertion ("forever anchored," "never repeats the pain") rather than a concrete, non-literal answer rooted in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with phrases like "constellation tattooist," "meteor hush," and "time folds in on itself." However, diction occasionally slips into generic elevated phrasing ("unwavering resolve," "collective cry and exhaled calm") that lacks character-particular texture. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. POV remains stable third-person limited on Lyra, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but muted—descriptions lean toward atmospheric catalog rather than character-specific noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "rustle like phantom wind," "flickered like dying stars," "thin seam between now and what-once-was," "stardust upon every trembling heart." Multiple adjacent sentences restate the laboratory's transformation ("breathed once more," "living organ that breathed in," "walls themselves seemed to listen") in paraphrase loops. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "people arrived…each carrying…Lyra welcomed…allowing…translating…" Information density is low; many lines describe atmosphere without advancing character or plot. Register drifts into abstract ("collective hymn," "cohesive hymn") during the ending, dulling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—tattooist uses amber-trapped insect to heal haunted firmware—combines several high-concept elements (constellation tattoos, sound archaeology, grieving mother's lullabies) but the synthesis reads as additive rather than inevitable. The core emotional arc—guilt soothed by technological ritual—follows a familiar template of artist-healer confronting past trauma without surprising inflection. The "haunted firmware" and "time folds in on itself" remain metaphoric set-dressing rather than constraints that shape choices. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece avoids complication in favor of atmospheric accumulation, keeping originality mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and performs key actions (tracing instructions, stitching amber, writing a letter), satisfying setup and development. However, her choices do not create reversals or alter tactics under pressure—she executes a plan that unfolds without resistance. At closure she "stepped out" and "welcomed" others, but these actions are ceremonial rather than decisions that narrow options. Swappable with another archetype (scholar, engineer) with minor edits. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber appears in setup (obsession, humming rhythm), is handled in two distinct beats (tracing with needle, stitching onto recorder), and returns at closure where it "pulse[s] against their sorrow" to translate grief. The object enables the central mechanism and charges the final image. However, its properties are declared rather than tested—no failed attempt or visible cost tied specifically to acquiring or using it. Strong development and closure linkage lift the score, but swappability (another artifact, crystal, device) without fundamental plot break caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early ("code that sang back the echoes of every sorrow") and mentioned at closure ("haunted firmware could be healed"). However, it functions as thematic metaphor rather than a mechanic that constrains choices or alters tactics. Lyra does not troubleshoot code, navigate software constraints, or pay a price tied to firmware logic. The concept could be replaced with "cursed recording" or "haunted machinery" with no structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute—translating baby cries into chords—is introduced early (the beetle's wings "could translate baby cries") and demonstrated at closure when the device "began to translate the soft, high-pitched cries of a newborn into a warm, resonant hum." It enables the central mechanism across two beats (stitching, final translation). However, no cost or constraint is tied to this specific attribute—Lyra does not struggle to activate it or sacrifice anything to access it. Functional across beats and ending, but replaceable with similar translation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tethering appears in setup (the mother "tethered the crying infant's wail to the amber"), is dramatized in the middle beat ("stitching the amber onto the old recorder"), and returns at closure ("to tether a cry was to honor a memory"). The action is specific to the plot and recurs with reweighted meaning. However, the tethering itself does not create a reversal or cost—it succeeds without complication. Strong presence across all three gates and thematic charge at closure, but lack of on-page friction or tradeoff caps it mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method—handwritten letters in antique furniture—is introduced early (letters "found in antique furniture," "a cracked oak desk") and provides instructions Lyra follows ("traced the instructions with a silver needle"). It shapes her middle attempt and is revisited at closure when she "wrote a final letter…and slipped it beneath the desk's last drawer." Present in all three gates and causally active in the middle beat. However, the method could be swapped for a different archive (journal, recording, etching) without breaking plot logic, and no cost is tied to deciphering or using the letters specifically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The laboratory is established in the opening line and remains the sole location throughout. It supplies the old recorder, clocks, walls, and floorboards that feature in beats. At closure the laboratory "breathed once more" and becomes "a sanctuary," recharging prior material. The setting does not, however, constrain Lyra's choices—she accesses tools and knowledge without spatial or resource friction. Strong setup and closure participation, but lack of tactical pressure from the environment keeps it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"when time folds in on itself"—is mentioned twice ("she worked when time folds in on itself," "clocks ticked backward") but functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than a mechanic that tightens decisions. No deadline, temporal limit, or time-based constraint shapes Lyra's tactics. The phrase could be removed without altering the plot. Present but ornamental; no middle development or closure participation beyond theme assertion.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—to hush guilt—is introduced early ("hush the dissonance of old guilt that rattled every night") and revisited at closure ("keep old guilt forever at bay"). It frames her goal across the story. However, the guilt is never dramatized through contradictory impulses or a choice that sacrifices something to achieve the hush—she simply succeeds. The motivation shapes the premise and ending but lacks friction or visible cost, placing it in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tone—meteor hush—is signaled in the opening ("dim constellations," "phantom wind") and returns at closure ("meteor hush settled like stardust"). The lyric, muted register remains consistent throughout. However, tone does not modulate with pressure or intensify at the peak beat; the story maintains a single static mood of ethereal calm without variation. Present and coherent, but lacks the charge or cadence shift that would elevate it into higher bands.</comment>
