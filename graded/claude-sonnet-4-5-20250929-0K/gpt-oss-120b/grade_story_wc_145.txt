<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and drives the action toward mapping the rivers' origin, but her "dry-witted" and "subtly confident" traits remain label-only without behavioral embodiment. The final choice to step outside and record coordinates is dramatized, but the interior progression feels declarative rather than contradictory—she moves from tranquility to hope without visible internal friction. The phrasebook functions as a prop rather than a relationship crucible, and no secondary character applies on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mara discovers the condensation pattern, aligns the transmitter, and the signal triggers the bell and thaw. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the ice cracks, the falcon circles, and Mara prepares to map the convergence—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt (no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens holds, but the final image reweights meaning more than it imposes a legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and glass-with-condensation are vividly rendered and purposefully deployed. The transmitter's antenna alignment and the falcon's flight path constrain Mara's tactical choices, and the ice crack in the final beat charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (lamplight, iron taste, ice crunch), though the broader geography of subterranean streams remains abstract. The micro-setting (glass, lamp, transmitter) functions as environment that shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping the rivers' origin—is signaled early and tightens through discovery of the condensation route, transmitter activation, and the bell's toll. Pressure accumulates under the accumulative lens, but Mara faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; the transmitter works, the signal bursts forth, and the thaw unfolds on cue. The tightening is atmospheric rather than agonistic, and no visible cost (stamina, tool failure, social price) alters her tactics. One clean deepening without friction or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ice/water/silence triad and the recurring convergence motif; "Kaltwasser" and the final vein of water offer a resonant answer to the question of origins without sermonizing. The falcon, phrasebook, and glass condensation reprise with shifted meaning at closure. However, "worrying tranquility" and the dread/hope pairing feel asserted more than embodied in contradictory action. The ending reweights prior material but stops short of full conceptual or emotional cost—Mara smiles, ready and hopeful, with terror mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable single-third, and diction carries a purposeful lyric register ("rusted compass," "ice sang"). However, the narrative voice tilts toward elevated poetic phrasing that occasionally clashes with Mara's pragmatic editorial role ("worrying tranquility," "ode to singular convergence"). Mara's perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—sensory details (iron taste, ice crunch) could belong to any attentive observer. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure, but the voice reads more authorial than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("compass," "herald," "veins," "portal," "mirror-like hush," "ice sang"), creating lyric texture but also register drift in peak beats where concreteness would sharpen pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "worrying tranquility" is restated as "calm that bordered on dread," and "the ice sang, and the world listened" echoes prior atmospheric declarations. Template cadence in the middle third (she took, she slipped, she traced, she aligned, she pressed) flattens momentum. Information density is adequate, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate. Apply −0.8 for loops and cadence plus −0.3 for figurative muddle in pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The atlas-editor protagonist, condensation-as-map device, and polyglot's phrasebook offer a fresh synthesis, and the singular-convergence concept is followed through to the thaw. However, the emotional arc (tranquility → dread → hope) and the mentor-object trope (phrasebook as guide) are familiar, and the final smile softens the stakes into safe optimism. The falcon-as-sentinel and ice-as-silence motifs are executed competently but not transformed. Risk-taking in lyric mode elevates slightly, but the ending retreats from bold consequence into readiness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices (lighting the lamp, aligning the transmitter, stepping outside) drive beats, but her "dry-witted" trait is label-only—no wry dialogue or tart observation appears on the page. She is the focal agent but not irreplaceable; a similar determined researcher would serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in the opening beat (companion, dog-ear curled), returns when Mara presses its dog-ear against the pane to imprint a glyph, and is mentioned as "herald" with cracked spine. Two beats plus thematic echo, but the object's polyglot property and the dog-ear's specific shape do not constrain or enable a choice—Mara could use any flat surface. Setup and middle use qualify, but payoff is functional rather than charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Singular convergence is signaled early (condensation route, rivers merge before dissolving), shapes Mara's goal (find where the rivers begin), and appears in the Kaltwasser word ("same root"), the transmitter signal, and the final vein of water. The concept organizes stakes and the ending image, and the thaw literalizes convergence. Three beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure present. Specificity is thematic rather than tactical, capping high-band entry, but integration is solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is mentioned in the second sentence ("aware that every marginal note she added could tilt the fragile balance") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Mara's confidence is asserted, not tested. She proceeds without hesitation or self-doubt. Label-only trait, no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Herald" appears twice: the phrasebook is taken "as a herald" (its cracked spine "announcing a new campaign"), and later "each clang a herald of impending thaw." The action of proclaiming/signaling drives the transmitter beat (signal burst carries the promise) and the bell's toll, both major turns. The concept shapes Mara's choice to activate the transmitter. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The term's metaphorical use dilutes irreplaceability slightly but remains integral.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Condensation is signaled early (page marked by pattern, secret script), Mara uses the glass-and-lamp method to reveal symbols (heat generates droplets, paths intersect like veins), and the condensation pattern pulses at the transmitter moment, directly enabling the signal. Three beats, causal mechanics matter (heat→droplets→map), and the method is indispensable to the ending—without it, no route and no transmission. Specificity and cost linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The outpost is introduced immediately, its rusted bell and transmitter constrain Mara's tactics (she must use the outpost's equipment), and the location frames all action. The frozen lake supplies the thaw imagery and subterranean-stream lore, altering the stakes. Two beats (transmitter, bell) plus closure charge (ice crack outside). However, the outpost could be any remote station with a transmitter; the "rusted" and "frozen lake" details are atmospheric rather than uniquely functional. Setup, development, and payoff present; modest causal pressure and closure linkage score well, but swappability caps high-band access.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The falcon's return is mentioned early ("after the falcon returns, the air tasted of iron"), Mara aligns the transmitter with its flight path (trusting the bird signals "a window of opportunity"), and it circles in the final beat casting shadows. Two beats, and the timeframe enables the transmission choice. However, the urgency is atmospheric—no ticking clock or narrowing window alters Mara's tactics on the page. Functional but not pressured use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to map the rivers' origin is stated early ("simple yet profound"), drives her choice to activate the transmitter and step outside to record coordinates, and the final vein of water literalizes the beginning. Three beats, causal linkage, and closure participation. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no friction between competing wants or visible cost (time, safety, doubt). Strong integration but limited conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is introduced early ("Mara felt a worrying tranquility settle"), modulates to "calm that bordered on dread" and "hope," and the final smile softens the tone into optimism. Tone is coherent and shifts with pressure, charging the ending's poise. However, the tranquility-dread pairing is asserted more than embodied in action or perception—Mara proceeds without visible hesitation. Setup, development, and payoff present; tone reweights the image but lacks visible cost.</comment>
