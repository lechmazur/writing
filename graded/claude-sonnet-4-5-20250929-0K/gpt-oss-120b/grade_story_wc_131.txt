<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren's "kindly methodical nature" is stated but rarely constrains choice; her actions proceed without visible internal conflict or trade-offs. The caching and tape-recovery unfold as smooth execution rather than decisions under pressure. The final visibility moment reads as thematic declaration rather than earned change with foreclosed options. Interiority remains abstract—"collective yearning," "quiet grief"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. The ending declares visibility achieved but lacks visible cost or a before/after that the reader can trace in Maren's options or stance; she "steps forward" and "smiled" without forfeiting a lived-in alternative. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sensory pattern, resonance motifs), yet no decisive cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure—"sapphire hush" recurs as decoration rather than a charged turn. The tape-reel discovery and circuit completion unfold without setback or tightening that narrows her path, reducing closure to summarized outcome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library's aisles, pipe chases, basement room, and copper conduits provide spatial anchors and guide Maren's path. "Sapphire hush" and flickering neon recur, though more as motif than constraint. The tape-reel spindle functions as micro-setting that enables the circuit closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement in principle, but the choice to place the coil is undramatic—no risk, access problem, or competing option—so the setting does not force a costly decision at the peak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—becoming visible to those who need help—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Maren's retrieval and placement of the tape fragment proceed without reversal, failure, or a moment where she must surrender another goal. The "flickering lights" nod toward urgency but impose no time pressure that alters tactics. No on-page tightening or deepening narrows options; the ending summarizes success rather than dramatizing a choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme (visibility as acknowledgment of loss, methodical kindness as archive work) emerges through image and motif—rain-smell sense memory, phantom patrons, cache as conduit. Yet the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "methodical kindness would continue to echo, guiding future seekers," which edges into Thematic Echo territory. The sense-memory map and blue glow offer concrete particulars, preventing full collapse into abstraction, but the ending does not pose a resonant question or ambiguity; it delivers a fulfilled promise without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren. Diction is elevated and poetic—"sapphire hush," "quiet arteries," "lingering shadows"—but consistent throughout, so register is voice-motivated rather than drift. Phrase recycling is notable: "sapphire hush" appears four times, "sense memory" five times, "kindly methodical" twice, "visible to those who need you" twice, creating template cadence that flattens rhythm. Perceptual signature is generic—Maren notices dust, rust, echoes—without character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy loop and scaffold debt: "sapphire hush" x4, "sense memory" x5, "flickering" x3, "kindly methodical" x2 within 800 words. Paraphrase loop in opening: "cool breath of dust and ink" / "aisles stretching like quiet arteries" restate atmosphere without added pressure. Template stems recur: "She knew that…" / "She realized that…" / "She felt…". Mixed metaphor: "aisles stretching like quiet arteries" (anatomical) clashes with "library breathed a sigh of relief" (personification of the building as lungs). Register drift into abstract elevation—"collective yearning," "language of light"—dilutes immediacy at closure. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering cumulative deduction of −1.7 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The crawl-space archivist recovering lost media to help the forgotten is a familiar template (quirky loner restores community memory). "Sense memory encoded on ferromagnetic tape" offers specificity, but the tape functions as a magic key rather than a constraint with trade-offs. The visibility-as-acknowledgment theme is earnest but predictable. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus; the story commits to its gentle, lyric premise but does not transform it through friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maren (crawl space dweller) is present throughout but makes no key turn via choice under pressure. She retrieves, places, and steps forward in linear success; no decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. Observation trends low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment is handled in three beats: discovery (brushed against conduits), caching (placed in alcove), and circuit completion (fitted into spindle). It enables the blue glow and closure moment, but is not reweighted—its function remains static. Meets two-gate threshold (setup, middle, payoff) but lacks causal pressure or cost tied to its use, capping near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sense memory (rain on stone, first sunrise) is named repeatedly and frames Maren's goal, but does not constrain or enable a choice on the page. It functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping device. Present throughout but ornamental, trending functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is stated twice as label without visible trade-off or cost. No on-page action where patience costs time, or kindness forecloses a faster option. Ornamental trait mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Caching (placing fragments in alcoves, completing the circuit) structures the plot but does not create a turn or cost. Maren caches without opposition or sacrifice; the action is present and functional but swappable with "restoring" or "activating" with minor edits. Functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is mentioned (following metallic resonance down a serpentine pipe to the basement), but the method is summary description rather than on-page problem-solving. No mechanics shown; no choice shaped by the difficulty of pipe-chase navigation. Present in middle development but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn (flickering streetlights, cracked windows, vaulted ceiling, basement room with recording equipment) anchors all action and supplies the spindle that completes the circuit, directly shaping the closure. Early setup, middle navigation, and payoff present. The setting enables rather than pressures, but the spindle's presence is causally necessary, lifting the score into the essential-across-beats range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The outage and flickering lights are mentioned three times but impose no deadline or tactical constraint. Maren's work proceeds at her own pace; the lights "seemed to steady" at the end without consequence. Time is vague and does not tighten decisions. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation (to become visible to those who need you) is stated early, recurs at midpoint and closure, and frames the ending image. Yet it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or cost—Maren pursues it without friction. The ending fulfills the desire without sacrifice, so the motivation shapes the arc but lacks the friction required for higher bands. Functional, one-beat causal role at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" recurs in opening, middle, and final paragraph, framing the atmosphere. Tone remains static—contemplative, gentle—without modulation under pressure or charged shift at closure. The phrase is lyric but ornamental, not reweighted by cost. Functional but replaceable with "quiet dawn" or similar.</comment>
