<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The painter remains a static abstraction with no on-page decisions that shift tactics or foreclose options. His motivation is stated ("to persuade mirrors to show possibilities") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible costs. The piece offers no embodied emotion—only labels like "perceptively calm"—and no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of stock metaphors ("borrowed heartbeat," "dusky harmony") repeated without characterological specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No causal chain or decisive change is legible; the painter completes his vision without friction, obstacle, or cost. The mirrors "begin to flicker" and then "shimmer" through unexplained agency, not protagonist choice. Orientation is absent: who, where, when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4 applied). The ending presents a cascade of doors but no before/after stakes shift or visible price paid, failing the closure requirement entirely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting details are atmospheric but never constrain a choice or shift tactics. The "echoing terrace," "prism parapet," and "mirrors" function as static backdrops without spatial choreography or physical consequence. Sensory selection reads as decorative catalog rather than filtered through urgency or goal-directed action. No tool, body state, or environmental pressure charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows options; the painter's work proceeds unopposed to an effortless outcome. Children and bells appear as ambient texture without applying pressure. Cost is absent: the protagonist achieves his goal without sacrifice, failure, or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme is announced rather than earned through specific events: "possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat to awaken them" is direct moralizing. Motifs ("borrowed heartbeat," "dusky harmony," "coded lullabies") recur as labels without constraining choices or accruing new meaning. The ending declares resonance ("mirrors will always reveal a new horizon") instead of offering a non-literal image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Voice demonstrates lyric ambition with patterned diction ("dusky harmony," "prism parapet after rain"), but perceptual signature is generic and interchangeable. Psychic distance remains far throughout with no modulation under pressure. Recycled stems ("each," "the," "his") and stock metaphors ("borrowed heartbeat," "cascade of light") flatten texture. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "borrowed heartbeat" appears seven times without functional variation; "dusky harmony" and "perceptively calm" are repeated mechanically. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]," "The [noun]" sentence openers cluster without taught pattern. Mixed metaphors: "borrowed heartbeat" shifts referent from droplets to brush to world pulse incoherently (−0.8). Stock phrases ("cascade of light," "tapestry of sound") replace concrete action. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disallow-9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist transforms reality through coded art—is a widely used template executed without fresh specificity. The "mirrors showing possibilities" and "lullabies hiding ciphers" remain abstract declarations rather than lived-in mechanics. Emotional and physical particulars are absent; no risk distinguishes this execution from generic portal-fantasy or artist-as-magician tropes. The final image offers symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options;观察 only. Introduced early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mentioned in three beats but always as static description ("caught the dwindling sun," "glittered like a choir"). No handling, evolving use, or causal pressure. Does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image beyond decorative mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Repeated seven times as a thematic label without shaping stakes or altering tactics. Summary-only: "whispered the borrowed heartbeat into his brush" recounts rather than dramatizes. Does not change options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>Label-only trait with no on-page cost or enabling tradeoff. "Perceptively calm" describes demeanor but never constrains action or reveals a blind spot under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Present in description ("graceful strokes," "moved with a grace") but does not drive a turn or redefine options. Easily swappable with "precision" or "care" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Signaled early and mentioned in three beats, but mechanics never matter: the lullabies are ambient texture, not tools that shape attempts or constrain the painter's work. No visible cost tied to their use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and returns in the ending ("terrace retained its echo"), but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Postcard atmosphere without spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Mentioned as framing device ("hush before bells rang," "when the first bell finally tolled") but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The clock is atmospheric, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stated early and present at closure, but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. The mirrors comply without resistance; no cost opposes the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyric register ("dusky harmony") present in first and final paragraphs, offering a purposeful seed-to-reprise frame. Tone does not modulate with pressure; remains static throughout. Contributes to closure atmosphere but does not charge the final image with new cost.</comment>
