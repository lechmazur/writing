<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation ("wavelength align with purpose") is declared but not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt," "uneasy certainty") without showing embodied emotion or internal conflict that would compel higher-stakes decisions. The final "alignment" is asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off or forfeiture that forecloses a path with felt cost. No secondary character is present to test status dynamics or relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~40 words, satisfying the test. The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Silas achieves "alignment," but the final beat lacks visible or felt cost—no option is foreclosed, no tactical shift is dramatized, and the prophecy's fulfillment is told rather than shown through a causal turn. The closure unit reads as abstract affirmation rather than an on-page reweighting with legible price. Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the ending does not produce a decisive cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" and "violet mist" are vivid and consistently tracked, and the deck's cracking glass at the end charges the final image with a micro-constraint (the void "whispering in"). The coins function as a recurring object that shifts meaning across beats. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting reflects Silas's isolation and purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice; it remains atmospheric rather than forcing tactical adaptation, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("wavelength align with purpose") is signaled early but remains abstract and never narrows options or forces a trade-off. The story recounts a sequence (coins decoded → prophecy unwound → alignment achieved) without on-page reversal, escalation, or visible cost that would test Silas's commitment. Coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's agency is passive: he follows instructions ("Turn the last coin face‑up") rather than making a decision that forecloses a path. No tactical shift or price is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy and wavelength-alignment motif are present, but the final image ("purpose pulse like a star newly born") is a generic abstraction rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The story offers a thesis statement ("purpose he sought was not a destination but a frequency") in the penultimate paragraph, which reads as moralizing rather than emergent subtext. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applies for prompt-like phrasing at closure. The deck's cracking glass and "distilling hope from fading signal" provide some particularity, lifting the score modestly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person, distance is consistent, and diction is generally controlled. However, the prose relies on stock metaphors ("thread through the cracks of time," "grand symphony of contraction") and elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak—Silas's way of noticing is generic rather than selective and biased in character-specific ways. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats deploys figurative language ("ambered observatory deck," "violet mist," "backwards prophecy," "wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "distill the murmurs," "thread through the cracks of time") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.7 for density. Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "dying stars," "fading signal," "contracting universe" recur without added pressure; "quietly enthusiastic" and "stellar doubt" are label-only. Template cadence appears in multiple beats ("He believed… He began… He lifted… He whispered…"). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise (backwards prophecy decoded via coins and static bursts in a contracting universe) is imaginative, but execution is template-driven: the protagonist follows instructions without fresh inflection, and key beats (prophecy unwinding, alignment achieved) are told rather than dramatized through specific, non-obvious choices. The "frequency as purpose" conceit is an abstraction rather than a concrete synthesis. Swappability is high: the coins, static, and prophecy function as interchangeable puzzle pieces without unique properties that constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Silas is the "cast lots decision maker" by role label, but his only on-page "decision" is to follow the prophecy's instruction ("Turn the last coin face‑up"). He observes, interprets, and complies without choosing between options or altering tactics with cost. Present in setup and ending, but functional involvement is ornamental; no causal turn traces to his agency. Cap at 2.8 for missing middle development; late-element and swappability adjustments lower to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "collection of foreign coins" appears in setup (first paragraph), middle (decoding pops), and ending (placed back into cradle, now humming). Three beats of involvement and closure participation meet all three gates. However, the coins are swappable with any symbolic object (runes, crystals, tablets); their "foreign" and "vanished civilization" properties do not constrain choice or enable a specific tactic. No visible cost is tied to the coins themselves. Swappability and lack of causal pressure cap at ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "backwards prophecy" is introduced in setup (paragraph two), decoded in the middle, and referenced at the ending ("final line of the backwards prophecy"). Three gates are met. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized: it does not change tactics or narrow options on the page; Silas reads the prophecy's instruction and complies. The mechanism (reading correctly only when the universe gazes toward the past) is asserted but never tested with cost. Ornamental use and summary-only involvement lower the score; three gates allow entry to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is label-only in paragraph one ("Silas was quietly enthusiastic about the strange collection") and again at the end ("his quietly enthusiastic heart pressed forward"). No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait; it does not produce a visible trade-off or cost. Present in setup and ending (two gates), but ornamental throughout. Label-only artifact penalty (−0.3) and swappability cap at ~1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in setup ("began to distill the murmurs") and ending ("distilling hope from the fading signal"), meeting two gates. The action is thematic rather than causal: Silas listens and interprets, but the mechanics are vague and do not shape a key turn with cost. Easily swappable with "decode," "interpret," or "translate." Lyric reprise reweights the stake modestly (distilling as rebellion), lifting the score to ~5.2 despite missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Understanding static bursts" is introduced in setup (paragraph eight: "a technique once taught by a wandering scholar") and mechanically deployed in the middle (coins emit pops when decoded) and ending (final static burst carries Silas's legend). Three gates met. However, the method is told, not shown: we never see how Silas performs the technique or why it matters tactically. The scholar's warning ("double-edged sword") is asserted but not tested with on-page cost. Summary-only use and late causal involvement lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" is present in setup (opening line), middle (walls soften, allowing light), and ending (glass cracks, deck breathes with Silas). Three gates met. The deck's cracking glass at the end constrains the closure image modestly (void whispers in), and the "ambered walls" shifting texture mid-story provides one beat of environmental change. However, the deck does not alter tactics or force a choice; it remains atmospheric. Closure linkage and one middle beat lift the score to ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the universe contracts" is stated in setup (paragraph four: prophecy claims "after the universe contracts") and ending (final paragraph: "As the universe continued its slow collapse"). Two gates met; no middle development. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure: no ticking clock, no tactical shift driven by contraction. Time does not tighten decisions or alter moves on the page. Ornamental use and missing middle gate cap at ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is declared in setup (paragraph five: "Silas's motivation"), pursued in the middle (alignment incomplete, doubts linger), and achieved in the ending (alignment complete). Three gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction or cost: Silas does not choose between competing wants, and the alignment is a passive event (he listens, the universe answers) rather than a forfeiture or trade-off. Summary-only involvement and lack of visible cost lower the score despite three-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" is present in setup ("environment pulsed with stellar doubt"), middle ("uneasy certainty," "doubts still lingered"), and ending ("stellar doubt turned quiet certainty"). Three gates met, and the tone modulates from doubt to certainty, reweighting the dominant stake. However, the shift is asserted rather than embodied in diction or rhythm: the prose remains uniformly elevated and figurative throughout. Coherent modulation and closure linkage lift the score to ~5.4.</comment>
