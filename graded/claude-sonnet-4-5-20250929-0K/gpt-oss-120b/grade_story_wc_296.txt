<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The druid remains a vessel for orchestrated actions rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "guarded" nature and "warlike serenity" are asserted labels that never manifest as on-page tension between competing desires—she moves through each beat with perfect calibration. The retrieval of the amulet and binding of the seed read as checklist fulfillment rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. Interiority consists entirely of stock mystical declarations ("she has sworn," "she knows") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: the "cursed lake" and "swirling orchard vortex" are named but never grounded in concrete spatial or temporal cues within the first ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece gestures toward a causal arc (druid seeks confession, releases it, seals it in seed) but the confession itself never alters her options or knowledge—it simply "shatters," she "gathers," she "whispers," with no visible cost or trade-off. The closure unit is a soft reset (lake clears, trees bow) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: accumulative imagery (expanding circles, shards) is present, but no pattern is taught early or paid off with a cadence shift or reweighting at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid but ornamental: the vortex, orchard, and lake are described yet never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The "swirling orchard vortex" and "expanding circles of ancient rune-lit water" function as postcard backdrops rather than micro-settings that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is unclear—the druid "steps into the vortex," trees "bend outward," but her position and the mechanics of her movement remain abstract. The amulet's retrieval and the seed's placement occur without spatial grounding or cost tied to the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (to "unbend a frozen confession") is declared but never tested: the druid encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and the confession's release carries no visible price. Escalation is absent—she steps in, chants, the ice shatters, she gathers shards, the lake clears. Coincidence does not complicate; it simply delivers. The "warlike serenity" tone implies internal tension, but no on-page beat shows her balancing competing pressures or narrowing options. The final image (lake sighs, orchard bows) is a soft resolution that resets rather than reconfigures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "what mirrors don't show," "warlike serenity," "truth beneath," and "lost things" are declared via prompt-echo language but never dramatized through specific conflict or micro-choices. The druid's "guarded heart finally open to the world" is a thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph (−0.5 for explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure). The seed, amulet, and confession recur but without reweighting prior material—they are moved like chess pieces to satisfy thematic labels. No resonant, non-literal answer emerges; the ending asserts meaning rather than enacting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance wavers between close ("she feels," "she knows") and elevated stock phrasing ("her presence a calm blade ready for battle"). The prose drifts into generic mystical register ("promises of future battles fought with the same calm steel") that reads detached from the druid's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present; voice distinction is not testable. Diction is consistent but lacks character-particular rhythm or selective attention—every detail is narrated with equal weight, flattening urgency. The opening simile ("like distant drums," "like a wounded bird," "like silver birds") establishes a lyric texture that does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: runs of "She [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences in the middle third (−0.6 for patterned artifact). Paraphrase loops are frequent—"unbend a frozen confession" is restated as "the ice's rigid grip," "the confession shatters," "the confession now free," "sealing the confession" without added pressure (−0.4 for synonym churn). Stock metaphor strings dominate peak beats: "calm blade," "silver birds," "sword unsheathed in peace," "retreating armies" (−0.5 for coherence debt; mixed vehicle logic). Information density is low: many sentences restate the druid's purpose or the seed's hunger without advancing stakes. Filter verbs ("she feels," "she knows") stack without voice motivation. The opening paragraph introduces a magic trick and illusionist's cape that vanish without causal connection (−0.3 for unresolved set-up). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her heart unbent, her purpose clear"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (druid retrieves frozen confession from cursed lake) is a familiar template: mystical protagonist, symbolic quest, metaphorical object. The prompt elements (guarded druid, flesh-eating seed, frozen confession, warlike serenity) are assembled but not transformed—each could be swapped for a near-synonym without altering the emotional or thematic arc. The "finds lost things" attribute and amulet retrieval read as late add-ons to satisfy the checklist rather than organic synthesis. The opening's "magic trick fails" and "illusionist's cape" are abandoned without payoff, suggesting stitched composition. No bold structural or perspectival risk is taken; the piece retreats to safe, mid-range mystical fantasy without specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The guarded druid is present throughout but makes no key choices that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She performs a sequence of actions (steps, chants, gathers, whispers, places, walks) without visible cost or internal conflict. "Guarded" is a label mentioned once ("guarded druid") and again at the end ("her guarded heart finally open") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains action. She is more conduit than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The flesh-eating plant seed appears in three beats: introduction (clenched, pulsing), recognition (pulses when shards melt), and closure (glows, bound to amulet). Its "hunger" shifts from devouring memory/flesh to "feeding on the fragment's truth," a functional middle-beat turn. However, the seed does not constrain a choice or impose cost—the druid simply "whispers" a promise and the seed complies. Removing it would require only minor edits; the confession could be sealed in the amulet directly. Setup and closure participation are present, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The frozen confession is the stated goal and appears in setup, middle (shatters into shards), and closure (sealed in seed). Yet it never changes the druid's options or knowledge—its content is never revealed, and releasing it carries no visible cost or complication. It functions as a McGuffin: the druid seeks it, retrieves it, seals it, with no friction. The confession's "words suspended in cold" could be replaced by any symbolic object without altering the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is asserted in exposition ("she possesses an uncanny attribute") and demonstrated once when she retrieves the amulet. The amulet itself is introduced late (final third) and resolves a problem it did not help create—its owner is never on the page, and the retrieval imposes no cost or trade-off. The attribute is label-only; it does not constrain action or shape tactics. Cap 3.0 applies (late element resolving a problem it did not create).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears in three forms: the druid's purpose ("to unbend a frozen confession"), the method ("unbending the rigid grip of winter"), and closure ("unbends her stance"). The action shapes the middle beat (ice releases) and the final image (war to peace). However, the word itself is more metaphorical than causal—what she does mechanically is "chant" and "release," and "unbend" could be replaced with "release," "melt," or "free" without structural loss. Closure linkage elevates the score, but swappability and lack of unique mechanics cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles" is signaled late (middle third: "expanding circles of ancient rune-lit water") and appears once in action ("Each ring expands"). The method is described but not dramatized—the mechanics of how circles "pull the ice toward the center" are asserted, not shown through resistance or cost. The circles do not complicate or fail; they simply work. Functional but replaceable: "chant," "spell," or "ritual" would fit with equal ease.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex at the heart of a cursed lake is named in the opening and reappears at closure ("begins to unwind"). It provides atmospheric description but does not pressure choices or supply resources—the druid "steps into" it, trees "bend outward," and later the vortex clears. No navigation challenge, tactical constraint, or danger tied to the vortex is dramatized. The setting is postcard rather than crucible. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the opening but is immediately abandoned—the illusionist and onlookers vanish, and the druid's quest proceeds in an unrelated timeframe. The phrase does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time; it reads as a discarded framing device. The main action (druid's ritual) unfolds in an unspecified window with no clock or urgency. Time is vague and untracked throughout.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is stated as purpose ("she seeks what mirrors don't show") and echoed at closure ("the lake… now reflects… the truths beneath"). Yet the motivation is never dramatized as conflicted desire or tested by cost. The druid experiences no friction between wanting to know and the price of knowing; she simply executes the quest. The phrase recurs but functions as thematic decoration rather than a live stake that forces choice. Setup and closure reprise without middle friction: lyric-resonance allowance suggests eligibility up to ~5.5–6.3, but absence of on-page conflict and label-only treatment lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is named twice (exposition and near-closure: "the warlike serenity settle within her") and implied by diction ("calm blade," "quiet resolve," "calm steel"). The tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure, no tension between the war and serenity poles. The druid remains perfectly calibrated throughout; the tone describes her rather than charging the final image with competing forces. Functional label without dramatic cost or progression.</comment>
