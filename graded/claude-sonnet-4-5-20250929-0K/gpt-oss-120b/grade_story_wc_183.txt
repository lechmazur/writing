<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "chimera twin discoverer" remains an abstract cipher—"stitched feathers and rusted brass"—without embodied motivation or internal contradiction. Actions (pirouetting, diving into ink, gathering blossoms) read as outline gestures rather than pressure-tested choices with visible cost. Thepiece tells us she feels "blissfully aberrant" and experiences "trapped freedom" but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values; the ending grants satisfaction without renunciation or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who this figure is, her concrete situation, and her agency remain vague past the first third. The piece accumulates lyric texture (mist, mirrors, ink) but lacks a clear drive lens: is this causal quest, accumulative pattern, or situational stance? The ending offers conceptual repricing ("true recapture was not of objects, but of stories") but the cost is asserted, not shown on the page—no tactical price, no foreclosed option. The "narrative threads" mechanism appears suddenly without prior setup or constraint, violating causality. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The carnival ship, fog, cracked mirrors, and carousel horses provide vivid sensory anchors, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The emerald swatch card opens a portal and the ship "shivered," yet neither environment nor object materially narrows a choice or alters tactics. The garden of forgotten names appears only in the final third without prior spatial grounding. Micro-setting (the body, the card as tool) charges the final image but does not shape the protagonist's moves earlier. Within 5.0–6.9 band for one-beat participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("recapture the scattered verses…find the garden") is declared early but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs: the protagonist inserts the card into a slot, dives into ink, and the verses glow on the card without opposition or trade-off. The "portal opened" and "river of ink" deliver solutions rather than complications. The ending grants all stated goals—assembled map, blossoms gathered, lights restored—without visible price or foreclosed path. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency is decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace" are invoked repeatedly but remain abstract labels rather than embodied tensions. The final line ("promised to catalog the silence of forgotten seas") gestures at theme without a non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars. The "true recapture was not of objects, but of stories" reads as thematic echo rather than earned wisdom from dramatized struggle. No counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into tidy epiphany. The motifs (mirrors, ink, carousel) recur but do not constrain choice or charge closure with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose sustains elevated diction ("chimera twin discoverer," "unkindled solace humming beneath the rust") across all beats, flattening distance and creating register drift—no modulation under pressure. POV control is stable (third limited) but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic: she "felt," "believed," "realized" without idiosyncratic filter. Internal voice lacks specificity; lines like "freedom can be both cage and wind" read as aphorism rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue to test for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6): "ghostly whispers," "captured sunrise," "living canvas," "lighthouse born of ink," "rusted chains of light." Mixed metaphors abound—ink flows "backward" yet acts as water, threads are "fragile rope of meaning" then "a net." Paraphrase loops: "The ship's decks were littered…She moved blissfully aberrant" restates mood without advancing causality. Template cadence across multiple lines ("She cradled…She moved…She pressed…She dove…She assembled…She gathered…She lifted…She smiled") (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("watercolor bleeding," "storybook") and therapy-speak ("unkindled solace") in peak beats (−0.3). Total artifact load disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—fantastical seeker on abandoned ship hunting scattered verses—follows a common quest-and-recovery template without fresh synthesis. "Garden of forgotten names" and "emerald swatch card" read as stock fantasy furniture; the protagonist's mission is told rather than made inevitable through lived detail or moral calculus. The ending's insight ("true recapture was not of objects, but of stories") recycles familiar meta-commentary. No risk-taking in structure or stance; the piece hedges into safe lyricism without bold, specific choices that would survive a transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character present throughout but makes no choices that alter tactics or narrow options. She inserts the card, dives, assembles verses, gathers blossoms—all granted without opposition. Observation and action without decision. Introduced at the prow (early setup), appears in multiple beats (mid-development), and present in the ending image (closure participation), but her agency is decorative. Late penalty does not apply, but causal pressure is absent (−1.2). Swappable protagonist (−0.6). Ornamental use in peak beats (−0.7). Caps: missing causal pressure and closure agency effectively cap near 3.0; adjust down for swappability and ornamental treatment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emerald swatch card introduced in the opening ("cradled an emerald swatch card"), used at the bow slot (mid-beat), accumulates captured verses (multiple touches), becomes "compass of names" and is lifted in the final image (closure participation). Setup, development, and payoff gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. However, the card enables solutions without cost—it never constrains a choice or imposes a trade-off. Its properties (pulsing, glowing green, swelling with light) are told rather than dramatized under pressure. Causal involvement is present but shallow (+0.6). Closure linkage present but not transformative (+0.8). Specificity moderate (+0.4). No visible cost tied to its use (−0.5). Swappable with another magical token (−0.5). Band guidance: two gates + moderate beat involvement + closure presence place it in mid 5.x; lack of constraint and cost prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" appears repeatedly as a label ("unkindled solace humming beneath the rust," "unkindled solace of centuries," "unkindled solace that had once been smothered," "unkindled solace now finally kindled by purpose") but never shapes a stake or alters an on-page option. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a mechanic that changes tactics. Setup present (early mention), no middle development (label-only), and closure claim ("finally kindled") is asserted without dramatized cost. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; ornamental use (−0.8), summary-only resolution (−0.6), label repetition without causal work (−0.3). Caps and deductions converge near 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" mentioned once as a descriptor ("She moved blissfully aberrant, pirouetting over broken carousel horses") without constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The trait is told, not shown through contradictory action or a trade-off. Setup present (first third), no development (single mention), no closure participation. Missing development and payoff gates cap at 2.8 per the gate model. Ornamental use (−0.7), label-only (−0.3). No causal pressure or cost connection. Final score near the cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" is the stated mission ("to recapture the scattered verses") and structures the sequence—insert card, dive into ink, catch verses, assemble map, gather blossoms. Setup early, present across beats, and drives the ending action. However, the action is granted without opposition: the verses are caught by the net of narrative threads, glow on the card, and form the map with no failed attempt or trade-off. Swappable with "collect" or "recover" with minor edits (−0.6). Summary-only resolution (verses "captured" and assembled off-camera) (−0.6). No visible cost or constraint tied to the act of recapture (−0.7). Setup + development + payoff gates met, eligible for ≥6.1, but lack of causal pressure and swappability pull it into mid-4.x after deductions.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Narrative threads" mentioned as method ("she wove narrative threads from the murmurs of cracked mirrors," "The narrative threads she had crafted acted as a net") but mechanics are vague and the method appears suddenly without prior setup or constraint. The threads glow green, catch verses, but their creation and use are told rather than shown under pressure. Setup marginal (first mention mid-story), development thin (one functional beat), payoff present (net catches verses). Missing clear early setup; introduced after ~40% mark caps at 4.6. Ornamental weaving (−0.5), summary-only use (−0.5). Swappable with generic "magic" (−0.5). Deductions place it in mid-3.x.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival ship with foggy bay provides vivid anchors (prow, decks, cracked mirrors, carousel horses, rusted slot, hull breathing) and is present throughout. Setup early, used in mid-beats (slot insertion), and referenced at closure ("ship…began to move"). The ship supplies atmosphere but does not pressure a choice—the protagonist moves freely, the portal opens on command, and the fog recedes as granted. Micro-setting (the body, the card as tool) charges the final image but does not constrain tactics. Setup + development + payoff gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Causal pressure weak (+0.4), closure linkage present (+0.7), specificity high (+0.6), but no visible cost or constraint tied to setting properties (−0.8). Postcard description in early beats (−0.5). Band guidance places it in low-5.x.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears in the timeframe slot ("As memories alter beside the blooming verbs") but does not function as a clock or deadline. Time remains vague throughout—no tightening pressure, no tracked duration, no cost of delay. Setup present (final third only—late), no development (not used to narrow choices), closure mention ornamental. Late introduction caps at 4.6, but missing development and pressure further reduce: ornamental (−0.8), vague/untracked (−0.7), no tactical impact (−0.8). Deductions and caps converge near 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To find the garden of forgotten names" is the stated motivation ("Her mission…was to recapture the scattered verses…that lay the map to the garden") and structures the goal. Setup early, pursued across beats (assemble map, converge on a point, enter the garden), and resolved in the final third (she enters, gathers blossoms). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—no friction between want and fear, no trade-off when the garden is reached. The mission succeeds without renunciation or visible price. Setup + development + payoff gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Told-only motivation (−0.6), no friction or cost (−0.9), summary resolution (−0.6). Band guidance after deductions: mid-4.x.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is named explicitly ("The tone of the place was trapped freedom, a paradox that wrapped around her heart like rusted chains of light") and echoed in images (carnival lights, fog, rusted steel, ship beginning to move). Setup early, modulates through beats (fog thickens, portal opens, fog recedes), and present at closure ("felt the trapped freedom within her pulse"). However, the tone is static—no modulation under pressure, no shift in mood as stakes change. The paradox is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory actions or perceptions. Setup + development + payoff gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Coherent across turns (+0.5), charges final image (+0.6), but single static mood (−0.7), label-only assertion (−0.5), no modulation under pressure (−0.6). Deductions place it in mid-4.x.</comment>
