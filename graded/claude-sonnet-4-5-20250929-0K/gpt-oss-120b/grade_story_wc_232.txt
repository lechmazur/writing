<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian remains a placeholder figure whose motivation—keeping a promise to a dying explorer—is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The interior voice defaults to lyrical abstraction ("lingering promise bound his heart," "felt a surge of purpose") without embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to step through the doorway and then return lacks visible cost; the claim that "every future decision would now echo" tells rather than shows forfeiture. No secondary character appears on the page to create relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story presents a continuous scene anchored by "one midsummer night" and the blooming cavern, meeting the Orientation Test by ~120 words. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece offers density (map dealer, matrix chip, ants, doorway) and a cadence shift at the corridor threshold. However, the closure unit—Elian stepping through, seeing vistas, then returning—carries no dramatized cost on the page; the assertion "knowing that every future decision would now echo" is conceptual price without visible forfeiture or tactical change. The piece gestures toward Charged Poise but does not crystallize options with undeniable pressure at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is anchored by sensory markers—moss, parchment scent, creek song, warm amber glow—and the rising creek functions as a modest time constraint. The matrix chip's brass teeth and the narrow arch offer micro-setting detail. However, spatial choreography slips: Elian moves from shop to cavern slit to corridor without clear transitions, and the shop's return in the coda feels teleported. The creek's rise is mentioned but does not visibly narrow access or force a tactical choice at closure, limiting environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the doorway of decisions to fulfill the promise—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the matrix chip clicks into the pedestal and the doorway materializes. Yet the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: Elian places the chip, the door opens, he sees "endless horizons," and chooses to return without visible trade-off or forfeited path. The creek's rising tempo is mentioned but does not complicate or narrow options in the final beat, and no micro-choice forces a hierarchy of values with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The piece gestures toward a theme of choice and legacy ("the true map was not on paper but in the act of choosing itself"), but delivers it as direct statement rather than emergent particular. The matrix chip and ant trails recur but function as symbolic ornament—ants do not constrain a choice at closure, and the chip's mechanics (responding to water and insects) do not charge the final image with cost. The ending's claim that "decisions are made not in isolation but in the echo of promises kept" articulates a thesis instead of dramatizing friction between competing goods. No non-obvious moral calculus or counter-reading pressure appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable past tense and controlled distance. The prose carries a consistent lyrical register ("scent of old parchment lingered like a memory of distant seas"), though under peak pressure at the threshold the texture remains elevated rather than tightening to urgency. Perceptual signature is generic; Elian notices in the same cadence whether cataloging maps or facing the doorway. No dialogue appears. Elision of the decision mechanism—how he "set his resolve like a compass needle"—is metaphoric without concrete anchor, and the final paragraphs summarize post-adventure cataloging rather than dramatizing the moment of return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops recur: "lingering promise" appears in three separate beats without shifting meaning, and "each one a reminder" / "each entry annotated" cycle through the coda. Template cadence is visible in the final third: "He now greets… knowing that the doorway… waiting for…" stacks three consecutive forward-looking summary clauses. Figurative density is high throughout ("inked by starlight," "tighten around his chest like a rope," "echo the quiet certainty") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering overwriting guidance. Information density is moderate; scaffold sentences summarize state ("he felt a surge of purpose," "he understood") rather than advancing through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—mystical doorway sought by map dealer via insect-guided clues—reads as a writing-exercise template (quest object + cryptic method + symbolic profession). The matrix chip's brass teeth that "rearrange themselves" and respond to water/insect frequency offer surface novelty but no causal consequence; the chip could be any mystical key. The ant-following method appears mid-story, is used once, and does not transform the arc—remove it and Elian could follow the glow directly. The emotional arc (lonely dealer seeks closure, finds it, returns enriched) fits a median template without a non-obvious turn or synthesis rooted in lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and makes the macro-decision to enter the corridor and place the chip. However, his choices do not create turns—he follows glimmer, follows ants, places chip, sees vistas, returns—each a passive response to cues rather than a decision that narrows options or alters tactics. The return to the shop is asserted in summary ("He turned back") without on-page friction or visible cost. Setup is early; middle beats involve observation; closure participation is cameo (he whispers thanks). Swappable with any seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The matrix chip appears early (cavern discovery), is handled mid-story (Elian senses its hum, follows its guidance), and is placed on the pedestal at closure, meeting all three gates. It shapes two beats: discovery and pedestal placement. However, its unique properties—brass teeth that rearrange, sensitivity to water/insects—do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; any mystical key would serve the same function. The chip's return in the coda ("each entry annotated with a tiny chip") is summary mention, not causal reprise. Cost is scene-generic (he enters a doorway) rather than tied to the chip's specific mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "lingering promise" is signaled in paragraph one ("a lingering promise bound his heart") and appears in three subsequent beats, including the closure paragraph ("whispered a thank-you to the promise he had kept"). It provides the macro-motivation and frames the quest. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible trade-off—Elian does not weigh breaking the promise versus another desire. The promise functions as backstory anchor and thematic label rather than a live tactical pressure. Lyric reprise at closure (early seed → final whisper) reweights the dominant stake modestly, lifting score into mid-6s despite no middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is mentioned once in paragraph four ("the device was empirically intuitive, reacting not to touch but to the subtle frequency of water") as exposition. It does not enable or constrain an action—Elian does not test frequencies, adjust his approach based on the chip's responsiveness, or face a cost tied to this trait. The chip's mechanics are described but not leveraged in a beat. Label-only use; no middle or closure participation. Late first appearance and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Glimmer" seeds early ("a soft glimmer caught his eye"), recurs as guidance ("the chip's faint hum… glimmer"; "each path illuminated by the same glimmer"), and appears in the coda ("each entry annotated with a tiny chip that glimmered"). It provides continuity and minor causal link (glimmer → Elian looks → discovers chip). However, the action is observation-response rather than a turn; removing "glimmer" and replacing with "glow" or "light" changes no structural beat. No unique cost or tactic tied to glimmering versus another luminous cue. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Following ants home" is introduced mid-story (paragraph seven: "he began following ants home"), used in one extended beat (ants converge at arch), and echoed in the coda explanation ("following ants home had taught him"). Setup is late (~40% mark). The method shapes one key beat—ants lead to the corridor—but the mechanics are passive; Elian watches trails, does not interact or adjust tactics based on ant behavior. Swappable with "followed the glow" or another directional cue. Lyric callback in coda adds modest thematic charge but no closure-beat cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "blooming cavern at midsummer" is anchored early (paragraph three: "One midsummer night, when the blooming cavern at midsummer opened") and houses the central discovery and corridor sequence. Midsummer timing and "blooming" are mentioned but do not constrain the window—no indication the cavern closes or that timing pressures the choice. The cavern supplies the matrix chip and corridor, shaping two beats and closure participation (the corridor is within the cavern). However, the setting is replaceable with any hidden chamber; "blooming" adds poetic texture without tactical cost. Spatial function is moderate; ambient rather than forcing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the creek rises" appears in paragraph eight ("As the creek rises louder") and again in the penultimate paragraph ("When night fell and the creek rose to a roar"). It signals escalating urgency but does not narrow the decision window on the page—Elian places the chip, sees vistas, and returns without time pressure altering his choice. Setup is mid-story; closure mention is atmospheric summary. The creek's mechanics (rising = ticking clock) are told, not leveraged to force a tactic or trade-off. Swappable with any ambient time cue.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To find the doorway of decisions" is the stated motivation, introduced early (paragraph six: "to locate the doorway of decisions") and fulfilled at closure (paragraph eleven: "a doorway of decisions materialized"). It drives the macro-quest across all beats. However, the desire is monolithic—no on-page friction between wanting to find the doorway and another competing need. The cost of fulfillment (what he gives up to step through or return) is asserted ("knowing that every future decision…") rather than dramatized. Functional across setup, middle, and closure, but told-only with no visible trade-off.</comment>
