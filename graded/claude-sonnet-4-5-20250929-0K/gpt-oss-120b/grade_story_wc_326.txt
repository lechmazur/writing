<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("fetch wisdom from failure," "miscounted beats") rather than embodied contradiction. The digital ghost remains a conceptual device; no genuine internal conflict arises between impulses in scene. The final "smile" and alignment with "the universe's quiet song" read as stock closure rather than earned transformation with visible cost. Motivation is declared but not dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is diffuse: who/where/when anchors arrive late and are buried in metaphor ("opal observatory," "legal phantom," "quantum server") without spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—Mara realizing the ghost is a mirror and stepping onto the roof with new wisdom—lands as conceptual repricing, but the cost is asserted ("a broken piece can still hold meaning") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres around a single pressure; beats feel like ornamental description rather than because/therefore linkage or cadence shift that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory and porcelain shard receive vivid imagery ("frozen lantern," "smooth edge catching pale lantern light"), but spatial choreography remains vague—console, roof, and kitchen positions are unclear. The shard functions as a tool in the ink ritual and returns warm at closure, constraining one choice and charging the final image, which narrowly qualifies the 9+ gate. However, the ink patterns and quantum server remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's urgency or professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correcting the death-certificate error and defragmenting the ghost—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live cost. The ink ritual unfolds as description; no reversal narrows options or forces Mara to forfeit anything on the page. The ghost's "confession" and the shard absorbing corrupted data read as convenient resolution rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Agency is observational; the final pulse alignment is declared, not earned through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—failure as teacher, broken pieces holding meaning—is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("fetch wisdom from failure," "even a porcelain shard could rewrite destiny") rather than emerging from concrete action. The ghost-as-mirror insight arrives as tell, not dramatized irony. Motifs (shard, ink, heartbeat) recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight prior material; they are invoked to harvest thematic points. The closing image ("universe's quiet song") leans toward generic solace without earned resonance or non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("shimmering cascade of code," "midnight solace"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers") that does not feel character-specific or grounded in Mara's professional lens. Filter verbs and passive constructions cluster in high-pressure beats ("she realized," "she knew"), dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not reflect a scientist's bias or embodied state under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated modifier ("frozen lantern," "legal phantom," "ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear ("the ghost's heartbeat counter synchronized with the rhythmic tapping of Mara's own pulse"; "a single, steady pulse—Mara's own"). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across the second half. Figurative muddle: "frozen lantern beneath a midnight snowfall" and "opal walls" amplifying a chime lack coherent vehicle logic. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("even a porcelain shard could rewrite destiny"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—bureaucratic death-certificate error survivor confronting a digital ghost—offers a fresh hook, but execution leans on stock SF imagery (quantum server, ink-based algorithm, resonant frequency) without lived specificity. The emotional arc (solace, alignment, wisdom) could transfer to any character with different names. The porcelain shard and ink ritual read as quirky ornament rather than inevitable synthesis. No bold risk; the piece hedges toward lyric safety without a non-obvious moral calculus or turn that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her choices are observational; the defragment routine and shard retrieval are described actions, not decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shard is retrieved early, used as a conduit in the ink ritual (middle beat), absorbs corrupted data, and returns warm at closure with reweighted meaning ("a tangible reminder"). Present across three beats and shapes the ending image, though its causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The digital ghost anchors the premise, drives the defragment mission, and delivers the error confession at closure. It shapes stakes on the page but remains abstract; its mechanics (counting heartbeats, corrupted archives) are told rather than dramatized as constraints that alter Mara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The heartbeat-counting trait is mentioned repeatedly ("counts heartbeats constantly," "tally of heartbeats halted") but functions as description. It does not constrain an on-page action or impose a visible cost; the synchronization with Mara's pulse is asserted, not leveraged to enable or block a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the central action, signaled early and resolved at closure when the ghost's tally halts. However, the mechanics are opaque; the ink ritual and shard resonance perform the work off-page. The action is present but not irreplaceable—another technical fix could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The spilled-ink method is signaled early and used in the ritual beat; the dried symbols glow and patterns act as keys. Present in setup and middle, but the mechanics remain vague ("fleeting sigils," "resonant frequency") and do not impose a cost or constrain later attempts. Lyric reprise at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The observatory is named early and provides vivid imagery (opal walls, snow-capped roof, aurora). The kitchen supplies the shard and the console hosts the ritual, but spatial choreography is unclear and the setting does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome. Postcard description without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static clears" appears in the opening but never tightens decisions. No live clock; the ritual unfolds without temporal pressure. The phrase is ornamental and does not constrain tactics or shape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is declared early and restated at closure ("the wisdom she fetched from failure would guide the next generation"). It frames the mission but is not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. Told-only; no on-page trade-off where the desire competes with another impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Midnight solace is signaled in the title phrase and closing image ("midnight solace," "chilled night," "quiet song"). Tone is coherent—lyric, hushed—but remains static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final reversal. The mood is present but does not reweight the stake or carry cost at closure.</comment>
