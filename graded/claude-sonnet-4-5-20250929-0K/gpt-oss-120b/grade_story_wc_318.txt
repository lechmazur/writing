<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The conductor is presented through heavy symbolic abstraction rather than concrete contradiction or embodied choice. "Mournfully eager" remains a label rather than acting in scene through simultaneous opposing impulses. The final "satisfaction" reads as declared resolution without visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority is poetic but generic, never grounded in a character-particular way of perceiving pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, though the symbolic density makes concrete spatial grounding unclear (−0.3). The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but no meaningful tightening or cost occurs—the conductor performs, ghosts reassemble, joy returns, all without friction or trade-off. The ending declares "restored joy" and "satisfied" eagerness without demonstrating what was risked or lost on the page. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is vividly described and recurs throughout, anchoring the action. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or providing resources that alter outcome. The leaf blower and pull cord are handled, yet their mechanics never force a tactical shift. Spatial choreography remains abstract; the alcove with the photograph and the house beyond are stages for effects, not pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early but never tested. The conductor performs without opposition, cost, or doubt; each action succeeds as declared. No on-page reversal narrows options or deepens pressure. The resolution is delivered by the protagonist's ritual, but no visible price is paid and no path is foreclosed. Escalation is replaced by decorative accumulation of metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-melody and tending-the-unspoken emerges through images, yet the ending states rather than earns its answer. "Sorrow and mirth can coexist" is declared on the page rather than demonstrated through a non-literal final image. The conductor's "gratitude" and "satisfaction" resolve complexity into tidy sentiment. Recurrence of lullaby and wind carries lyric texture but does not reweight prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated, image-dense, metaphor-heavy—but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature; it reads as authorial atmosphere rather than the conductor's specific way of noticing. Diction remains uniform across beats without modulation under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "blade of sound began to macerate the heavy silence, grinding it into fine particles that floated like ash, each speck humming with possibility" stacks metaphor without causal clarity (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "mournfully eager" recurs as label; "tending to the unspoken" and "restore lost laughter" are repeated without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence: "The [X], [gerund], [abstract effect]" structure appears in seven sentences (−0.5). Stock metaphors: "weep," "breathing back," "fireflies desperate to be seen" (−0.3). Cumulative artifacts touch closure beat, triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—conductor with leaf blower restoring laughter to haunted house—offers surface novelty but executes as prompt-assembled rather than causally integrated. The core turns (hourglass grain, lullaby, giggle from photograph) feel like checklist beats rather than inevitable consequences. Emotional arc is generic: mourning → ritual → satisfaction. The piece could swap the leaf blower for any ritual tool and the lullaby for any method with minimal rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The conductor raises the blower, pulls the cord twice, and whispers lullabies. Setup present by first paragraph; development spans multiple beats. However, his choices do not create turns—he performs unopposed and succeeds without cost. Closure participation is ornamental ("lowered his baton," "vanished"), not decisively causal. Swappable with "ritual keeper" or "haunting medium."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in setup ("clasped tight in the hollow of his palm"), is pulled twice in development ("lifted the pull cord handle once more," "He pulled the cord again"), and is placed "back onto its cradle" at closure. Functional across three beats, but its specific properties—trembling, remembering gasps—do not constrain tactics or shape outcome. Swappable with any activator mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Tending-the-unspoken is stated early ("years of tending to the unspoken") and echoed at closure ("realizing the power of tending to the unspoken"). Development shows coaxing and guiding, but the concept remains thematic claim rather than on-page method that alters options. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this act of tending versus another approach.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears three times as a label ("mournfully eager," "mournful eagerness," "mournful eagerness satisfied"). It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. No scene demonstrates the contradiction between mourning and eagerness driving a choice. Purely decorative descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Macerate appears twice: once for silence, once for air. Setup after first third; development shows the blade of sound grinding silence into particles. Closure references the blade at rest. The action is vivid but swappable with "disperse," "transform," or "reshape" with minor edits. It does not redefine options or create a turn that another verb would not.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies carried on off-key wind appear in setup ("half-sung lullaby," "off‑key wind"), recur in development ("half‑sung lullabies wove through the off‑key wind"), and close the story ("via half-sung lullabies carried on an off‑key wind"). Mechanics matter—song and wind combine—but the method is declared effective without friction. No cost or failed attempt tied to this specific means versus another.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel is present in setup ("hollow echo chamber tunnel"), shapes multiple beats (amplifies sound, houses the alcove, connects to the house), and participates in closure (exhales final sigh). The tunnel's acoustic properties enable the conductor's method and the walls pulse with returning mirth. Spatial pressure and resource provision are legible, though abstract. Removing the tunnel would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" appears once in the opening third and is never referenced again. The hourglass does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No tactics change because of temporal pressure. Ornamental atmospheric marker, easily cut.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Restoring lost laughter is stated early ("restore lost laughter to a household") and drives the conductor's actions throughout (coaxing silence into song, guiding breath toward embers, urging chairs to remember). Closure declares success ("restored joy," "house would now hear laughter again"). Desire is dramatized via repeated attempts but never conflicted—no friction between cost and goal. No visible sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"True haunting" is named once midway ("The haunted tone of the tunnel remained, true haunting, but now it served as a backdrop rather than a prison"). Tone is coherent—mournful, reverent, elegiac—across beats and modulates slightly at closure (gratitude, satisfaction). The final image retains shadow ("vanished into the shadows"), charging the restored joy with residual sorrow. Tone supports closure but does not drive it.</comment>
