<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride remains entirely abstract—no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied contradiction, no genuine interiority. Her "lovingly venomous" affection and debt repayment are asserted through poetic summary rather than dramatized through action or decision. The final "sigh that tasted of roses and rust" is a metaphoric gesture without visible cost or consequence to her agency. No relationship crucible exists; she drifts through a static tableau.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit: the bride simply "fades" after a breath that causes blossoms, with no before/after alteration in her options, knowledge, or stance. The narrative is pure accumulation of metaphoric description without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes cost visible. Orientation remains vague—who she was, when this occurs, and spatial anchors dissolve into endless abstraction. Causality is absent; events happen in parallel poetic register without because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are vivid in metaphor but never constrain a choice or supply a resource. Spatial choreography is unclear—she "drifts," "ghosts," "glides" without legible position or movement. The carved bead and vines are described but never handled in tactile, lived-in ways. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and abstract, lacking the body-anchored specificity that would ground the frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the bride moves through a predetermined sequence without agency or trade-off. The final act (releasing a sigh) resolves nothing she struggled against. Coincidence and metaphor substitute for escalation; no persistent constraint shapes her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of debt and redemption is stated rather than earned through specific struggle. The final image—blossoms and a pulsing bead—does not reweight prior material or answer a central question the narrative dramatized. "Lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" remain oxymoronic labels without embodied tension or conceptual cost. Travelers' gratitude is told, not shown, and adds a sermonizing frame. No non-literal resonance; the ending explains its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person distant narration maintains a consistent elevated register but lacks perceptual signature—every sentence could belong to any lyric-fantasy narrator. Diction is ornate and uniform, with no modulation under pressure because no pressure exists. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "remembered") stack without voice motivation. POV remains stable but generic, offering no character-particular way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without information. Paraphrase loops abound—"mournful elation" appears three times, "resonant awakening(s)" four times, "lovingly venomous" twice, all without reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive beats. Mixed metaphors: vines "sing," the bead "sings," branches "sang"—sound logic collapses. Stock phrases: "whisper of ash," "liquid amber," "roses and rust." Clarity suffers under the ornamental load; no propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-repaying-debt premise is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The alchemical orchard and carved bead are ornamental additions that do not create fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity is absent; the arc could be rewritten with different proper nouns unchanged. No bold risk or transformation test passed. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or create turns. She drifts, whispers, places the bead, and sighs—all summary actions without on-page choice or cost. Introduced early but remains passive and ornamental. Swappable with any spectral figure. Late first-appearance penalty does not apply, but ornamental use (−0.8) and no causal pressure (−1.2) bring the score down. No closure participation beyond fading. Missing middle development gate → cap 3.4. Score: 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The carved stone bead appears in multiple beats: she clutches it, it glows, she places it on a branch, it settles in the greenhouse heart. However, its "use" is decorative—glowing and pulsing without constraining choice or enabling a tactic under stress. It does not create a problem it later solves, nor does it carry a specific cost. Present at closure (final image) but not causally active there. Setup + payoff gates met; middle development weak. Closure participation is cameo only (−0.6). Ornamental use (−0.7), no causal pressure (−1.0). Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is a thematic label repeated four times but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. The vines stir and leaves unfurl as metaphoric background, not as choices the bride makes or obstacles she navigates. The concept is told, not dramatized. Present early and at closure but only as atmospheric phrasing. Setup + payoff gates; missing middle development → cap 3.4. Label-only trait (−0.3), no causal pressure (−1.2). Score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" appears twice as a descriptor but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is asserted in narration without dramatization—her affection does not create a trade-off or friction. Swappable with any poetic oxymoron. Present in first and final third but purely ornamental. Setup + payoff gates; missing middle development → cap 3.4. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.2). Score: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ghosting / ghostly gliding is the bride's mode of movement throughout, present in at least three beats ("ghosted through," "ghostly glide," "ephemeral cameo appearances"). However, the action is purely atmospheric—being a ghost does not create a turn or redefine options. It is signaled early and present at closure (she "fades"). The mechanics are vague; no specific cost or constraint tied to ghosting. Setup + development + payoff gates met. Beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage weak (+0.4), swappability (−0.6), no causal pressure (−0.8). Score: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" describes her movement ("appearing at the edge of a blossom then vanishing") and is signaled early. The method is used in at least two beats but does not shape attempts or create friction—it is purely descriptive of her ghost state. The mechanics (why she appears/vanishes, what limits this) are never tested. Setup + development gates met; payoff weak (she simply fades, no specific use of the cameo mechanic at closure). Beat involvement (+0.4), no causal pressure (−1.0), ornamental (−0.7). Missing closure participation → cap 2.8. Score exceeds cap due to early presence and two beats, adjusted to 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is described vividly but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The setting is static backdrop. Glass walls turning translucent is told consequence, not shown constraint. Setup gate met (first line); no middle development or closure participation. Ornamental (−1.0), no causal pressure (−1.4), swappability (−0.5). Missing middle and closure gates → cap 2.8. Lyric reprise (endless night recurs) adds slight resonance (+0.3 within cap zone). Score: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" is the opening timeframe phrase but does not function as a clock. No decisions are tightened by time; the narrative is timeless drift. Winter imagery recurs but purely atmospheric. Setup gate met (first sentence); no middle development (no time pressure shapes choices), no closure participation (ending is unmoored in time). Ornamental (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.3). Missing middle and closure gates → cap 2.8. Score: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation to repay a debt across lifetimes is stated early and recurs but is never dramatized in conflicted choice. The bride does not weigh competing desires or costs on the page; she enacts a predetermined sequence. Told-only motivation without friction. Setup gate met (second paragraph); weak development (no on-page trade-off), weak payoff (debt "loosens" as assertion). Summary-only use (−0.7), no causal pressure (−1.2), swappability (−0.5). Missing middle development → cap 3.4. Score: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named three times and sustained as register throughout—tone is coherent but static, lacking modulation with pressure (no pressure exists). The oxymoron charges descriptive passages but does not shift at the final image in response to events. Setup + closure gates met (present first and final paragraphs); middle development weak (tone does not escalate or break under stress). Coherent static mood (−0.5), no pressure modulation (−0.8), label-only in final beat (−0.4). Score: 3.8.</comment>
