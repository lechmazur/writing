<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is present but his agency never crystallizes into a genuine choice with trade-offs. Interior life is filtered through lyric abstraction ("space between heartbeats," "quiet drum") rather than embodied contradiction. The compass responds to his recitation, but we never see him struggle, hesitate, or pay a visible price. Interiority remains decorative rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure lacks visible cost: the tutor "understood" and "breathed out," the island "inhaled"—these are assertions, not on-page change with felt consequence. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~200 words in); applying the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The severance backstory and compass setup are told rather than dramatized, and no meaningful tightening narrows options before the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The islet, rain-scent, stone, and compass anchor the scene with consistent sensory detail. The bonsai and lace-pattern imagery recur and charge the final paragraphs. However, the setting remains largely postcard: no environmental constraint meaningfully alters a tactic or choice on the page. Spatial choreography is clean, but the world does not pressure the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing the island's sorrow—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The tutor recites instructions and the compass "responds" without resistance, ambiguity, or cost. Escalation is absent; the narrative moves through assertion rather than pressure. No live option is foreclosed, and coincidence (the compass simply aligns) substitutes for agency-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as a returning tide, unspoken apologies as feeling rather than pigment—emerges through images and the lace-pattern method. The final image ("color only those who listen can truly see") gestures toward resonance. However, the ending tells the theme rather than letting the particular compass-stone-lace triangle earn it; lines like "the color of unspoken apologies was not a pigment but a feeling" are overt thesis statements that flatten subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrically controlled with purposeful patterned repetition ("rhythmically placid," "tides of remembrance"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak moments ("weave a second knot at the point where the wind's sigh meets the stone's cold") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted, and the tutor's perceptual signature is not distinct from the narrator's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Patterned artifact penalty pack applies: paraphrase loops across adjacent lines ("diffuse," "rhythmically placid," "tides of remembrance" recycled without added pressure), template-cadence runs ("He whispered," "He placed," "He instructed"), and stock metaphor strings ("leaves rustling in rhythm with the tide's sigh"). Applying −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive loops and scaffold. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the closure beat without pattern-teaching payoff, triggering additional −0.5 for density overwriting. Information density is low; many lines restate the same content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The bonsai-tutor/lace-instructions/compass synthesis has lyric appeal, but the premise—heal communal sorrow through ritual—is a familiar template. The story does not transform it through specific lived detail, unexpected moral calculus, or a non-obvious turn. The "color of unspoken apologies" concept risks abstraction without grounding in verifiable particulars. No bold structural risk elevates execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The tutor is present throughout and his role (reciting instructions, placing the compass) appears in multiple beats and the ending. However, his choices do not create key turns; he performs a ritual without friction, hesitation, or cost. The ending "understood" is realization, not decision. Swappable with any ritual-performing guide.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The compass appears early (setup), is placed on the stone mid-story (development), and points eastward at closure (payoff). It is handled in at least two beats and its needle's movement signals progress. However, its function is passive ornament: it responds to the tutor's ritual without constraining his tactics or introducing friction. Lyric reprise present but causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tides of remembrance appears as metaphor throughout and frames the thematic question. It recurs in the ending ("keeper of tides"). However, it does not shape stakes or constrain on-page choices; it is echoed as theme rather than altering options. The tutor's actions are unaffected by whether "tides" rise or fall.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is a recurring label applied to the tutor's voice, the island's pulse, and the sea's promise. It does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with cost; no moment shows a trade-off where placidity must be maintained or risked. Ornamental modifier without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears in multiple beats (diffuse sorrow, diffuse tension, diffuse regret into wind) and is tied to the ending's action. However, the act of diffusing is told rather than dramatized with visible mechanics or resistance. Swappable with "release," "disperse," or "ease." No unique property of diffusion shapes the tutor's method or the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The lace-pattern instructions are mentioned early ("instructions woven into an antique lace pattern") and reappear at closure ("final lace pattern that sealed the lesson"). The tutor recites knotting instructions mid-story. However, the mechanics are vague and do not constrain his choices or shape attempts. The method is present but not integral; the story would function identically with any ritual instruction set.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The breezy islet after rain is signaled in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph. Petrichor, moss, stone, and wind provide consistent sensory anchors. The setting supplies the stone on which the compass rests and frames the tutor's isolation after the severance. However, no environmental feature pressures a choice or alters tactics; the islet is backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the severance" is named early and frames the tutor's vow. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock runs; the tutor's ritual proceeds without temporal pressure or deadline. The severance is static backstory rather than a constraint that narrows present options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the color of unspoken apologies—is stated early and drives the tutor's ritual. It appears in the middle beats and the ending realization. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice or tested against cost. The tutor pursues it without friction, doubt, or trade-off. Told motivation without on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cerulean regret is seeded early ("cerulean regret"), recurs mid-story ("faint cerulean tint"), and returns in the ending ("cerulean regret that now sang softly of hope"). The tone is coherent and modulates from sorrow to forgiveness. However, the tone is declared rather than embodied through action and image; "cerulean regret" functions as a label, not a felt pressure that charges the closure beat.</comment>
