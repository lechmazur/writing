<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" remains abstract and unanchored in embodied contradiction. His actions—humming, placing the case, unfolding the tapestry—proceed without visible internal friction or cost. The Marlowe backstory (hidden map, misread cowardice) is told rather than earned through present choice, and the epiphany that "intention is a shape, a circle" arrives as assertion rather than dramatized struggle. No meaningful trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/lyric lens with clear spatial anchors (cemetery, silo, case) established early. However, closure relies on a conceptual claim—"the shape of intentions was a circle"—delivered through summary rather than an image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The chess-clock timeframe is mentioned once and never constrains a choice. The structure reads as a single reflective scene without meaningful tightening or reversal; the gardener's discovery unfolds without escalation or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric detail (cobalt silo, velveteen gloom, copper-hued glow) establishes tone effectively. The antique sovereign case is described with care ("faded vellum," "compartments adjusted like a lover's embrace") and appears in multiple beats. However, the environment remains decorative; neither silo nor case constrains a tactical choice or alters the gardener's approach. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at any turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a narrowing of options. No reversal occurs; the gardener proceeds from case to tapestry to map to epiphany without obstacle, mistake, or cost. The story asserts that Marlowe's map "could heal the wounded" and that intention "was a circle," but these claims are not dramatized through conflict or trade-off. Agency is observation and arrangement, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (the shape and persistence of intention across memory) emerges through recurring images—threads, echoes, the circle—and the tapestry's reweighted meaning. However, the final assertion "the shape of intentions was not a weapon but a seed" is stated rather than shown, and the gardener's smile signals resolution without ambiguity or earned complexity. The piece avoids moralizing but delivers its concept through direct claim rather than a non-literal final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a consistent perceptual filter (the gardener's tender, ritualistic attention). Diction is elevated and textured ("velveteen gloom," "errant note," "quiet applause") and maintains coherence. However, register drift into poetic abstraction ("uncharted echoes," "the shape of intentions") occasionally clouds immediacy, and the gardener's internal voice does not degrade or shift under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled but emotional modulation is minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: most sentences carry figurative language ("velveteen gloom," "quiet applause," "compass for future gardens") without pattern-teaching or pressure payoff, triggering −0.7 in Q7. Paraphrase loops appear ("uncharted echoes" recurs three times with minimal reweighting; "tenderly organized" and "blithe" are restated). Template cadence ("He felt," "He knew," "He traced") stacks in the middle third without variation. Clarity holds but density and propulsion are diluted by synonym churn and decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—cemetery gardener decoding memory via tapestry threads—offers a lyric frame, but the execution leans on familiar motifs (forgotten soldier, hidden map, healing spring) without transformation. The discovery that intention is "a circle" and "a seed" reads as abstract wisdom rather than a synthesis grown from lived particulars. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the story plays safely within its established register without a fresh angle on memory, intention, or care.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gardener is present throughout and his ritual of unfolding, decoding, and sealing the case structures the narrative. However, his choices do not create reversals or narrow options; he observes and arranges without facing opposition or cost. His final smile and return to tending rows signal continuation rather than decisive change. The character is thematically central but does not drive causal turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case appears in the opening, houses the tapestry and map in the middle, and is sealed with "a promise of remembrance" at the end, serving all three gates. It is handled across multiple beats and its compartments "adjust to fit" the new parchment, suggesting purposeful design. However, the case does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is a vessel for the gardener's work rather than a source of friction or transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" recurs as a phrase ("feeling the uncharted echoes rise," "the uncharted echoes swell," "sealing the uncharted echoes once more") but functions as atmospheric label rather than a mechanic that shapes tactics or alters options. The concept is present but does not drive on-page conflict or decision. It remains thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears twice (opening description of the case's vellum-lined compartments; closing reflection on "his tenderly organized tools") but describes the gardener's manner rather than constraining or enabling a specific action with cost. The attribute is label-only and could be swapped for "careful" or "deliberate" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled early ("he must untangle the story by decoding frayed threads") and recurs at the end ("ever untangling the threads of what was and what might be"). The gardener's central act—brushing the tapestry, tracing the first thread to Marlowe's story—is an instance of untangling. However, the action is summary-only; no on-page beat shows the mechanics of decoding or the resistance of knotted threads. The verb frames intent but does not dramatize struggle or reversal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—is named in the first third and the gardener touches the cloth, feeling "each filament like a question." The first thread "sang of a soldier named Marlowe" and reveals a hidden pattern. However, the decoding is told rather than shown; the reader does not witness the process of reading thread-arrangement or inferring meaning. The method is present and central but its mechanics remain opaque.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo appears in the opening ("beneath a cobalt silo under stars"), recurs at the midpoint ("seemed to pulse, its metal skin catching starlight"), and frames the final image ("the cobalt silo reflecting his silhouette"). It establishes atmosphere but does not constrain choice, supply resources, or alter tactics. The silo is decorative backdrop, not active setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" is mentioned once in the opening but never tracked or used to pressure a decision. The piece unfolds in a single nocturnal ritual without temporal tightening or deadline. The timeframe is ornamental and could be removed without affecting structure or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of intentions" is stated early and recurs throughout. The gardener's ritual—unfolding the tapestry, tracing the circle—serves this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice; no friction arises between the want and a cost or competing priority. The drive is present and thematic but does not generate on-page tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is named early, recurs at the midpoint ("In that velveteen gloom, the gardener understood"), and lingers in the final paragraph ("the velveteen gloom lingered, a reminder of night's quiet resolve"). The tone is coherent, modulates subtly (from humming to understanding to resolve), and charges the ending image. The phrase is specific and integral to atmosphere, though its affect remains stable rather than shifting under pressure.</comment>
