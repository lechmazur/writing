<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's firefighter identity is asserted repeatedly but never tested by on-page action—she performs no rescue, extinguishes no fire, makes no tactical choice under pressure. Her "unyielding compassion" remains a label rather than an embodied trait that constrains decisions. The coin-and-thread ritual unfolds without friction or visible cost; the villagers' gratitude arrives unearned, summarized rather than dramatized. Interiority consists of stock bodily clichés ("water's cool breath mirror the steady rhythm of her own pulse") and thematic echo ("scars can sing") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure effect with felt cost. The opening promises a migration-driven ritual, but the lagoon setting remains static; Mira fastens the coin, the thread glows, villagers gather—no decision alters tactics, no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The final paragraph summarizes thematic resonance ("clouds carried the song") rather than dramatizing a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is present (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative patterning (recurring "scars," "fire," "thread") yet never delivers a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake with cost. The graft "holds" by assertion, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and kelp-drift air are vividly rendered and consistently present. The coin-on-pier graft anchors the action spatially and reappears in the final image. However, setting does not constrain choice—Mira could perform the ritual anywhere; the lagoon's properties (shallow water, black sand warmth) affect atmosphere but never alter her tactics or the ritual's outcome. Sensory selection is broad but undifferentiated by urgency; the narration catalogs rather than filters through Mira's professional or emotional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs: Mira plans the graft, executes it without friction, and the desired outcome (villagers' gratitude, warmth in the sand) materializes by summary. The clouds' migration functions as atmospheric backdrop, not causal force. Agency is missing; Mira's ritual succeeds without a trade-off, sacrifice, or moment when an option is foreclosed. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "scars can sing" motif is repeated across six beats and charged by the coin's "faint, resonant tone," but it remains a stated thesis rather than an emergent property of scene work. The fire-lineage versus water-peace binary is developed through recurring images (black sand's volcanic memory, kelp-drift peace, red thread) and the final dawn image reweights "her father's fire into a beacon of enduring compassion." Yet the ending states the theme ("compassion is a tide that never truly recedes") instead of trusting the coin's hum or the villagers' silent gathering to carry meaning. Thematic echo in the final two paragraphs lowers the score by ~0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Mira notices with cinematic sweep rather than occupational or temperamental bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("unyielding compassion like a lantern," "quilted with moving clouds") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose unfolds in uniform declarative paragraphs without taught pattern. Filter verbs ("felt," "letting") appear but do not obscure immediacy. The voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic signature beyond the steady accumulation of clause-heavy sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "scars can sing" appears five times with minimal variation; "black sand" recurs in static descriptions across eight sentences. Template cadence dominates the opening and middle ("She carried… She planned… She fastened… She inhaled… She knelt…"), reducing propulsion. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague: "clouds of the seasonal migration" treats clouds as migrating entities, "water's cool breath mirror[s] the steady rhythm of her own pulse" stacks metaphor without coherence, and "quilted with moving clouds" contradicts the prior "liquid midnight" image. Stock phrases proliferate: "steady hands and brave hearts," "gentle brushstroke," "silent promise." The closure beat is dulled by summary ("carried the song of healed scars across the horizon") rather than concrete image. Apply −1.2 for combined loop, template-cadence, and stock-metaphor debt, plus −0.5 for artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The firefighter-arsonist pairing and symbolic coin-graft offer mild novelty, but the emotional arc is a template redemption without friction: inherited guilt → symbolic act → community acceptance. The "scars can sing" thesis is told rather than discovered. Proximity check flags echoes of numerous symbolic-object / inherited-trauma stories; the lagoon ritual reads as interchangeable with any liminal-space absolution scene. The transformation test fails—swap names, swap the coin for another talisman, and the plot holds unchanged. No bold risk elevates the piece; the middle-ground hedging (villagers "whispered gratitude" rather than dramatized confrontation) avoids stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mira's firefighter role is mentioned but never enacted; her father's arson is backstory without on-page consequence. She performs no tactical choice that depends on firefighting skill or tests her compassion under pressure. Present in setup and closure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Black volcanic sand appears in seven beats: opening description, "memory of fire" reflection, coin-fastening at the sand's edge, mid-ritual "whispered stories," dawn transformation to "molten amber." It anchors the setting and charges the final image, but its properties (volcanic origin, warmth) do not constrain Mira's choices or alter the graft's mechanics. Early signal, closure linkage, and lyric reprise earn mid-band placement; lack of causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is asserted as motivation but never tested—Mira faces no moment where compassion conflicts with another need or exacts a visible cost. It functions as thematic label rather than a stake that shapes tactics. Present in setup and thematic summary but does not change options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice as bodily description ("gracefully alert step," "gracefully alert" stance at closure) but never constrains or enables action. No tradeoff between grace and alertness is dramatized; the trait remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The graft structures the action: Mira plans it, executes the coin-fastening, and the closure image ("sealing the graft with an unbreakable covenant") refers back. However, the graft succeeds without complication—no failure, adjustment, or cost alters its execution. It shapes one turn (the ritual itself) but does not redefine options or force a sacrifice. Present across all three gates but functionally replaceable with any symbolic act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread is introduced early, its mechanics detailed (fastened at pier-sand junction, swaying signal, faint tone). It drives the ritual beat and reappears in the dawn closure image ("red thread glistened like a sunrise promise"). Yet the coin's properties (foreign origin, drilled hole, red thread) do not impose constraint or cost—any hung object could produce the symbolic effect. Early signal, method involvement, and closure linkage earn low-6 consideration; high swappability and lack of causal pressure lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is present in every paragraph: opening anchor, shallow-water movement, pier junction, kelp-drift air, mirrored sky, dawn transformation. It supplies the site for the graft and its black sand charges the final image. However, the lagoon's features (depth, temperature, volcanic origin) do not constrain Mira's actions or alter the ritual's success. Early signal, sustained presence, and closure participation across all three gates; lack of tactical constraint limits the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The migration of clouds is mentioned in the opening, mid-ritual ("clouds migrated higher"), and twice in the final paragraphs ("migration carried the song"). Time of day progresses (waning light → sunset → night → dawn), but the migration does not tighten decisions—Mira's ritual unfolds at her own pace, unaffected by the clouds' movement. Present in setup and closure but does not impose urgency or shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated as motivation in the opening and restated in the closure paragraphs. The graft is framed as an answer to this desire, and the villagers' gratitude confirms it. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no moment where Mira doubts, where the cost of proving this claim forces a tradeoff, or where her want collides with another need. Told rather than dramatized; present in setup and thematic summary but lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named twice and the tone remains contemplative and elegiac throughout—no tonal modulation under pressure because no pressure arises. The prose sustains a single calm register from opening to close; the ritual's success does not shift the mood or charge the final image with contrast. Coherent but static; a single mood without purposeful break or intensification trends mid-low per the rubric.</comment>
