<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("to weave continuity through chaos") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—whispering to plants, distributing rose petals—remain symbolic and never face a genuine obstacle that would test commitment or reveal internal conflict. The ending distributes petals to villagers in a choreographed tableau without visible cost or a path foreclosed. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") instead of specific, embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story orients adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words), but no causal pressure tightens options. Lira moves through a sequence of symbolic gestures—whispering to roses, placing sandbags, handing out petals—without a reversal, obstacle, or decision that narrows her path. The ending amplifies the opening tableau rather than reconfiguring it with visible cost; no Decisive Change, Earned Stasis with foreclosed path, or Conceptual Repricing is legible. Lens reads accumulative/textural, but density does not escalate and no cadence shift reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm are anchored early and provide atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent (central greenhouse, fountain, perimeter). The sandbag and rose petals are handled on the page, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics under pressure—they serve as symbolic props rather than functional setting elements that drive decision or charge the final image meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (restore hope/continuity) is signaled early, but no tightening or reversal tests Lira's commitment. She encounters a boy with a broken compass but the moment resolves immediately without cost or complication. No on-page obstacle forces a trade-off or forecloses an option; the resolution distributes rose petals in a gathering that mirrors the opening without escalation or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (quiet strength, hope amid ruin) emerges through repeated images—sandbag, engraved quiet, tranquil blaze, roses as guardians—but is also explicitly stated multiple times ("silence can hold strength," "burden can become a bridge"). The final image offers a sunrise and communal vow but does not reweight prior material with fresh tension; it restates the premise. The boy's compass and Lira's whispers are on the page but remain symbolic gestures rather than particulars that earn insight through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet"), though the repeated phrase "tranquil blaze" and stock figurative language ("rustle of sandbags," "thorns glinting like tiny swords") flatten texture. Perceptual signature is declared ("senselessly perceptive") but not demonstrated through selective, character-specific noticing under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy pattern artifacts pervade: "tranquil blaze" appears four times, synonym loops ("breathing," "whisper/whispered/whispering" cycle across adjacent lines), template stems ("She [verb]… She [verb]…"), and stock metaphors ("thorns glinting like tiny swords," "dawn cracked open"). Paraphrase loops in mid-section restate that sandbags anchor and roses respond without adding pressure. The closure beat ("tranquil blaze promising tomorrow") is touched by figurative recycling and abstraction, triggering escalated penalties. These artifacts measurably dull momentum and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist heir in post-collapse settlement using symbolic gardening to restore hope—follows a familiar template (gentle healer after catastrophe) without fresh synthesis. Symbolic objects (sandbag, rose, compass) function as expected without transformation or irony. The title phrase "tranquil blaze" and "engraved quiet" are repeated as thematic labels rather than earned through specific, non-obvious choices. Emotional specificity is thin; the arc could transfer to another setting with only name changes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and performs symbolic actions (whispers to roses, places sandbag, offers petal), but none of these constitute key turns or decisions under opposition. Her pacifism is stated but never tested by a live conflict requiring her to choose between violence and her values. Present in closure (distributes petals), but role remains declarative rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap is handled in three beats: discovered at oasis with engraved quiet, placed beside fountain to anchor water's pulse, and handed to the eldest with a vow to speak its story. It recurs with evolving meaning (relic → anchor → banner of resilience), satisfying the lyric-reprise standard. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; its use remains symbolic rather than instrumental. Early signal present; middle and closure involvement qualify it for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears as a phrase on the sandbag canvas and is echoed thematically ("protect the quiet," "engraved quiet of old voyages") but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. It remains a metaphor rather than a mechanism that narrows options or creates cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is declared twice as a label ("whose eyes were senselessly perceptive," "Lira's senselessly perceptive gaze") but never demonstrated through a specific on-page action where heightened perception enables or constrains a choice with visible cost. Label-only mention without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears twice: Lira "chose to sheathe" her blade (backstory summary) and "sheathing any notion of blame" (metaphorical extension). Neither instance drives a key turn; the first is exposition, the second a descriptive gesture. The action does not redefine options or create a moment of choice with cost. Present but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is signaled mid-story when Lira whispers stories of the fallen tower into rose roots, and the roses respond by curling thorns and sweetening scent. Method is described and shown once, but it does not shape a key turn or face resistance that would test its mechanics. Present in middle development but not causally active in closure; functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure is anchored early, frames the entire action, and provides coherent spatial choreography (central greenhouse, fountain, perimeter). Lira's actions unfold within this setting across multiple beats. The dome's lanterns and moonlight charge the final image ("glass dome breathed a sunrise of amber fire"). Setting is integral to atmosphere and present at closure, though it does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure. Strong presence across setup, middle, and payoff elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" establishes a post-catastrophe timeframe but does not impose a live clock or deadline. Time progression is vague (sunset → night → dawn), and no urgency tightens decisions. The timeframe provides context but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure. Present but non-causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to weave continuity through chaos" is stated explicitly early and restated at closure ("weaving continuity through the chaos"). It guides her symbolic actions but is never dramatized through a conflicted choice where this want competes with a cost or opposing impulse. Told rather than shown under friction; functional but not causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" recurs four times, establishing a consistent oxymoronic tone (calm fire, steady warmth). It modulates slightly with context (inner peace, guiding light, hope's glow, sunrise promise) and appears in the final image. However, the repetition becomes mechanical rather than charged, and tone does not deepen or shift with escalating pressure. Present across beats and closure but static in effect.</comment>
