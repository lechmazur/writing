<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her swallowing of the clasp and final "vanish" command feel unmotivated by prior interiority. The whispering advisor remains a flat device without goals or pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent—"trembling hand" and "flickering eyes" are stock gestures, and the piece relies on atmospheric labels ("terror," "dread") rather than concrete perception under stress. The ending choice lacks earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who Mara is, why she's here, and what "after the resuscitation of her brother's lifeless body" means remain unclear past 120 words; this debt is never paid off (−0.4). The closure unit is ambiguous—Mara whispers "vanish" and the figure dissolves, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The advisor's final bargain suggests an open choice, but Mara's response is absent, leaving closure incomplete. Causality is weak: the clasp's powers, the paradoxical notes, and the dream dictionary mechanics are asserted rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The carnival funhouse is vividly described with strong sensory detail (copper, rot, viscous syrup air), and spatial choreography through the hall of mirrors to the carousel horse is coherent. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The clasp and carousel horse are objects within the setting but their interaction feels arbitrary rather than emergent from the funhouse's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to trick fear into revealing its weakness"—is declared but never tested through on-page choices that narrow options or impose trade-offs. Mara's actions (swallowing the clasp, placing it on the horse, whispering "vanish") are responses to the advisor's instructions rather than agency-driven decisions. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the figure's dissolution feels coincidental rather than earned. The final bargain is offered but not answered, leaving stakes unresolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of confronting fear through paradox is stated rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The "photographically cursed rose" and "lingering luminance" recur but function as decorative motifs without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The paradoxical dream-dictionary note—"Fear is a candle; snuff it with its own flame"—is on-the-nose philosophizing that the story illustrates rather than dramatizes. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration; the advisor's final bargain is not answered, so thematic cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but lacks perceptual signature; Mara's way of noticing reads generically gothic rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated diction ("slithering susurrus," "nauseating aurora," "viscous syrup") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Mara's consciousness under stress. The advisor's dialogue ("To trick fear…") is expository and unnaturally articulate. Psychic distance is inconsistent—some sentences inhabit Mara's body ("feeling its cold weight seep into her veins") while others observe from outside ("the air taste of copper and rot").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphors and elevated diction ("rotten lantern," "slithering susurrus," "phosphorescence that clung like a disease," "ribbons of black smoke," "nauseating aurora") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lingering luminance" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same atmospheric effect (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or use participial phrases to stack simultaneous actions (−0.4). Mixed metaphors: the clasp "seeps into her veins" (liquid) then the carnival "inhales" and "exhales" (breath), then shadows "unspool like ribbons" (textile), breaking coherence (−0.5). Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("seemed to," "feeling," "watched as"). Artifacts touch closure beats throughout, triggering additional caps per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The carnival-funhouse-as-metaphor-for-fear premise is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8). The "whispering advisor," "cursed object," and "hall of mirrors" are stock gothic furniture deployed without fresh synthesis. The paradoxical dream-dictionary method and "photographically cursed rose" add surface novelty but remain ornamental rather than integral to character or stakes. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking; the piece adheres to linear gothic atmospherics without challenging reader expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears in three beats (ticket booth, following through mirrors, final bargain) but makes no decisions that alter Mara's tactics; he instructs and observes. His final offer is not answered, so closure participation is absent. Swappable with any mysterious guide archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp appears in four beats: given to Mara, swallowed, placed on the horse's bridle, and cracked into shards at the climax. Its use evolves from passive receipt to active placement to destruction, and it enables the paradoxical-notes mechanism. However, its specific properties (silver, etched rose) do not constrain Mara's choices in a way another cursed object could not. Present in closure but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is mentioned eight times but functions only as atmospheric descriptor and label for the cursed glow. It does not shape Mara's tactics, narrow her options, or impose a visible cost. The concept could be replaced with "cursed light" or "supernatural glow" with no structural change. Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Photographically cursed" modifies the rose on the clasp and the carousel horse's gaze, described as turning "any image it met into a lingering echo of decay." This trait is asserted but never demonstrated through on-page action—no image is shown decaying, and the attribute does not constrain or enable Mara's choices. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unbosom" appears twice: the advisor instructs Mara to "unbosom the carnival's heart," and later states "the only way to unbosom fear was to let it drink its own cursed reflection." The action is metaphorical and not dramatized as a concrete choice or physical act. The story could replace "unbosom" with "reveal" or "expose" without altering structure. Mid-band at best due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "paradoxical notes in a dream dictionary" are mentioned three times: initial instruction, Mara's scribbled note ("Fear is a candle; snuff it with its own flame"), and the moment the notes "flared" to crack the rose. The method is not signaled early—it appears first at midpoint—and its mechanics are unclear (how does recalling a written paradox trigger physical effects?). The dictionary itself never appears on the page. Present but vague and replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse is established early and provides spatial progression (ticket booth → hall of mirrors → carousel center). However, it functions primarily as gothic backdrop; the mirrors and carousel horse are props rather than constraints that shape Mara's tactics. The funhouse "inhales" at two points, but this anthropomorphism is atmospheric rather than mechanical. Functional setting with one causal contribution (the horse's bridle as clasp-holder) but largely replaceable with any gothic interior.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation of her brother's lifeless body" is mentioned once in the opening and never revisited. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, impose a clock, or alter Mara's tactics. The brother and resuscitation are absent from the rest of the narrative. Ornamental mention without integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To trick fear into revealing its weakness" is stated by the advisor and implied by Mara's actions (placing the clasp, whispering "vanish"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Mara does not weigh costs or face friction between this desire and other wants. The goal is present across beats but remains abstract and uncontested, trending toward replaceable with "defeat fear" or "escape the carnival."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is embodied in the carnival's atmosphere (copper, rot, syrup air) and the advisor's "sour scent" and "thin slash of decay" grin. The tone is consistent through turns and modulates slightly at the climax when the luminance "drained…like blood from a wound." However, the tone is maintained through description rather than charged by escalating pressure, and the final image (advisor bowing, offering a bargain) does not decisively reweight the repulsion-attraction dynamic. Coherent but static.</comment>
