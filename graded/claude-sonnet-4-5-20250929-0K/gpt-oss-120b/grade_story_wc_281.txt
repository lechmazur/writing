<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract conceptual connections ("hidden geometry," "somatic markers," "neural resonance") rather than embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The protagonist moves through a linear chain of successful experiments without meaningful internal conflict or cost; her "affectionate skepticism" is told but never dramatized through a difficult choice between doubt and belief. Emotional states are labeled ("hope," "purpose") rather than shown through physical sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The final "whisper of another mind" arrives as a convenient validation rather than an earned transformation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality operates as a straight line of successful technical steps with no reversal, tightening, or cost. The "breakthrough" is handed to Mara by an external event (the power surge), and every subsequent action succeeds without friction or failure. No closure unit is legible: the ending summarizes future intent ("prepared to devise the next experiment") rather than landing a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The piece reads as an outline of discovery rather than a dramatized pressure sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The studio setting is anchored with specific sensory elements (neon ribbons, cracked panes, programmable LEDs) and the muscovite geode is handled across multiple beats. However, the environment functions as backdrop rather than constraint: Mara's choices are not shaped by spatial access, resource scarcity, or environmental friction. The geode's "opalescent veins" and "crystalline geometry" are described but their physical properties do not alter her tactics or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving neural resonance without a drug—is signaled, but no meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. Mara encounters no obstacles, failures, or costs; each step (calibrating brushes, tracing fractures, programming LEDs, recording data) succeeds linearly. The "true test" is mentioned but not dramatized on the page, and the final "whisper of another mind" arrives without visible price or foreclosed option. Pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of skepticism yielding to wonder is explicitly stated rather than earned through particulars: "even a skeptic can become a conduit for wonder when affection for truth guides the heart." The "willowglass hope" metaphor is explained rather than dramatized, and the closing lines moralize directly ("the most fractally precise secrets could be shared, not hidden, when curiosity meets compassion"). No resonant image reweights prior material; the ending instead summarizes the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice remains stable in third-person limited, and POV boundaries hold without head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into technical-abstract register ("somatic markers," "fractally precise intervals," "neural resonance") that feels more like prompt-echo than character-specific perception. Mara's internal texture does not modulate under pressure; her thought patterns remain equally articulate and conceptually fluent throughout, never degrading into urgency or sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy template cadence dominates: "She had spent…she felt…she realized…She programmed…She smiled…She recorded…She knew…she felt…She recorded" creates a mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("the brain's somatic markers" repeated across adjacent sentences; "hidden pathways" / "illuminate hidden pathways"). Figurative language often tangles: "fractally precise patterns" is repeated as a label without physical grounding, and "willowglass hope—transparent yet resilient, bending light without breaking" mixes vehicle logic (glass that bends light is a prism, not resilient). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("willowglass dream painted in light"), triggering the elevated penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise assembles multiple speculative-fiction tropes (telepathy pill, light painting, somatic feedback, crystalline resonance) without transforming them through character pressure or world constraint. The "affectionate skeptic" and the "breakthrough after static shock" follow familiar template beats. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the muscovite geode and LED setup could be swapped for other tech without altering Mara's arc. The transformation test fails: the same emotional journey (skeptic → believer) could occur with different props and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara is labeled an "affectionate skeptic" in the opening line, but her skepticism does not constrain a single choice. She moves through successful experiments without doubt or resistance; no beat dramatizes a decision where skepticism and affection pull in opposite directions. The attribute is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The muscovite geode appears in three beats: Mara reaches for it, traces its fractures with light, and it glows faintly at the end. The object enables her method (mapping fractures onto skin) and is present at closure. However, its specific properties (opalescent veins, crystalline geometry) are described but not causally decisive; a different crystalline object could substitute with minor edits. Scores mid-band for involvement across beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "telepathy pill recall" is mentioned as "a concept from a long-forgotten neuroscience paper" and reappears twice ("the pill's recall could be achieved," "recall the telepathy pill concept without any external cue"). It frames the goal but does not shape on-page tactics or create a visible cost. The concept functions as thematic backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears five times as a label ("fractally precise patterns," "fractally precise intervals," "fractally precise method," "fractally precise secrets") but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The attribute is decorative; no beat shows Mara trading precision for speed or struggling with the demand for fractal accuracy.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears three times: Mara devises a feedback loop (middle beat), the consortium is expected to devise further exploration (off-page future), and she prepares to devise the next experiment (final line). The middle instance drives the key technical turn—mapping the geode's fractures to create the feedback loop—but the action could be replaced with "construct" or "program" without structural loss. Scores for shaping one major beat but lacks unique necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" are introduced early ("the brain's somatic markers"), used to describe the feedback mechanism ("using somatic markers as the conduit"), and appear in the climax ("somatic markers pulse like tiny drums"). The method is signaled and repeated, but its mechanics remain abstract; no beat dramatizes a choice where somatic feedback constrains her approach or imposes cost. Functional but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "light painting studio" is anchored in the opening and provides tools (luminous brushes, programmable LEDs, neon ribbons). However, the setting does not pressure Mara's choices or supply a constraint that alters her tactics. The studio functions as a backdrop for technical work rather than a crucible that shapes decisions. The cracked panes and neon ribbons are sensory decoration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the opening and is mentioned as "the lingering charge" and "lingering hum," but no subsequent beat tracks elapsed time or uses the timeframe to tighten decisions. Mara works at her own pace without urgency or clock pressure. The shock provides the inciting condition but does not function as a live timer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated late ("a surge of purpose to illuminate hidden pathways for anyone lost in mental fog") and reiterated in the final lines ("illuminate hidden pathways"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no beat shows Mara weighing this altruistic goal against a personal cost or competing desire. Present as a thematic claim but not enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is introduced mid-story, defined explicitly ("transparent yet resilient, bending light without breaking"), and repeated in the final paragraph ("willowglass dream painted in light"). The tone label is asserted rather than modulated through the narrative arc; Mara's internal voice remains steady and optimistic from opening to close without tonal shift or pressure-driven modulation. The metaphor is decorative.</comment>
