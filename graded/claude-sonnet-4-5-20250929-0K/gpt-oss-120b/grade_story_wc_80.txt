<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear—cataloging abandoned structures—but her interiority relies heavily on abstract, label-like phrasing ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than embodied contradiction. The core action of placing notes lacks on-page cost or friction; she completes her task without struggle, renunciation, or meaningful choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin: "her heart hammered like a drum, yet her face remained a mask of calm calculation" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final vow to return reads as continuation rather than transformation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with anchors (drawbridge, river, Mara) but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Mara places notes, whispers a vow, and departs; no decision narrows options, no renunciation forecloses a path, and no image reconfigures stakes with felt price. The structure is a single continuous action—wade in, place notes, leave—without a meaningful tightening or deepening that alters her situation or knowledge. The ending gesture ("knowing that each future repair…would become another stanza") is aspirational summary, not a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with sensory detail (moss, algae scent, marble columns, mist), and spatial choreography is clear. The inkwell and pavilion constrain Mara's movements slightly (wading, slipping the inkwell into a cavity), giving micro-setting function. However, the environment does not decisively shape a choice or charge the final image; Mara's task proceeds unimpeded, and the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cataloging the pavilion's memory—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or tightening. Mara completes her task without reversal, trade-off, or cost; no on-page choice narrows options or forces sacrifice. The whispered vow is a continuation, not escalation. Agency is present (she acts), but the action lacks friction: no tool fails, no time pressure bites, no internal conflict forces renunciation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no density break or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving forgotten places emerges through imagery (interlaced absence, quiet fire of ink, submerged arches), and the inkwell serves as a modest motif. However, the final vow is stated rather than resonant: "each future repair…would become another stanza" is thematic narration, not an image that reweights prior material. The piece resists overt moralizing but does not offer a non-literal answer to its central question; instead, it declares Mara's resolve without ambiguity or cost. The recurring phrase "interlaced absence" functions more as atmospheric label than pressure-bearing concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narration maintains consistent third-person limited POV with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering is stable. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("stoically sensitive," "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "hushed blaze") that reads as imposed rather than character-organic. Rhythm is controlled but repetitive: many sentences follow the pattern of noun + verb + poetic modifier. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She believed," "She imagined") appear frequently, dulling immediacy. The voice reads more like atmospheric exposition than a distinct mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("skeletal fingers," "mute witnesses," "cloak of flame," "wet parchment"), creating density without corresponding clarity or propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "interlaced absence" recurs five times with minimal variation in meaning, and "quiet fire" / "hushed blaze" are synonym-churned across beats. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She waded… She slipped… She recorded… She felt… She pressed… She whispered… She lifted… She walked…" The final third stacks these patterns without modulation, applying −0.9 for pervasive artifact spread and −0.3 for metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens. Automatic disqualification from 9+ globally applies per artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor cataloging submerged ruins with antique ink—offers a lyric angle, but the execution relies on familiar motifs: the romantic ruin, the preservationist's vow, the talismanic object. The "stoically sensitive" trait and "archeologist of abandoned dreams" phrasing read as prompt-template language rather than lived specificity. No turn or intensification surprises in hindsight; the arc is a straight line from intention to completion. The piece commits to its atmospheric register but does not transform its material through non-obvious synthesis or bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her profession (shore surveyor) frames the task, satisfying setup and development. However, her choices do not create key turns; she completes her intended cataloging without friction or pivot. The final vow is continuation, not decision that alters tactics. Closure participation is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The inkwell appears early (setup), is handled twice (slipped into cavity, lifted from hiding place), and returns in the final paragraph, satisfying beats and closure presence. However, its use is static: it does not constrain choice, enable tactics under pressure, or shift meaning across beats. The object is atmospherically consistent but functionally swappable with any symbolic artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is invoked five times but remains thematic label rather than on-page constraint. It does not shape stakes or tactics; Mara does not grapple with absence as obstacle or resource. The concept echoes atmospherically but does not alter decisions or closure options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is named once and illustrated with the line "her heart hammered like a drum, yet her face remained a mask of calm calculation," but this moment is summary without on-page cost or tradeoff. The attribute does not constrain action or enable a choice that another trait would foreclose. It reads as character label rather than pressure-bearing trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice: "wrest the secret of the pavilion's foundation" and "wrestling the stubborn timber" (in imagined future). The action is setup and middle development, but does not drive a turn; Mara retrieves the inkwell and completes her task without the wresting altering options. The verb is present but swappable with "retrieve" or "extract" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Placing notes is signaled early, executed in the middle ("began placing notes in foundation repairs"), and referenced at closure ("each future repair…would become another stanza"). The method shapes the middle beat and links to closure, but its mechanics do not create friction or cost; Mara places notes without obstacle. The method is purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is established early, provides spatial detail throughout (moss, crumbling steps, rusted beam, broken statue), and anchors the final image. It constrains movement slightly (cold water, slick moss) and supplies the cavity for the inkwell. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Mara's task proceeds unimpeded by the setting's specific features.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The drawbridge rising is the opening anchor and mentioned again at the end ("rising drawbridge"), satisfying setup and closure presence. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; no clock pressures Mara, and the bridge's state does not alter her choices. Time is vaguely tracked ("night settled") without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated early and drives Mara's actions throughout, satisfying setup and development. The final vow reaffirms it, providing closure participation. However, the desire is never dramatized in conflict; no friction arises between this want and a cost or competing need. It is told and enacted but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" and variants ("quiet fire," "hush of the night wrapping her like a cloak of flame," "hush of her blaze") recur across setup, middle, and closure, satisfying presence. The tone is coherent but static; no modulation occurs with pressure, and the oxymoronic phrasing becomes repetitive template rather than evolving charge. The tone labels rather than inhabits the final image.</comment>
