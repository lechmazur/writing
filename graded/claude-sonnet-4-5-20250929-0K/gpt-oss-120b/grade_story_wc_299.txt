<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is drowned in abstract, therapeutic self-narration ("insulating emotionally with facts," "confidently uncertain," "after the applause") that never embodies contradiction in concrete action. Emotions are labeled and philosophized rather than dramatized through embodied perception under pressure. The final "calm resolve" arrives as assertion, not earned through a visible choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The brass compass vignette gestures at character alignment but remains ornamental summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague—who, where, when emerge slowly through dense lyric texture without a taught pattern by ~25%. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (moving toward purpose), but the cost is conceptual assertion ("letting the echo...mingle") rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that narrows options on the page. The dominant lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and a failed Causal arc; no single meaningful tightening or deepening that changes knowledge or tactics is legible. The ending recounts internal shift without dramatizing the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is mentioned but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The speaker grille cloth scrap recurs but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a tool or object that pressures decisions. Sensory detail is present (amber dust, corrugated walls) yet filtered through abstract metaphor ("valley longing") instead of POV-specific professional or tactile perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering purpose after public failure—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. No antagonist, obstacle, or ticking resource forces a trade-off; the protagonist passively catalogs relics and whispers resolutions. The tarnished compass and record player are backdrop props, not pressure points. The final "calm resolve" is asserted without visible cost or a decision that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("purpose after loss") is stated overtly in multiple passages rather than emerging from concrete particulars and earned turns. The final ledger entry moralizes the lesson explicitly: "the true stage is not lit by spotlights but by the quiet conviction..." This is thematic summary, not resonance through image. Motifs (applause echo, valley longing, cloth scrap) recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning at closure—they are decorative rather than structural.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent in register but relies on template cadence and repetitive stems: "I felt," "I realized," "I whispered," "I pulled." Psychic distance is stable but diction inflates into lyric abstraction ("valley longing," "confidently uncertain") that clashes with the ex-roadie's established idiom. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("letting the echo...mingle") reads as helpful narrator syndrome rather than earned POV perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the applause I once craved was now a quiet echo, a valley longing" restates the same sentiment across adjacent clauses without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third ("I wrote," "I stepped," "I realized"), and stock metaphors (dust like sunrise, lights like fireflies) stack without specificity. Mixed register: "wresting meaning from metal" and "scaffolding that insulated my fear" are strained, abstract constructions. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering accumulation cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The premise—roadie-turned-appraiser seeking purpose after public failure—follows a widely used template (fall from grace → self-discovery in solitude). The "after the applause" motif and the symbolic grille cloth are surface ornaments that do not transform the arc. Emotional beats (shame, resolve, rebirth) cycle through predictable stages without fresh moral calculus or unexpected synthesis. The closing "quiet conviction" ending is a stock resolution that could apply to any redemption narrative with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The ex-band roadie appraiser is mentioned throughout but makes no on-page choice that turns the plot. He catalogs, whispers, and reflects without altering tactics or forfeiting a path. The dual background (roadie + appraiser) seeds metaphor but does not constrain or enable a key decision. Swappable with any solitary reflective role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth scrap appears in three beats (desk, cushioning the player) but functions as symbolic callback rather than a tool that pressures choice. Its "faded navy fibers" are described, wrapped metaphorically, then reappear ornamentally in the final morning beat. No evolving use or visible cost tied to its handling. Present across shards but not causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" is named and echoed thematically ("the applause I once craved," "the next time I hear applause") but never shapes an on-page tactic or decision. It is the story's conceptual frame, not a driver of choice. The concept is told rather than dramatized through constrained options or conflicting desires in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears once as a label ("my mind, confidently uncertain") without constraining or enabling a visible action. No trade-off or cost demonstrates the trait on the page. It is philosophical flourish, not a dramatized attribute that alters behavior under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice (wresting from rust, wrestling with the past) as metaphorical summary of the appraiser's reflective process. No single on-page action of physically or emotionally wresting something drives a turn or changes options. Easily swappable with "extract," "discover," or "salvage" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is named once and described (cataloguing provenance, material, patina) but the method does not fail, succeed, or force a choice that alters the ending. It is backdrop texture rather than a tested means. The final resolve arrives without the method being visibly overcome or vindicated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer anchors the setting from the opening and recurs (battered desk, dim light, back door clatter). It provides atmosphere and spatial continuity but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that changes the outcome. Postcard description (corrugated walls, amber glow) without micro-setting pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" frames the timeframe as post-crisis but does not impose a ticking clock or deadline that tightens decisions. The story unfolds across one afternoon/evening and the next morning without time pressure altering tactics. The temporal frame is backdrop, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is the stated motivation and recurs thematically, but it is told and summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. No visible friction between competing wants (e.g., pride vs. humility, retreat vs. action) with felt cost. The desire is asserted in interiority without scene-level testing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" permeates the tone through repeated imagery (quarry echo, valley's waiting, breath mingling with echo). The tone is coherent and modulates from trembling shame to calm resolve, but it remains a single lyric register rather than tensioning or charging the final image with undeniable pressure. The tone supports theme but does not reweight the stake at closure.</comment>
