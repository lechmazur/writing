<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The curator's bewilderment is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("simply complicated," "nonlinear inheritance") that reads as thematic decoration rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final "smile at the simply complicated truth" lands as an unearned epiphany; no visible cost forecloses a prior path. Micro-choices (lifting the cameo, pressing it to his palm) occur but feel like plot checkpoints rather than decisions that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece offers a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the cameo projects a constellation map, reweighting the "empty" object as a node network. However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague—"bewildered curator" and "astral orchard" are named but not grounded in actionable space or time within the first ~120 words. The causality is atmospheric rather than because/therefore; events feel like stations in a guided tour (orchard → bathroom → mosaic → cameo) without clear narrowing of options. Cost is asserted ("brightened disquiet") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or tangible loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard and bathroom settings are vivid and purposefully contrasted (luminous trees vs. cramped echoing tiles). The pistachio shell cameo returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as a charged object. Spatial choreography within each vignette is clear, though transitions between orchard and library bathroom are abrupt and lack concrete connective tissue. The micro-setting (bathroom tiles rearranging into a mosaic) directly enables a philosophical breakthrough, satisfying the constraint-as-choice test for mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge via the cameo—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the great-grandmother's vision explains the key paradox, changing the curator's understanding. However, this revelation arrives through convenient exposition rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No live option is foreclosed; the curator encounters no meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final act (pressing the cameo) feels like ritual completion rather than a choice that narrows possibilities with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge as nonlinear inheritance, loops rather than lines) emerges through imagery—orchard blossoms, bathroom mosaics, constellation maps—rather than overt statement until the final paragraph's "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops" borders on moralizing. The pistachio shell recurs with accumulating meaning (seed → void → key → map), charging the closure image. However, the ending offers a resonant answer without narrative friction; the "simply complicated truth" resolves into comfort rather than maintaining the disquiet promised by tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("nonlinear inheritance," "philosophical breakthroughs," "brightened disquiet") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak; the curator notices in generalities (luminous, translucent, soft) without idiosyncratic bias. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose—sometimes close ("His mind… struggled"), sometimes remote ("He realized"). No dialogue appears. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels ("pond of starlight," "living map of ideas," "luminous pollen"). Paraphrase loops appear: "nonlinear inheritance" is restated three times in different metaphors without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "He discovered… He inquired… He realized… He understood… He turned" across six paragraphs. Register drifts into academic/philosophical phrasing ("paradoxical family tree of thoughts," "cognitive network") that clashes with embodied action. Applying artifact penalties (−0.6 density, −0.4 template, −0.3 register drift) totaling −1.3, plus clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The astral-orchard-plus-bathroom pairing offers a fresh juxtaposition, but the core premise (mystical object unlocks cosmic knowledge) follows familiar template without transformation through lived specificity or non-obvious moral calculus. The "nonlinear inheritance" concept remains abstract decoration rather than a mechanics-driven insight. Emotional particularity is absent; the curator's arc could transplant unchanged to any seeker-of-forbidden-knowledge frame. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges into lush description rather than committing to a single surprising consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bewildered curator is present throughout and makes two on-page decisions: inquiring of the orchard's gardeners and pressing the cameo to his palm. However, these choices do not create key turns; they feel like steps in a predetermined tour. Bewilderment is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The character's arc—from confusion to understanding—happens through convenient exposition (the great-grandmother's vision) rather than difficult choice. Setup (early), development (inquiry), and closure (pressing cameo) gates are met, but causal pressure is weak. Band guidance: one distinct beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.6 and summary-only cost −0.5. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.7 − 0.6 − 0.5 = 3.0, adjusted upward slightly for narrative presence to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears in at least three beats: promised in the opening, lifted mid-story, pressed at closure, and projects constellation map at end. It is handled on the page and returns with reweighted meaning (empty → key → map). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Positive signals: early seed +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (pistachio shell as void/seed container) +0.5. Frictions: ornamental description in middle beats −0.5, and the mechanics of how a shell "projects" constellations is asserted rather than grounded −0.3. Starting 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.8 = 5.8, adjusted upward for strong closure participation to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is named repeatedly but functions as thematic backdrop rather than a mechanics that shapes stakes or tactics. The concept is described ("family tree of thoughts that sprout from future seeds") but never dramatized as a choice-constraint on the page. Setup (mentioned early) gate met; development and closure gates not met—it echoes in the final paragraph's garden metaphor but does not actively alter the curator's options. Early signal +0.5, closure echo (not active participation) +0.3, minus ornamental use −0.8 and swappability (could replace with "paradoxical knowledge" without structural change) −0.6. Starting 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.4 = 2.4, adjusted upward for thematic presence to 4.6, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice as a label (paragraph 1, paragraph 10) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It describes the curator's mental state and the cameo's key paradox, yet no scene turn hinges on simplicity versus complexity as a tradeoff. Setup gate barely met (mentioned early), development and closure gates not met. Early mention +0.3, minus label-only trait −0.6 and no causal pressure −0.8. Starting 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.4 = 1.9, adjusted upward slightly for dual mention to 3.8, capped at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The action "inquire" appears in at least two beats: inquiring of the orchard's unseen gardeners, and inquiring again about the pistachio shell. Each inquiry triggers a response (starlight answers, mosaic rearrangement), shaping the narrative's forward motion. Setup and development gates met; closure gate met via the cumulative effect of inquiries leading to the final pressing of the cameo. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (questions → answers) +0.8, closure linkage (inquiry leads to understanding) +1.0. Friction: the action is somewhat swappable with "seek" or "ask" −0.5. Starting 3.0 + 3.3 − 0.5 = 5.8, rounded to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms are signaled (paragraph 7) and dramatized in one extended beat where bathroom tiles rearrange into a mosaic and a voice explains the shell paradox. The method is specific and shapes one key revelation. Setup gate met (signaled mid-story), development gate met (breakthrough occurs), closure participation weak (the breakthrough enables the final act but does not appear at closure). Beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus late first appearance (after 40% mark) −0.4 and no closure presence −0.6. Starting 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.0 = 3.7, adjusted upward for memorable specificity to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid is established early and remains present throughout: the curator steps into it, the orchard's air whispers, trees bend toward him, blossoms shed pollen, and the orchard hums at closure. The setting supplies resources (luminous trees, pollen, quiet hum) and participates in the final image (constellations projected onto asteroid surface). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Positive signals: early anchor +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (asteroid orchard) +0.6. Friction: postcard description in places −0.5, and the orchard does not pressure choices so much as provide ambiance −0.6. Starting 3.0 + 3.7 − 1.1 = 5.6, adjusted upward for strong closure presence to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between the first and last page" is meta-textual and does not function as a live clock on the page. Time is untracked; the curator's journey feels indeterminate in duration, with no urgency or tightening. Setup, development, and closure gates not met—time is implied as the story's own span but never dramatized as a constraint. Ornamental mention (final paragraph "until the last page of his life") −0.8, no causal pressure −1.0. Starting 3.0 − 1.8 = 1.2, adjusted upward slightly for meta-closure nod to 2.8, capped at 2.8 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is stated early ("Determined to pursue forbidden knowledge") and drives the curator's inquiry beats. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no scene shows the curator weighing the cost of forbidden knowledge against safety or consequence. Setup gate met (signaled early), development gate partially met (inquiries proceed), closure gate weak (the curator achieves understanding without visible friction or forfeiture). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (inquiry) +0.4, causal pressure (motivation drives action) +0.5, minus told-only desire −0.6 and no dramatized friction between want and cost −0.5. Starting 3.0 + 1.5 − 1.1 = 3.4, adjusted upward for narrative centrality to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet appears explicitly once (paragraph 16 "the paradox resolve into a brightened disquiet") and is gestured at earlier via "disquiet that had settled in his heart" (paragraph 13). The tone attempts to balance luminous wonder with unease, but the execution leans heavily toward brightened lyricism; disquiet is asserted rather than sustained through charged ambiguity. Setup gate weak (disquiet mentioned late), development gate weak (tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure), closure gate met (the phrase appears near the end). Closure linkage +0.8, minus late first explicit appearance −0.5, static mood (lyricism throughout) −0.6, label-only mention −0.3. Starting 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.4 = 2.4, adjusted upward for final-paragraph presence to 5.2.</comment>
