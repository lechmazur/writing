<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to lead and protect the community is clear, but her agency never faces a meaningful internal contradiction or cost. She observes, organizes, and reflects extensively, yet no on-page choice forces her to forfeit a path or wrestle with competing impulses. The elders and children remain functional background figures; Mara's interiority consists largely of declarative statements ("She understood that the sanctions were a test") without embodied contradiction or felt stakes. No credible change or renunciation occurs—only a static maintenance of the same stance from dawn to midnight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece delivers an Earned Stasis frame (community endurance through repeated bell-ringing) with no decisive change, reversal, or crystallized cost on the page. Closure requires visible, felt, or conceptual cost; here the final paragraph repeats the opening's tone and activity ("the bell's song faded into memory, ready to be rung again") without reweighting stakes or foreclosing an option. Under an Accumulative lens, the story would need a pattern break or cadence shift that charges the final image—none appears. The orientation is established late (~"ridge," "arbor," "sanctions" all front-loaded abstractly), and the link between anonymous donations and the bell's signal remains causally vague (how do volunteers know what to collect, when, or where to deliver beyond "the hollow"?). The ending simply loops back to the beginning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and ridge anchor the setting early and recur at key beats (dawn gathering, midnight bell-ringing, elder meeting). However, spatial choreography is vague—volunteers "disappear into the darkness" and "emerge again" without clear paths, distances, or tactical constraints tied to terrain. The arbor and hollow function as symbolic markers rather than micro-settings that alter choice or supply resources under pressure. The sanctions period remains abstract (no border patrol sightings, no blocked roads, no concrete scarcity forcing a tradeoff). Sensory detail defaults to generic visuals ("amber light," "faint moonlight") without POV-specific filtering or pressure-driven selection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—feeding the community without drawing patrol attention—is declared but never tested on the page by an antagonistic force, scarcity event, or failed run. No reversal or tightening occurs; the first month succeeds off-stage, the volunteers smile "brighter," and new sacks appear with no cost, friction, or trade-off. Mara makes no decision that narrows options or forecloses a path. The story offers a series of successful repetitions (bell → volunteers → donations → pantry filled) without escalation, setback, or visible price. Agency is procedural rather than choice-driven under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of intergenerational solidarity and community resilience emerges clearly through repeated images (bell, arbor, children learning knots, elders nodding). However, the final image—"the bell's song faded into memory, ready to be rung again"—restates the premise rather than reweighting it with a non-literal answer or felt cost. Subtext is minimal; dialogue is absent, so all meaning arrives via narration that often tells theme directly ("the purpose of all this was to build intergenerational support"). The piece gestures toward complexity (sanctions as "test of solidarity") but resolves into a tidy affirmation without ambiguity or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer, and diction is consistent—though it leans toward elevated, abstract register ("amplified quiet," "gently persistent rhythm," "surge of hope that rose like a tide") that can drift from immediate perception. No head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance is controlled but uniform; the narrative never tightens into close embodied sensation during peak moments (midnight runs, elder meetings). Perceptual signature is generic—Mara notices light, sound, and emotional labels without character-specific bias or selective attention shaped by her role or background. Dialogue is absent, so no voice distinction or subtext is tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "amplified quiet" appears twice in proximity without added pressure; "gently persistent" recurs as a label; "the bell's tone/echo/song" cycles without functional variation. Template cadence dominates ("She would declare… She secured… She spoke of… She reminded… She knew…"), flattening rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "knowledge curled like smoke around the old bell's tone" conflates smoke (dispersing, rising) with sound (traveling horizontally through trees). Stock phrases accumulate: "fireflies," "lullaby for the hungry," "tide," "silent spine," "secret heartbeat." High-pressure beats (midnight runs, elder gathering) receive the same ornamental diction as transit passages, killing propulsion. Paragraph cut test fails repeatedly—many paragraphs restate community endurance without advancing situation or emotion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—exiled community survives sanctions through anonymous donations coordinated by a bell signal—is functional but follows a familiar mutual-aid template without a fresh angle or non-obvious complication. The bell, arbor, and volunteers remain interchangeable symbols; swapping them for drums, a statue, and couriers would leave the emotional arc unchanged. No turn or ending image grows inevitably from prior particulars; the story could loop indefinitely. Mara's leadership and the community's success face no friction, mistake, or moral calculus that would individuate the vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or creates a turn. She organizes (off-stage), rings the bell, and observes success—observation without decision. Present in setup, middle, and ending, yet purely procedural.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The antique silver bell is introduced early, handled at multiple beats (secured, rung at night, swung in wind, final fade), and returns in the ending image. Its tone becomes a symbolic signal and promise. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—ringing it succeeds every time without friction. Removing it would weaken the motif but not break story logic if another signal (drum, lamp) replaced it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Anonymous donations frame the premise and fill the pantry, shaping the community's survival tactic. They appear in setup (hollow packages), middle (first month success), and ending (new sacks placed). However, their mechanics remain vague (who donates, how they know the need, what cost they bear), and no on-page choice hinges on their anonymity versus revelation. The concept is thematic backdrop rather than a pressure point that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is applied twice as a label to describe the plan and the bell's rhythm, but it never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. It remains ornamental diction rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff or differentiates Mara's approach under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Mara "declares" twice (dawn pronouncement that the community must find a new way; elder gathering to declare first-month success). Neither declaration creates a turn or redefines options—both summarize off-stage consensus. The action is expository rather than decisive, and easily replaceable with "announced" or "explained."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are mentioned in setup, occur off-stage in the middle, and volunteers return in the ending with new sacks. The method appears across beats but its mechanics (routes, risks, contents, timing) remain abstract. No run fails or forces a tactical adjustment. Present but generic; swappable with "dawn deliveries" or "weekly drops" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor on the ridge anchors setup (dawn listening post), middle (elder meeting site), and ending (bell sways in wind). It recurs visually and holds the hollow for donations. However, it supplies no tactical constraint—no patrol sight-line, no weather exposure forcing a choice. It functions as a symbolic gathering place rather than a micro-setting that alters moves under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The sanctions period is declared in setup and frames the community's scarcity, but time remains static—no clock tightens decisions, no patrol schedule forces timing, no expiration deadline escalates stakes. "Three winters" and "first month of runs" establish duration without pressure. The timeframe is context rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mara's desire to build intergenerational support is stated explicitly ("the purpose of all this was to build intergenerational support") and shown through children learning knots and elders teaching. It appears in setup (implied in her leadership stance), middle (elder meeting), and ending (children promise to pass the bell). However, it is never conflicted—no choice tests whether short-term survival must trade off against long-term teaching. Told more than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is introduced early ("listening to the amplified quiet") and recurs near the end ("the amplified quiet would never become a void"). The tone modulates slightly (dawn reflection → midnight tension → hope), but the phrasing itself is static and abstract. It charges the final image weakly—sound/silence motif is present but does not shift meaning or reconfigure stakes at closure. Coherent but not transformative.</comment>
