<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's core trait—"sharply observant"—is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The interiority relies on stock philosophical phrasing ("the weight of her responsibility," "exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality") rather than character-particular perception. Her decision-making proceeds in a straight line without internal conflict; the diamond's discovery and the stillpoint revelation feel automatic rather than earned through flawed struggle. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies her triumph, reducing the final choice to a declarative summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (wasteland orchard, post-liquidation), satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure unit—Mira's realization that "the hidden stillpoint was not a place but a mental state triggered by the diamond's focus"—arrives as a convenient epiphany unsupported by prior causal pressure; the diamond's inscription and the dust-storm cessation are presented as reveals rather than consequences of her choices. The plot follows an outline-like "and-then" structure (collect fragments → reassemble → find diamond → understand) without meaningful tightening or a felt cost at the ending. Under a Causal lens, the protagonist's agency does not narrow options or foreclose a path; under an Accumulative lens, no cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vividly sketched with selective detail (twisted trees, phosphorescent fruit, radioactive dust storms) and the setting recurs at key beats. The rusted table and the gnarled apple tree anchor the reassembly and discovery beats. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics; she moves through it without friction. The diamond's cradle and the magnetic-stone seal appear as conveniences rather than resources that shape the ending, preventing the setting from charging the closure image or meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the cursed diamond—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-offs. Mira's progress is linear: she collects fragments, reassembles them, follows the map, and finds the diamond without complication or reversal. The "curse rumor faded" is told rather than dramatized through a tightening choice that forecloses an option. No visible price is paid; the stillpoint's revelation and the orchard's transformation occur as automatic consequences, not as results of agency under pressure. The story lacks escalation under any drive lens, remaining descriptive rather than conflict-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—truth versus comfortable lies—is explicitly stated in the diamond's inscription ("Only in stillness does the truth shine brighter than any lie") and in repeated authorial declarations ("excavate truth from comfortable lies," "smokescreen"). The ending moralizes rather than allowing the final image to resonate: "the orchard…now stood as a testament that even in a wasteland, truth could bloom." This didactic closure replaces earned insight with a tidy thesis statement, violating the "no thematic echo" rule. While the flawed diamond and stillpoint motifs recur, they function as symbolic tokens rather than constraints that pressure choices, preventing thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited focalization through Mira's perspective without head-hopping. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register that clashes with immediate scene pressure: "the exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality," "the world held its breath." Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Mira's way of noticing reads as interchangeable descriptive narration. No dialogue appears. The prose texture lacks rhythmic variation or compression under stress, maintaining uniform sentence structures and a measured, explanatory tone throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "sharply observant conspiracy debunker" is echoed by "excavate truth from comfortable lies" and "sharp observation"; "the cursed legend was a smokescreen" paraphrases "comfortable lie set by the corporation to hide the stillpoint." Stock metaphors abound: "wounded star," "beacon of clarity amid chaos," "truth could bloom." Runs of identical stems ("She collected," "She knew," "She followed," "She placed," "She understood," "She documented," "She left," "She shared," "She whispered") create mechanical rhythm across the final third. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a pulse," "felt the weight," "felt the radiation") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—cursed object in post-apocalyptic setting concealing a hidden sanctuary—follows a familiar quest template without transformation. The "curse is really a cover story" twist and the "mental state, not a place" reveal are predictable turns that lack groundwork in specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Mira's profession as "conspiracy debunker" is label-only; her methods and perspective do not distinguish her from a generic treasure-hunter. The wasteland-orchard juxtaposition and radioactive aesthetic offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc and thematic resolution remain generic. The story reads as a competent execution of stock elements rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her goal frames the quest, but her choices do not create key turns. She collects fragments (beat one), reassembles them (beat two), and follows the map to the diamond (beat three) in a linear sequence without on-page decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. The ending shifts ("realizing the hidden stillpoint was not a place but a mental state") are epiphanies delivered to her rather than choices she makes. Observation without decision dominates. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in setup (rumored cursed), is discovered at the climax (half-buried cradle), and shapes the ending (inscription, stillpoint trigger, safely stored). However, its role is largely static: Mira examines it, reads the inscription, and places it on the cradle without handling tension or evolving use. The diamond does not constrain her choices or create trade-offs; it is a goal object that delivers exposition rather than an active pressure point. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with closure linkage places it mid-band, but lack of causal pressure and specificity limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "hidden stillpoint" concept is seeded early (suspected zone where radiation ceased), drives Mira's search tactics (reassembling the map), and is revealed at the end (mental state, dust storms cease). However, the stillpoint does not constrain choices or create trade-offs on the page; Mira's realization is told ("Mira smiled, realizing") rather than dramatized through a decision or visible cost. The concept functions as a thematic claim more than an active stake-shaper. Present in all three gates but replaceable with minor edits; mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is asserted in the opening line and echoed in the final paragraph ("sharp eyes ever scanning") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Mira's observation is narrated generically: "Her eyes darted across the chaotic script, each fragment shouting a hidden clue." No trade-off between observation and another trait (e.g., caution vs. speed) appears. Label-only mention; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Intuit" is mentioned once in the opening ("Mira's intuition told her that the curse was merely a cover for a deeper secret") and echoed in the ending realization, but the major turns trace to physical reassembly of letters, not intuitive leaps. The map diagram and inscription deliver explicit directions; no turn hinges on a gut decision under ambiguity. Easily swappable with "deduce" or "suspect" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled early ("Scattered among the orchard's ruined stalls were shredded letters"), executed on-page at night ("Mira spread the torn papers…aligning edges like puzzle pieces"), and produces the map that leads to the diamond. The method shapes the middle beat and enables the discovery. However, the mechanics are generic (sorting by ink hue, paper grain, scent) without unique properties or trade-offs; any puzzle-solving could replace it. Two-gate presence with beat involvement but limited specificity; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is anchored early, recurs across multiple beats (twisted trees, irradiated fruit, rusted table, gnarled apple tree), and supplies the cradle location at the end. The setting provides atmosphere and discovery resources but does not pressure Mira's choices; she navigates it without friction, cost, or tactical adjustments. The dust storms "intensify" but do not constrain her reassembly work. The orchard's transformation at the end (dust ceased, leaves shimmered) is a consequence, not a constraint. Setup, development, and payoff gates met, but causal pressure is weak; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation of the mining conglomerate" establishes a post-collapse timeframe but does not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock pressures Mira's search; night falls and she works under a lantern, but time does not alter her moves or create urgency. The timeframe is a backdrop, not a constraint. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missing. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated in the opening paragraph and echoed repeatedly ("excavated truth," "comfortable lies that had settled like dust") through the ending. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Mira never faces a trade-off between truth and safety, comfort, or another want. No friction between her stated motivation and a competing impulse appears. The motivation frames the quest but does not constrain action with cost. Functional setup and thematic echo, but replaceable and lacking causal pressure; low-mid band.</comment>
