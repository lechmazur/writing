<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority relies on abstract, elevated reflection ("clear complexity," "noctilucent reckonings") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ritual of stone-tossing lacks concrete stakes or internal conflict—no foreclosed path, no visible cost. Motivation is declared (illuminate value in the mundane) but never tested by competing impulses or difficult trade-offs. Emotional progression is flat; gratitude and lightness arrive without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration occurs on the page; Mira begins grateful and reflective, ends grateful and reflective, with no alteration in options or knowledge. The stone ritual and prism observations generate atmospheric description but no causal pressure or cost. Closure form is absent: the final image restates the opening premise without reweighting it. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural but lacks a cadence shift or density break that would constitute closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay, the prism atrium, mist, and the pond are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (noctilucent glow, fractured light, prismatic shards). The stone and glass constrain Mira's ritual and charge the final image with recurring motifs. Spatial choreography is clear. However, setting does not force a choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop for contemplation rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"illuminate value in the mundane"—is signaled but never tested by opposition, doubt, or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the ritual proceeds smoothly from toss to gratitude without friction. Mira's agency is observation and appreciation, not decision or renunciation. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid. Pressure is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (finding worth in the ordinary) emerges through recurring images: stone, ripples, glass, light. However, it is stated rather than earned—"value lives in every ripple," "hidden ledger balance itself"—and the final paragraph moralizes directly. No epiphany arises from struggle or specific cost. The prism and noctilucent imagery accumulate without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose adopts a single elevated, poetic register throughout ("noctilucent reckonings," "silent dialogue," "read between lines of wind and water") that does not modulate with pressure or reflect Mira's occupation as a glazier in diction or perception. No distinct perceptual signature; the voice reads as generic lyric narrator. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains static; no compression or intensification under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "read between lines" recurs five times with minimal variation; "clear complexity," "noctilucent," "prism," "rings," "ripples," and "stone" cycle without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [abstract noun]" structures repeat across paragraphs. Elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "ledger of deeds") clashes with the POV's grounded task (harbor glazier). Figurative density (prism, shards, galaxy, scripture, wheel, crowns, tapestry, talisman, eye) appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening the image. Stock metaphors ("whispered," "breathe," "patient eye") flatten specificity. Baseline −1.4 for loops, template cadence, and register drift; additional −0.3 for figurative muddle in the final third. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—contemplative ritual revealing hidden value—follows a familiar template (lyric epiphany via symbolic object) without transformation. The harbor glazier's occupation is mentioned but does not shape perception, diction, or stakes. Ripples, prisms, and light are stock poetic devices; no fresh synthesis or irreplaceable detail emerges. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk-taking; the piece retreats into abstraction rather than grounding insight in specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and performs the stone ritual, but her choices do not create turns—observation replaces decision. No competing impulse, no foreclosed path. She begins reflective, ends reflective. The "reflective" trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in the opening, midpoint (catches mist, scatters shards), and ending (catches noon light). It supplies visual texture and a recurring motif but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Static description dominates; no evolving use or reweighted meaning at closure. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. Swappable with any refractive surface.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is mentioned three times as thematic label ("noctilucent veil," "noctilucent reckonings," "noctilucent glow") but never defines stakes, options, or tactics on the page. Ornamental; could be cut without altering structure. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" recurs five times ("read between lines of light," "read between lines of natural scripture," "read between the ordinary lines") but remains metaphorical description. It does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with cost. Label-only trait; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Commune" shapes the opening and frames the ritual (toss stone, watch ripples, read patterns). However, it does not create a turn or redefine options; the communion proceeds smoothly to gratitude without friction. Signaled early; one beat involvement; no cost. Functional but not indispensable—"observe" or "reflect" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The stone-toss and ripple-reading method is demonstrated in the opening beat and reprised in the final paragraph ("another stone would be tossed"). It structures the ritual but does not shape a choice under pressure or face resistance. Mechanics are shown; two beats; no escalation or cost. Swappable with any divination method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn supplies mist, light, tide, and the pond setting. Anchored early; sensory detail is vivid. The bay provides resources (glass, water, sunrise) that enable the ritual and charge the final image with layered motifs. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. Postcard description elevated by recurring elements (mist → tapestry) but no causal constraint. Three gates met; causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" appears in the title, opening ("the moment before everything shifts"), and penultimate paragraph ("before the next dawn"). It gestures at urgency but no clock tightens decisions or tactics on the page. Time flows from dawn to noon without consequence. Vague; untracked; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate value in the mundane" is stated explicitly ("the purpose of this ritual was to illuminate value in the mundane") and restated in the ending ("the simple act of throwing a stone could illuminate the mundane"). No friction between this want and competing cost, doubt, or obstacle. Told-only; no dramatized conflict. Present in setup and payoff; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" recurs as label (twice in the text) and governs the elevated, abstract register throughout. Tone remains static—poetic, contemplative, distant—without modulation under pressure or cadence shift. It does not charge the final image distinctly; the ending restates the opening mood. Single static mood; no purposeful tension or tonal turn.</comment>
