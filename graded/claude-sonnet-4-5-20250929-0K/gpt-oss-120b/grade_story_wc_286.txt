<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is consistently present—her belief in fractured timelines, her intention to understand, her benediction—but her agency never faces a high-stakes choice with visible cost. The "thrum" and lantern responses are perceptual events she observes rather than dilemmas she resolves through internal contradiction. Her final departure reads as contemplative closure but lacks the embodied cost or renunciation that would make the change legible. The zen-potter archetype remains static; no flaw or competing impulse disrupts her patient kindness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (lantern, thrum, sun patterns, fractured timelines) build toward a final image where the oasis "breathes again." However, the closure lacks visible cost—the hives awaken, the lantern glows steadily, and Mara walks away satisfied. No path is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible. The ending reweights prior material through recurrence but does not impose the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis, cracked dunes, dead beehive, and lone cactus are vividly anchored and purposefully deployed. Spatial choreography is clear: Mara moves from the oasis heart to the stone altar, traces sun patterns to the hive, and exits across the dunes. The lantern's placement on the altar and movement across the stone tie setting to action. The oasis's fractured-timeline premise charges the environment conceptually, and the dormant hive's awakening depends on proximity and light. Micro-setting (body, lantern, stone) shapes the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the oasis resists change—is signaled early and pursued through perception (tracing vibrations, following sun patterns, whispering to the lantern). Yet pressure never tightens into a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The lantern brightens, the hive awakens, and the oasis breathes without Mara sacrificing, risking, or forfeiting anything. The accumulative design does not excuse the absence of a legible price at closure; the final image offers transformation but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—resilience through fractured memory, kindness as catalyst—emerges from the lantern's phototropism and the oasis's lattice of timelines. The final image (lantern as beacon, kindness that bends timelines) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the resolution is too tidy: the oasis "remembers how to breathe," the lantern "no longer fading," and Mara's smile confirms success without ambiguity or conceptual cost. The story gestures toward complexity (fractured pieces protect each other) but does not dramatize tension between preservation and change that would charge the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Mara's perception. Diction is consistent—"zen-minded," "sharp gentleness," "phototropic to kindness"—though occasionally elevated ("benediction," "lattice of memory") in ways that feel more authorial than character-specific. No head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional beats (hush, thrum intensifies, sigh at closure) but lacks a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices in poetic generalities rather than idiosyncratic detail. Psychic distance is controlled, and the voice serves the lyric-accumulative mode without slipping into filter-verb stacks or expository intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("careful sigh," "sang of patience," "delicate lattice of memory," "sharp gentleness," "chimney smoke flattens"), creating tonal coherence but slowing momentum and risking overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear: "fractured timelines" recurs without added pressure; "thrum" is restated as "hum," "vibration," "pulse," "resonant thrum" across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She believes… She set… She traced… She felt… She realizes… She knelt… She moved… She knows… She feels… She leaves… She smiles" dominates the structural rhythm. Sentence openings lack variety. Clarity remains high, and no artifacts obscure causality, but density and propulsion suffer under decorative weight. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase/template issues and −0.4 for figurative density without pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—phototropic lantern, fractured timelines, dormant hives awakened by kindness—is conceptually fresh but executed through familiar beats: solitary artisan in a mystical ruin performs patient ritual to restore life. The oasis's "fractured timelines" premise is intriguing but remains abstract; the mechanics are told rather than dramatized through causal friction. The ending offers gentle wish-fulfillment (everything restored, nothing lost) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative template: lone healer in a wasteland coaxes rebirth through ritual and intention. No bold structural risk or transformation of the template through lived specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her actions (setting the lantern, tracing vibrations, whispering, moving the lantern, gathering vessels) structure the narrative. However, her "zen-minded" trait manifests as observation and patience rather than choices that create turns. She waits, watches, and offers kindness; the lantern and oasis respond. Her agency is reactive—reacting to the thrum, responding to the hive's awakening—rather than driving reversals. Setup is immediate, development is continuous but passive, and closure shows her departure as witness rather than architect. Functional but replaceable with another contemplative archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The faded lantern glass appears in the opening (cradled, dulled by sand), is placed on the altar, responds to Mara's benediction (warming, glowing), is moved across the stone following sun patterns, and charges the closure image (steady amber, beacon by the entrance). Its phototropic nature drives multiple beats: it brightens with kindness, guides Mara's actions, and coaxes the hive's awakening. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The lantern's state evolves (faded → glowing → steady amber) and its final position (beacon for travelers) reweights its initial faded condition. Essential across beats and ending, with causal pressure and closure linkage. One notch below indispensable because the hive's awakening could plausibly occur through other catalysts (direct sunlight, Mara's voice alone).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced early ("the oasis survived because its timeline was fractured") and recur as explanation ("fractured timelines allowed pockets of the past to flicker," "convergence of timelines humming together," "weaving the fractured timelines into a new tapestry"). However, the concept remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping on-page tactics or constraints. Mara does not navigate temporal contradictions, exploit timeline friction, or pay a cost tied to temporal instability. The fractured nature is told as the reason the oasis resists change but does not alter Mara's choices or the hive's awakening. Setup is present, but development and payoff are ornamental. Swappable with "layered memory" or "nested echoes" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Phototropism to kindness is introduced early ("brightening whenever a gentle word brushed its rim"), tested when Mara whispers a benediction ("the lantern responded, its surface warming… confirming its phototropic nature"), and drives the hive's awakening ("hoping the kindness it carries will coax a new pulse"). The trait enables action with visible result (lantern glows, hive awakens) but imposes no cost or constraint—Mara's kindness is abundant and effortless. Setup, development, and payoff are present. The trait shapes one key turn (offering light to hives) and contributes to closure (lantern as beacon). Mid-band: causal role clear, but no tradeoff or specificity that makes this trait irreplaceable; "responsive to warmth" or "attuned to intention" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The thrum appears as ground vibration (synchronized with Mara's breath), intensifies as the lantern glows, mirrors the earth's heartbeat when the hive awakens, and closes the story as "resonant thrum that vibrates through the sand, echoing her own steady heartbeat." It structures escalation and charges the final image. Setup is immediate ("waited for a thrum to rise from the ground"), development shows it guiding Mara's perception and intensifying with the lantern, and payoff ties it to the oasis's reawakening and her departure. The thrum is causally active and irreplaceable in the lyric-accumulative mode. One notch below indispensable because its role is perceptual confirmation rather than forcing a choice with cost; Mara does not struggle against or negotiate with the thrum.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Following sun patterns is introduced midway ("She traced the faint vibrations by following sun patterns etched into the cracked salt crust") and recurs when Mara moves the lantern "guided by the sun's arc" and gathers vessels "etched with a line of light that mirrors the sun patterns." The method shapes her movements and ties to the lantern's light, but its mechanics remain vague—how do sun patterns guide her actions or constrain choices? Setup is delayed (second paragraph), development shows it directing her path, and payoff etches it into the vessels. Functional but replaceable: "tracing vibrations" or "following the lantern's pull" could substitute. Mid-band for one causal beat and closure mention, but no visible cost or specificity tied to solar mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is anchored immediately ("cracked dunes," "cracked clay tiles," "dead beehive," "dormant hives") and its state pressures Mara's goal (understanding why it resists change). The setting supplies resources (stone altar, lantern, hives) and its "scorched wasteland" context charges the stakes. The oasis's fractured-timeline premise explains its resilience and the hive's awakening depends on spatial proximity (lantern moved to hives). Setup, development, and payoff are all present. Closure image (oasis breathing, thrum drifting outward) reweights its initial abandonment. Essential across beats; the beekeeping ruin and wasteland context are irreplaceable for the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens across the horizon" appears once, mid-story, as atmospheric description during a hush. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or mark a temporal constraint. No chimney or smoke is established earlier or revisited. The timeframe remains vague throughout (sunrise to sunset with no tracked pressure). The phrase feels ornamental, possibly a symbolic image of stillness rather than a functional clock. Missing setup (no chimney mentioned at opening), missing development (no tactical response to time pressure), and missing payoff (sunset closes the piece without invoking smoke). Present but replaceable with any ambient detail.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to understand why some places resist change"—is introduced early ("She believed the oasis survived because its timeline was fractured") and tested when "the lantern's glass glowed, reacting… to her intention to understand." The motivation drives her actions (waiting, tracing, whispering, offering light) and the ending provides an answer ("the oasis resists change because its fractured pieces protect each other"). Setup, development, and payoff are present. However, the desire is never conflicted—Mara pursues understanding without friction, doubt, or cost. The realization arrives as contemplative insight rather than through struggle. Mid-band: shapes the arc but lacks dramatized tension between wanting to understand and the price of knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness is signaled in the opening ("each footstep a soft echo," "hands calloused yet precise") and recurs at closure ("the sharp gentleness of this rebirth, a precise kindness that cuts through the heat yet soothes the soul," "the sharp gentleness of the world settle into her pores"). The tone is coherent and modulates from contemplative patience to quiet awakening. However, "sharp gentleness" remains more assertion than embodied texture—where is the sharpness in Mara's actions or the lantern's glow? The tone charges the final image but does not create friction or constrain choices. Setup and payoff are present; development shows the oxymoron recurring but not tested under pressure. Mid-band: purposeful and legible, but the sharp/gentle paradox is told more than dramatized.</comment>
