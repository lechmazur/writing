<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") remains abstract and is never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her interiority consists largely of stock metaphor ("minutes stretching like thin silk") and declarative emotional labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and satisfaction come without any dramatized internal conflict or renunciation that would earn the shift. The claimed "fulfillment" is asserted rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story presents a loose Accumulative/Textural design, but no meaningful tightening or cost appears on the page. Mara's rediscovery journey proceeds by convenient discovery (ledger → phrase → hourglass → fragment fit) without resistance, error, or trade-off. The orientation test is met (~emerald silo, Mara, valley), but the closure image—villagers gathering, Mara narrating, sky stitched with silver sand—offers only a conceptual mood shift with no felt or visible cost. The final paragraph's "tapestry she could walk through, line by line, forever" is abstract assertion rather than a legible before/after with consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly established and recurs throughout, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure. Spatial choreography (silo interior, foundation, valley below) is legible. Sensory details ("dust-laden valley," "liquid glass," "green steel") are present but do not evolve causally with Mara's actions or filter through urgency-driven perception. The setting does not materially alter tactics or shape the final image's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscover the capsule's purpose before time runs out—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal, tightening, or visible cost. Mara's sequence of actions (scour ledger → find phrase → uncover hourglass → fit fragment) proceeds without complication, failed attempt, or forced trade-off. The hourglass metaphor ("last grain of sand") is declared but never shown to impose urgency on tactics. Agency is passive discovery rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the resolution grants fulfillment without dramatized sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—time's texture and memory as carrier—emerges from motifs (urn fragment, hourglass, garage-sale messages) but is stated rather than earned through specific, conflicted action. The final image ("tapestry she could walk through, line by line") offers a declarative answer without ambiguity or felt cost. Recurrence of the silo and fragment is present but does not reweight meaning at closure; the villagers' notes function as thematic echo rather than a non-literal resonance that complicates prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent throughout. Diction trends toward elevated metaphor ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "unborn seconds," "era-shifting chronicle") that sometimes clashes with concrete action but remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Mara's way of noticing does not shift under pressure. The final paragraphs maintain the established register without modulation, missing an opportunity for rhythmic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but the prose suffers from repeated abstract metaphor strings in high-pressure beats ("texture of time passing itself," "shimmering time-threads," "tapestry she could walk through"). Sentence openings vary, but figurative density flattens momentum rather than propelling it. Minor scaffold appears: "seemed to," "as if," "a reminder that" recur without pattern-teaching. The final paragraph stacks multiple closure metaphors (sky stitched with sand, stars as moments, tapestry walk-through) that blur rather than sharpen the image. No major loops or grammar errors, but overwriting dilutes information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—damaged time capsule unlocked by an urn fragment via garage-sale cipher—combines multiple genre tropes (mysterious relic, hidden coordinates, magic key) without transforming them through specific, grounded character or world logic. The silo-as-antenna and villagers-as-memory-keepers feel ornamental rather than inevitable. Emotional specificity is replaced by abstract poetics ("texture of time," "borrowed days"), and the resolution satisfies all threads without trade-off or surprise. The story reads as a response to prompt elements rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role as timekeeper frames the premise, but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, scours, brushes away dust, and places objects; none of these actions narrow options or face resistance. The capsule responds to her automatically, and villagers gather without her persuasion. Setup present, no middle development as choice-maker, closure participation is passive narration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears early (first third), is handled in at least two beats (placement beside capsule, click into groove), and its etched sequence matters to the cipher. It enables the capsule's pulse and map revelation. However, its cremation-urn identity is mentioned but never reweighted; it could be any key object. Participates in closure mechanism but lacks irreplaceability and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is present from the opening, shapes the rediscovery quest, and its "intentional damage" is revealed at closure. However, the capsule itself is passive; it does not constrain Mara's tactics or impose trade-offs. The concept drives the premise but does not alter options on the page. Setup, weak middle development, closure mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" appears twice: when Mara places the fragment and as description of the capsule's design. It functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint or cost. The air growing timeless does not prevent or enable a specific action, nor does it impose a trade-off. Ornamental use without beat involvement or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" frames the quest and drives Mara's sequence (scour ledger, find phrase, uncover hourglass). However, the action proceeds by convenient discovery rather than forcing a major turn. The verb could be replaced by "unlock" or "retrieve" with minor edits. Setup, weak development (no failed rediscovery), closure present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale descriptions is signaled early, Mara uses the method to find the cipher phrase, and the villagers later adopt it for their notes. The mechanics matter in the middle beat and recur at closure. However, the method's specificity (garage sale vs. any cipher) is not load-bearing; a library catalog or recipe book would serve equally. Two-beat involvement, closure reprise, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly present throughout, provides spatial structure (interior, foundation, valley), and its walls "ripple" and "hum" at closure. The silo functions as antenna in the final reveal. However, it does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she could conduct the same search in any locked archive. Setup, atmospheric development, closure image participation but no causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" is mentioned in the opening and as context for the cipher, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose urgency. The final beat declares that "clocks outside the silo counted not seconds but the weight of decisions," but this is thematic statement rather than on-page constraint. Setup present, no middle pressure, closure theme-only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated early and declared fulfilled at closure. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice or cost. She craves texture, pursues clues, and achieves satisfaction without friction between want and price. Setup, told-only middle, closure assertion without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" is coherent in the opening (waning sun, forgotten lighthouse, borrowed time) and recurs at closure (villagers drawn by anticipated mysteries). The tone modulates slightly from solitary discovery to communal revelation but remains static within beats—no tension or irony charges the final image. Setup, maintained through middle, closure mention without pressure shift.</comment>
