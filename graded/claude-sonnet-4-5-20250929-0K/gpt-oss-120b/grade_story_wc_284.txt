<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The burned spy remains abstract throughout, defined by symbolic guilt rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("the guilt a scar that never healed") and therapy-speak labels without embodied contradiction. The character's transformation from guilt to redemption arrives through magical objects and ritual rather than earned choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. No micro-decisions reveal a hierarchy of values; the protagonist moves through the valley without resistance or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—concrete who/where/when remain vague until the valley descent. The drive lens oscillates between accumulative-lyric (codes in snow, silver hush motifs) and causal (pillbox unlocking, map projection) without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the final "unused courage" revelation is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; the pillbox releases "light that rose like a phoenix" in lieu of an on-page choice or forfeiture. The valley sequence introduces new rules (glowing codes, crystal spring) that resolve problems they did not create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The zephyr bluff and mist provide atmospheric anchoring, and the valley altar offers spatial specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for symbolic action rather than constraining choices—the spy's descent and ritual proceed without environmental resistance or resource scarcity. The engraved pillbox is handled across multiple beats (clutched, aligned, placed, opened) and its compartments matter to the sequence, elevating it to micro-setting status. Sensory detail leans visual and generic ("silver hush," "pale glow") without POV-specific filtering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fixing broken trust through redemption—is signaled early but never narrows options through protagonist agency. The spy follows a preset ritual (trace codes, align pillbox, drink vial, follow melt, place pillbox) without meaningful resistance or trade-offs. The valley and spring appear to solve the internal conflict through external magic rather than forced choice. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the "unused courage" is claimed by stepping into a pass that offers no visible obstacle or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through courage emerges but relies on direct statement rather than particulars: "unused courage was not a place but a state," "fixing what's broken required both the courage he had sought and the humility to accept aid." The engraved pillbox and snow codes recur but function as puzzle pieces rather than accumulating pressure or shifting meaning. The final paragraph moralizes: "The valley echoed with a silver hush, a promise that the world could heal when its people acted prudently daring." Symbolic objects (phoenix light, crystal spring) are convenient rather than earned from prior constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent but diction drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe the secret," "luminous river," "phoenix") that clashes with the spy's concrete mission and ash-marked body. Perceptual signature is generic; the spy notices symbolic resonance (constellations, courage, forgiveness) rather than tactical detail. No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean but the voice lacks character-specific texture—rhythms and word choice could belong to any lyric fantasy narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silver hush" recurs four times, "prudently daring" appears twice as a label, "unused courage waits" is repeated. Template cadence is evident in parallel "he [verb]" constructions across the valley sequence. Paraphrase loops: "fixing what's broken" appears in beat one and is restated at closure as "fixing what's broken required both courage...and humility." Mixed metaphors: the pillbox "vibrated, releasing...light that rose like a phoenix" conflates mechanical and mystical registers. Scaffolding like "Thus, the burned spy" in the final paragraph signals summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—spy seeks redemption through symbolic quest—follows familiar redemption-arc templates without fresh synthesis. The burned spy, engraved artifact with hidden compartments, codes in nature, and valley altar with mystical waters are stock fantasy elements assembled without transformation. "Unused courage" as both destination and internal state echoes common self-help framing. The snow-code mechanism is introduced but not dramatized with cost or constraint. No bold structural risk; the linear quest from bluff to valley to spring follows expected stations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Burned spy is present throughout and frames the quest, but his choices are reactive: he follows the melt, descends, places the pillbox. Agency is minimal; the valley and pillbox drive the sequence. He drinks the vial and enters the pass without dramatized resistance or trade-off. Label-only trait ("prudently daring") appears but does not constrain action. Swappable with "haunted soldier" or "exiled mage" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Engraved pillbox appears early (clutched in hand), is used at the bluff (aligned with stars), and drives the valley climax (placed on altar, releases compartments, projects map, vibrates to release light). Three distinct beats with causal pressure: its compartments unlock the path and the final release stitches memories. However, the mechanics are convenient—no cost or constraint is tied to its use. Setup, development, and closure gates are met, earning mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is stated in beat one and restated at closure but functions as thematic claim rather than shaping on-page stakes. The spy's mission is framed as mending shattered trust, yet the valley sequence resolves this through external magic (amber liquid, crystal spring, phoenix light) rather than choices that alter tactics. The concept is ornamental: removing it would not break the quest structure. Present functionally but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is labeled twice (once in beat one, once in the penultimate paragraph) but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The spy traces codes, drinks the vial, and enters the pass without dramatized caution-versus-risk tension. The trait could be swapped for "determined" or "resolute" without altering any beat. Label-only integration; no visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once in beat one as part of the spy's intention ("vouchsafe the secret to the one who could decode the winter's whisper") but is not dramatized in any later beat. The valley sequence does not show him entrusting or protecting the secret; the pillbox and codes operate independently. Summary-only use; does not drive a turn or redefine options. Swappable with "reveal" or "deliver."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Codes in accumulated snow are signaled early (beat describing nightly tracing on the bluff) and return at the valley climax where "snow codes glowed, projecting a map." The method shapes two beats: the spy's nightly ritual and the altar revelation. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—no cost, constraint, or failed attempt is shown. The melt forming a luminous river is poetic but passive. Setup and payoff gates met; mid-band for functional but passive integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Zephyr bluff in mist anchors the opening and frames the spy's ritual, providing atmospheric specificity. However, the bluff does not constrain choices—the spy traces codes, aligns the pillbox, and descends without environmental resistance. The mist functions as mood rather than altering tactics or outcome. Mentioned in the opening third and final paragraph but does not pressure the valley sequence. Functional but replaceable with any atmospheric high ground.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as thematic bracket ("The world tilted toward spring") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No countdown or seasonal pressure affects the spy's ritual or descent. The timeframe is poetic rather than causal; removing it would not alter the quest structure. Vague and untracked; ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is stated as the spy's desire and drives the snow-code ritual and valley quest. The glen revelation ("unused courage was not a place but a state") attempts to reweight the goal, but the shift is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The motivation is present across beats but functions as quest objective rather than creating internal friction or cost. Told-only internal shift; no visible trade-off between want and fear on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs four times (bluff description, soothing moment, map shimmer, valley echo at closure) and attempts to unify tone across the piece. The phrase modulates slightly—from atmospheric descriptor to thematic promise—but the repetition feels mechanical rather than charged. Tone remains static (elevated, mystical) without adjusting to the spy's internal pressure or the valley's stakes. Purposeful reprise earns mid-5s, but the phrase does not constrain choice or deepen with each use.</comment>
