<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seeker's interiority remains abstract and repetitive across the piece—"attentively inventive," "watcher's burden," and similar labels recur without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The harness revision is externalized choreography rather than a window into competing impulses. The outpost crew's gratitude at the end gestures toward relational stakes but arrives too late to test the protagonist under interpersonal pressure. Muscle memory and the buckle provide concrete anchors, but the seeker's internal experience never deviates from a single reverent tone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives slowly—"nocturnal arbor above the clouds" and "midnight pattern seeker" delay who/where/when past the 120-word threshold, though the radio crackle eventually anchors the inciting pressure. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: the seeker climbs, revises the harness, descends, and receives affirmation, with closure landing as Charged Poise when the crew emerges and the seeker turns back toward the clouds. The final image reweights the watcher's burden through the cycle's return, but the cost remains conceptual—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The radio's "Hold fast" and the crew's relief gesture toward stakes, yet the dominant pressure (preserve trust) never narrows tactics or forces a trade-off during the revision itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The arbor, parachute buckle, and harness provide tactile anchors—moss-dulled metal, vine reinforcement, the buckle's "gentle bite"—that ground the seeker's work. Spatial choreography (climb, branch, descent, misty ground) remains legible. However, the "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; no environmental detail (wind shift, leaf cascade) alters a choice or tactic during the revision. The buckle and harness recur and charge the ending, satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but the arbor itself never pressures the protagonist's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early via the radio crackle and the fallen skyfarer's broken promise. The seeker's revision of the harness provides one meaningful action, and the crew's relief at the end gestures toward fulfillment. Yet the revision itself unfolds without friction: "His hands moved without thought," the knot is recalled through muscle memory, and the final loop tightens smoothly. No live complication forces a trade-off or narrows options; the radio's return ("Hold fast") arrives as affirmation rather than test. The piece delivers one coherent pressure arc under the Accumulative lens, but escalation remains implicit rather than dramatized through choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—duty, memory, cyclical vigilance—emerges through the buckle, the fallen skyfarer's promise, and the seeker's return to the clouds. The final image (vanishing into the arbor at dawn, "ready to watch, ready to bear") reweights the watcher's burden without moralizing. The parachute buckle and harness revision carry symbolic weight tied to trust and repair. However, the piece occasionally edges toward prompt-echo phrasing: "watcher's burden," "attentively inventive," "soundless echo" recur as thematic labels rather than earning resonance through specific action. The closing line's "soundless echo of purpose" gestures at meta-commentary, though it stops short of explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the seeker; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—"midnight pattern seeker," "muscle memory," "tactile promise"—creates a reverent, observant texture. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("nocturnal arbor," "vaulted dome," "muted conversation between sky and earth") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted, especially during peak action (harness revision). The piece sustains a single lyric mood without modulation under pressure. Dialogue is absent; the outpost crew's gratitude is rendered as "without words," a choice that fits the tone but forecloses a test of voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries rhythm and selective sensory detail (moss-dulled buckle, vine-reinforced rope, leaves like confetti), but template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate. "Soundless echo" appears four times; "watcher's burden" three times; variations on "the seeker felt/realized/decided" recur across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("cathedral of leaves," "cascade of tiny leaves fell like confetti") and elevated diction ("lofty silence," "vaulted dome") cluster in the opening and closing thirds without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph's "soundless echo of purpose that would linger long after he was gone" and "his silhouette echoing the soundless echo" stack redundancy at the closure beat, dulling the image. Filter-verb runs ("He felt," "He smiled, realizing," "aware that") appear in three consecutive high-pressure lines mid-piece. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings in peak beats (−0.4), and closure-beat redundancy escalation (−0.6) totals approximately −1.7 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure image, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a solitary watcher in a tree-city above the clouds, repairing trust through ritual harness work—offers a fresh frame. The parachute buckle as memory-object and the muscle-memory knot provide specific, grounded details. However, the emotional arc (duty → affirmation → renewed duty) follows a familiar template without unexpected friction, and the final image (returning to the arbor at dawn) resolves symmetrically. Thematic language ("watcher's burden," "attentively inventive," "soundless echo") reads prompt-adjacent rather than organically synthesized. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from bold risk; no turn reweights expectations in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker is named in the opening third and present throughout. His decision to revise the harness (middle) and his return to the arbor (ending) frame the arc. However, his choices feel low-agency: the revision unfolds "without thought," guided by muscle memory, and the descent is "a study in memory." The crew's emergence provides external affirmation rather than a choice-driven turn. The seeker observes, climbs, and acts, but no on-page decision narrows options or alters tactics under competing pressure. Present across all three gates, but minimal causal pressure; cap around 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears early (first third: "old parachute buckle, its metal gleam dulled by moss"), is handled and revised in the middle ("decided to revise the old harness, reinforcing the rope"), and is clutched by the crew at the end as "a symbol of renewed trust." The buckle's moss-dulled state and its link to the fallen skyfarer charge its meaning across beats. However, the buckle itself does not constrain a choice—the seeker's decision to revise is motivated by duty, not by a property of the buckle. Strong closure linkage and two-beat involvement, but swappable with another memorial object; score in the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named in the opening third ("the watcher's burden was heavier than usual") and recurs at the ending ("aware that the watcher's burden would return"). It frames the seeker's motivation (to preserve trust) and shapes his decision to revise the harness. However, the concept operates as thematic label rather than tactical constraint—no on-page moment shows the burden altering a choice or forcing a trade-off. Present at setup and closure, but does not constrain middle beats; score around 5.0–5.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is declared early ("He was attentively inventive, always tweaking his tools and thoughts") and appears once more ("confident that his attentively inventive spirit would always find a way to revise the fragile balance"). The harness revision could illustrate the trait, but the work itself is described as flowing through muscle memory without friction or visible trade-off. Label-only; no on-page cost or tactical choice tied specifically to inventiveness. Cap around 4.0–4.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Revise" drives the central action: the seeker decides to revise the harness (middle), completes the revision ("his revision had been heard"), and the revision's success enables the crew's relief (ending). The act of revising—reinforcing rope with vines, tying the knot—provides the story's through-line and participates in closure. However, the revision is executed smoothly without complication; if swapped with "repair" or "restore," the plot holds with minor edits. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate specificity; score in the 7.0–7.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Muscle memory is signaled in the middle third ("remembering through muscle memory. His hands moved without thought, each twist and pull echoing a rhythm") and recurs at the descent ("each movement a study in memory, his muscles recalling the exact sequence"). The method enables the harness revision and the safe descent, participating in two beats. However, muscle memory solves rather than complicates—no moment shows it failing or forcing adaptation. Present at middle and ending, functional role, but no cost; score around 5.5–6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is named in the opening line and recurs at the ending ("He vanished into the nocturnal arbor above the clouds"). The setting provides atmosphere (branches, leaves, wind, mist) and a vertical structure (climb, descent). However, the arbor never constrains a choice—wind shifts and leaf cascades punctuate beats without altering tactics. The branch "cradled" the buckle, but the environment itself remains postcard. Early signal and closure reprise with no middle tactical pressure; lyric resonance lifts it slightly, score around 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" is the stated timeframe. The radio crackles early, clears briefly mid-story ("a faint crackle returned from the radio, the static clearing just enough to reveal a single phrase"), and the outpost crew emerges at dawn. However, the timeline is vague—no sense of urgency or ticking clock shapes the revision. The storm "had ripped" the transmission (past tense), and the seeker works at his own pace. Present but does not tighten decisions; functional mention only, cap around 4.5–4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve trust under pressure" is dramatized early (the fallen skyfarer's broken promise, the outpost crew's reliance) and drives the harness revision. The seeker "felt his own promise echo in the same metal," and the crew's relief at the end confirms trust restored. The motivation shapes the central action and closure image. However, no on-page moment forces a choice between trust and another competing want; the seeker's path is linear. Coherent across all three gates with moderate friction; score in the 6.0–6.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears in the opening ("each branch whispering in a soundless echo"), mid-story ("the soundless echo of his own breath"), and twice in the closing lines ("the soundless echo of the forest followed him down," "his silhouette echoing the soundless echo of purpose"). The tone is reverent and lyric throughout, modulating slightly when the radio crackles but never breaking into friction or urgency. The tone charges the final image through accumulation, but static mood and repetitive phrasing (four uses of "soundless echo") trend mid-band. Strong closure linkage, but no modulation under pressure; score around 6.0.</comment>
