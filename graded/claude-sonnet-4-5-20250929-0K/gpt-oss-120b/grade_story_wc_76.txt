<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The clock maker remains entirely abstract—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle. We see him "feel the bleak exhilaration" and achieve his goal, but interiority is label-only ("restless heart," "seized control") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The resolution feels declared rather than earned through prior causality; he simply succeeds at every step without visible cost or internal friction. Therapy-speak ("restless heart," "step beyond fate's design") and diagnostic self-awareness flatten what should be visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when by ~120 words). However, closure lacks visible cost: the clock maker "vanished into the mist, his purpose fulfilled" reads as summary rather than a decisive change with on-page price. The causal chain is outline-like—he arrives, finds yoyo, spins it, engine starts, beacon lights—with no resistance or narrowing of options. The inferred lens is Causal, but linkage is convenient ("realized," "could translate") rather than because/therefore with genuine friction. No meaningful tightening occurs; each step succeeds without forcing a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse and island are present early and vividly described ("jagged teeth," "stone floor," "lantern room"). However, setting never constrains a choice—the clock maker moves freely through space without spatial pressure altering his tactics. Sensory detail is present but ornamental; the environment does not force adaptation or supply meaningful resources at the closure beat. The yoyo and hunger stone function as plot devices rather than grounded objects whose physical properties matter tactically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("step beyond fate's design") is declared early but never tested with on-page friction. No reversals, no genuine tightening—the yoyo spins, the engine starts, the beacon lights, all without resistance or visible cost. The protagonist's "agency" is frictionless execution; nothing forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. Escalation is absent under the Causal lens; pressure should narrow options but instead every move succeeds immediately. The ending declares transformation ("his purpose fulfilled") without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("rewrite fate," "reverse time," "initiate change") is stated overtly in the final paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The hunger stone and yoyo function as symbolic tokens without thematic resonance earned through action. Epiphanies are asserted ("He had learned that to initiate change...") rather than dramatized. The ending moralizes ("ingenuity can reverse even the most stubborn puzzles") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Thematic elements feel imposed by prompt requirements rather than organically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstracted register inconsistent with visceral urgency ("bleak exhilaration," "latent radiance," "mournful rhythm"). Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") stack in key beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to judge. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks purposeful modulation under pressure; the voice reads uniformly literary throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "He felt the bleak exhilaration" appears twice verbatim; "latent radiance" recurs mechanically five times without meaningful evolution; "hunger stone" and "counter clockwise clock maker" are synonym-churned across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors ("dying star," "thin ribbon") and therapy-speak labels ("restless heart") populate peak beats. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (ocean breathing, teeth cliffs, hunger stone glowing) lacks coherent vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure moments, flattening immediacy. The closure beat itself is summary rather than charged image. Artifacts touch closure; applying −1.7 baseline plus pattern spread penalties totals roughly −2.0, compounded by lack of propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (mysterious mechanism, ancient cipher, fate reversal) draws heavily from template adventure fantasy without transformation through specific lived detail. The yoyo-as-cipher and hunger-stone-as-conduit function as convenient puzzle pieces rather than irreplaceable elements grown from world logic. Emotional arc and plot would remain unchanged with different names and objects (transformation test failure). The "counter clockwise" motif and "reverse-engineering" feel ornamental rather than synthesized into a fresh, non-obvious angle. No bold risk elevates the execution; the story hedges toward middle-ground safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout but decisions do not create key turns—each action (spinning yoyo, holding stone, turning key) succeeds without friction or cost. Setup met, beats involve him, but swappable with "inventor" or "seeker" with minor edits. No causal pressure or closure linkage where his specific traits matter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Hunger stone appears early, recurs across beats (glows, pulses, warms, dims), and is present in the final image. However, its function is ornamental conduit rather than constraint—removing it would not break the story's logic; the yoyo could power the engine alone. No visible cost tied to the stone itself. Meets setup, development, payoff gates but remains replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" appears as label in multiple beats but never shapes stakes or tactics—it describes the hunger stone's glow without altering options on the page. Echoed thematically ("endless sunrise") without mechanical role. Present but ornamental; swappable with "hidden energy" or "dormant power."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is mentioned once in narration ("he would have to be neatly inventive") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The clock maker's methods are frictionless execution, not ingenuity under pressure. Label-only; no tradeoff demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears early as motivation and recurs at the key turn ("initiating the lighthouse's beacon"). The action redefines the lighthouse's state and shapes the closure image (beacon blazing). However, the act itself is frictionless—he turns a key and it works. Meets setup, development, payoff gates with moderate causal role but no visible cost tied specifically to the initiation act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The yoyo is discovered early, its mechanics (spin cycles, gear ratios) shape the middle attempt, and it is reprised thematically at the end via the sailor's charm. However, "reverse-engineering" is asserted rather than demonstrated—the clock maker simply "could translate" without on-page puzzle-solving or failed attempts. Functional but the method's specifics do not constrain tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse and island present early, anchor all action, and supply the hidden engine that is the object of the quest. The setting is essential to plot presence but does not pressure choices—the clock maker moves freely without spatial friction altering his tactics. The lighthouse's "stone floor" and "lantern room" are mentioned but do not supply resources or obstacles at key beats. Meets setup and payoff gates; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Under the slow exhale of low tide" appears in the opening paragraph but never tightens decisions—no ticking clock, no rising water, no deadline pressure. Time is vague ("Days later") and untracked. The tide "breathing out once more" at the end is atmospheric callback, not causal. Present in setup, absent in development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated early as motivation and reprised at closure ("seized control," "purpose fulfilled"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between wants and costs, no visible trade-off. The desire shapes the quest's direction (one beat involvement) but remains abstract. Meets setup and payoff gates; functional but replaceable with "seek power" or "prove mastery."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice verbatim and echoed throughout ("dread and hope," "quiet rhythm"). Tone is coherent across beats but static—no modulation under pressure, no charge added to the final image through tonal shift. The mood is asserted rather than embodied in sentence rhythm or sensory selection. Present across the arc but does not intensify or reweight the closure.</comment>
