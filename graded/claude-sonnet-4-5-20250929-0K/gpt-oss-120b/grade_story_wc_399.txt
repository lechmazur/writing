<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Keeper is defined almost entirely through abstract labels ("strangely honest," "whisperfield calm") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation to preserve wisdom is told rather than dramatized through concrete choice under pressure. The prophet and villagers remain stock figures without individual traits or dialogue. No embodied emotion or micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values; the protagonist performs ritualized gestures without visible internal conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: the half-masked line walker's identity and the pavilion's function emerge gradually through abstraction rather than concrete situation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the Keeper performs the same meditative gestures from start to finish. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final departure image, but no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page—he simply continues his prior wandering with renewed understanding that was never tested. The kinetic parapet's "conjured clearing" functions as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a constraint that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "murmuring pavilion" and "kinetic parapet" are vivid in image but remain atmospheric backdrops; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and poetic (sand, stars, cool breath) but filtered through a generic lyric register rather than the Keeper's professional or personal priorities. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers "approach," the prophet "arrives," but distances and bodies remain abstract. The pavilion's micro-setting potential is untapped; it charges the final image poetically but does not pressure the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to preserve wisdom—is signaled early but never tested by opposing pressure or a live trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the Keeper raises his hands, the clearing appears, the teaching occurs, and he departs as planned. Coincidence (the prophet's timely arrival) complicates atmosphere but not the protagonist's agency. The resolution is unopposed: the Keeper's understanding deepens off-page without a visible price, missed opportunity, or credible endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—that wisdom lives in listening rather than structure—emerges clearly through the Keeper's explanation to the villagers and the recurring image of the dunes shifting into footsteps. However, the insight is stated rather than earned through struggle; the villagers' question invites a sermon, and the Keeper delivers one. The final constellation image offers lyric resonance but no non-literal answer with cost; it restates the theme rather than reweighting it. "Echo of wisdom" and "peripheral awareness" function as prompt-label motifs rather than images that constrain choice or accumulate pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited on the Keeper, with a poetic register that remains consistent. Diction is elevated and hypnotic ("whisperfield calm," "soft sea of grain") but uniform across emotional beats; stress does not degrade perception or compress syntax. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Free indirect style is clean, though several filter verbs ("he felt," "he sensed," "he understood") dull immediacy in peak moments. The perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; any sage could notice these details in this voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is lyric and controlled, but syntactic variety is limited: many sentences open with "The" or "He" and follow subject-verb-object patterns without modulation. Paraphrase loops appear ("echo of wisdom" recurs six times; "peripheral awareness" appears four times without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors accumulate: "sea of grain," "secret tide," "fragile fire," "dew on his inner landscape." Information density is low; beats often restate atmosphere without advancing situation. The final paragraph stacks three sentences beginning with participial phrases, creating template cadence. No clarity breaks occur, but propulsion sags under decorative repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desert-sage premise and wisdom-preservation arc are familiar; the Keeper's half-mask and line-walker role add surface texture but no fresh moral calculus or character-specific friction. The kinetic parapet and conjured clearing are evocative images but function as magical set-dressing rather than constraints that force non-obvious choices. The ending—wandering toward the horizon to consecrate future clearings—restates the opening posture without transformation. Prompt elements are present but do not synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable in hindsight; swapping "Keeper" for "Wanderer" or "dunes" for "forest" would require only cosmetic edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker (Keeper) is present throughout and performs the central ritualized action (consecrating the space), but no choice or turn hinges on his specific identity. His mask is mentioned twice descriptively without constraining a decision. He observes, explains, and departs; each move is unopposed and could be performed by any sage figure. The half-mask label appears in the opening and once more mid-story but does not enable or constrain tactics. No visible cost ties to this character's particularity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is mentioned in three beats: initial description, the Keeper's interaction to conjure the clearing, and its settling after the teaching. It enables the conjured clearing but does not constrain choice or evolve in meaning; it functions as a magical device that responds to the protagonist's will without resistance. Its "shifting" quality is atmospheric rather than tactical. Present across beats but replaceable with any responsive magical architecture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are the story's central image: the parapet creates one for the prophet's teaching, and the Keeper sets out to "consecrate each new clearing" in the final line. The clearings enable the teaching scene and frame the protagonist's purpose, but they do not narrow options or impose cost. The clearing appears when summoned and fades without consequence; no choice hinges on its presence or absence. Functional setup and payoff, but the concept does not pressure tactics or alter the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is assigned as a label in the opening paragraph and reflected once in the Keeper's "strangely honest simplicity" when he explains listening to the villagers. No on-page action demonstrates the trait under pressure, and no cost or trade-off arises from it. The attribute is told rather than shown and does not constrain or enable a decision. Ornamental character flavor without structural weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Consecrate" appears three times: the Keeper's task is to consecrate for the teachings, he performs the act by raising his hands, and he will consecrate future clearings. The action frames the protagonist's purpose and drives the middle beat (conjuring the clearing), but it is ritualized and unopposed—raising hands succeeds without friction. The act does not redefine options or force a choice; it is a necessary step in the prescribed sequence but swappable with any ceremonial gesture. Setup, middle use, and payoff are present; causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" is named twice: once in the Keeper's consecration and again in his final sensing of constellations. The method is described as "letting the edges of his perception gather the subtle vibrations" but not tested or constrained; it succeeds on first attempt. The mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated through trial or adaptation. Present in two beats but does not shape struggle or tactics; the Keeper's perception is always sufficient.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is the primary location and frames the teaching scene. Its "pillars humming low prayers" and floor lined with the kinetic parapet supply vivid atmosphere, but the setting does not pressure choice or alter tactics. The Keeper could perform the same actions in any sacred space. The pavilion's murmurs are mentioned in the opening and closing, creating a lyric bracket, but the setting remains a stage rather than a constraint or resource that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" establishes the inciting moment and the Keeper's task emerges immediately thereafter. Time is not tracked or tightened; the teaching occurs in an unspecified duration, and the Keeper departs "when the teaching ended" without urgency or deadline. The timeframe sets the sequence but does not create pressure or narrow options. Functional setup without escalation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated as the Keeper's task in the opening third and recurs in his explanation to the villagers and his final understanding of purpose. The motivation frames every action but is never conflicted or tested by a competing desire. No moment dramatizes a friction between preserving wisdom and another cost (personal safety, rest, doubt). The motivation is consistent and functional but told rather than embodied in a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is assigned to the Keeper's voice in the opening and sustained through his meditative actions and the pavilion's "ancient lullaby." Tone remains uniformly serene across all beats; no modulation reflects rising or falling pressure. The calm charges the final image of the Keeper's soft breath and patient departure, creating coherence and a poetic cadence shift at closure. Static mood throughout most of the piece, but the tonal consistency supports the accumulative design and the ending's resonance.</comment>
