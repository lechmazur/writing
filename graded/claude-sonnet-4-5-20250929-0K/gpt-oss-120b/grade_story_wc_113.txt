<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are signaled (unravel the ghost's code, free the trapped melody) but her interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("feeling the pressure of that invisible dialogue," "understanding blossomed"). The final act of placing the program back feels symbolic rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from curiosity to reverence without competing impulses or credible struggle. No embodied emotion or micro-choices under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of water damage → marginalia → ghost code → played note → symbols revealed → ghost satisfied. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note produces the water-ripple shift revealing the final stanza. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (ghost's satisfaction, program dries, lanterns steady), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or price paid by Mara on the page that the reader can point to in a specific sentence. The lens holds, but the closure lacks the felt or visible cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house, leaking roof, water-etched staff lines, and lanterns are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. Water actively constrains the environment and produces the code images that drive the plot. The setting charges the final image (lanterns steady, river recedes, arches reflecting light). Sensory selection is atmospheric but leans heavily on visual; other senses are underused. Micro-setting (water on floor, antique program) functions as setting and enables the central discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: unravel the ghost's code and free the trapped melody. One tightening occurs when Mara plays the note and the water responds, narrowing her task to the final chord. However, escalation is gentle; no reversals or competing costs. The resolution (playing the final chord) feels more like fulfilling a ritual than a choice with trade-offs or risk. Agency is present but not tested by opposition or internal conflict. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of silences, "spaces in between," and reverence for the unseen emerges through image and pattern (water damage code, unstruck chords, wordless conversation). The final realization—"the code was not a cipher of letters but a pattern of silences"—borders on overt statement but is anchored in the water-ripple discovery. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer via the dried program and steady lanterns. However, "wordless conversation" and "in between spaces" recur as phrases more than lived pressure, and the ghost's satisfaction feels abstractly tidy rather than ambiguous or costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with controlled focalization through Mara. Diction is lyrical and elevated throughout, creating a consistent atmospheric texture. However, register occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing ("lately inspired," "caress carve new symbols," "gratitude for the secret") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. Perceptual signature is dreamy but generic; no distinct idiom or rhythm that reflects Mara's particular mind. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression and pattern are present but borderline precious.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated diction ("trembling like breath," "water's caress carve," "sigh that seemed to echo the ghost's own breath," "hush of unstruck chords settle like gentle water"). Template cadence in several moves ("She lifted... She pressed... She placed..."). Mixed metaphor: "water's caress carve new symbols" (caress vs. carve). Paraphrase loops appear ("wordless conversation" / "wordless exchange," "in between spaces" repeated four times). Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("seemed to speak," "seemed to smile," "felt the pressure"). Density −0.7, coherence −0.5, loop −0.4 = cumulative −1.6 in Q7. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level momentum and clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—musician decodes ghost's message via water damage in flooded opera house—offers a specific synthesis of gothic and artistic elements. However, the arc (discover code, play note, ghost satisfied, environment heals) follows a familiar template: artist completes unfinished work, ghost finds peace. Emotional truth is muted by the tidy, frictionless resolution. The water-damage-as-code mechanism is inventive but underexplored; the ghost legend and vanished prima donna feel stock. No bold risk or transformation that reweights the material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes the key choices (trace patterns, play note, press chord, place program). Her role as violinist matters for the instrument but not for on-page stakes or tactics. Two beats: playing the note and pressing the final chord. Causal pressure is mild; her choices follow discovery rather than risk or cost. Present in closure (places program) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Program appears in beat one (cradled, warped pages), beat two (marginalia spacing mirrors water patterns), and closure (placed in seat, now dry). Early signal, middle development, and closure presence satisfy all three gates. The program guides interpretation and is charged at closure by its transformation (dry pages). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it functions as clue and symbol. Lyric reprise with closure linkage justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is stated four times as a phrase (orchestra pit shadows, where water pooled, spaces between sounds, spaces between past and future) but remains thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. It does not change Mara's options or create friction. The concept is ornamental and could be removed without altering the plot. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once in paragraph one as a modifier ("lately inspired by the echo of forgotten arias"). It primes her receptiveness but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No visible trade-off or tactical consequence. Label-only mention, no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears explicitly: "demanded she disrupt the complacent calm by letting the water's caress carve new symbols." This frames her willingness to let the water work, but the action itself is passive observation rather than active disruption. The major turn (playing the note) is not labeled as disruption. Present in setup, marginal causal role, no closure participation. Swappable with "engage" or "activate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled early (droplets merge into staff lines and letters), developed in the middle (spacing mirrors marginalia, water-etched staff lines glow), and returns at closure (water ripples shift to reveal final stanza). Mechanics matter: the water produces the code that Mara decodes. The method drives two beats and shapes the ending. Specific and irreplaceable; removing it breaks the plot. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Flooded opera house with lanterns is anchored immediately and sustained throughout. The flooding supplies the water damage, the pit positions Mara, the leaking roof produces the code, and the lanterns' steadying at closure signals resolution. Setting pressures the discovery (water as medium), provides resources (program in seat), and charges the final image (arches reflecting amber light). Micro-setting (floor, stage, lobby) is spatially coherent. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" and "wordless conversation" recur as tone markers but do not function as a timeframe constraint. "Over hours" is mentioned once but not tracked or used to tighten decisions. No live clock alters tactics. The element is present as atmosphere, not as temporal pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel the ghost's code is stated early ("the motive that surged within her") and drives her actions: tracing patterns, playing the note, pressing the chord. Two beats shaped by this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between desire and price. Present at closure (code unraveled, ghost satisfied) but without on-page struggle. Lyric reprise with causal role justifies low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" recurs four times as a phrase and frames the tone throughout: dialogue without words, silent exchange, reverence. Coherent and modulates subtly (pressure → exchange → gratitude). The tone charges the final image (hush settling, promise whispered). However, it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring choices. Pattern-taught and closure-linked, but not indispensable. Mid-6s for lyric coherence and closure presence.</comment>
