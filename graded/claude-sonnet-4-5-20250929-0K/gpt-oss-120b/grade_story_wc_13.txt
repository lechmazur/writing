<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior reads as abstract and externalized throughout; her "motivation was singular" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece offers no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—she glides through a lyric reverie without friction or doubt. Embodiment is absent: no bodily reaction to the glowing pendant, no hesitation before stepping onto light, no cost that alters her stance. The final dissolution of the pendant and her walk back lack any visible forfeit or renunciation that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within tolerance, but causality remains decorative: the pendant glows, a bridge appears, echoes swirl, and Mira "understood"—all without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis. The closure image (pendant dissolving, rhythm restored) asserts resolution without demonstrating a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the final walk back erases the journey's tension. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the "interrupted cadence" functions as atmosphere rather than a forcing mechanism. The drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (lyric density) and Causal (quest structure) but neither holds at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system and lattice towers anchor locale early and supply vivid particulars (mirrored ribbons, star-like cascade). Spatial choreography is clean across skiff, arch, and cavern descent, and the pendant's glow/spiral provides micro-setting constraint at two beats (arch, cavern). However, the environment never pressures a choice: Mira encounters no locked gate, rival, or resource scarcity—only spectacle. The giant's nap remains metaphor without tactile consequence, and "veins of pure possibility" substitutes elevated register for grounded detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where echoes are born"—is declared but never tested on the page; no ticking clock, rival, or sacrifice narrows options. The pendant unlocks a light bridge and releases echoes without resistance, cost, or complication. No meaningful escalation under any lens: pressure remains static from skiff to cavern, and the cavern "responded" conveniently. The resolution (restored rhythm, echoes reborn) is gifted by the setting rather than earned by protagonist agency. Coincidence (the pendant's automatic functions) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-malleable emerges through recurring imagery (infinity loops, sculpted time, interrupted cadence) but relies on direct statement: "she must become the echo," "sculpts time itself." The final image (silver water, restored rhythm) asserts thematic closure without reweighting prior material through concrete action or visible cost. No earned wisdom arises from struggle—Mira receives insight ("realized," "understood") as exposition. The echo-as-living-note conceit is poeticized rather than dramatized, and the ending's "promise" resolves ambiguity into tidy satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (illustrator's eye: "sketches could coax the soul from a fossil," ink capturing fractured light) carries professional specificity. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("mythic source," "tangible slice of borrowed time," "chorus of whispers") that exceeds the narrator's established voice under pressure. Psychic distance contracts during the cavern descent but without embodied urgency. Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early, but filter verbs ("she sensed," "she realized") dull immediacy at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Figurative overload pervades: "lattice of stone ribs," "mirrored ribbons," "pair of tiny constellations," "dreamscape stitched together by the city's own sighs"—mixing metaphors without coherent vehicle across adjacent sentences. Paraphrase loops cluster mid-piece: "the place where echoes are born" appears three times in five paragraphs, and "interrupted cadence" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in succession during the arch/cavern sequence. Stock phrasing ("lifted her small skiff," "a soft chime rang like a half-remembered song") replaces concrete action with generic gesture. Zero loops or scaffold is required for 9+; this piece stacks multiple artifact types, disqualifying high-band entry and triggering the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The quest-for-mythic-source frame is template-familiar, and the pendant-as-magic-key follows well-worn fantasy logic without transformation. Emotional specifics are absent: Mira's illustrator profession colors two images (fossil sketch, ink on ripples) but does not alter tactics or stakes. The lyric-fantasy register (giants, echoes born, time sculpted like clay) relies on stock poeticism rather than grounded particulars. The ending's restoration-of-rhythm arc offers no non-obvious synthesis or moral calculus; coincidence (the cavern "responded," the pendant "dissolved") replaces protagonist ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Illustrator profession appears in opening exposition ("sketches could coax the soul from a fossil") and mid-piece when she draws the waterway to "anchor her in the fleeting present," but neither sketch alters tactics or stakes—observation without decision. Final walk-back mentions her sketchbook "filled with the sound of time itself," a label-only claim. No on-page choice traces to her illustrator skills; the profession is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Infinity symbol pendant is introduced early (neck, "catching light"), glows at the arch (beat 1), extends a light bridge when Mira whispers a prayer (beat 2), is pressed into water to form a spiral staircase (beat 3), lifted in the cavern to release echoes (beat 4), and dissolved into star-points at closure (beat 5). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, with four distinct beats. However, the pendant's mechanics are never constrained—it responds automatically to need without cost or trade-off. Swappability moderate: any magical key could serve the same function. Closure linkage is present (dissolution recharges the city) but the pendant's disappearance lacks felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence appears in opening rumor (gondolier's claim), echoed by ripples on the canal (beat 1), and in the cavern where "each tone carving a new second" maintains the rhythm (beat 2); final resolution states the cadence "would never again break." Setup and closure gates are met. However, the concept remains atmospheric: no on-page choice or tactic changes because the cadence falters. It colors mood but does not narrow options or impose constraint. Functional but replaceable with any rhythmic metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sculpts time itself" is declared twice in exposition ("to sculpt time itself into visible patterns," "her ink continued to sculpt time itself") and asserted once in interiority ("time could be sculpted like clay"). No on-page action demonstrates this ability with cost—Mira draws one sketch to anchor herself, but it does not alter the quest or impose a trade-off. The attribute is label-only, never constraining or enabling a beat. Introduced early but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Uncage" appears in the opening rumor ("could uncage moments"), Mira's prayer ("to uncage the suspended moment"), the vortex description ("uncage the very notion of linear time"), and the denouement ("even the mightiest pauses can be uncaged"). Present across setup, middle, and closure. However, the action itself is abstract and passive: moments are uncaged by the pendant's automatic response, not by Mira's choice or sacrifice. Swappable with "release" or "free" without structural change. Functional recurrence but mid-band due to lack of causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Borrowing time" is seeded in the opening ("as if borrowing time from the future to fuel her quest"), dramatized when Mira whispers a prayer to "borrow time" at the arch (beat 1), and reprised in the final image ("borrowing time from the giant's lingering dream"). Setup and closure gates are met. The method matters at one key beat (arch) where the prayer triggers the light bridge, but mechanics are never specified or constrained—no visible cost or resource is traded. Functional but replaceable; "invoking" or "channeling" would serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system is established in the opening image and supplies spatial coherence across skiff journey, arch, and cavern descent; the canals "become veins of pure possibility" during the giant's nap (world-rule link). The setting constrains Mira's path (she follows the canal to the arch) and provides a resource (water that brightens, turns into a staircase). Present in setup, middle exploration, and closure (water turns silver). However, the setting never pressures a difficult choice—no rapids, rival, or resource scarcity—so its role is navigational rather than forcing. One beat of causal work (canal guides to arch) lifts it above ornamental; lack of tactical friction caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Giant's nap" is introduced in the old legend (first third), invoked when the towers cast long shadows and Mira senses a dreamscape, and echoed in closure ("the giant's nap lingered only as a gentle hum"). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the timeframe imposes no urgency or constraint: no risk of the giant waking, no ticking deadline that alters tactics. It functions as metaphor for the suspended-time atmosphere rather than a live clock. Missing middle development (no choice shaped by the nap's duration). Lyric reprise lifts it slightly, but lack of causal pressure keeps it low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the place where echoes are born" is declared singular in opening exposition, pursued across the skiff journey and arch crossing, and fulfilled when Mira realizes "the place…was not a location but a moment" and "must become the echo." Setup, middle pursuit, and closure realization are present. However, the desire is never dramatized under friction: no doubt, rival claim, or competing want tests commitment. The realization is gifted by the cavern's spectacle rather than earned through sacrifice. Told-only interiority ("she understood") replaces embodied choice. Functional pursuit but lacks on-page cost or contradiction.</comment>
