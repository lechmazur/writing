<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains more concept than character; decisions are observational rather than truly pressured. Interior life is buried under figurative density—"drowsy alertness" recurs as a label without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to leave the wheel reads as thematic gesture rather than a motivated turn foreclosing a path with visible cost, and no prior behavior established what Mara wanted enough to sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt is severe: POV gender, physical grounding, and immediate goal remain unclear past 120 words; Mara's name and the valve-wheel objective emerge only after sustained atmospheric wandering. Closure—leaving the wheel—lacks visible cost; no on-page option was foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (truth as weight), but the final image ("quiet prayer he never intended to utter") replaces scene pressure with abstraction, and no felt price anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is evoked through mood and metaphor but rarely constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography (alcove, conveyor, tracks) remains vague; the beaded wheel's physical state and Mara's handling are never dramatized. The setting functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure, and the final emergence into predawn light adds no cost or closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—quantifying hidden truth—is declared but never tested by a live on-page choice with alternatives and cost. No reversal or deepening narrows options; Mara appraises the wheel in summary, derives a pattern off-page, and decides to leave it without any friction or price paid. Coincidence (taped radio fragments, the foreman's confession) supplies all pressure; protagonist agency is observational throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—hidden truths as measurable weight—is stated rather than earned from particulars. The beaded valve, "swallowed truth," and "emotional tonnage" recur as symbols but do not constrain a choice or evolve through conflict. The final image ("quiet prayer he never intended to utter") moralizes instead of landing a resonant, non-literal answer. Religious skepticism is mentioned twice without shaping perception or costing anything on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Diction oscillates between elevated lyricism ("rusted artery," "frozen syllables") and concrete action without a stable perceptual signature anchored in Mara's mind. Filter verbs and abstract modifiers ("drowsy alertness," "invisible mass") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. POV distance is inconsistent: some lines inhabit close third, others drift into omniscient summary ("the tunnel seemed to breathe"). Gender pronouns shift (his/he) without clarity on Mara's identity, harming voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops: paragraphs 2–4 restate "drowsy alertness," "ghost shift," and "weight of truth" in synonym cycles without advancing knowledge or pressure. Template cadence dominates ("He descended…he let…he listened…he chose"), creating syntactic monotony. Figurative language ("steel ribs," "Morse code of fear," "frequency chart of guilt") appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality. The orientation paragraph (1) and the closure paragraph (12) both bury action under metaphor, flattening propulsion when clarity is most needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—measuring emotional weight via industrial relic—echoes established urban-fantasy and psychometry tropes without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Mara's religious skepticism and the talk-radio psychics are mentioned but not integrated into choice or worldview. The final decision (leave the wheel) feels like a median safety choice rather than a bold risk that heightens stakes, and the turn is unmotivated by prior causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mara is labeled "reckless" but makes no on-page choice testing that trait; exploration is passive appraisal. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in three beats (discovery, appraisal, decision to leave) and anchors the closure choice. However, it is never physically handled or used; all interaction is summary ("appraised it by weighing reverberations"). Swappable with any symbolic relic; beads' specific properties do not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Factory ghost shift recurs as atmospheric label and thematic echo but does not alter on-page options or tactics. Mentioned in paragraphs 2, 4, 7, and 10 without causal pressure; functions as mood rather than stake-shaping concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Religiously skeptical appears twice (paragraphs 2 and 14) as background trait; does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appraise is central to stated goal and recurs (paragraphs 1, 4, 7, 15), but the method is summarized rather than dramatized. Mara "appraised it by weighing reverberations" and "derived a numeric pattern" off-page; no tactile handling or test shown. Present in setup and closure but swappable with "measure" or "study."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Frantic calls to talk-radio psychics seed setup (paragraph 2), return in the middle (paragraph 14), and inform the appraisal method (paragraph 7: "aligning their frantic tones with the wheel's oscillation"). However, the mechanics are told, not shown; we never witness Mara parsing the recordings on the page. Functional but summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Abandoned train tunnel anchors the entire action and recurs across nine paragraphs. However, it pressures no choice; Mara moves through it without spatial friction, and the alcove's emergence is coincidental. Micro-setting (wheel in alcove) is described but not used to alter tactics. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but postcard-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hush following confession is mentioned in setup (paragraph 1: "hush that followed the sudden confession") and closure (paragraph 11: "In the hush that followed his decision"), but time remains vague and untracked; no tightening deadline alters moves. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>To find the weight of a swallowed truth drives the stated goal and recurs (paragraphs 1, 4, 7, 13, 15), but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between wants and costs. Mara's appraisal succeeds off-page, and the decision to leave the wheel is renunciation without visible sacrifice. Present across beats but told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Drowsy alertness recurs in six paragraphs (2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 16) as a mood label but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Static descriptor applied uniformly rather than a tonal shift that reweights stakes. Present but ornamental.</comment>
