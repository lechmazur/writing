<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The calligrapher remains a type rather than a character—no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle visible in her choices. The journey from workshop to cavern to vent unfolds as smooth discovery with no embodied cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Her refusal of the council proclamation is told in summary ("That night she retrieved...") rather than dramatized with felt consequence. The final moment offers no earned change; she simply documents what happened, trading agency for passive witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece lands a Conceptual Repricing—candor as restorative force—but the cost is atmospheric rather than personal or causal. The narrative moves by conjunction ("That night... She decided... She stepped through...") without because/therefore pressure narrowing options. The map functions as a tour guide to pre-solved locations (bottles waiting, vent pre-rigged to respond) rather than a constraint that forces trade-offs. Orientation is swift (greenhouse city, calligrapher, toxic sky by line three), preventing further penalty, but the closure image (vines singing, sky healed) asserts thematic victory without on-page sacrifice or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, zinc plate, and bottles supply vivid texture, and the plate's color-change grounds the candor mechanic in observable physics. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no locked door, depleted resource, or spatial trade-off alters her tactics. The cavern of crystal shelves and sky-vent appear exactly when needed without scarcity or access cost. The piece reaches mid-band through atmospheric specificity (bioluminescent ferns, vaulted hall of parchment) but cannot enter higher bands without the setting pressuring a choice or charging the final image with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring truth to a society that forgot it—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The calligrapher's refusal of the council is summarized in one line with no on-page consequence, and every subsequent discovery (doorway, bottles, vent) rewards her immediately. No reversal narrows options; the map assembles smoothly, the conduit opens, the vent surges on cue. The ending provides spectacle (sky healed, vines singing) but no visible price paid or path foreclosed under any lens. One whispered truth fixes the toxic sky, collapsing stake into convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—candor restores worlds—emerges through recurring images (zinc plate glow, bottled speech, vent surge) rather than earned struggle. The piece commits to its premise but resolves into a thesis statement: "candor in small moments could restore whole worlds." The final scroll-opening meta-documents the triumph, severing reader distance. The map and plate function as thematic tokens rather than particulars that complicate the premise. A strong mid-band score for coherence and atmospheric resonance, but the ending's declarative summary ("a testament that even in a toxic world, candor can bloom") flattens subtext into moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated diction ("bruised, toxic sky," "gilded-leaf," "breathing misty sighs") and stable third-limited POV throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, and the piece avoids head-hopping. However, the register is uniformly lyric-descriptive without modulation under pressure—discovery beats carry the same cadence as reflection beats. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific (she notices beauty and metaphor equally whether assembling a map or stepping through a doorway). No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the final third (multiple moves compressed into single lines) fits the accumulative design but lacks the syntactic variety that would elevate rhythm control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and consistent ("wilted courtyard," "breathing misty sighs," "words settle in the air") without mixed metaphors, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workshop to archive to cavern to vent. Sentence openings vary adequately, preventing template monotony. However, several beats loop conceptually: "She believed... She felt... She realized... She understood" recur as stems that restate theme rather than advance pressure. The phrase "lost conversations" appears six times without meaningful variation. Information density is moderate—many lines do atmospheric work but few do double duty advancing both character and plot. No major artifacts obscure closure, capping deductions at mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligrapher + toxic-sky greenhouse + truth-detecting artifact + bottled conversations offers specificity, but the core premise—truth heals a broken world—follows a familiar moral-fantasy template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious calculus. The map-assembly and bottle-archive beats feel ornamental rather than inevitable; swap the map for another discovery device and the arc holds. The vent that responds to whispered truth is a convenient mechanism rather than a choice that reweights prior material. Atmospheric language is controlled and the piece commits fully to its premise, earning functional mid-band placement, but no risk-taking heightens stakes or surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The calligrapher is present throughout and makes procedural moves (retrieves map, pieces fragments, steps through doorway, whispers truth), but none of these choices create turns that alter tactics or narrow options. Her refusal of the council is told in summary; her decision to follow the map is unopposed. She observes and documents rather than deciding under conflicting pressures. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting two gates, but causal pressure and cost are absent—she is more vehicle than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in the opening workshop description, pulses green when she rereads map fragments (middle beat), trembles when she whispers in the cavern, and returns to "luminous green" in the closure paragraph. Handled across four beats with observable state changes (dull gray, soft green hue, trembling, luminous green) that confirm the candor mechanic. The plate enables no tactics and constrains no choice—it functions as indicator rather than tool. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff, but lacks the causal pressure or cost that would lift it above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Candor is named in the opening ("believed that candor in small moments could stitch..."), tested when she refuses the council (allowing the plate to gray), operationalized through rereading map fragments aloud (sparking green hue), and invoked at the vent ("whispered a simple truth"). It shapes her tactics—speak truthfully to activate the plate and vent—and anchors the thematic closure. Present in setup, middle action, and ending, meeting all three gates. However, candor never conflicts with another want or imposes visible cost; it is adopted without friction and rewarded immediately, limiting integration to functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plate "wilts near dishonesty" in the opening and turns "dull gray" when she refuses the council's loyalty proclamation, demonstrating the trait in action. The fading glow over dry-basin map sections suggests environmental grief tied to dishonesty. Present in setup and middle, but does not constrain a closure choice—by the ending, only truth is spoken, so the wilt-mechanic has no cost or trade-off. The attribute enables one on-page consequence (gray plate after refusal) but does not force a dilemma or tactic shift, capping score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rereading map fragments aloud is introduced in the middle section ("she would reread them aloud, letting the words settle") and triggers the zinc fragment's green pulse, signaling breakthrough. The act of rereading is named again when "each piece bore a line of calligraphy, and she would reread them aloud." However, the major turn—discovering the hidden doorway—follows immediately from alignment rather than from rereading itself, making the action contributory but not decisive. Present in development and linked to a turn, but easily swappable with another repetitive truth-act (e.g., copying, inscribing). Functional integration without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shredded treasure map is retrieved from beneath archive floorboards in the second beat, framing the entire middle sequence. Piecing the map guides her to the hidden doorway, the cavern, and finally the conduit/vent, anchoring three major location reveals. The map's final piece reveals the sky-conduit, and she places the whole map beside the plates at closure as a "reminder that truth, once pieced together, never wilts." Present in setup (retrieval), development (assembly and doorway discovery), and payoff (conduit reveal, final placement). The method is signaled early, mechanics matter across beats, and it shapes the ending image—strong integration across all three gates with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky are named in the opening line and return in the closure ("toxic sky's sting," "toxic clouds redirected," "the day the sky healed"). The setting provides atmosphere and the macro-problem (toxic sky) that the protagonist solves. However, the greenhouse itself does not constrain tactics—she moves freely from workshop to archive to cavern to vent without locked doors, resource limits, or spatial trade-offs. The "walls close like lungs" is a lyric moment without mechanical consequence. Present in setup and payoff with thematic charge, but lacks the micro-constraint or choice-pressure that would elevate above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the oasis dried" anchors the story in a post-collapse timeframe, establishing scarcity context (dry basin, cracked earth streets). The dried oasis appears again when map sections show "a dry basin" and the fragment's glow fades, linking past loss to present grief. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency, no trade-off between speed and care. The protagonist works "by dim light" and "that night" but time does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Present in setup and development as context, but does not function as a stake-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire "to find where lost conversations go" is named when she decides to piece the map together, motivates the journey through doorway and cavern, and is fulfilled when she discovers the bottled speech and realizes "lost conversations had not vanished; they were stored here, waiting." Present in setup (decision), development (journey), and payoff (discovery and realization). However, the motivation is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost to pursuing it, no moment where she must choose between finding conversations and another goal. Functional integration across all gates but lacks the friction or visible trade-off that would reach higher bands.</comment>
