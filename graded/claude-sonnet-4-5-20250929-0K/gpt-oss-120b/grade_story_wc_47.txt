<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to transform grief is signaled early, but her interior life remains abstract—"protected vulnerability" and "honeyed hush" function as thematic labels rather than embodied contradiction. The sister's viral confession is told rather than dramatized, so Lira's response lacks friction or visible cost in scene. Micro-choices (placing stones, touching the interface) exist but feel ornamental rather than pressure-tested; no competing impulse acts against her in the moment. The final smile is asserted satisfaction without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but *when* remains vague—"a month earlier" offers backstory without present temporal stakes. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent (drip pattern, moss growth, code rewriting), yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift narrows Lira's options; she moves through beats without resistance. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image (fireflies, pulse of data), but cost is never made legible on the page—her action succeeds without sacrifice, foreclosing nothing. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies for unclear temporal pressure; closure lacks felt cost under the Accumulative lens, preventing access to higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moss garden is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (emerald silence, cracked glass, honeyed scent) and constrains micro-setting through the drip pattern and dormant interface. However, the environment never pressures a difficult choice—Lira encounters no barriers, so the setting functions more as evocative backdrop than tactical constraint. The amber pendant and stones are handled on the page but their physical properties don't alter her approach. Strong description elevates the score, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto grief—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lira's actions (placing stones, proffering the pendant) succeed immediately without complication; the moss responds, the interface awakens, the garden transforms. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows her options; coincidence (finding the interface) enables rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break with felt cost, but the story offers serial additions without sacrifice. The final spread of word online is told in summary, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (transforming pain into gentle knowledge) emerges from the moss garden conceit and is reinforced by recurring images (honeyed hush, drip pattern, amber glow). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly—"every drip, every pendant, every proffered stone had stitched together a future where pain could rest in honeyed hush"—rather than trusting the image to carry it. The sister's viral confession remains abstract; Lira's reconciliation with it is asserted, not earned through on-page friction. The 9+ test (ending offers resonant, non-literal answer) is not met due to explicit moralizing in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans heavily on abstract constructions—"protected vulnerability," "honeyed hush," "verdant hush"—that float above concrete perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "seemed") cluster in emotional beats without voice-motivated purpose. The prose texture is lyric but uniform; urgency does not modulate syntax or rhythm. Dialogue is absent (no penalty applied). Perceptual signature is weak—Lira's way of noticing is generic observer rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" across paragraphs ("The wind whispered," "The pendant warmed," "The code unfurled," "The garden thrummed," "The story of that night"). Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "cathedral of rusted racks," "soft current," "cautious arms," "gentle lullabies," "luminous hush" all appear in high-pressure beats, muddling clarity. Synonym churn recycles "honeyed hush" and its variants without functional pressure. Scaffold appears in transition lines ("Guided by that scent," "Word of the transformation spread") that exist only to move the plot. Apply −1.4 for combined artifacts (template stems, figurative density, loops). The final third is touched, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—data center turned moss garden as site of grief transformation—offers a fresh visual but follows a familiar template: protagonist seeks healing in liminal space, nature reclaims technology, digital past becomes organic archive. The viral confession backstory and the "quiet hope versus loud confession" contrast are thematically obvious. Lira's journey lacks a non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived detail that would transform the template. The drip pattern and amber pendant function as symbolic conveniences introduced to serve thematic closure rather than arising from prior causality. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and labeled "watchful dreamer," but her choices are low-stakes and unopposed (kneeling, placing stones, proffering pendant). Observation dominates; the few decisions do not create turns or foreclose paths. The swappability cap (3.8) applies—another gentle, observant character could perform the same actions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The amber pendant appears in three beats: worn at the start, whispered to mid-story, proffered to the interface near the end, and echoed by fireflies at close. It is handled on the page and its glow "acts as a key," but its specific properties (amber versus another material) do not constrain Lira's options. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak (the whisper is ornamental). Score reaches mid-5s for multi-beat presence but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" recurs as a phrase (rhythm of breathing, scent, tone) but functions as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. It is never an on-page constraint or choice-driver. Present but ornamental; no causal pressure demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is mentioned once as a label ("Quietly proactive, she knelt") without demonstrating cost or constraint. The trait does not enable or foreclose an action; Lira's choices are unopposed. Label-only mention trends low; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Proffer" appears twice: she proffers stones into gaps (mid-story) and proffers the pendant to the interface (near end). The second use triggers the interface awakening, a key beat, but the action itself is generic—"offer" or "present" would serve identically. Setup and payoff gates met; beat involvement modest. Swappability friction (−0.6) limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The drip pattern is introduced early (cracked glass floor), guides Lira deeper (mid-story), and is echoed in the final spread ("each note a drip adding to the pattern"). Setup and closure gates met; middle development is weak (she follows it without constraint). The pattern's mechanics do not shape her attempts or impose cost. Lyric resonance (early seed to final reprise) lifts the score into mid-4s, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moss garden is vividly established, supplies resources (stones, interface, moss response), and frames all action. It appears in the setup, middle beats (moss unfurling, interface discovery), and ending (fireflies, living archive). The setting does not pressure a difficult choice—Lira encounters no barriers—but it charges the final image. Three-gate presence and closure linkage elevate the score; lack of tactical constraint prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" is mentioned once in backstory ("a month earlier") but does not tighten present decisions or tactics. No live clock shapes moves; time remains vague. The later online spread is told in summary. Setup gate missed (appears after 10%); no middle or closure participation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated early and reflected in Lira's actions (placing stones, rewriting code). However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between desire and cost, no competing want. The motivation labels the plot rather than creating pressure. Setup and middle gates met; closure participation is summary-only. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once and echoed in atmosphere ("she felt a protected vulnerability rise"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (quiet observation to luminous hush at close), but it remains a single static mood rather than charging under pressure. The phrase recurs in the final third ("a sigh of protected vulnerability"), reweighting the opening. Lyric resonance and closure linkage lift the score into mid-5s; lack of pressure modulation prevents higher bands.</comment>
