<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The navigator remains an abstract figure throughout—"eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps" is ornamental rather than enacted. No micro-choices under pressure appear; she records coordinates, builds an engine, and watches ships arrive, but we never see her hesitate, choose between competing goods, or pay a visible personal cost. Interiority consists of thematic statements ("she understood that reverse migration was not a folly") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile is asserted ("not with triumph but with the steady acceptance") without dramatized struggle to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: objects and images accrue around the concept of "geography of loss." Orientation is delayed—who the navigator is, why she is at this station, and what specific loss she maps remain unclear past the 120-word mark; apply −0.4. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (ships appear, confirming the reverse migration), but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no visible price paid by the navigator. The accumulation of moon phases, censer foot warmth, and ship lanterns charges the final image, but the protagonist's agency in the closure beat is observational only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is vividly rendered—cracked walls, flickering consoles, skeletal antennae—and the censer foot's patina bronze texture recurs with purpose. The setting does not constrain a choice: the navigator assembles her engine without spatial friction, and the arrival of ships happens to her rather than through negotiation with the environment. Sensory detail is vivid but largely static; the station hums and the sea breeze mingles with incense, yet these do not alter tactics or charge the closure beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping the geography of loss to enable reverse migration—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should come from density increase or pattern break; here the engine-building and nightly calls deepen the ritual but do not narrow options or force a trade-off. The ships' arrival is coincidental (they appear when the signal steadies) rather than driven by a navigator decision that forecloses a path. No visible cost: the navigator feels weight and warmth but does not lose, renounce, or endure anything on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—loss, return, and the necessity of mapping grief—emerges through particulars (censer foot, moon phases, copper coils). The final image of ships turning westward with lanterns flickering like patina offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, lines like "she understood that reverse migration was not a folly of longing but a necessity" and "the navigator smiled... with the steady acceptance of someone who has built a bridge from loss to hope" veer into thematic echo, stating the theme rather than letting the image do the work. The censer foot's hollow storing coordinates is a purposeful concrete detail that lifts the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the navigator. Perceptual signature is present—the censer foot "echoing the navigator's own restless rhythm," the sea "stole their names"—but diction occasionally slips into elevated abstractions ("geography of loss," "raw solace") that feel imposed rather than arising from the character's idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, but the lack of embodied micro-observation under pressure (we never see her hands tremble, her breath catch, her eyes narrow) flattens the texture. The phrase "raw solace" recurs as a label rather than an enacted state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "skeletal ribs," "eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps," "invisible rivers across the sky." In peak beats (the engine's completion, the ships' arrival), metaphor stacks without propulsion—"Each breath she drew was raw solace, a reminder that even broken machines and fractured maps could still point toward something worth returning to" paraphrases the theme rather than advancing action. Template cadence appears: "Each call painted... Each breath she drew... each line... each ring." Apply −0.8 for stacked figurative language and paraphrase loops in closure beats. No generation artifacts or grammar errors, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than add.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a patina bronze censer foot, lunar phases, and reverse migration as a map-making ritual offers conceptual originality. However, the emotional arc—lonely figure builds a beacon, mourners return—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The navigator has no blind spots, makes no mistakes, and encounters no friction; her project succeeds exactly as envisioned. The censer foot's moon-phase fluctuation and the cryptic phone calls are fresh particulars, but their integration is static rather than dynamic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is present throughout and frames the piece, but her choices are passive: she "noted," "began to assemble," "felt the weight," "lifted," "watched," "recorded." No decision alters tactics or narrows options. She appears in setup, middle, and ending (three gates), but the involvement is observational. Cap at 4.6 for missing causal pressure; lower to 3.2 for lack of any on-page choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot appears in setup (carried, described with moon-phase trait), middle (patina deepens each night, wired into the engine), and ending (lifted, scent mingles with breeze, coordinates recorded in its hollow). It shapes two distinct beats: the engine-building and the final ritual. Its fluctuation with moon phases ties to the engine's pulse, creating causal linkage. However, the censer foot does not constrain a choice—it enables without friction. Score 6.8 for three-gate presence, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage, but no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Reverse migration is named early and frames the concept, but it operates as theme rather than on-page stake. The navigator maps routes for others; we do not see a single person make the choice to return, pay the cost, or struggle with the reversal. The ships appear at the end, confirming the concept, but the mechanics of why they turn back and what they forfeit remain off-page. Setup and payoff present (two gates); cap at ~6.0 for lyric reprise, then lower to 4.1 for lack of middle development and no on-page choice shaped by the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The moon-phase fluctuation is described early (brighter on full moons, dimming on new moons) and recurs in the middle ("on a waning crescent it whispered softly, on a full moon it roared"). It colors the engine's operation but does not constrain a choice or impose cost—the navigator never waits for a moon phase, adjusts tactics because of it, or loses an opportunity when the moon is wrong. Setup and middle present (two gates); cap at ~6.0, lower to 3.8 for ornamental use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Build" drives the middle: the navigator assembles a lattice of wiring, radio tubes, and the censer foot to create a map-making engine. This action is signaled early ("the only way to build a new chart") and shown in the middle beat. However, the building itself is summarized—no on-page obstacle, mistake, or cost during assembly. The engine works immediately when completed. Setup and middle present (two gates); score 5.9 for one clear beat involvement and causal role, but capped by summary execution and missing closure participation (the building is complete before the ending beat).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight are signaled early ("through cryptic phone calls at midnight") and appear in the middle ("The station's outdated transmitter crackled at twelve, and a voice... answered with coordinates"). The method shapes one beat—coordinates arrive via calls—but the mechanics are vague (who calls? how does the navigator respond?) and the calls do not recur in the ending. Setup and middle present (two gates); score 4.3 for functional presence in one beat but lack of specificity and missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is named in the opening line, described throughout (humming antennae, cracked walls, outdated transmitter, flickering consoles), and returns in the ending ("the starlit signal station became a sanctuary"). It provides atmosphere and houses the action but does not constrain a choice—the navigator's work could occur in any similar location. Setup and payoff present (two gates); score 5.2 for framing presence and closure reprise, but no middle constraint or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" appears in the second sentence as a time anchor, but the failure itself does not shape the narrative. The thin air and flickering consoles are mentioned once and never constrain action or escalate pressure. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—nights pass in summary without urgency. Setup present but no middle or closure participation; cap at 4.6 for missing gates, lower to 2.6 for ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss" is stated early and recurs throughout ("she understood that reverse migration was not a folly of longing but a necessity to map the geography of loss"). The motivation frames the entire piece but is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the navigator torn between competing desires or paying a personal cost to pursue this goal. Setup and payoff present (two gates); score 5.8 for thematic consistency and framing presence, but lower for lack of friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is named explicitly twice ("The method was raw solace... Each breath she drew was raw solace") and the tone—elegiac, mournful yet hopeful—pervades the piece. However, the tone is static; it does not modulate under pressure or shift at the closure. The navigator's emotional state remains consistent from opening to ending. Setup and payoff present (two gates); score 4.9 for coherent tonal consistency but lack of modulation or charge in the final image beyond the established mood.</comment>
