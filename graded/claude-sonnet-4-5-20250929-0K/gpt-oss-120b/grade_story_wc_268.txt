<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The titan remains largely abstract throughout, defined by metaphor ("small enough to slip between towering scrolls yet radiating a presence that felt almost planetary") rather than embodied choice. No internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure appear; he simply follows the ink's guidance without friction. The spectral pretender arrives only to be dispatched in summary ("trembling as the rune's truth stripped away his borrowed sovereignty"), never forcing a decision that reveals the titan's values. The piece tells us he feels "quiet pride that was both grand and modest" without dramatizing what that costs him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed beyond 120 words—who the titan is, why he's been summoned, and what the oracle's role was remain vague until well into the piece. The drive lens reads as Causal, but key turns lack motivation: why does touching the crown trigger collapse, and how does the rune's flare unmask the pretender without the titan making a choice? The closure offers a Decisive Change (pretender fades, throne restored), but the cost is conceptual only—"treachery into dust"—without a visible price paid by the protagonist on the page. The ink pellet's mechanics (unveiling letters "not written by any hand") substitute mystery for clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is evoked through layered sensory detail ("scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse," "shelves seemed to melt into the walls") that charges atmosphere. The iron gall ink pellet and the cracked crown function as micro-setting elements that constrain the titan's path and trigger the climactic collapse. Spatial choreography remains stable, and the courtyard finale anchors the exit. The setting does not, however, force a tactical choice at closure—it reacts rather than resists—keeping it shy of the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early, but escalation occurs through discovery rather than protagonist agency—the ink guides, the rune flares, the temple collapses, all independent of the titan's decisions. Touching the crown triggers the climax, but the action feels coincidental rather than a weighed choice with alternatives. The resolution (pretender fades, throne restored) lacks visible cost to the titan; he tucks the crown away and walks off into twilight with "quiet pride" rather than forfeiting something on the page. One tightening (finding the pellet, following the map) narrows options, meeting minimum escalation for this length, but agency remains thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images—drift, collapse, borrowed sovereignty—but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "power taken by deceit would always crumble under the weight of truth." The rune of drift shifts meaning (mystery → truth-telling stain → calm pattern), offering a purposeful progression. The "graceful collapse" motif recurs with tonal coherence, charging the ending image of stones singing "a lament for the lost but also a promise of renewal." However, the explicit thesis statement and the tidy restoration (kingdom's rightful line) resolve complexity into a binary moral rather than inviting ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent high-fantasy register ("vaulted aisles," "faded glyphs," "trembling fingers"). Diction is elevated throughout, matching the setting, but the titan's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic noticing distinguishes his mind. Key moments lean on abstract metaphor ("presence that felt almost planetary," "power regally unpretentious") rather than concrete perception. The single line of dialogue ("the throne would belong only to one whose blood matches the original line") reads stiff and expository, telling rather than acting. Filter verbs cluster lightly ("felt," "seemed") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "a diminutive titan, small enough to slip between towering scrolls yet radiating a presence that felt almost planetary" stacks modifiers without advancing action. Paraphrase loops appear ("cracked crown" recurs three times in adjacent paragraphs; "graceful collapse" echoes four times). Template cadence runs dominate: "He found... He entered... He reached... He emerged... He tucked... He walked." Stock metaphors ("slow tide," "dying ember," "low hymn") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to melt," "felt almost planetary") dull the prose. The closure image ("turned treachery into dust and restored the kingdom's rightful line") summarizes rather than dramatizing the cost, and the final paragraph's sermon on power and truth replaces scene pressure with exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—small hero unmasks impostor via ancient library clue—follows a familiar quest template without fresh transformation. The "diminutive titan" contrasts size and power, but the oxymoron remains ornamental; his size never constrains a choice. The iron gall ink pellet as truth-serum is a specific detail, yet it resolves a problem (finding the pretender) it did not help create, arriving conveniently. The rune of drift and graceful collapse motifs offer thematic coherence but no synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The ending restores order tidily, avoiding risk or ambiguity. One inflection—library as collapsing witness—lifts atmosphere but doesn't alter the arc's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The diminutive titan is present throughout and pursues the goal, but his choices are reactive—he follows the ink's guidance without alternatives or friction. No moment shows him weighing competing goods or paying a visible cost for a decision. His "quiet pride" and declaration to the pretender's spectral form are asserted rather than earned through on-page choice. The trait "diminutive" contrasts with "titan" but never constrains action; he slips between scrolls once, then the size detail disappears. He is the POV and present at closure, meeting setup and payoff gates, but middle development lacks a choice-driven beat. Functional but replaceable as written.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in three beats: found in the bindery box, pressed onto vellum to reveal the map, and spent/cracked at the ending to "seal the truth into the stone." Early signal is strong (first third), and it enables the middle turn (unveiling the map). At closure it is present and transformed (cracked, essence spilled), reweighting its function from tool to seal. However, the pellet's properties are asserted—"soaked any parchment into a truth-telling stain"—rather than tested under pressure, and its mechanics remain vague. The titan does not choose to use it over an alternative; it simply works when pressed. Swapping for another magical revealer would require only minor edits. Strong recurrence and closure linkage, but middling causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rune of drift is seeded early ("sigil that shimmered like mist over water") and appears in three beats: oracle's clue, etched on the pellet, and pulsing beneath the crown at climax, where it flares to trigger collapse and unmask the pretender. At closure it "settled into a calm pattern," offering a clear before/after. However, the rune's mechanics are told, not tested—why does it reveal the pretender when the crown is touched, and what choice does the titan make in response? The concept shapes the quest's structure but does not constrain tactics; the titan simply follows the ink's map. Present across all three gates with thematic resonance, but causal pressure and cost are thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is assigned as a label in the opening paragraph ("wore his power regally unpretentious") but never dramatized through action or choice. No moment shows the titan balancing regal bearing with modesty under pressure, and the trait does not enable or constrain a decision. It appears once more implicitly in the closing ("quiet pride that was both grand and modest") as summary rather than scene work. Setup gate is met (first paragraph), but middle development and closure participation are absent. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sunder" drives the climax: the titan's touch on the crown triggers the rune's flare, and "a silent force began to sunder the very floor," causing cracks to spider and the ceiling to bow. The action is specific and irreplaceable—swapping for "break" or "split" would lose the formal, violent connotation that matches the temple's collapse. It redefines the situation (from discovery to escape) and is present in the closure unit (the collapsing temple frames the pretender's unmasking and the titan's exit). However, the action is triggered passively (he "brushed the metal") rather than chosen, and the cost is environmental rather than personal. Strong closure linkage and specificity, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through cryptic messages left in library books" is seeded when the ink unveils "a map of the library's forgotten alcoves, directing him through cryptic messages left in library books, each note a fragment of the pretender's deceit." The method appears once in the middle beat, enabling the titan to reach the vaulted chamber. However, the messages themselves are never shown or decoded on the page—the text summarizes "Following the ink's guidance, he entered..." Setup and middle gates are met, but the method is told rather than dramatized, and it does not shape closure. Swappable with any guiding mechanism. Functional but thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is present from the opening line and anchors all action across beats: the titan moves through vaulted aisles, finds the pellet in a cracked bindery box, enters the vaulted chamber where shelves "melt into the walls," and exits through the courtyard as the temple collapses. The setting supplies the ink pellet (hidden resource) and reacts to the climax (collapse), charging the final image with guardian spirits guiding the exit. Spatial choreography is clear, and the temple's "graceful collapse" reweights the closure. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure—it facilitates rather than resists. Strong presence across all gates, solid closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" is introduced in the fourth sentence as the duration of the titan's quest and reprised at closure: "the pause of shifting stars finally ending as the sky reclaimed its motion." The timeframe bookends the piece with lyric resonance but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics within the quest. No on-page moment shows the titan racing against the pause or making a trade-off because of it. Setup and payoff gates are met through the constellation imagery, but middle development is absent—the timeframe never constrains action. Thematic accent only, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To unmask a pretender to the throne" is stated explicitly in the opening ("summoned to unmask a pretender to the throne") and drives the quest structure: finding the ink pellet, following the map, reaching the crown, and confronting the spectral pretender. The motivation is consistent and present at closure when the titan declares the throne's rightful succession and walks away with the cracked crown as proof. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no moment shows the titan weighing personal cost, doubt, or competing wants. The quest unfolds as linear discovery rather than friction between motive and obstacle. Setup, middle (pellet and map beats), and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is moderate and cost is conceptual only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is woven throughout as both literal event (the temple's physical disintegration) and tonal motif. The phrase appears four times, modulating from "air heavy with the scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse" to "the ceiling bowed in a graceful collapse" at climax to the closing "stones sang a low hymn of graceful collapse, a lament for the lost but also a promise of renewal." The tone charges the final image, reweighting destruction as both mourning and rebirth. However, the repetition of the exact phrase risks becoming mechanical, and the tone does not modulate sharply with pressure—melancholy remains constant rather than escalating. Strong coherence and closure linkage, moderate pressure modulation.</comment>
