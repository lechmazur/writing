<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira remains abstract throughout—no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulses under pressure, only declarative interiority ("felt the brittle awakenings," "understood") that reads like summary rather than dramatized choice. The sky-whale is ornamental texture, not a second character applying pressure. Motivation is asserted ("to translate isolation into independence") but never tested by a concrete trade-off or micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final "smile" and "ready to write" are unearned epiphanies without visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No identifiable closure unit: the ending offers atmosphere and declarative summary ("her independence forged from isolation") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with cost, or conceptual repricing. The piece drifts through a series of actions (placing the sundial, climbing, placing it again) without a meaningful narrowing of options or a felt price—Mira begins alone and ends alone, declaring victory without on-page transformation. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Mira is, what the library's agency means) and never clarified. The lens remains ambiguous: neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern payoff, nor situational crystallization is legible at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vivid imagery ("tide of clouds," "shelves floated like kelp," "sea of ink") remains postcard description without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The brass sundial is handled repeatedly but its "atomically reflective surface" never blocks or enables an action with cost. Spatial choreography is vague—Mira "walks," "steps," "places" without clear before/after positioning or distance tracking. No environmental detail pressures the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("translate isolation into independence") is declared but never tested by a reversal, trade-off, or tightening that narrows options. No credible obstacle appears: Mira performs a ritual (placing the sundial), the library "sings," and the goal is announced as achieved without visible cost or foreclosed path. The sky-whale's "coexistence" is atmospheric rather than a source of friction. Escalation is absent; the piece moves through a sequence of images without pressure rising or a decision altering tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The theme of "isolation → independence" and "coexistence" is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("translate her isolation into independence," "brittle awakenings were not failures but delicate beginnings") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The brass sundial and sky-whale recur but do not shift meaning at the end—they remain symbolic placeholders. The final vow ("whispered a vow to translate her isolation into independence") is sermonic rather than a resonant answer earned by prior events. No conceptual cost is legible; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction oscillates between lyric specificity ("translucent ribs forming arches") and elevated abstraction ("delicate beginnings of new consciousness," "bridge between extinction and living") that exceeds the POV's grounded lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic—Mira "feels," "understands," "records" without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in peak beats without embodied anchoring, flattening immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "translate isolation into independence" appears three times; "brittle awakenings" five times without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs through the final third ("Mira placed… She felt… She stepped… She whispered…"). Stock metaphors ("tide of clouds," "sea of ink") lack fresh collision. Mixed register: "atomically reflective" clashes with lyric tone. The scaffold visible in repetitive stems and synonym churn ("hum," "vibration," "pulse," "resonance") dulls the closure image. Figurative density in most sentences creates overwriting without pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise (lone researcher in cloud library communes with extinct creature) reads as a familiar fantasy template. The "atomically reflective sundial" and "stone circle's hum" are genre tokens without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (isolation → communal song) could swap names and setting without loss. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice; the piece hedges toward atmospheric safety rather than forcing a difficult trade-off or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Mira is labeled "a contemporary of the extinct sky-whale" but this is ornamental backstory; her choices (placing the sundial, climbing, whispering a vow) do not trace to that identity. The sky-whale itself is passive atmosphere, not a decision node. Present by setup but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in at least four beats (carried, placed at center, glowing, placed on edge at summit) but its handling is descriptive rather than causal—it does not narrow options or enable a tactic under pressure. The "atomically reflective surface" is mentioned repeatedly yet never constrains a choice. Closure participation is cameo (glowing brighter in approval) rather than active transformation. Early signal and recurrence meet two gates, but causal pressure and cost linkage are absent, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" is invoked five times as thematic label ("brittle awakenings of each page," "delicate beginnings of new consciousness") but never shapes a stake or alters tactics on the page. No cost or friction is tied to the concept; it remains echo rather than driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" is applied to the sundial in six mentions but functions as decoration—light fragments are caught, glyphs reflect, photons shimmer—without enabling or constraining a single action with cost. The trait is ornamental; a mirror or polished surface would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Coexist" is declared as goal and outcome ("learning to coexist," "Together they began to coexist," "a reminder to coexist") but no turn or reversal traces to this action. Mira and the sky-whale's ghost are juxtaposed without friction; coexistence is achieved by assertion rather than a choice that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "hum of an ancient stone circle" is signaled early ("stone circle that hummed beneath the clouds") and recurs throughout, but its mechanics remain vague—vibrations "awaken dormant scripts" and "resonate through the world" without specifying how this constrains or enables Mira's ritual. The method is atmospheric rather than a tactical tool; its presence does not shape attempts or costs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The "tidal library above clouds" is vividly described (shelves floating like kelp, marble arches, vaulted sky) and frames all action, meeting setup and development gates. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Mira moves freely through it without constraint. Closure participation is weak (the library "breathes" in metaphor). Lyric presence without causal work places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" appears once as a temporal marker mid-story ("It was after the reincarnation memory, a moment when past lives flickered into present awareness, that the library finally sang") but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Time itself is vague and untracked; no clock or deadline alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated as Mira's goal in the opening third and repeated verbatim twice more, meeting setup and weak development (the library's awakening is framed as progress toward this aim). However, the desire is never dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible friction between wants and costs—Mira achieves the goal by ritual completion without trade-off. Closure participation is declarative ("her independence forged from isolation, ready to write") rather than earned through cost.</comment>
