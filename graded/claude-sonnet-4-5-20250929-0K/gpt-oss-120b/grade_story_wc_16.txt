<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a fixed abstraction; her "carefully reckless" trait is stated but never tested through a concrete choice where caution and recklessness pull her in opposite directions. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("cautious exuberance of a child discovering a secret garden") rather than embodied perception. The shadow-scholars who emerge at the end feel like convenient props rather than pressure points, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but no on-page closure with felt cost is legible. The transcription succeeds smoothly without a reversal or trade-off; the archive "breathes," scholars nod, and Elara accepts the next task, but no option is foreclosed and no cost paid. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (layered glyphs) and Causal (restoration quest), yet neither delivers a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The archive's stone walls, vellum pages, and glass ink well are described with sensory care, and the setting's acoustic properties (vibrations, echoes) thread through the action. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains a vivid backdrop rather than a tactical actor. The "micro-setting" test (body, tool, recurring object charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no opposition, resource limit, or internal conflict; each glyph releases its secret on cue. The "timeframe: before paths diverge" creates no ticking clock, and the transcription's success feels inevitable rather than earned through a tightening choice or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The covenant/broken-trust motif recurs and the final pledge ("no silence would ever again eclipse these pages") attempts thematic closure, yet the promise arrives as assertion rather than earned insight. The symphonies-of-truth concept remains metaphorical decoration; no particular reveals a non-literal answer to the central question. Thematic resonance is diluted by direct statement in the final beats rather than emergent from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a lyric register throughout. Diction leans elevated ("arcane linguist," "vaulted extinct language archive") but stays consistent; no head-hopping occurs. However, psychic distance never modulates with pressure, and the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Elara notices in the same poetic cadence whether tracing glyphs or watching scholars emerge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "silence that had settled…was a breach" / "broken trust" restates the same idea across adjacent lines; "promise" recurs as both noun and verb without added pressure. Template stems ("She [verb], and the [object] [verb]") create rhythmic monotony. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (ink "sang," knot "unwound," droplets "formed a symphony") blurs rather than sharpens causality, triggering overwriting penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The arcane-linguist-restores-lost-language premise maps closely to a common template, and the piece does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived consequence. The glass ink well and singing glyphs feel ornamental rather than causally irreplaceable. No turn or intensification grows from prior particulars in a non-obvious way; the success arc is linear and predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns; she observes, transcribes, and accepts the next task without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Late-paragraph appearance of the fresh vellum offer is the closest to a choice, but it is accepted off-page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in the opening, is dipped into vellum, sings louder mid-story, and closes as "a beacon for future seekers." Three beats satisfy setup, development, and closure participation, but the object's function is static description rather than causal pressure; any enchanted tool could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" frames expectation in the opening third and recurs in the final image ("soft symphony swelled"), but the concept remains metaphorical flourish. It does not change options on the page or constrain tactics; the transcription succeeds whether or not the ink "sings."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is labeled in paragraph one ("felt carefully reckless") and echoed as "cautious exuberance" near the end, but no on-page action demonstrates the tension between caution and recklessness. The trait exists as description without enabling or constraining a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Unsnarling appears as a method label in the opening and is enacted when Elara invites the storm-knot to release. One mid-beat use satisfies functional presence, but the action is swappable with "decode" or "interpret" without structural loss; it does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" is stated as her method early ("decode via interconnected promises") and enacted when each glyph links to the next. Setup and development are present, but the mechanics are told rather than tested under pressure, and the method could be replaced with "via empathy" or "via resonance" without altering the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive provides sensory texture (dust, stone walls, parchments) and spatial coherence (alcoves, corridors). It frames the quest and supplies the vellum at the end, satisfying setup and closure presence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that changes tactics; it remains scenic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" appears once in the opening as urgency framing ("Time pressed, for before paths diverge she must finish"), but no on-page clock tightens decisions. The transcription proceeds without temporal cost or deadline pressure, and the timeframe is not revisited at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"To restore trust after silence" is signaled in the opening and articulated mid-story ("by unsnarl-ing the glyphs…she was weaving the broken threads back together"). The motivation frames the quest but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice where cost competes with desire; the restoration succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is labeled twice (opening: "felt carefully reckless"; mid-story: "cautious exuberance of a child") and the final paragraph pairs "careful balance of exhilaration and duty." Tone is asserted but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it remains a static descriptive overlay.</comment>
