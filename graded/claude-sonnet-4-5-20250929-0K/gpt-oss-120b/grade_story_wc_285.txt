<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Arlen's interiority is abstract and elevated rather than embodied—"distill the complexity of the river's memory" reads like thesis statement, not lived thought. The yarn needle returns but never constrains a choice with visible cost; his "invisible stitching" and percolation metaphors remain decorative. No genuine internal conflict appears; he moves through contemplation to resolution without contradiction or struggle. The final "smile" and light heart arrive unearned by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the opening lines. The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: fog, needle, ticking, and reflection layer toward a quiet resonance. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Arlen waits, listens, the fog lifts, he leaves. The "promise" mentioned early is never tested or paid in visible cost; the closure image (smooth river, finished stitch) asserts resolution without dramatized consequence. Cost remains conceptual and unevidenced on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is vividly rendered with tactile detail (spindrift, wet stone, muddy path). Sensory selection is consistent and POV-filtered through Arlen's contemplative stance. The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The rain-gutter ticking provides temporal texture but does not pressure decision. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to distill the complexity of the river's memory"—remains abstract and untested. No opposition, reversal, or tightening appears; Arlen performs a metaphorical ritual (invisible stitching, listening) and the world complies without friction. The rain gutters stop, fog lifts, and resolution arrives by atmospheric coincidence rather than protagonist agency. No visible cost forecloses a path or alters later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The palimpsest motif (layering, erasure, stitch) recurs and charges the prose texture. Theme emerges from image rather than statement: memory as rewriting, promise as layered commitment. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt moralizing—"to distill complexity into essence was not to erase, but to honor each layer"—stating rather than trusting the image. The river-as-promise metaphor is thoughtful but not tested by choice or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Arlen; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, often slipping into unmotivated poeticism ("spindrift serenity," "percolate through awareness"). Psychic distance stays consistent but the narrative voice reads decorative rather than character-specific—Arlen's perceptual signature is generic contemplation. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm supports the meditative tone but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: "spindrift serenity" appears four times, "palimpsest" three times, "closely attentive" twice, "percolate" twice—all within 600 words, creating synonym churn and template cadence. Mixed metaphors abound: "fog curled like spindrift" (spindrift is sea-spray, not fog), "thoughts percolate into mist" (percolation is filtration, not dissolution). Paragraph-level loops restate the same contemplative stance without adding pressure. Register drifts into elevated diction ("ambient awareness," "distill complexity") incongruent with a coachman's likely lexicon. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("spindrift serenity… percolated through his awareness" in the final third), triggering disallow-9+ and −1.2 penalty in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The palimpsest-as-river and yarn-needle-as-ritual-tool offer modest freshness, but the coachman-mystic performing invisible stitches to commune with a river reads as whimsical allegory rather than grounded necessity. No risk or bold choice elevates stakes; the piece settles into safe lyricism. The core frame (contemplative figure awaits atmospheric signal, departs enlightened) is a familiar meditative template. Transformation test: swap river for forest, needle for talisman, and the arc survives intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Arlen is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or narrows options. He waits, listens, imagines stitching, then departs. Observation without decision. Present in setup and ending but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The yarn needle appears in paragraph one (setup), is lifted and felt in paragraph ten (middle), and slipped back into coat near the end. It returns with claimed reweighted meaning ("pulse in his palm"), but never constrains a choice or enables an action with cost—it remains a passive talisman. Two-beat presence with lyric reprise, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Palimpsest promise" is named in paragraph one and echoed thematically ("layering hope over old regret," river rewrites surface, final stitch). It never shapes an on-page choice or tactic—remains thematic label. Present in setup and ending as metaphor, not as driver of stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" appears twice as a phrase; Arlen's listening and observation are described but never constrain or enable a choice with cost. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Percolate" appears twice as metaphor ("percolate through every breath," "thoughts percolate into the mist"). No major turn traces to this action; easily swappable with "dissolve" or "seep." Ornamental verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is named once in paragraph six; Arlen listens to water and rain gutters. The method is signaled but its mechanics do not shape a choice or attempt—he simply waits. Present in middle but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is established early and pervades the text. It supplies atmospheric texture and the rain-gutter timeframe, and the lifted fog signals the ending shift. Does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, but its changing state (fog lifts, surface smooths) charges the final image. Setup, middle presence, closure participation via transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Rain-gutter ticking is introduced in paragraph six, mentioned again in fifteen and twenty-five ("final tick slipped away," "ticking ceased"). It marks time but does not tighten a decision or alter Arlen's moves—he waits passively until it stops. Present in middle and ending, but no causal pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To distill complexity into essence" is stated in paragraph five and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("to distill complexity… was not to erase"). Never dramatized as conflicted desire facing cost—told-only motivation without friction. Present in setup and ending as theme claim, not choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" appears four times, cohering tone across the piece. The tone remains static meditative throughout; no modulation under pressure since no pressure appears. Present in setup, middle, and ending, lending unity but not dynamic charge. Coherent but unchanging mood.</comment>
