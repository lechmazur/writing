<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alder's motivation is declared but remains abstract throughout—his drive "to reclaim the light stolen by midnight" never translates into embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The repair work proceeds without visible struggle, competence never tested by meaningful failure. Interiority consists of generic gestures ("felt the weight of centuries," "heart humming") rather than character-specific perception. The final choice to guard the chamber is not earned by prior causality; no path is foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images, rust-as-garden motif), but the closure lacks visible cost or reconfiguration—Alder simply succeeds, the village sleeps peacefully, and the final image (music box playing on its own) adds whimsy without reweighting prior material. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the resonance chamber sequence is purely procedural: chip placed, gear aligned, problem solved. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the covenant's threat dissolves without on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with brass tones, rusted rivets, and amber luminescence, and the "rust as iron vines" image is distinctive. However, the environment does not constrain Alder's choices—he enters, works, and succeeds without spatial friction. The chamber's sensory detail remains decorative rather than tactical; no tool or recurring object alters his approach. Micro-setting criteria not met for 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (silencing the sorrowful note) is signaled early but never escalates. Alder's repair proceeds without reversals, failed attempts, or visible trade-offs. The covenant's threat to "wilt near dishonesty" is told but never tested on the page. Agency is procedural rather than decision-driven; the central gear "clicks into place" without cost or friction. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option or forces a choice that reweights tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The covenant-of-rust motif and the light/midnight binary gesture toward theme (truthful metal, reclaimed light), but the story does not earn a non-literal answer through specific struggle. The final image—music box playing, Alder promising to guard the chamber—states the moral rather than enacting it. "Tinkersong wonder" and "hopeful tune" tell rather than resonate. Subtext is minimal; all thematic weight is declared in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and carries a fairy-tale register ("legend whispered," "tinkersong wonder"), but lacks perceptual signature—Alder's way of noticing is generic rather than repairman-specific. Diction is elevated throughout without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Distance remains stable, and POV is clean, but the prose does not reflect Alder's interior state or professional lens; vocabulary and rhythm feel externally imposed rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "the covenant wilts near dishonesty" restated multiple times; "tinkersong wonder" appears thrice without reweighting. Template cadence runs cluster in the repair sequence ("He placed… whispering… He circled… gently aligning… humming"). Filter verbs stack without voice motivation. Figurative language ("rust behaved like a garden of iron vines," "luminous lattice") decorates rather than clarifies. Deduct −0.8 in Q7 for patterned artifacts; no 9+ allowed globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The music-box-repairman-as-healer premise combines familiar elements without a fresh angle. The rust covenant and philosopher's stone chip read as ornamental fantasy tokens rather than irreplaceable story logic. The emotional arc (summoned, repairs, succeeds, promises to guard) follows a generic quest template without transformation. No turn or reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight; the resolution could swap in any craftsperson with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Alder is present throughout but his choices are procedural rather than decisive. Placing the chip and aligning the gear are described actions, not turns that alter tactics or stakes. He recalls the method, hums a lullaby, and succeeds without friction. No on-page decision narrows options or incurs cost. Swappable with any competent craftsperson.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's stone chip appears in three beats: commission briefing, placement on the gear, and return to the satchel. Early setup (~15% mark) and closure reprise present. However, its function is static—it glows, threads silver, and mends—without evolving use or visible cost tied to its properties. The chip enables success but does not constrain choice or force a trade-off. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is named early and recurs as a thematic label ("the covenant was listening," "the covenant would endure"), but it does not shape on-page tactics. The threat that dishonesty causes wilting is told, never tested. The covenant's mechanics remain abstract; Alder's repair does not grapple with its rules. Present as atmosphere, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is declared twice but never constrains an on-page action. No moment tests whether Alder must lie, conceal, or speak truth under pressure. The attribute exists as exposition without visible cost or tactical impact. Label-only mention; no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tether" is named in the incantation ("tether the errant vibrations back into harmony") and enacted when the gear emits a soft sigh and the pulse ripples outward, knitting seams. Setup and payoff present. However, the action is procedural rather than transformative—easily swappable with "bind," "anchor," or "restore." The tethering does not redefine Alder's options or incur cost. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is seeded early ("the ancient method taught to his forebears") and guides Alder's approach ("coaxing broken iron to remember its original song"). Appears in two beats: recall and application. The method shapes his repair philosophy but does not alter tactics under pressure or force a visible trade-off. Present as thematic texture, not causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is established early, provides vivid sensory anchors (brass tones, rusted rivets, luminescence), and hosts all key beats. The chamber's air and walls pressure Alder's attention and set the repair's urgency. However, the setting does not constrain his choices—no spatial obstacle or resource scarcity alters his approach. The chamber frames rather than drives; micro-setting test not fully met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In the balance" and the midnight deadline are declared but never tighten Alder's decisions on the page. The chamber's fate is said to be balanced; midnight "had already begun to steal the last stray glimmers," yet Alder works without time pressure or consequence for delay. The timeframe is ornamental rather than tactical. No live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is stated once midway through and again at the end, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice. Alder's desire remains abstract; no on-page friction between want and cost emerges. The motivation is told rather than enacted under pressure. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named three times and carries a consistent fairy-tale register throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—warmth when the chamber brightens, gentle closure with the music box playing. However, the tone does not charge the final image with felt cost or pressure; it remains a static aesthetic choice. Functional but does not reweight prior material at closure.</comment>
