<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marin's motivation to defeat numbness is declared but her interior contradictions are thin—she observes effects but makes few live choices under competing impulses. The turn from setting the needle to rewinding songs shows agency, yet the entire arc feels narrated from outside; we see the frost melt rather than experiencing her struggle with it. Embodied emotion is sparse: "smiled, a quiet celebration" and "felt the emotional numbness dissolve" label states without concrete sensory particulars. The final choice lacks visible cost; the phonograph functions as a magic key rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: Marin; where: cavern; when: vague seasonal frame) arrive early enough. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mood, image, and metaphor build until the final mirrored-hush moment. However, the closure unit—Marin rewinds the needle, songs play forward, numbness dissolves—lacks a visible felt cost on the page; the "key" metaphor suggests resolution without sacrifice. The middle deepening (backward songs → forward songs) narrows options slightly but reads more like a procedural unlock than a consequence-laden turn. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what Marin loses or forecloses by her action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cavern is vivid and sensory ("throat of stone," "thick, damp air," "petrified drum skin"), and the broken needle anchors tactile presence. The turntable and wax shells constrain Marin's method, shaping how she engages silence. However, spatial choreography is thin—Marin moves from entry to turntable without intervening geography—and the cavern's details recur mostly as atmosphere rather than complicating her choices. The body and tool (needle, palm on stone) do charge the final image, qualifying for the 9+ gate, but the setting itself remains a backdrop more than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled in the opening third. The escalation (placing needle → backward songs felt → rewind to forward songs → numbness dissolves) tightens once, meeting the one-meaningful-turn standard. Yet the turn feels procedural: Marin executes a remembered technique without visible trade-off or risk. No option is foreclosed, no credible loss appears; the drum maker's warning ("only when the silence is mirrored") is fulfilled as instruction, not dramatized constraint. The forward-song pressure "pressed against the filament" describes sensation but lacks a causal consequence that narrows Marin's next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as mirror, feeling through negation—emerges from image and action rather than assertion. The filament-of-hush metaphor recurs and shifts meaning (threat → glow → ribbon of light), and the final observation that "the heart can still compose a symphony of feeling" grows from the cavern work. However, the ending leans close to thematic summary: "emotional numbness can always be rewound and healed" states the premise rather than letting the image speak. The mirrored-hush concept charges the closure but never acquires non-literal ambiguity; it remains a one-to-one symbol. Subtext is thin in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single close-third POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic ("yawned like a throat of stone," "ribbons," "marrow"), matching a lyric mode, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("the heart can still compose a symphony"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Marin notices vibrations and textures without character-specific idiom or bias. The voice modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and filter verbs are rare. Purposeful compression in the lyric frame is legible, though some phrases ("filament of hush") repeat without evolving meaning mid-text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, the piece suffers from synonym churn and paraphrase loops: "audibly muted, not because sound could not exist, but because every vibration was swallowed" restates the same idea; "mirrored hush" appears five times with minimal functional variation; "filament of hush" recurs as both noun and metaphor without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The music was not heard but felt... The cavern's air shifted... The cavern, once a tomb..." Stock metaphors cluster ("frost," "sunrise," "ghostly drumheads"). These artifacts dull the closure image slightly. Baseline −0.8 in Q7 for loops and churn; no causality break, so penalty stays here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—deaf teacher uses reversed phonograph songs to mirror and heal numbness—offers a fresh sensory angle. However, the emotional arc (numbness → felt vibration → healing) follows a template recovery plot without transformation. The cavern, drum maker, and wax shells provide texture but remain illustrative; swapping them for another sensory metaphor would leave the arc intact. The "backward songs" mechanic is introduced as backstory rather than discovered through struggle, reducing ingenuity. The mirrored-hush image is evocative but leans on symbolic convenience—it glows when needed without prior cost. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric mode but hedges with explanatory summary in the final third.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marin is introduced early and her goal (defeat numbness) frames the arc. She executes two actions: placing the needle and rewinding it. However, these are procedural moves executing a known technique rather than live choices under competing pressure. Her deafness is mentioned but does not constrain or enable a key decision with visible cost—she feels vibrations, which any character could. Setup and closure gates met; development gate weak. Swappable with another archetype. Cap 4.6 for missing mid-scene constraint; strong closure linkage lifts slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken needle appears in beat one (carried in vellum), beat two (placed on turntable), and beat three (rewound to play forward songs). Its "splintered" state and tip are noted but do not impose a mechanical constraint—it works despite being broken. Setup, development, and closure gates met. Two distinct beats +0.9; closure linkage +0.8; but the needle is functionally swappable with any music-playing device, reducing irreplaceability. No visible cost tied to the needle itself; Marin does not struggle with its brokenness. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "filament of hush" is mentioned eight times but functions as atmosphere and metaphor, not a constraint on Marin's choices. It "glows" and "brightens" in response to her actions but does not shape her tactics or force a trade-off. Setup early, present at closure, but development gate missing—no middle beat where the filament enables or blocks a decision. Ornamental use −0.7; label-only mentions −0.3. Present and thematically coherent but replaceable with "silence" or "quiet" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the cavern's atmosphere in beat one and recurs as theme ("the world is audibly muted"). It does not constrain Marin's action—she feels vibrations regardless. Label-only trait; no visible tradeoff. Setup met, development and closure gates missing. Swappable with "silent" or "soundless." Ornamental −0.6; late functional absence −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears twice: "reversed melodies to enthrall her senses" and "visitors...would hear...a gentle pull that would enthrall their own hearts." In both uses it describes an effect rather than driving a choice. The reversed melodies do enable the mirrored-hush moment, giving one beat of causal involvement, but the action itself (being enthralled) is passive observation. Setup met, one beat +0.4, closure linkage weak. Swappable with "engage" or "captivate." Mid-band for one-beat function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are seeded early (backstory: "the needle had once traced backward recorded songs") and used twice: played backward to create mirrored hush, then rewound to play forward to confront silence. Setup, development (backward songs felt as vibration), and closure (forward songs burst, dissolving numbness) gates met. Two beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.0. However, the mechanic is told in backstory rather than discovered on the page, and the reversal is procedural—Marin follows instructions rather than experimenting under pressure. Specificity moderate; cost indirect. Mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is introduced in the opening line, provides the turntable and wax shells, and hosts all action. Setup and closure gates met. The "thick, damp air" swallows vibration, shaping Marin's need to coax silence into a felt shape—one development constraint. One beat +0.4; closure linkage +0.7; causal pressure +0.6. However, spatial detail is thin (no choreography of movement within the cavern), and the setting could be swapped for another resonant chamber without breaking logic. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as atmospheric framing. It does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or create urgency. The main action occurs in a single visit; seasonal return is mentioned as future iteration, not on-page pressure. Setup missing (no signal before final third), development missing, closure participation ornamental. Late intro −0.8; no causal pressure −1.0. Present but non-functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marin's motivation—to defeat emotional numbness—is declared in the opening third and frames every beat: entering the cavern, placing the needle, rewinding songs, feeling numbness dissolve. Setup, development (felt vibrations erosion of frost), and closure gates met. Two beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.2. However, the friction between want and cost is thin—no competing desire, no visible sacrifice. The motivation drives structure but lacks embodied conflict or trade-off on the page. Strong setup and closure, weak dramatized friction. Upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears as concept (drum maker's warning, "only when the silence is mirrored"), description of the cavern state, and final-image charge ("thrummed with a mirrored hush"). Tone is coherent—hushed, lyric, resonant—and modulates slightly as pressure builds. Setup early, closure strong. However, the tone remains static through the middle; no sharp shift or break that reweights stakes. Coherent and purposeful but not dynamic. Closure linkage +1.0; causal pressure +0.5; static middle −0.4. Mid 5s.</comment>
