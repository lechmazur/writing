<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains a device rather than a character with agency; no choices, only ritualized action. Interiority consists entirely of label-emotion ("haunted euphoria," "reverence") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The "gently thorough" trait is mentioned but never constrains a decision or creates visible cost. Motivation is declared ("preserve the weight of small moments") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or stakes that force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit: the archivist begins writing, continues writing, and promises to return—a static loop with no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or reconfigured stance. The "regenerated covenant" is asserted repeatedly but never tested or altered by events; no beat narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation is present (who/where/when anchored early), preventing the test penalty, but causality is absent: the locket, ledger, and lighthouse pact are described, not dramatized, and no because/therefore linkage drives the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (violet/amber light, jasmine scent, crimson/white flowers), and spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting remains decorative: no environmental feature constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters the archivist's action. The locket and ledger are handled but do not interact with the jetty's physical features to shape outcome, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("preserve small moments," "renew the covenant") but never tested on the page; no opposition, resource limit, or ticking consequence forces a choice. The archivist encounters no reversal, complication, or cost—he arrives, writes, and departs in a frictionless arc. Pressure does not escalate under any lens; the final beat mirrors the opening without tightening or reweighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("preservation of small moments") is stated outright in multiple lines rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The locket-child-lighthouse-fisherman chain is told, not enacted, so the conceptual weight rests on assertion. The final image repeats prior gestures (lifting quill, feeling metal pulse) without a non-literal answer or reweighting; no earned insight or resonant ambiguity lands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (walnut-ink, sepia, violet-amber palette) and diction remains elevated throughout. However, register uniformity flattens pressure: "haunted euphoria," "regenerated covenant," and "proximate causes" recur as incantations without modulation. No dialogue. Psychic distance does not shift with scene stakes, and the prose reads as committee lyricism rather than a character-specific filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate; "haunted euphoria" appears five times, "regenerated covenant" six, "gently thorough" twice, "proximate causes" thrice—synonym churn without fresh information. Mixed metaphors: ink "soaking into parchment as if the paper itself were a tide" contradicts "pages turning with a sigh that seemed to echo the covenant's own breathing." Register drift into pseudo-philosophical abstraction ("proximate causes," "context changes") clashes with the archivist's embodied moment. Artifacts pervade the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 and 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (preserving memory via physical artifact and ritual writing) is familiar; no transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The locket-lighthouse-fisherman link is told in summary without grounding particulars. "Haunted euphoria" and "proximate causes" read as prompt tokens rather than earned synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges in lyricism without dramatized stakes.</comment>
