<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aric is present throughout and his "grim optimist" stance is stated, but his choices are largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene. Interior contradiction is absent—he moves smoothly from obsession to incorporation of failure without visible emotional cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and the phrase "a cage and a key, bound and free at once" read as stock philosophizing rather than embodied struggle. Motivation is declared ("to capture the texture of a missed opportunity") but not tested by on-page pressure that forces a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches its pattern clearly—equations, bronze contraption, and dice mechanics are summarized rather than shown affecting tactics. Orientation is vague: "At its base" and "the eighth landing" anchor space weakly, and no temporal frame is established. The ending offers a micro turn (chipped side lands face-up) but the cost is asserted ("a faint scar turned triumph") rather than made legible through prior sacrifice or foreclosed option. The staircase "quivering" and "singing" read as metaphor without causal consequence, so the closure effect (Conceptual Repricing or Resonant Reconfiguration) lacks the on-page felt or visible cost required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is named and visually sketched (marble arches, stone risers, polished glass disc), but spatial choreography remains abstract—Aric teleports from "the base" to "the eighth landing" to "the twentieth landing" without transitions or micro-setting detail that constrains choice. The bronze contraption and rotating disc are described but never handled or adjusted on the page in a way that alters his tactics. The setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible; removing the staircase and replacing it with any other "endless" structure would not break the story's internal logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("perpetual motion" and "capturing the texture of a missed opportunity") is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or resource scarcity. No reversal narrows options—the dice "stubbornly refused" until they don't, without cost or agency driving the shift. The "rupture" and "quivering" are told effects rather than earned escalation; Aric's "balancedly daring approach" is labeled but not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path. The piece reads as a series of assertions about a quest rather than pressure accumulating toward a decisive tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of "boundless confinement" and the dialectic of chance/certainty emerges through recurring images (staircase, dice, equations), but the final image offers thematic echo rather than earned resonance—"both a cage and a key, bound and free at once" restates the premise without reweighting it through prior cost. The chipped die landing face-up is told as triumph without prior sacrifice that charges the moment. Subtext is thin; the narrative voice explicates rather than implies ("a reminder that some missed chances refuse to be reclaimed"). The piece invites reflection on the concept but does not deliver a non-literal answer earned by on-page particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs, but perceptual signature is generic—phrases like "a silent promise," "a whisper of kinetic potential," and "a quiet anthem" could describe any philosophical quest. Diction drifts into elevated register ("rupture the confines," "lattice of probability," "algorithmic") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The prose carries a consistent rhythm but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would distinguish Aric's mind under pressure. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He realized," "He felt") appear frequently, dulling immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "boundless confinement" recurs without reweighting, "balancedly daring" is restated as "half mathematician, half poet," and "perpetual motion" appears in multiple near-identical phrasings. Template cadence runs through the middle: "The staircase responded... Soon the whole structure quivered... Aric felt the boundless confinement lift..." uses parallel stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("wounded star," "living algorithm," "quiet anthem") stack without fresh vehicle. Information density is low—many sentences restate the quest's premise rather than advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("the staircase sang a quiet anthem"), so the −1.7 floor applies and 9+ is disallowed globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (proving perpetual motion via dice and equations on an infinite staircase) is conceptually bold but executed through summary and stock language rather than specific, grounded choices. The "grim optimist" archetype, "missed opportunity" motivation, and the reconciliation of flaw-as-stabilizer read as familiar philosophical moves without fresh synthesis. The chipped die landing face-up at the end is a predictable closure symbol. Transformation test: swapping the staircase for any "infinite" structure and the dice for another randomizing object would not break the story's logic, signaling insufficient specificity. No close proximity to famous lines, but the piece hedges toward the safety middle—philosophical without committing to either rigorous math or visceral human stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aric is present throughout and his "grim optimist" stance is stated in the opening, but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option. His "balancedly daring" approach is told rather than shown through a choice with visible cost. The final smile is observation, not agency. Setup clear, development label-only, closure participation ornamental (he "stood...eyes reflecting")—two of three gates, but causal pressure is absent. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (building the contraption), −0.5 ornamental at closure, −0.8 swappable (any "persistent inventor" archetype).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pair of dice (one chipped) appears in four beats: opening description, nightly rolls noting the stubborn refusal, incorporation into the bronze contraption, and the final face-up landing. Setup early, development through the contraption and refusal pattern, payoff in the ending image—all three gates met. However, the dice are not handled or adjusted on the page in a way that narrows options; their chipped side "refuses" passively until it doesn't. The ending reprise reweights meaning ("a faint scar turned triumph") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats (rolls, contraption use), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.4 swappable (any flawed token), −1.0 summary-only at key beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is the stated quest and frames the staircase's "quivering" response, but the concept is never translated into on-page tactics or a choice constrained by its mechanical requirements. Setup early, development through the contraption's supposed success, closure linked (the staircase "sang...motion unending")—all three gates present. Yet the mechanics are told ("the disc spun, the dice would tumble...outcomes feeding back") rather than shown altering Aric's attempts. The rupture and motion are metaphor without consequence. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (contraption), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.8 swappable (any "impossible dream").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is stated as Aric's approach ("half mathematician, half poet") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Setup present (opening), no development through middle choice, closure participation ornamental (the phrase is repeated without causal tie). Missing middle gate caps at 3.4. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 setup, −0.3 label-only, −0.8 swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rupture" appears twice: "rupture the confines of the staircase" and "a quiet rupture that echoed through the marble arches." Setup mid-story (~30%), development through the staircase's quivering response, closure linked ("the rupture not as destruction but as a doorway"). However, the rupture is told effect rather than dramatized action—no on-page moment shows Aric performing or triggering the rupture through a choice. Missing early setup caps at 4.6. Starting at 3.0, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 late signal, −1.0 summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are mentioned in the opening ("He believed that balancedly daring mathematics could rupture..."), sketched on risers, and said to feed the contraption's feedback loop, but the method is never shown shaping an attempt or choice. Setup early, development summary-only ("equations...feeding back into his equations"), no meaningful closure participation beyond the phrase "the dice's proof." Two gates (setup + weak development) allow ~6.0 ceiling, but swappability and ornamental use lower the score. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat, −0.8 swappable (any "systematic method"), −0.5 ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is introduced in the opening and recurs throughout (base, eighth landing, twentieth landing, marble arches, stone risers), satisfying all three gates. Development includes the contraption placement and the steps' "subtle tilt" response. Closure participation: "the staircase sang...motion unending." However, the staircase never constrains a tactical choice—Aric could conduct the same quest anywhere. Spatial choreography is vague (no clear sense of verticality or distance). Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (contraption placement), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.8 swappable (any "endless" space), −0.7 ornamental description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is stated in the opening ("That stubbornness became his obsession") and returns at the ending ("That moment captured the texture of the missed chance"). Setup clear, development through the incorporation of failure into proofs, closure linked. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through competing wants—Aric never faces a choice where capturing this texture costs him another goal. The final "capture" is asserted, not earned. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (incorporation), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 told-only, −0.5 no friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is named in the opening and echoed throughout ("the staircase, once a prison of endless repetition, became a laboratory"). Tone remains consistent—philosophical, elevated, abstract—through all beats and modulates slightly at the ending ("a cage and a key, bound and free"). Setup early, development through the contradiction explored in the contraption's success, closure charged by the final paradox. However, the tone never sharpens under pressure or collapses into urgency; it remains a single static register. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats (staircase as prison/lab, final paradox), +0.7 closure linkage, −1.0 static mood, −0.3 label-only at key beats.</comment>
