<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inspector remains an archetype defined by stated traits ("purposefully curious") rather than embodied contradictions. Interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("elegy," "melancholy of dawn") without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The grief and solace at the grain's capture are asserted rather than dramatized through hesitation or trade-off. No secondary character appears to test the POV through relationship friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens (chemical timer triggers shutter at sunrise) but the closure—packing the canister and descending—reads as mission completion without visible cost or foreclosed path. The ending whispers a hope ("May the grain's story travel") but does not dramatically reconfigure the inspector's stance or options; the archivists' future reaction is told, not shown. Orientation is prompt (moonlit summit, space age, inspector's mission brief by the second sentence), waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The chemical-reaction setup earns causal linkage, but the final image lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonlit basalt summit, tripod, insulated kit, and lens are rendered with concrete detail. The chemical vapor and darkening film strip provide micro-setting specificity that charges one beat (the shutter click). However, environment does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; the inspector's actions proceed without friction from terrain, light, or tool limits. The dawn light paints atmosphere but remains postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (photograph the grain before dawn reclaims it) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or narrowing. The inspector calibrates, sets the tripod, waits—each step proceeds as planned without reversal or tightening choice. The "tremor of grief" and solace are named emotions, not decisions that foreclose a path. No visible cost alters later tactics; the mission succeeds as briefed, and the descent is epilogue rather than earned consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (memory, witness, endings) emerges through recurring images (hourglass grain, dawning hush, nightwatch) but the final whisper to the summit ("May the grain's story travel") is an overt thematic statement rather than a non-literal answer earned by scene pressure. The archivists' future "dawning hush" is told, not dramatized. The grain as "captured breath of time" risks symbolic convenience; its resonance is asserted more than built from prior micro-costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains elevated register ("aching line," "elegy," "threaded through the melancholy") consistently, but diction occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("dawning hush of the universe," "heartbeat of the universe itself") that blurs the inspector's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. The camera click "echoed the heartbeat of the universe" reads as authorial assertion rather than POV-filtered perception. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "dawning hush" recurs without new pressure (lines 7, 15, 25, 29), and "outlast/outlasting" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence emerges in the second half: "He [verb], the [noun]" runs across multiple sentences (lines 18–22). Figurative density ("ghost of the nightwatch," "lighthouse," "shawl," "heartbeat of the universe") stacks without pattern-teaching or causal payoff. Stock metaphors ("blue marble," "breath of the world") dull specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence combined in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (photograph a symbolic grain at dawn using chemical timing) synthesizes familiar elements (space-age elegy, archival mission, timed capture) but does not transform them through non-obvious character calculus or world logic. The inspector's "purposefully curious" trait and the grain's memory function are asserted rather than tested by friction. The ending's whispered hope and archivists' future feeling read as template closure for reflective SF. No bold structural risk or fresh inflection charges the final image; the story executes a known elegiac mode without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The crater inspector calibrates the kit, sets the tripod, waits, packs the canister, and descends—procedural actions without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. His choice to whisper to the summit is ornamental; the mission proceeds as briefed. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but never drives a turn or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hourglass sand grain is named in the mission brief (line 3), described as a "tiny lighthouse" (line 13), captured in the photograph (line 16), packed in the canister (line 20), and invoked in the final image (line 29). It appears across three beats but remains a static symbol; its presence does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure. The grain's "memory" is told, not dramatized through causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" recurs as a phrase (lines 7, 15, 25, 29) and frames the tonal atmosphere, but it does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. The inspector experiences the hush; it does not constrain his actions or force a trade-off. Present early and at closure, but operates as thematic echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated in line 2 as a trait but never dramatizes a cost or enables a specific on-page action. The inspector's procedural calm does not visibly embody curiosity pushing against caution or time. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Outlast" appears in the mission brief context (line 3: "photograph...before it vanished"), in the inspector's reflection (line 18: "outlasting the fleeting glow gave him solace"), and in the descent (line 22: "outlasted the night to greet the dawn"). The action structures the mission goal and charges the final image, but the inspector does not face a dramatized test of endurance; he waits as planned. Present across beats and at closure, shaping the dominant stake, but swappable with "preserve" or "capture" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The chemical-reaction timer is introduced early (line 8: "silver nitrate...five minutes after exposure"), calibrated to trigger the shutter (line 10), and its vapor rises as the countdown begins (line 15). The method enables the photograph and provides procedural texture, but the inspector does not adapt the chemistry under pressure or face a trade-off in its use. Present in setup and climax, functional but not indispensable; a simple timer could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is anchored early (line 1) and returns in the descent (line 22) and the inspector's whisper to the "empty summit" (line 21). The basalt, tripod sinking into powder, and sun's edge painting the horizon provide spatial detail, but the setting does not constrain a choice or complicate the mission. Present across beats; atmosphere without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Space age" is named once (line 2) as background context and the "expanding colonies" (line 17) gesture toward the era. The timeframe does not tighten a decision or impose a live clock; the inspector's wait proceeds without friction from schedule or rival claims. Present in setup but does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The mission to "photograph the last of the nightwatch's hourglass sand grain before it vanished forever" (line 3) frames the inspector's goal and recurs in his grief (line 17: "last record of a mineral that would soon be reclaimed"). The desire is stated and reflected upon, but never dramatized through a friction between wanting the shot and a competing cost (time, risk, scruple). Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending, shaping the dominant stake, but told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" pervades the prose through repeated "melancholy of dawn" (line 19), "dawning hush" (lines 7, 15, 25, 29), and the inspector's "tremor of grief" (line 17). The tone remains static across beats without modulation under pressure; the inspector's calm reflection at the peak moment and the descent carry identical lyric register. Present throughout and charges the final image, but does not shift with escalation.</comment>
