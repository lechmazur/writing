<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is dense but largely contemplative rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "jealous of past selves" motivation is asserted repeatedly but never embodied through a micro-choice with visible cost. Emotions lean toward abstract lyric labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than specific embodied states. The final act of stepping outside reads as willful rather than earned by prior pressure narrowing options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who (lucid dream chronicler), where (mountain ranger cabin), and when (after seeing grave) are anchored, but the temporal frame remains vague—no concrete "today" or continuous action window emerges by ~120 words, and the reflective mode dominates without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but the final step outside does not reconfigure prior material with undeniable cost; it asserts resolve without foreclosing a path or altering options on the page. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the narrator moves from reflection to more reflection to an open gesture. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cabin, pine scent, snow, and birch bark scroll are vivid and anchor the piece sensorially. The scroll functions as a micro-setting object that the narrator handles and that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography is minimal (single room, single character), and the grave marker outside shifts from threat to metaphor without clear physical grounding. Sensory hierarchy and POV filter are present but not deeply leveraged under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to distill chaos into narrative"—is declared but never tested by an external obstacle or forced trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the narrator reflects, dreams, writes, and steps outside in a sequence that accumulates mood but does not escalate pressure. The final resolve to "begin to soar again" lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed. Coincidence does not intrude, but agency remains contemplative rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Thematic resonance around memory, nostalgia, and the artist's struggle to capture fleeting vision is present and coherent. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chaos into narrative") rather than earning insight through specific dramatized experience. The final image of stepping outside gestures at renewal but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal, cost-laden answer. No single particular (object, gesture, constraint) carries the theme's weight at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable, and the lyric register is consistent and often striking ("letters rearrange themselves as if jealous of past selves"). Diction leans elevated and sometimes abstract ("lucid dream chronicler," "feral nostalgia"), which fits the reflective voice but risks distancing the reader from embodied urgency. No head-hopping or filter abuse. Some syntactic variety, though template stems recur ("I watch," "I feel," "I glance"). The voice is distinctive but lacks modulation under pressure—register holds steady across reflection and dream without a clear shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and some images are vivid ("wind carve new stories into my skin"), but template stems recur frequently across adjacent lines ("I sit," "I watch," "I feel," "I close," "I glance," "I write," "I stand") creating a drumbeat cadence that flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops are present: "the cabin walls whisper" / "the cabin door creaks" / "the cabin walls humming" restate ambiance without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("time is a cruel editor") and abstract phrasing ("distill chaos into narrative") recur without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (setting + mood), but key beats (the dream, the grave) are told rather than shown. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-artist premise and the self-jealousy method are unusual on their face, but the execution leans on familiar lyric templates: isolated artist, cabin retreat, scrolls and memories, past-vs-present nostalgia. No single turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight; the final step outside could be swapped for any gesture of renewed resolve. Emotional specificity is thin—"feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" are asserted but not particularized through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. No bold structural risk beyond heavy reflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler is the narrator and frames the piece, but no key turn arises from a chronicler-specific choice. The character observes, reflects, dreams, and writes—all passive or contemplative acts. The occupation is label-level; no chronicling mechanics (choosing which dreams to record, sacrificing clarity for speed, etc.) constrain a decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in multiple beats: unrolled at the table, glowing in firelight, handled after waking, and present in the final resolve. It recurs with shifting metaphorical weight (archive → winged messenger → approving witness). However, its use remains largely symbolic; the narrator never makes a choice shaped by the scroll's physical properties or contents. No visible cost tied to its handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly mid-piece as "the literal manifestation" of soaring feeling, but it functions as thematic label rather than stake-driver. It does not constrain an action or alter options on the page; the narrator yearns for it, but no tension arises from pursuing or resisting it. Label-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is stated twice ("chronologically confused mind," "chronologically confused brain"), describing the narrator's struggle to sequence memories. The trait colors perception but does not enable or block a choice with cost. No dramatized moment where confusion forces a mistake or trade-off. Summary-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Soar" appears in the dream (soaring over valleys) and the final line ("I begin to soar again"). The action seeds expectation and closes the lyric arc, but no middle beat dramatizes a choice shaped by the ability or failure to soar. The dream is recounted, not shown with pressure. Swappable with another transcendent verb (fly, rise, lift) without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is named as "the method I have chosen to anchor my chaotic visions, converting envy into ink." The mechanics are asserted but never demonstrated: no beat shows the narrator selecting a past self, feeling jealousy, and then acting differently because of it. Told-only method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin anchors location and provides sensory texture (pine, cracked window, single table, firelight). The cabin door creaks at the end, and stepping outside frames the closure gesture. Setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Postcard-level presence with minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is mentioned in the opening and revisited near the end ("the spot where the grave was marked"). The timeframe colors mood but does not impose urgency or a countdown that tightens decisions. The grave shifts from literal to metaphorical without on-page consequence. Vague temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is declared as the narrator's motivation and repeated. The desire frames the piece but is never conflicted by a competing want or obstacle that forces a trade-off. The narrator writes "furiously" once, but no cost or friction emerges—no sacrifice of clarity for speed, no choice between recording truth or comfort. Told-only desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named explicitly and colors the narrator's stance throughout: weary yet still attuned to beauty. The tone is consistent and modulates slightly (cabin reflection → dream awe → final resolve), though the register remains elevated without sharp shifts under pressure. The tone charges the lyric texture but does not decisively reweight the final image with new cost. Static mood with some modulation.</comment>
