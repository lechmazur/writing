<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains a static figure whose interiority is never dramatized; we see no internal conflict, no micro-choices under pressure, only declarative statements about his motivation. The piece tells us he "discovered a method" and "works after words become unnecessary" without showing the struggle, doubt, or cost of those choices. Emotional states are labeled rather than embodied—"smiles," "feeling the muted vigor"—without contradictory impulses or lived tension. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost occurs; the protagonist ends exactly as he began, tending his sculpture in an unchanging routine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge gradually across the opening third without deliberate disorientation that pays off, triggering a −0.4 deduction. No causal linkage or meaningful escalation appears; the piece offers a series of static descriptions rather than because/therefore pressure. The ending whispers a "promise that the symphonies of truth will never be silenced" and asserts "hope glistens," but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost occurs—the tuner's situation and stance remain identical from first line to last. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering bluff and suspended iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—"copper arm that glisten when sunrise kisses the sky," "long shadows that ripple across the cliffside." Setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, remaining primarily atmospheric. The body-as-micro-setting (tightening copper joints, feeling wind on cheek) appears but does not drive a turn. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the details are filtered through the tuner's priorities, but the world remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening that narrows options occurs; the tuner tends his sculpture without friction, and the world "watches silently" in passive admiration. The piece declares stakes ("a promise... will not fade") yet provides no scene where those stakes face jeopardy or force a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve because no conflict materializes to require resolution. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with cost) appears; the protagonist's routine continues unaltered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—silence as language, wonder preserved through art—emerges from images and motifs rather than direct statement, a strength. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") without transforming them through specific, grounded events. The ending asserts "quiet triumph" and "hope glistens" rather than letting the iceberg's motion or the tuner's micro-choice offer a non-literal answer to the central question. Thematic resonance is diluted by the absence of cost or complexity; no counter-reading or ambiguity lingers, and the resolution feels declarative rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature—selective attention to light, motion, and silence. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonious bell tuner," "tempered vigor," "perpetual dance of metal and ice") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Filter verbs ("feeling," "watches," "knows") stack in emotional beats without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation, and the prose reads more like narrated observation than the tuner's lived interior texture. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "glisten" recurs eight times, "muted" / "seasonally mute" five times, "symphonies of truth" four times, "color of wonder" four times, often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate—"He works... His motivation... He knows... He walks"—creating syntactic monotony (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("sunrise kisses the sky," "world senses a quiet triumph") and therapy-speak labels ("muted vigor," "quiet triumph") flatten immediacy in key beats (−0.4). Scaffold sentences restate content: "The tuner smiles, feeling the muted vigor of his craft pulse through his fingertips" immediately follows "the copper arm casts long shadows... turning silence into a visual chorus" without causal advance. High figurative density in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("Thus hope glistens"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category at 8.8 (though the base score remains well below that threshold). Total artifact deduction: −1.7 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—silent artist preserving wonder through kinetic sculpture—offers a poetic angle, but the execution relies on abstraction and prompt labels without grounded transformation. The piece could be rewritten with different names and objects (a painter, a garden, a chime) without altering the emotional arc or thematic claim, failing the transformation test. No bold risk-taking or unconventional structural choice heightens stakes; the narrative unfolds as a static tableau. Proximity check: "sunrise kisses the sky," "world senses," and "perpetual dance" echo familiar lyric tropes without fresh inflection. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the core (artist in isolation preserving beauty through ritual) matches widely used templates without lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 adjustment within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The bell tuner is present throughout but makes no key choices; he tightens joints, watches, and walks to the edge without altering tactics or stance. No decision or renunciation occurs—only observation and routine maintenance. Missing middle development and closure participation (no causal action in the ending); late summary ("whispers a promise") does not count as dramatized choice. Ornamental presence, label-only occupation, swappable with "artisan" or "sculptor" with minor edits. Setup present, two gates missing → cap 3.4; ornamental −0.5, swappability −0.4, summary-only −0.3 = 2.2, rounded to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears early (setup), is handled on the copper arm in the middle (one beat: coaxing it to glisten), and returns in the final third ("iceberg glisten," "metal and ice"). Three touches across beats, but functional involvement is limited to description and symbolic reprise without causal pressure. No cost tied to the object; it does not narrow options or enable a tactic under stress. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (cameo mention, not causally active) +0.3, lyric reprise +0.4 = base 5.1; swappability (any translucent material would serve) −0.4, ornamental −0.3 = 4.4 range; lyric-resonance allowance lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is mentioned four times as a thematic label but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page; no choice depends on whether a melody is "true" or not. The concept remains abstract and decorative, swappable with "beauty" or "meaning" without structural impact. Setup present (early mention), no middle development, no closure participation beyond a final assertion. Label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.5, swappability −0.5, missing two gates → cap 3.4; cumulative −1.0 max = 2.4, adjusted to 2.1 for lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Seasonally mute" and "after words become unnecessary" appear as labels but do not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The tuner already works in silence; no scene shows what he sacrificed by becoming mute or how speech would alter his tactics. The trait is told, not dramatized. Setup present, no development, no closure participation. Label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.5, swappability (any silent artist) −0.4, summary-only −0.3, missing two gates → cap 3.4; cumulative −1.0 max applied = 2.4, adjusted to 1.8 for zero visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Glisten" recurs eight times throughout the piece, anchoring the visual motif of light on ice. Present in setup, middle (coaxing the iceberg to glisten brighter), and ending ("hope glistens"). However, no major turn traces to this action; the glistening is static description rather than a choice or event that redefines options. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (final word) +0.7, lyric reprise +0.4 = base 6.0; swappability (shine, gleam) −0.6, ornamental (description, not action pressure) −0.8, synonym churn artifact −0.3 = 4.3, rounded to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through kinetic sculpture" is signaled in the first third and mentioned again in the final third. The mechanics (copper arm, suspended iceberg, wind-driven vibration) are sketched but do not shape attempts or choices; the sculpture exists as a completed artifact without on-page assembly, adjustment under pressure, or failure. Setup present, one functional beat (tightening copper joints), closure mention. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (mentioned) +0.3 = base 4.2; late full disclosure of mechanics −0.3, ornamental (static description) −0.5, swappability (any wind-driven instrument) −0.4 = 2.6 range; partial development lifts to 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "whispering bluff above the clouds" is present in setup, middle, and ending, anchoring spatial identity. The setting provides atmosphere and witnesses (neighbors, gulls) but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The bluff does not constrain access, time, or action; it remains a postcard backdrop. Early signal +0.5, three touches +1.4, closure linkage (final paragraph) +0.3 = base 5.2; ornamental (description without choice pressure) −0.5, swappability (any remote promontory) −0.4 = 4.3 range; lyric cohesion lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" and "since the season of silence arrived" frame the timeframe as past a threshold. The time marker is vague and does not tighten decisions or tactics; no clock, deadline, or seasonal pressure forces a move. Setup present (early mention), no middle development, no closure participation. Thematic framing +0.3, early signal +0.3 = base 3.6; vague (no live clock) −0.5, ornamental −0.4, missing two gates → cap 3.4; cumulative −0.9 applied = 2.5, rounded to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated early as motivation and recurs in the final third. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no scene shows the tuner weighing wonder against cost or choosing it over a competing want. Setup present, no middle friction, closure mention (assertion). Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (thematic echo) +0.3 = base 3.8; told-only (no on-page friction) −0.6, ornamental −0.3, missing middle → cap 4.6; cumulative −0.9 applied = 2.9 range; thematic reprise lifts to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is labeled twice and the tone—quiet, restrained, lyric—remains coherent throughout. Syntax and cadence are uniform rather than modulating with pressure; no peak beat tightens rhythm or diction to charge the final image. The tone is consistent but static, a single mood rather than a dynamic emotional arc. Setup present (early tone), sustained middle, ending consistent. Coherence +0.8, closure linkage (tonal consistency) +0.5 = base 4.3; static (no modulation under pressure) −0.4, label-only (phrase appears without embodied rhythm shift) −0.3 = base 3.6; full presence across three gates and lyric cohesion lift to 5.3.</comment>
