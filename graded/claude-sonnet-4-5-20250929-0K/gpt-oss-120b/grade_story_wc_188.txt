<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The designer remains an abstract cipher whose internal contradictions are asserted ("serious playfulness," "fierce resolve") rather than enacted through difficult choice. No moment forces him to sacrifice one impulse for another; the chants and fire are performed without visible cost or friction. The final vow to return operates as summary rather than a crystallized stance shaped by prior pressure. Interiority consists of poetic declarations that never degrade under stress or reveal competing motives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words—"wandering" offers no anchor, "blooming fortress" is metaphoric rather than spatial, and "dusk" into "hush of a night" blurs time without functional payoff at closure (−0.4). The piece drifts through lyric tableaux without causal linkage: the designer walks, chants, lifts the rag, watches sparks, then vows to return. No reversal narrows options; the "gravity of hopelessness" lifts without on-page cost. Closure reads as thematic echo rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory texture—ivy, rose, amber light, oily kerosene scent, jasmine—is woven throughout, and the blooming fortress recurs in the final image. However, the setting remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The micro-setting allowance (body, tool, object) is not met because the rag knot and mosaic are invoked rather than used to pressure decisions. Spatial choreography is vague (corridors, alcove, gates appear without clear layout).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma or trade-off. The designer encounters no obstacle, resistance, or cost; the firework simply "erupts," the mosaic glows, and hopelessness lifts. No reversal or tightening narrows options. The vow at the end functions as a static resolve rather than a stance earned by prior escalation. Agency is observation and performance without forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("art filters despair") emerges through repeated imagery—sparks, mosaic tiles, chants—but is explicitly stated in the penultimate paragraph: "to filter despair through art, to let hope sparkle in darkness." This thematic echo replaces resonance; the final image does not reweight prior material through irony or tension, only restates the premise. The mosaic and rag knot recur without shifting meaning. No counter-reading or ambiguity survives the sermon-like closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice exhibits purposeful compression and pattern-taught lyricism ("through ambient awareness," "filter through the memory of a note in mosaic"), which the rubric allows when legible and paid off at closure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("serious playfulness," "gravity of hopelessness") that clashes with concrete action, especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen pressure. Single-POV focalization remains stable, but perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "chants while walking" appears five times with synonym variants ("low chants," "final chant," "chanting softly"); "blooming fortress" repeats four times with near-identical phrasing; "filter" and "mosaic" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: "He [verb]" stems run across multiple sentences in the middle third. Figurative density is high—"velvet blank," "humming gallery," "moving tiles," "cascade of colored ribbons"—without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to choice. Baseline −0.8 for loops and stems; −0.4 for density in peak beats without payoff; total −1.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise—artist as wandering healer through fireworks—follows the "lone visionary performs redemptive art" template without fresh inflection. The mosaic, rag knot, and chants are invoked as symbolic tokens rather than lived particulars that constrain or enable. The transformation test fails: swap "fireworks" for "music" or "painting" and the arc remains unchanged. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's "serious playful dream" reprises the opening's "serious playfulness" without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The wandering fireworks designer is present throughout and performs actions (walks, chants, lifts the rag, releases a firework), but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup: first sentence. Development: walks and chants without decision pressure. Payoff: vows to return, a summary intention rather than a causal act. Observation dominates; agency is absent. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation as a decision-maker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The fire spinner's kerosene rag knot appears in three beats: pocket mention (paragraph 6), lifted aloft with flame (paragraph 16), and tucked back into satchel (paragraph 28). Setup clear, middle handling present, closure cameo. However, the rag knot does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off; it is used as atmosphere. No cost tied to the object itself. Score ~5.2 for two-gate presence (setup, middle touch) with ornamental rather than causal function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The note in mosaic is introduced mid-story (paragraph 9), described as a fragment, then revisited when the firework illuminates it (paragraph 24). Setup missing (arrives after first third). Development: thematic echo only. Payoff: glows in reflected light without reweighting stakes. The concept operates as symbolic backdrop rather than a driver of choices. Cap at 3.4 for missing setup; apply −0.3 for ornamental use. Final 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Chants while walking appears in five beats but functions as label-only texture. Setup: paragraph 4, "sang low chants while walking." Development: paragraph 14, "chants while walking resonated"; paragraph 23, "released a final chant"; paragraph 30, "chanting softly." Payoff: final paragraph, "chanting while walking." No moment shows chanting constrain an action or impose a cost; the trait is repeatedly invoked without causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development as constraint; apply −0.3 for label-only use. Final 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Filter appears as verb and metaphor throughout: "could filter the damp night air" (paragraph 7), "filtered through the memory" (paragraph 9), "filtered through the night" (paragraph 16), "filter despair through art" (paragraph 26), "filter of ambition" (paragraph 30), "fireworks that filter sorrow" (paragraph 32). Setup early, development repeated, payoff explicit. However, the action is thematic rather than physical; no turn traces to filtering as a tactical choice. Swappable with "transform" or "channel." Cap at 3.8 for high swappability; no causal work. Final 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Through ambient awareness appears once (paragraph 8): "Through ambient awareness he sensed the fortress's pulse." Setup present but vague. Development: no second use or demonstration of mechanics. Payoff: absent; the ending does not show ambient awareness shaping the firework or vow. One-beat ornamental mention. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; apply −0.2 for late-only summary. Final 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Blooming fortress at dusk is named in the opening line, recurs in eight beats, and anchors the final image ("blooming fortress at dusk faded into silhouette"). Setup, development touches, and payoff all present. However, the fortress supplies atmosphere rather than constraint; no wall, vine, or spatial feature alters a choice or tactic. Postcard description dominates. Three gates met but ornamental function; score ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The hush of a night with no stars is introduced early (paragraph 3) and reprised in the final paragraph. Setup clear, development absent (no mid-story pressure from darkness or starlessness), payoff present as frame. Time does not tighten decisions; the "night" is static backdrop. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow up to ~6.0, but missing middle development and no tactical constraint lower to cap of 3.4; lyric reprise lifts slightly to ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>To defy the gravity of hopelessness is declared in paragraph 5, invoked when "gravity of hopelessness lift[s]" (paragraph 19), and restated in the vow to "filter sorrow" (paragraph 32). Setup, development (told-only), and payoff all present. However, the motivation is summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between desire and sacrifice. Three gates met but label-only execution; score ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is named in paragraph 5 ("serious playfulness, a paradoxical grin") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("absurd seriousness") and final line ("serious playful dream"). Setup, middle touch, and payoff present. Tone remains lyrically elevated throughout; no modulation under pressure or shift that charges the final image. Coherent but static. Three gates met with consistent application; score ~5.4 for functional presence without dynamic pressure.</comment>
