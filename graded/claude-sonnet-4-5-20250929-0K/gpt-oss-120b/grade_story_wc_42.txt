<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sage camera repairer remains externalized throughout; his "purpose clarified" and "changelessly constant" hands are label-only traits without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of abstract meditation ("luminous ache," "ephemeral pulse") rather than character-particular perception under stress. No meaningful internal conflict shapes the repair sequence—he moves through steps with competent certainty, never facing a genuine mistake or trade-off that would demonstrate flawed judgment scaled to stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Closure exists as a physical completion (the clock hand slows, the device "held its course"), but cost remains abstract and asserted rather than legible in a decisive image or forfeited path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural in ambition (recurring "luminous ache," leaf motif), yet the final paragraph recycles earlier phrases without reweighting them through new pressure or a conceptual repricing. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and concrete spatial anchors emerge slowly across the first third—triggering a −0.4 deduction and cross-category caps per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lunar observatory "above the clouds" and brass cradle supply vivid sensory anchors, but spatial choreography remains vague (the sage "stood on the rim," then "opened the brass cradle" with no intervening movement clarifying proximity or scale). The leaf's fall "far below" and the telescope measuring escape velocity offer atmospheric detail without constraining any on-page choice or altering repair tactics. Setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure or resource that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the spinning clock hand—is signaled early, but escalation consists of procedural steps (listen for the leaf, align gears, tighten screw) without a reversal or narrowing of options. The sage's competence never wavers; no credible loss, omission, or forced trade-off alters his tactics. The hand's slowing reads as inevitable success rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, and coincidence (the leaf's echo arriving at the exact moment) enables resolution without protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of harnessing the ephemeral and "changelessly constant" effort emerges through recurring motifs (leaf, luminous ache, escape velocity), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "constant change is possible when the heart remains changelessly constant" and "to harness the ephemeral, one must listen." These direct articulations replace earned resonance with summary. The "luminous ache" recurs frequently yet shifts meaning only through synonymous rephrasing rather than concrete events that reweight it at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic elevated-literary rather than character-specific (the sage sees "silvered arches," "radiant sigh," "bittersweet glow" in repeated poetic register). Diction stays consistently formal without modulation under the physical task's pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady, but the vocabulary ("ephemeral pulse," "immutable rhythm") reads as authorial overlay rather than the repairer's working idiom, creating mild register drift that persists across peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "luminous ache" appears six times with synonym variants ("radiant sigh," "bittersweet glow") that restate mood without adding pressure; multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "He [verb]" in runs of three or more. Mixed metaphors: the clock hand is both "a filament of starlight" and mounted on a "brass cradle," and "escape velocity" conflates astronomical threshold with metaphorical yearning incoherently. Figurative density in most sentences (silvered arches, luminous ache, song of gears, dance of light) without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.6 for density, plus −0.5 for paraphrase loops and −0.4 for template cadence, totaling approximately −1.5 cumulative deduction in Q7, with an additional −0.2 for these artifacts touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sage-craftsman-restoring-cosmic-mechanism premise is a familiar template (wise artisan, fantastical device, thematic repair-as-metaphor) executed without fresh synthesis. The "leaf falling" method and "escape velocity" as metaphor for longing read as symbolic ornament rather than irreplaceable story logic—remove them and the repair arc remains unchanged. Emotional territory (quiet competence, steady purpose, poetic wonder) avoids specific contradiction or non-obvious moral calculus, settling into median safe choices that could fit many mystical-repair narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The sage camera repairer is present throughout and performs the repair, but his choices are procedural rather than decisional. He "knew" what to do, moved with "changelessly constant" hands, and completed steps in sequence without facing a dilemma, error, or forced trade-off. No key turn traces to his agency under conflicting pressures; he executes a plan without internal friction or visible cost tied to his character traits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The clock hand appears in the opening (introduced early), is described mid-repair (the sage "opened the brass cradle" to reveal it), and slows at closure (payoff present). However, its involvement is passive—it is observed and adjusted but does not constrain the repairer's tactics or force a choice. The hand's "refusing to pause" and eventual slowing result from the sage's external work rather than the object's unique properties creating friction or enabling a specific solution unavailable otherwise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Escape velocity" is mentioned three times as a telescope measurement and metaphorical yearning, but it does not shape on-page tactics or alter the repair sequence. The concept functions as thematic backdrop and label rather than a mechanical constraint or resource the sage must work with or against. Removing it would not change the repair's causal chain or the ending's effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" describes the sage's hands in one sentence ("His hands were changelessly constant") and recurs as a theme statement in the final paragraph. The trait is asserted but never dramatically tested—no moment shows the sage's steadiness enabling a fragile adjustment or costing him adaptability when conditions shift. It remains a label without visible tradeoff or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Restructure" is named explicitly ("he must restructure the entire mechanism") and enacted when the sage opens the cradle, aligns gears, and tightens the final screw. The action drives the middle repair sequence and leads to the hand's slowing at closure. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than shown in beats that create reversals or narrowed options; the action is present and functional but somewhat swappable with "repair" or "realign" without deep specificity to this story's unique problem.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By the sound of a leaf falling" is introduced early (the sage must "attune his tools" to the leaf's vibration) and returns at closure ("the leaf fell again…its soft thud marked the rhythm"). The method is signaled and participates in the ending image, satisfying two gates. However, the mechanism remains vague—how the leaf's sound enables gear alignment is asserted ("carried the secret rhythm") rather than shown through a specific sensory or technical constraint the sage must navigate. The method shapes expectation but not demonstrable tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory above the clouds is introduced in the opening line and recurs in the closing image ("The observatory stood silent, its lenses aimed skyward"). Spatial details (rim, vaulted dome, glass panes, brass cradle) are vivid, but the setting does not pressure the repairer's choices or supply a resource that alters the repair's outcome. The "foundations shake" timeframe operates independently of the observatory's location; the repair could occur in any workshop without changing the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"When foundations shake" is mentioned twice: once describing ambient tremors and once noting "the foundations continued to quake" after the repair. The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions or force time-constrained tactics—the sage works at his own pace without urgency imposed by the shaking. The tremors add atmospheric pressure but do not alter the repair sequence or create a live clock that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated explicitly in two sentences and named as the sage's "purpose clarified." The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or friction between desire and cost. The sage pursues the goal without internal doubt, competing need, or visible sacrifice that would show the ephemeral's elusiveness creating on-page difficulty. The motivation frames the task but remains abstract and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" recurs six times with variants ("radiant sigh," "bittersweet glow"), establishing a coherent melancholic-wonder tone from opening to close. The tone modulates slightly—"deepened" at the climax, "settled into quiet gratitude" at the end—and charges the final image where the ache "glowed gently" as the sage walked into mist. However, emotional register remains uniformly elevated and poetic without contrasting pressure or a sharper turn that would test tonal control under stress. The tone is consistent and purposeful but somewhat static in affective range.</comment>
