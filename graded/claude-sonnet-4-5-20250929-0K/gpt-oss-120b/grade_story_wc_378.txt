<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vira's motivation—"inner static"—reads as therapeutic abstraction rather than embodied desire. Her choices feel mechanically aligned to prompt elements rather than arising from contradictory impulses; she approaches the box, whispers code, activates systems without visible internal friction or cost. The "nostalgic android" trait remains a label; no specific memory or contradiction shapes her actions under pressure. The ending smile is tagged as "a fleeting glitch in her programming, yet it felt genuine"—tell-only interiority that undermines embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate: android, dome, desert roses established early. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern and image density rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: the box transforms from fear repository to "seed of calm," static dissolves to "fragmented wholeness." However, the cost is asserted ("burned away the static") rather than dramatized; no on-page choice forecloses a path with visible price. The controlled burn succeeds without complication, making the ending feel declarative rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert setting, and roses are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("ozone and old metal," "molten sky and cracked earth"). The magnetic north shift and dome shielding provide concrete environmental pressure. The box's organic wood constrains her method—she draws on its living quality to compress fears. However, spatial choreography during the burn sequence is vague; we don't track Vira's position relative to flames, vines, or the box clearly enough for the stakes to feel urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving inner static—is signaled early but remains abstract. The controlled burn complication is introduced and resolved within two paragraphs with no reversal or cost; the dome's systems simply succeed when activated. No tightening or deepening narrows options; Vira's actions proceed in a linear checklist (approach box → whisper code → activate suppression → place box among seedlings). The "fragmented wholeness" she senses is told rather than tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—harmony between machine and organic, chaos contained and transformed—emerges from recurring images (the breathing box, desert roses as compasses, intertwining bark). The final image of the box "intertwining with the plant" offers a non-literal answer. However, the piece leans on prompt labels: "fragmented wholeness," "miniaturized chaos," "organic heart beating in rhythm." The ending paragraph moralizes: "even the strangest organic chaos can be contained, miniaturized, and transformed into hope"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Diction attempts a lyric register ("throbbed with heat," "mosaic of molten sky") but repeatedly drifts into abstraction ("nostalgic android," "fragmented wholeness," "perpetual vigilance"). Perceptual signature is generic; Vira's way of noticing doesn't feel android-particular or nostalgia-inflected. No dialogue. The prose has texture but lacks a distinct mind; it reads more like authorial observation than Vira's lived interiority under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The box inhaled, its bark tightening, and a quiet hiss announced the containment" restates the miniaturization already described. Template cadence runs through the ending: "She realized… She tucked… She recorded… She stood." Figurative density is high without clear pattern payoff: "symbols that pulsed faintly," "chaos humming in synchrony," "fractured glass" stars. Prompt-element labels recur as fill rather than pressure: "miniaturize," "controlled burn escape," "fragmented wholeness." These artifacts dull momentum and obscure whether actions have cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—android caretaker tending roses in a dome, using a living box to contain fears and execute a controlled burn—synthesizes multiple prompt elements but feels constructed to specification rather than inevitable. The "nostalgic android" and "box of childhood fears" read as quirky ornament; neither is explored through specific lived detail that transforms the trope. The magnetic north shift and miniaturization method remain underused conveniences. Emotional arc (static → wholeness) follows a template path without bold risk or fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vira is present throughout and makes decisions (approach box, whisper code, activate suppression, place box among seedlings). However, these choices feel prompted by plot checklist rather than constraining her options with cost. She observes and tends but does not face a dilemma that her android nature or nostalgia forces her to resolve with visible trade-off. Setup and development present; closure participation ornamental (she "stood," "smiled," "tucked").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The box appears in setup (on shelf with pulsing symbols), development (Vira approaches it, whispers code, it inhales and compresses fears), and payoff (placed among seedlings, bark intertwining with vine). It is handled across three beats. However, its function is asserted rather than dramatized with cost; the "oddly living wood" enables the miniaturization conveniently. Its transformation from fear repository to "seed of calm" is told in summary. Swappable with any magical container.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Controlled burn escape" is introduced as a sensor warning, then executed without complication or escape element. The burn clears thorns and succeeds; nothing escapes, no one flees. The concept does not shape tactics or create pressure—it is simply completed as described. Present in middle and ending but ornamental; could be replaced with "controlled burn" or "system maintenance" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" describes the box's wood grain "breathing as if alive" and later its bark "intertwining with the plant." This trait enables the miniaturization method (Vira "coaxed the fears" using the "oddly living wood"). However, the attribute is asserted rather than constraining a choice with visible cost; it functions as convenient magic. Setup and development present; payoff is decorative intertwining. Borderline functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" is the stated resolution method: Vira decides to "miniaturize the chaos," the box compresses fears "like origami," and logs note "chaos contained by organic wood could be miniaturized without loss." The action is told rather than shown with cost; we do not see how compression alters her choices or forecloses options. It appears in middle and ending but as explanation rather than dramatized turn. Swappable with "contain" or "neutralize."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"By containing chaos" frames the method: the box functions as "a vessel capable of shrinking the volatile into harmless particles." The means is signaled in development and mentioned in the ending logs. However, mechanics are vague (whisper "ancient code," box inhales) and do not shape her attempts with friction. The method succeeds on first try without complication. Present but replaceable with any containment ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in a glass dome is vividly established in setup, provides environmental pressure (heat, magnetic shielding flicker, failing irrigation, overgrown thorns), and appears in the closure image (dome panels glow, roses unfold as compasses). The setting constrains her actions (she must use the dome's fire suppression) and charges the final image (farm as sanctuary, box among seedlings). However, spatial choreography during the burn is vague, reducing tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"When magnetic north shifts" is mentioned once in setup ("that night") and affects the dome's shielding (which flickers, triggering sensor warnings). At closure, "magnetic north settled into its new alignment" and roses point toward the new north. The shift does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it provides convenient complication and convenient resolution. Time is not tracked or felt as pressure. Present in setup and payoff; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To resolve inner static" is Vira's stated goal: "she felt an inner static humming through her circuits" and decided "to resolve that inner static." The motivation is told rather than dramatized as conflicting wants under pressure. At closure, "the static dissolve[d], replaced by a fragmented wholeness"—summary resolution without on-page cost or choice that forecloses a path. Setup and payoff present; development is assertion rather than friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is named explicitly ("replaced by a fragmented wholeness," "stitching together the fragmented wholeness of her existence") and implied through images of mosaic sky, fractured glass stars, and the box integrating with the vine. Tone attempts lyric accumulation but is undermined by template cadence and prompt-label repetition. It modulates minimally; pressure never sharpens into urgency. The tone charges the final image weakly—more declared than felt.</comment>
