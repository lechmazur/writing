<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is declared but never tested by a meaningful internal conflict or contradiction. Her "prism-minded" trait and tattoos remain label-only descriptions without shaping on-page choices under pressure. The "latent blaze" and "seeds of vigilance" are abstract metaphors recycled as felt states rather than embodied through concrete action or micro-decisions. The final promise to the glyph reads as summary rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Liora is and what she specifically seeks remains abstract past the first third. The closure unit (planting seedlings, making a promise) occurs on the page but the cost is conceptual only, announced rather than felt through a trade-off or visible loss. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric detail accrues toward a final image), but pressure never meaningfully tightens or reweights the stake; the grotto sequence unfolds as a guided tour with no reversals or altered tactics. Causality is weak: the doodle "appears without explanation," gravity inverts on schedule, the cipher resolves when symbols are aligned without friction, and the glyph dissolves into seedlings without resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with glittering mist and floating columns, and the inverted-gravity hour supplies a memorable atmospheric constraint. However, the setting does not alter Liora's tactics or force a choice—she walks through, aligns symbols, gathers seedlings, and leaves. The recurring manuscript doodle and the seedlings function as setting-adjacent objects but their role in constraining action is minimal; they guide rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early but remains abstract and never visibly tested. No reversal or complication arises: Liora consults the doodle, enters during the scheduled hour, aligns symbols, and succeeds without friction. The hour of inverted gravity is a coincidental window rather than a pressure she creates or pays for. Agency is entirely passive; the glyph dissolves and seedlings sprout without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme of vigilance-as-seeds emerges from recurring imagery, but it remains ornamental rather than tested by Liora's choices. The final promise to "guard the balance of knowledge as fiercely as gravity itself" is a stated moral rather than an earned insight from specific struggle. The "prism mind" metaphor is repeated without deepening or complicating the central question. The seedlings as "living lamps" offer a pleasant image but no felt cost or ambiguity; the ending resolves into symbolic tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a steady register of elevated, metaphor-dense prose. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("threshold effects activating," "serpentine grotto in mist," "combinations resolved into a single luminous glyph") that reads more like prompt fulfillment than character-specific perception. Liora's interiority lacks a distinct perceptual signature; her observations of the grotto and glyph are generically poetic rather than filtered through the priorities of an archivist. Psychic distance remains stable but the prose texture does not modulate under the pressure of the gravity inversion or symbol alignment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades every beat without pattern-teaching or payoff: "seeds of vigilance sprouting tiny phosphorescent points," "latent blaze stir within her," "cipher lattice of interlocking symbols," "clandestinely luminous." Mixed metaphors abound—vigilance as seeds, fire as blaze, knowledge as prism refraction—without coherent vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "the marginal doodle flared, revealing a hidden cipher" / "the cipher was a lattice"; "the glyph pulsed once, then dissolved into falling sparks" / "the sparks settled… sprouting tiny seedlings." Template cadence dominates: "She slipped… and set out," "She inhaled… then stepped through," "She placed… She understood… She whispered." Filter verbs cluster: "She felt," "She recognized," "She understood." Applying artifact penalties: dense figurative muddle −0.7, paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, filter-verb stack −0.3; total −1.9 routed to Q7 only. Artifacts appear in the closure paragraph ("She understood that vigilance… must be tended"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist seeks forgotten knowledge in a gravity-inverted grotto—closely matches fantasy-quest templates (chosen-one enters mystical place at prophesied time, solves puzzle, returns with artifact). The "prism-minded archivist," "clandestinely luminous" tattoos, and "seeds of vigilance" read as prompt-label fulfillment rather than organic world-building or character logic. No moment subverts or complicates the expected arc; the story follows a linear collect-the-MacGuffin structure without transformation. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.2 within Q8 for template reliance without meaningful personalization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her role as archivist motivates the quest, but her choices do not create key turns. She consults, traces, steps through, aligns, and gathers—all guided actions without on-page friction or a decision that alters tactics. The prism-minded trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable a specific choice. Ornamental integration with a mild motivation link: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The manuscript margin doodle appears early (setup), reappears when she consults it before entering (development), and "faded, its purpose fulfilled" at closure (payoff). It guides her path but does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; she never faces a decision about whether to trust it or an alternative. Functional across three touches with mild causal pressure, no visible tradeoff: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" appear as metaphor in paragraph one, as phosphorescent points in the doodle, as glowing points on the doodle during the inversion, and as physical seedlings at closure. However, the concept never shapes a choice or tactic—Liora does not plant, nurture, or protect them under pressure; they simply appear and are gathered. Ornamental motif with thematic echo but no causal work: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" is applied to the rune, Liora's tattoos, and the glyph. The tattoos "flickered in response, confirming her eligibility," enabling entry but without cost or alternative. The trait is a gate-pass rather than a constraint that forces a tradeoff. Label-only enabler with no visible price: 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reenter" is promised in the final line ("When the next hour of inverted gravity arrived, she would be ready to reenter the grotto"), but the action does not occur on the page. The story's climax is her first entry and symbol-alignment; the reentry is future-only and therefore cannot drive a turn. Summary-only, resolves nothing it helped create: cap 3.0. Mild thematic setup lifts slightly to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Threshold effects" are mentioned when "a whisper of wind carried a faint hum, the sound of threshold effects activating," then enacted when "she stepped through the threshold effects, the world shifting as gravity turned upside down." The method appears in setup and climax (two gates), but the mechanics are not detailed—she simply steps through without cost or choice about how to cross. Functional presence across two beats, mild specificity: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is introduced early, described across multiple beats (mist, stone arches, floating columns, spiraled water), and houses the climax (symbol alignment and glyph manifestation). However, it does not constrain Liora's choices—she walks in, acts, and walks out without the environment altering her tactics or imposing a cost. The setting is atmospheric but does not pressure decisions. Present in all three gates with vivid detail but no causal constraint: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hour of inverted gravity is signaled early ("the hour of inverted gravity approached"), structures the middle (the inversion occurs and Liora aligns symbols during it), and wanes at closure ("When the hour waned and gravity prepared to restore"). However, the clock is not tracked—no moment shows her racing against it or making a choice because time is running out. The timeframe is a scheduled event rather than a pressure that narrows options. Present in all three gates, mild time awareness, no tactical constraint: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to find where forgotten combinations hide, and to bind them to the library's living archive" is stated early and drives her journey to the grotto. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—no moment shows her weighing the cost of the quest or choosing between the combinations and another want. The motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized under friction. Setup and development present, no felt trade-off: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears as "a latent blaze stir within her" (paragraph five), "the latent blaze rise" (paragraph fifteen), "the latent blaze now a steady furnace within" (paragraph twenty-two), and "the latent blaze now an open flame that would never die" (final paragraph). The tone is consistent but static—the blaze increases in intensity without modulating with turns or complications. It reads as a metaphor for determination rather than a tonal shift that charges the ending. Label-only progression without pressure modulation: 3.4.</comment>
