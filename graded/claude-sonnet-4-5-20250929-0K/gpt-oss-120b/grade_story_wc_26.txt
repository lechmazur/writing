<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains essentially passive—watching, sensing, and whispering—without genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His transformation from observer to actor happens through decorative gestures (lifting a stone, whispering to it) rather than a choice that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("luminous regret," "gentle certainty") and therapy-adjacent diction ("metamorphose his perception") that never ground in specific, character-particular sensation. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values; the stone warms conveniently, validating him without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: "blooming library above clouds" and "after dreams become shareable" provide conceptual flavor but defer spatial and temporal grounding past 120 words (−0.4). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through patterned imagery, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the protagonist faces no narrowed options or raised cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the stone "now humming with the captured shadows"), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the footage brightens "as if remembering a promise" without on-page consequence or forfeited path. The lens remains legible, preventing a full collapse, but the closure unit lacks felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" offers vivid conceptual texture, and sensory details (marble floor, perfume of rain-kissed clouds, vaulted arches) are selective and purposeful. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a decorative backdrop. The river stone, handled twice, approaches micro-setting function but does not block or enable an action; the protagonist's movements (approaching the podium, lifting the stone) proceed without spatial friction. Anchors are present but do not charge the final image, capping the category below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A dominant stake—preserving hope for future wanderers—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The protagonist encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no visible price; the stone warms obligingly, the footage brightens, and his "mission" concludes without escalation. The "shadow unbound" remains abstract, never narrowing options or forcing a tactical shift under the Accumulative lens. Agency is absent: the universe places fragments "with gentle intention," and the protagonist's only act is passive observation followed by convenient validation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of fleeting moments, hope as legacy—emerges through recurring images (the stone, the shadow, the child's kite) but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or earned insight. "Luminous regret melt[s] into gratitude" is an explicit emotional summary that replaces scene pressure with label-speak. The final paragraph moralizes ("every shadow eventually seeks light") and delivers thematic echo in prompt-like language ("after dreams become shareable for generations"). No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending states rather than dramatizes meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice is generic and ornamental—"soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds," "symphony of remembrance"—without character-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance floats: the narrator claims omniscient certainty ("the universe had placed each fragment") beyond what the protagonist can plausibly know. Diction drifts into elevated register ("metamorphose," "luminous regret") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; interior texture is abstract and interchangeable, lacking the specificity needed to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "soft footfall…softly deliberate," "blooming library" recurs without new pressure, "shadow unbound" cycles four times without added meaning. Template cadence appears in stacked "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors clutter peak beats: "watercolor skies," "ribs of a great wing," "beacon for all who would seek hope." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "sensed," "understood") dull immediacy in the second half. Figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff lowers clarity and momentum (−1.0). The final third carries multiple artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise—ethereal library, dream-sharing future, magical preservation stone—follows a template mystical-quest structure without fresh inflection. The "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" role is label-only; his task proceeds without friction, obstacle, or surprise. Turns feel obligatory rather than inevitable: the stone warms because the plot requires it, not because prior causality compels it. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into abstract poeticism and avoids concrete choice. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—mission complete, hope preserved—without transformation or earned complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout but purely observational. His choices (lifting the stone, whispering, recording) do not create turns or alter tactics; events unfold around him without his agency driving causality. Observation without decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone is handled in three beats: initial description, lifted and placed beside the screen, returned to the pedestal. It warms and "hums with captured shadows" at the end, reweighting its symbolic function. However, its properties do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it serves as a passive vessel rather than an active element. Lyric reprise (first third → final image) with thematic reweighting but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shadow unbound" appears as a metaphor (the phantom in footage, the child's kite, the hope preserved) but never shapes on-page stakes or alters tactics. It echoes thematically without changing options. Theme claim without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is used twice as a label (the revelation, his footfalls) but does not constrain or enable an action with cost. No visible tradeoff tied to this attribute; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is named once ("he must metamorphose his perception") and restated near the end ("metamorphose was not merely a change of form but a rebirth of meaning"), but the action itself is not dramatized. No turn traces to this action; easily swappable with "shift" or "transform."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent video footage from decades apart—is explicitly stated midway and used in one beat (the child reaching for a kite, echoed thirty years later). It enables the protagonist's realization but does not shape earlier attempts or face obstacles. Present in development and closure, but mechanics remain thin; no tactical friction or iterative use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" provides vivid backdrop (velvet cushion, vaulted arches, stained glass, marble floor) but never constrains choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description without tactical pressure; setting does not alter the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"After dreams become shareable" appears in the first sentence and twice more as a descriptor of the archive and future reach, but the timeframe imposes no urgency or deadline. Vague temporal setting without a live clock; does not tighten decisions or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated early and restated multiple times, framing the protagonist's goal. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost—he succeeds without friction. Told-only desire without on-page tradeoff between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named explicitly and paired with gratitude in the denouement. The tone registers as wistful throughout but does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—no tonal shift at turns, and the final image ("every shadow eventually seeks light") resolves into affirmation without sustaining the regret. Single static mood with minor modulation; does not charge the final image under tension.</comment>
