<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation—"to capture the sound of trust breaking"—reads as abstract poeticism rather than a concrete goal that drives visible choices under pressure. Her physical actions (decoy vial, rope trick) are legible, but interior contradiction is absent; she moves through the scene with uniform resolve despite the "comforting unease" label. The watch fob appears repeatedly but remains inert—warm, cold, ticking—without altering her stance or forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied emotion is thin: "comforting unease" is asserted, not shown through contradictory impulses or degraded perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Lila is, what the truce entails, and why lanterns matter emerge piecemeal across the first third, forcing re-reads. The plot moves through because/therefore linkage (decoy → confusion → lantern theft → darkness), but the closure—placing the watch fob and whispering a hope—offers no decisive change or visible cost; the truce was always time-limited, and her success changes no options on the page. The final image recurs to the watch fob without reweighting prior stakes or forecloses a path. Closure reads as arrival rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly sketched—salt, ferment, driftwood stalls, aromatic vapor—and the spatial choreography (central tent, lantern storage, pier exit) remains coherent. The antique watch fob's temperature shifts (warm, cold, warm again) anchor sensory detail in the present. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure; Lila's final walk toward the horizon ignores the market's spatial logic, and the "until sunrise" clock, though mentioned, does not tighten her moves. The watch fob charges the final image modestly, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thwart the rival crew's lantern theft and preserve the truce—is signaled early and pursued through one meaningful tightening (the barrel decoy and rope maneuver). Yet the escalation is brief: the scout lunges, Lila sidesteps, darkness ensues, and the elders validate her report without friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the truce holds "until sunrise" by design, not Lila's agency. The "comforting unease" recurs as a label rather than deepening pressure, and the ending offers reflection without visible cost or consequence that alters future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A theme of fragile trust and cyclical conflict emerges through "truce of hush," "false starts," and "comforting unease," but the final whisper—"May this hush stay firm, and may the sound of trust never shatter again"—edges toward overt statement rather than resonant image. The watch fob's return in the final paragraph reweights time and inheritance lightly, yet the ending pivots to Lila's steady heart and "fresh chances to thwart the darkness," a generic forward gesture that does not reframe prior particulars. The core concept integrates thematically but remains under-dramatized in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lila; psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature—salt, ferment, the watch fob's warmth—colors the narration. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("a metronome for the night to count down," "the comforting unease of waves lapping") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The minimal dialogue (Lila's whispered plea) carries no subtext or goal beyond thematic echo. Purposeful repetition of "truce of hush," "false starts," and "comforting unease" creates pattern, but the voice does not modulate sharply under peak stress (the scout's lunge).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but overwriting clusters in several beats: "the comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket," "a pulse echoing the fading night," and "the truce of hush would still hold only until sunrise" recur with synonym churn and template cadence ("the truce of hush" appears four times). The watch fob's state is paraphrased across adjacent lines—"warm," "cold," "warm against her chest"—without added pressure. Figurative density is high in the final third ("metronome," "pulse," "blanket," "seed of future conflict") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5 for overwriting and −0.3 for loops, totaling −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The pirate-market-beneath-a-pier frame and moonshine-runner heritage offer surface novelty, but the plot—young operative thwarts rival theft to preserve fragile truce—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" are phrase-level inventions that do not reshape stakes. The "sound of trust breaking" motivation reads as poetic ornament rather than an earned dramatic anchor. The ending's "fresh chances to thwart the darkness" defaults to generic resilience without a turn that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout and executes the decoy/rope plan, but her key choices (slip vial, pull rope, place watch fob) are tactical rather than transformative; removing her specific backstory would not alter the theft-prevention logic. No live dilemma or visible cost charges her final walk.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in at least four beats (opening, pocket check, negotiating table, final walk) and its temperature shifts, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it is handled and described without altering Lila's options. The final placement atop the table as "a metronome for the night" offers modest symbolic reprise but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The truce of hush is explained early, motivates Lila's goal (no gunfire, preserve lanterns), and her success allows it to hold "until sunrise." It shapes stakes and tactics—decoy to avoid breaking the hush, darkness startles but does not shatter it—and is present in the ending negotiation and final reflection, meeting setup/development/payoff gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is asserted twice as a label ("Lila moved curiously steadfast," "she remained curiously steadfast") but does not constrain or enable a visible trade-off; her actions read as straightforward resolve without internal friction or cost tied to this specific attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the verb anchoring Lila's mission and the middle turn (barrel decoy, rope pull), and the elders acknowledge her "thwarting plan." It is signaled early and drives the central beat, but the action is easily swappable with "stop" or "disrupt" without structural loss; the specificity does not reshape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"False starts" is mentioned three times: Captain Marrow's habit, Lila's rehearsal, and her survival of "countless false starts" in the sidestep beat. It flavors tactics (decoy as misdirection) but the mechanics are not dramatized—Lila's plan succeeds on the first attempt on the page—so the method shapes background more than on-page attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The pirate market is established early with vivid sensory detail (salt, ferment, driftwood, canvas, rotting pier) and spatial anchors (stalls, central tent, lantern storage, pier exit). The setting pressures Lila's choices—she must navigate the crowd, the secret tunnels depend on the lanterns, the darkness alters tactics—and the market is present in the ending (elders, stirring for the next day). It meets all three gates and provides causal support across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is signaled early as the truce deadline and mentioned in four beats (opening, middle, elder scene, ending), but the clock does not tighten on-page decisions; Lila completes her task without time pressure, and the pale light arrives as ambient closure rather than a forcing constraint. The timeframe frames the story but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated as Lila's motivation and echoed in her final whisper, but it is never dramatized in a choice or friction—Lila does not confront a dilemma between preserving trust and another cost. The phrase reads as thematic decoration rather than a desire with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" appears four times as a label across opening, middle, and ending beats, creating pattern. The tone is asserted—waves, soft blanket, aromatic vapor—but does not modulate sharply under the scout's lunge or the final victory; it remains static rather than charging the closure image with earned ambiguity.</comment>
