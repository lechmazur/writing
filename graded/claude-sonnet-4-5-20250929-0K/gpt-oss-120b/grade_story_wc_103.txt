<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("retrocognitively trapped, recalling futures as if they were already past") is label-only; the story never dramatizes this attribute in a choice or perception that affects tactics. Her interior consists of abstract declarations ("She believed…," "Mara understood…") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment—thanking the garden—reads as a declarative epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The child appears briefly without applying pressure to Mara's stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are named early, penalty waived. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural by ~40% (pattern of dissolution, fragments, hyperbolic geometry). However, no on-page closure unit is legible: the maze is described as "complete" and Mara "watches" and "whispers" thanks, but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing occurs—the final state is presented as achieved via summary rather than a crystallizing image or choice that reweights prior material. The phrase "stood complete—a reverie that quaked" asserts completion without showing a before/after moment or felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The living bridge, hyperbolic corridors, and halo fragment are vividly described with sensory specificity (luminescence, mist, scent of rain-kissed earth). Spatial choreography is coherent across the maze's construction. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: no environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image—Mara moves through the space without obstacles, resource shortages, or forced adaptations. The "quaking reverie" remains atmospheric decoration rather than a pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("dissolve the boundaries between memory and moment") is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens: Mara consults the halo fragment, drafts corridors, arranges photographs, and watches the child—each beat adds description without narrowing options, raising cost, or forcing a trade-off. The child's pause and the garden's bloom are coincidental responses, not protagonist-driven turns. No on-page reversal or deepening changes Mara's knowledge or forecloses a path; the maze's completion is declared rather than earned through visible struggle or price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("texture of time," dissolution of static walls) is overtly stated multiple times ("She believed that only by disintegrate the static walls…," "Mara understood that the maze's purpose…") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The fading photographs and hyperbolic geometry are potential motifs, but their recurrence does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—they illustrate the declared theme without reweighting it at closure. The final image asserts thematic completion ("the maze stood complete—a reverie that quaked with the promise of endless discovery") as a thesis statement, not a resonant non-literal answer grounded in cost or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register incongruous with moment-to-moment perception ("mutable sanctuary," "quaking reverie," "trembling fabric that resonated with both loss and renewal"). Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Mara's way of noticing does not reveal distinct priorities or blind spots. Sentence rhythm is uniform, with many clauses opening "The [noun]" or "Mara [verb]," creating mechanical cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy loop and scaffold penalties accumulate: "She believed…only by disintegrate" (verb form error), "the texture of time" repeated three times, "fading photographs" four times in similar constructions, and paraphrase loops ("The garden itself seemed to quiver, a quaking reverie" immediately restates mood already established). Template cadence runs appear ("The fragment…allowed," "The garden's ambient mist carried," "The light refracted," "Each thread sang"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague ("sine wave…shifting in proportion to the observer's heartbeat," "vaporous threads that stitched the present to the past"). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure causal links, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of living architecture, non-Euclidean geometry, and temporal dissolution is conceptually ambitious and not a stock template. However, execution relies on familiar tropes (maze as metaphor, fragments of memory, wise artisan communing with nature) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "retrocognitively trapped" attribute and hyperbolic geometry are mentioned but do not generate fresh inflections in plot or character choice. The ending's "promise of endless discovery" reads as abstract aspiration rather than an earned, particular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara (hedge maze designer) is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a key turn. She consults, drafts, collects, arranges, watches, and whispers—actions that describe rather than decide. Her role could be swapped for "garden sculptor" or "architect" with minor edits. Introduced early (+0.3) but ornamental use and no causal pressure yield low score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in three beats: consultation for drafting, illumination when wanderer steps on bridge, and final hum at dusk. However, its mechanics are vague ("encode geometric truths"), and it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara uses it as a reference, not a tool with tradeoffs. Swappable with "ancient blueprint" or "mystical codex." Early signal (+0.3), multiple beats (+0.9), but no causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs are handled across multiple beats (Mara collects them, arranges them along the maze's spine, they disintegrate as the child watches, leaving "only the scent of their memory"). The concept shapes the maze's visual design and thematic intent. However, their dissolution does not alter Mara's options or impose a cost—they illustrate theme rather than constrain action. Early signal (+0.3), two beats (+0.9), lyric reprise at end (+0.4), but ornamental integration caps at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped, recalling futures as if they were already past" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph and never operationalized. No on-page perception, choice, or constraint demonstrates this attribute—Mara's thoughts and actions are entirely present-tense. Label-only mention without causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" appears as infinitive ("by disintegrate the static walls") and as finite verb ("the fading photographs began to disintegrate"). The photographs' disintegration is the story's most visible turn, enabling the child's pause and the garden's bloom. However, this action is passive environmental response rather than protagonist-driven decision. Present in setup and payoff but could be swapped for "dissolve" or "fade" with no structural change. Two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but swappability and lack of protagonist agency limit score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("corridors whose angles obeyed hyperbolic geometry") and returns at closure ("hyperbolic geometry of the maze ensured that the new arch curved back into the old"). However, its mechanics are abstract—"non-Euclidean dance that stretched space" does not show how it shapes Mara's drafting choices or maze function. Present in setup, middle description, and payoff, but ornamental; could be replaced with "fractal patterns" or "spiraling design" without altering plot. Early signal (+0.3), three mentions (+1.4 if beats were distinct, but these read as repeated description −0.3 ornamental), no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Living bridge garden is the story's spatial anchor and primary setting element, present from opening to close. The bridge senses the wanderer's weight and pulses luminescence, the maze breathes and blooms a new arch in response to the child. These actions are environment-driven responses that enable the story's thematic moves. Setup (+0.3), development (bridge pulses, maze blooms) (+0.9), closure participation (maze "stood complete" with inner light) (+0.7), causal enabler (+0.8). However, the garden does not constrain Mara's choices—she works within it without obstacles or resource limits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated twice ("She believed…," "Mara felt the texture of time under her fingertips") but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Mara's actions (consulting, drafting, arranging) are presented as smoothly aligned with this goal, with no friction between desire and obstacle. The motivation is told rather than tested. Present in setup and asserted at closure, but no on-page friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is explicitly named in the final sentence and implied throughout by descriptions of the garden quivering, vines humming, and luminescence pulsing. Tone is consistent—dreamlike, meditative, suffused with wonder—and modulates subtly as dusk settles. However, the tone does not respond to pressure (there is no crisis or escalation to test it) and the final invocation reads as label rather than earned atmosphere. Setup (implied by opening imagery) (+0.3), closure participation (final sentence) (+0.7), coherence across beats (+0.4), but static mood without pressure modulation limits score.</comment>
