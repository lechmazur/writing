<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The translator exists as a label rather than a character making choices under pressure. Interiority is abstract and consistently elevated ("I work as a between‑worlds translator, a conduit") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The supposed "task" to honor the lighthouse memory unfolds through passive observation and metaphysical gestures rather than difficult trade-offs. The final "promise to the unseen sailors" arrives as unearned sentiment disconnected from any on-page cost or character-specific vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains unclear past 120 words: who is speaking, where exactly they stand, and what concrete stakes exist stay vague. The drive lens is ambiguous—passages read lyric-accumulative but no pattern is taught, and no decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost occurs on the page. The "translation loop" closing and the fragment dissolving are asserted metaphysically without dramatized causality or felt consequence. The ending offers thematic echo ("stories will never dim") but no visible before/after that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market "strung high above city rooftops" is vivid in initial description, and the paintings-as-maps detail is specific. However, spatial choreography dissolves into abstraction: the narrator "studies," "traces," and "aligns" without clear physical grounding or tactical constraint. The fragment and chain are handled metaphorically rather than as objects that pressure choice. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the lighthouse memory—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The protagonist encounters no resistance, makes no difficult choice, and pays no visible price. The "patterns converge" and the chain "unfastens itself" through coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The ending dissolves stakes into sentimental promise without foreclosing a path or altering tactics. One brief tightening (studying paintings to align them) is present but does not escalate or deepen with trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The lighthouse fragment recurs but shifts meaning only through assertion ("its essence now a shared memory") without dramatic cost. The final paragraph delivers direct thematic summary ("your stories will never dim") that replaces scene pressure with platitude. No resonant non-literal answer to a central question is earned; the piece substitutes lyric decoration for thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains an elevated, incantatory register throughout ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition settle like stars") that reads consistent but lacks modulation under pressure. Diction remains uniform—"between‑worlds translator," "eternal instant," "timeless instant"—with no perceptual signature tied to the narrator's supposed profession or history. The prose texture is recognizable but does not degrade or sharpen in response to tension. Filter verbs ("I realize," "I remember") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "I work as a between‑worlds translator, a conduit who deciphers" restates its own function; "eternal instant captured" and "timeless instant I have created" recycle the same metaphor without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("rise like incense," "settle like stars," "glitter like a constellation") appear in most beats without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("elusively tangible balance of what is seen and unseen") disconnected from embodied action. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("your stories will never dim"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—translator deciphering painted clues to unlock a lighthouse memory—is recognizable from fantasy-quest templates and executed without transformation. The "between‑worlds translator" role, paintings-as-maps device, and mystical object (lens fragment) follow familiar genre conventions without fresh synthesis. Emotional beats (childhood memory, parent's tale, whispered promise) are generic and could transfer to any artifact-quest with minor edits. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece chooses median lyric-fantasy diction and avoids specific lived detail that would anchor its universals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout as a role label but makes no causal choice that alters tactics or outcome. The translator observes, studies, and "closes the translation loop" through passive alignment rather than decision under pressure. Late first-person claim ("I, a between‑worlds translator, am forever the bridge") is summary rather than dramatized agency. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation) applies; ornamental use −0.5 brings the score to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Appears in opening ("a single lighthouse lens fragment I have carried"), middle (aligned with paintings), and ending (dissolves into the market's night). However, its mechanics are metaphorical—"slides into the void" without physical consequence or tactical constraint. The fragment is handled abstractly rather than used in distinct beats with evolving function. Cap 4.6 (missing middle development as causal pressure) applies; ornamental final mention −0.5 brings the score to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The phrase "anchors of intuition" recurs as thematic label ("I must locate the anchors of intuition hidden among the painted stalls," "intuition is anchored not in certainty") but never constrains an on-page choice or alters tactics. It functions as poetic gloss rather than a mechanic that shapes the protagonist's method. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation) applies; label-only trait −0.3 and theme-only echo (no stakes shift) bring the score to 2.6 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" describes the fragment's feel ("its glass cold yet humming") but does not enable or constrain action with cost. The attribute is aesthetic rather than functional; no on-page beat turns on this quality. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation); label-only trait −0.3 and ornamental use −0.3 bring the score to 2.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice: "unfastening the sealed memory" (task declaration) and "the chain begins to unfasten itself from the ancient pedestal" (passive event). The action is abstract and self-executing rather than a protagonist-driven turn. Cap 4.6 (introduced after setup but weak middle development); swappability (could be "unlock" or "open") −0.5 and summary-only use −0.3 bring the score to 3.8, rounded to 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("hidden details in the paintings") and demonstrated in one middle beat ("I study the hidden details… tracing the curve of the gull's wing to the angle of the lantern's flame"). However, the method's mechanics are asserted rather than tested; alignment happens without complication or visible cost. Cap 4.6 (weak middle development); ornamental closure (paintings not active in final image) −0.8 and swappability −0.4 bring the score to 3.2 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("alchemist's market strung high above city rooftops"), provides initial atmosphere and spatial frame, and recurs at closure ("the market's night," "the market's wind"). However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Two-gate lyric reprise (first third → final image) allows eligibility to ~6.3; ornamental use −1.0 and postcard description (vivid but not causal) −0.5 bring the score to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The phrase "between my childhood and now" anchors the narrator's life span but does not create urgency or tighten decisions. Childhood memories recur but function as thematic reflection rather than a live clock. Time is vague and untracked; no temporal pressure alters tactics. Cap 3.4 (missing middle development as pressure); vague time −0.5 brings the score to 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Stated as task ("to honor overlooked histories") in the opening and echoed in the ending promise ("your stories will never dim"). However, the desire faces no friction or trade-off; the protagonist pursues it without competing want or cost. Cap 4.6 (introduced early, weak middle, present at closure as assertion); told-only motivation (no on-page choice testing the desire) −0.8 and no friction −0.3 bring the score to 3.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" recurs as motif ("like an eternal instant captured in a drop of light," "the timeless instant I have created") and establishes a lyric, elevated tone consistent through the piece. Tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new urgency; it remains static. Two-gate lyric reprise allows ~6.3 eligibility; static mood (no cadence shift under pressure) −1.5 and synonym churn ("eternal" / "timeless") −0.5 bring the score to 4.3.</comment>
